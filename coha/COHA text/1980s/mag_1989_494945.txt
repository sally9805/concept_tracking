' d been primed to expect a lot of things in Mana ? gua ? revolutionary fervor , totalitarian sullenness , grotesque poverty . churchy North American " san ? dalistas " ? and , sure enough , a bit of each was on view during the days I spent there . But no one had told me about the weird beauty of the place . Managua was flattened by an earthquake in 1972 and never rebuilt . Somoza stole the relief money that poured in after the quake , and the Sandinistas had other priorities . So nature took its course . As a conse ? quence , downtown Managua is more rural than urban . A few shells of old buildings remain , now weathered into mossy ruins in a haunting tableau softened by lush vegetation . The main square now commands a pan ? oramic view of Lake Managua . A herd of oxen wanders in a nearby meadow . The walls of the old cathedral still soar , but the roof is long gone . Inside , you look up and stone angels blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and the weeds that carpet the floor are waist-high . In this neighborhood there is very little motorized traffic . The smell of exhaust . which in many Third World cities is so strong you can taste it on your tongue , is entirely absent . Instead the air has a faint aroma of charcoal . At the Eastern Market , a mile away , crowds trudge through a muddy warren of ramshackle stalls offering faded plastic trinkets , loose cigarettes . expired pharmaceuticals . In an alley of food stands , chill-eyed children wave clouds of flies from chunks of fatty organ meat . Here the poverty is palpable . But the quiet , green center of town is a romantic ruin , more like ninth-century Rome than the modern focus of the wan ? ing cold war . . Along with my North American traveling compan- nms ? journalists from the 1.03 Angeles Times , the Nation , the Ailanitc , and ranav Fair ? I spent most of my time in Nicaragua 's magic-realist capital talking with Sandinista spokesmen , their political opponents , and representa ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , who are responsible for observing the I ? ebruary 25 general election . Voters are to choose not Only a president and vice president but also a new National Assembly and hundreds of local officials . De ? spite everything ? which is to say despite the sputtering contra war , despite the government 's suspension of the cease-fire , despite the horrors in neighboring El Salva dor , and despite the fabled hostility of anti-Yankee revolutionaries to bourgeois democratic institutions ? the election will probably come off as scheduled . If it does , it will be the freest , fairest election ever held in Central America outside Costa Rica . The reason is all those international observers . They are uniformly independent , well informed , and well organized . and to all appearances they are com ? petent . The U.N . will have 150 observers running around the country during election week , the OAS will have 300 , and free-lance non-governmental groups like the one organized by former President Carter ? who was invited by both the Sandinistas and the opposition ? will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this horde has been in place for three months , monitoring the registration process ( which was unanimously pronounced fair ) and the campaign itself . Nicaragua has 4.394 polling places , and the observ ? ers obviously wo n't be able to watch the voting and counting at them all . Their plan . as Iqbal Riza , a suave Pakistani diplomat who heads the U.N . contin ? gent . explained it to us , is to visit all or nearly all the rest after the polls close . At each polling place , the votes will be counted by the president of the local elec ? tion pinta in the presence of a poll-watcher from the Sandinista party and one from the United National Opposition ( UNO ) , the 14-party alliance whose presi ? dential candidate is Violeta Chamorro . The U.N . or OAS observer will make sure all three agree on the totals , and if they tally the assumption will be that the count was fair . This system should be foolproof ? assuming , of course , that UNO manages to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling place . " That 's one of the points we 've been stressing to the opposition , " Riza said . " They have a major responsibil ? ity . They have to be there . " After some earls doubts , it now appears certain that UNO will he able to recruit ( or hire ) enough volunteers to ensure a fair count . The international kibitzing is unprecedented in both scope and duration . " We have observed many elec ? tions , but we have never before observed a proess , " Mario Gonzalez , the Colombian chief of the OAS team , told us . " In Chile and elsewhere , our observers were in the country for a week at most . This time we will be around for more than six months . We 've had 18 OAS observers here since August 4 , living in all nine regions of the country . We 'll be able to render judgments not only on the registration and the voting , but also on things like access to the media . " If the margin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election will be very hard to steal . But if it 's very close , the Sandinistas will in theory be presented with a powerful temptation to jiggle the figures a bit and pre-emptively announce a victory . The antidote to this danger would be a " rapid count , " an effort to sample the returns independently of the offi ? cial national counting center and with comparable speed . A " rapid count " dissuaded the Chilean authori ? ties from falsifying the results of last September 's refer ? endum on keeping Pinochet in power , and another exposed the crude fraud in Panama last May . Such an effort will likely be undertaken in Nicaragua . The Car ? ter group is consulting with the OAS and the U.N . about mounting one . And the election could well be close . The three high Sandinista officials we met with ? Vice President Sergio Ramirez , Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco , and Foreign Ministry Secretary General Ale ? jandro Bendafia ? all predicted that President Daniel Ortega and Ramirez would win with at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well organized and well disciplined , and in a country where the po ? lice , the army , and the education system are run as branches of the ruling party , incumbency offers more than the usual advantages . Opinion surveys , however , show a dead heat . The most reliable one , taken a month ago by the Washington political consultant Sergio Bendixen for Univision , the U.S.-based His ? panic TV network , shows 40 percent for Ortega , 39 for Chamorro , five percent for one of the seven other parties on the ballot , and 16 percent " undecid ? ed . " ( North American political obsessives will remem ? ber Bendixen as a strategist for Alan Cranston in 1984 and Bruce Babbitt in 1988 . ) No one thinks all the " undecideds " are really unde ? cided . Bendafia insists that " people do n't like to be asked . They 've been told that their vote is secret , and they 're not going to tell any pollster . " But if he 's wrong , and if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugged Nicaraguan individualism than by fear that the authorities might somehow find out and be displeased , then the poll numbers are bad news for his side . The campaign , which formally begins this week , will not be anything like as fair as the voting itself . The print press will not be a problem for UNO ? Chamorro , after all , is the publisher of La Prensa , the largest of Nicaragua 's three daily news ? papers ? but television will be . The parties get free time on the box , and the Supreme Electoral Council , Sandinista-controlled but remarkably well behaved , re ? cently ordered that these broadcasts be moved from Channel 2 , which yields a snowy picture in Managua and none at all in outlying areas , to Channel 6 , which comes in clearly throughout most of the country . But UNO has to rotate its slots with the minor parties that stand no chance of winning , and the Sandinistas con ? trol the news broadcasts . For UNO , however , this problem may not be a prob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various as India , Panama , and Poland demonstrates , opposition ? ists can win elections handily even if the government shuts them out of television entirely . In Nicaragua , everybody knows who 's running . Everybody knows the race is between the Sandinistas and UNO . If the elec ? tion becomes a referendum on the status quo , UNO will win easily , and the less people know about UNO ( be ? yond the already well-known fact that it represents change ) the better . The Sandinistas ' own campaign slogan , " Todo sera mejor " ( " Everything will be better " ) , reflects in its choice of tense a nervous recognition that the country is a mess . But if the election gets cast as a choice'between two prospective governments , the San ? dinistas could do better . UNO is a taped-together coali ? tion of parties and grouplets ranging from the Commu ? nist Party to . former Somocistas , with democrats of varying stripes in between . This does not make for a " clear message . " Chamorro launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joaquin , who has been dead for ten years , had told her he endorses her candidacy , as had God ? which in most countries would have been a fatal gaffe . This sort of thing goes down better in Nicaragua , where there 's a good deal of primitive religiosity , but not much better . If there 's a televised debate ? still an outside possibili ? ty ? Daniel is likely to come across as competent if hu ? morless , Violeta as a nice lady way out of her depth . The Sandinistas have national pride on their side . They have stood up to the colossus of the north . They whipped the contras . They carried out land reform , which even the opposition ad ? mits will be an enduring achievement of their rule . UNO , for its part , appeals simultaneously to high mo ? tives and low . The high motive is democracy . The low motive is money . The millions of dollars the U.S. Gov ? ernment is giving UNO is a campaign issue , but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sandinistas have received large amounts of Soviet logistical aid . Asked why his side had decided to accept the money , Alfredo Cesar , an important UN() spokes ? man , told us , " If we do n't take it , the Sandinistas will say we took it anyway " ? which , when you think about it , is a pretty lame argument . The money from Wash ? ington is important not so much for what it will buy in the way of buttons and bumper stickers as for the mes ? sage it sends about future largess from up north . If UNO can pry loose $9 million when it 's sti in opposi ? tion , many voters are bound to reason , drink how the Yankee cash will flow if UNO wins ! The most interesting question will arise after the voting and the counting are done . If UNO wins , will the Sandinistas accept it ? The Sandinista officials I spoke with all said they would go peacefully if they lost . " If we lose we 'll be ? come an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a strong opposition party , " Tinoco told me toward the end of a long evening of conversation . " To be perfectly honest , I would n't want to be the party in power and have to deal with an opposition party like the Sandinista Front . I would n't wish that on anybody . " The next morning , over breakfast at the incongru ? ously Swedish Modern convention complex called the Olof Palme Center , I asked Vice President Ramirez how he could square the possibility of electoral defeat with such tenets of Marxism-Leninism as " democratic cen ? tralism " and the leading role of the party . " The truth is we 've never described ourselves as a Marxist-Leninist party , " he replied . " Yes , some of our perspectives reflect Marxist insights . But the great dif ? ICrence between us and traditional orthodoxy is that we 've never talked about a single party without opposi ? tion or a command economy without private property . We are not carrying out measures to let people enter or leave the country freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Socialist Republic of Nicaragua ' from our constitution because we never put it in . We are not changing from a single-party system because we never had one . If ' somebody has something to learn here , it 's not us . It 's those countries in Eastern Europe . " All very stirring . Yet there is reason for doubt . In Eastern Europe , Communist regimes now abdi ? cate power on an almost daily basis , but the Communists of Eastern Europe are quislings in a state of moral collapse . The Sandinistas are genuine revolutionaries who won power on their own , and who brought with them a vision of the revolutionary state as an instrument of utopian transformation . That vision ill comports with the humdrum notion of parties alternat ? ing in power through regular elections until the end of time , especially when the other party represents the class enemy . And when the Sandinistas boast about the cleanliness of the current electoral process , they tend to do so in a way that suggests they regard the election as a Concession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal opposition . In a real democracy , of course , elections are not concessions . They are the basis of legitimacy . In the wake of the carnage in El Salvador , Nicaragua 's political atmosphere has darkened . The Central Ameri ? can " peace process " is in deep trouble . As the crash of I he plane carrying surface-to-air missiles establishes , the Sandinistas have been supplying arms to the Salva ? doran rebels in violation of Ortega 's explicit promises to i he other Central American presidents not to do so . The Sandinistas , it would seem , are perfectly capable of Playing for keeps . If they become convinced they are going to lose the election , it is far from unimaginable that they could find a pretext to cancel it . Washington has helpfully provided one such pretext by keeping the contras , who by regional agreement were supposed tohave been demobilized by now , in business . And then there is the awkward matter of the military . Even if the election takes place and the Sandinistas lose , they will retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . UNO recognizes this and is prepared to live with it . One possibility , especially if the UNO victory is narrow , is a " national unity " government in which the Sandinistas hold on to the Defense Ministry . Another possibility , familiar in this part of the world , is a civilian government headed by one party in which the army is under the de facto control of a different political ten ? dency , one with a less than perfect record of respect for democracy . Nicaragua could become a sort of El Salva ? dor in reverse ? minus ( and this is a big minus ) " death squad activity . " And what if the Sandinistas win ? Will the United States accept it ? So far there is no sign Washington has made up its mind . Governments , like individuals , prefer to avoid thinking about an outcome they dread . When the economist Richard Parker . who organized our trip to Nicaragua , asked UNO 's Alfredo Cesar if LINO favors lifting the U.S. trade embargo if the Sandi ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . Yes . Without any doubt . " The Bush Administration has not yet given a clear answer to that question . One thing , though , is clear : the U.S. policy of thwarting contra demobilization makes it considerably likelier that the question will have to be faced . President Bush ought to ponder some figures from the Bendixen-Univision poll . Nicaraguans , the poll shows , view the contras unfavorably by an overwhelming 65 percent to 20 percent margin . Only 29 percent think they 're " freedom fighters , " while 44 percent see them as " tools of imperialism . " Asked whose pressure made the election possible , 53 percent say it was the Central American presidents , while only 14 percent say it was the contras . Fifty-nine percent say the United States is Nicaragua 's enemy , considerably more than any other country . On the other hand , 55 percent blame the Sandinistas fully or partly for Nicaragua 's economic crisis , and a full 61 percent say life was better under Somoza than it is now . Only 24 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Bush is seri ? ous about helping UNO the best thing he could do would he to eliminate the contras as an issue and allow Nicaraguans to focus their full attention on the dismal state of the economy . I left Managua with rather more respect for the intel ? ligence and suppleness of the Sandinistas than I had brought with me . Even so , as a North American I hope for a UNO victory . Nicaragua was never a threat to our security , but for ten years it has been a threat to our sanity . If LINO squeaks by , perhaps the United States ' Nicaragua neurosis will at last be cured . It will take a lot more than a new government , howev ? er , to cure what ails Nicaragua . Decades of dictatorship and another of war and revolutionary rapture have left the country with a devastated economy and a wounded political culture . No matter who wins , the weeds will grow waist-high for a long time to come . ?           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
