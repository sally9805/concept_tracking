back was Cratchit 's refusal to work on Christmas Day , even though Scrooge was swamped by the end-of-the-year inven  --  tory . I should think that it would have been the essence of the Christmas spirit for him to help poor Scrooge keep his costs down . But no . Cratchit said he 'd promised Tiny Tim he 'd be home for Christmas dinner , and if he did n't come the boy 's heart would be broken . Now , Scrooge had seen this Tiny Tim , and he suspected he was faking a gimpy leg so he could collect disability payments , or whatever they 4 called it in those days . Like father , like son . Cratchit was what was known as an " almshouse chiseler , " which means he was always getting money from poorhouses under the system of socialism that was prevalent in England before Mrs. Thatcher turned the country around . At any rate , when Cratchit refused to work on Christmas Day , Scrooge just blew his top and fired him . Well , Cratchit stormed out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the almshouse , he went to a pub and had some drinks with an out-of-work actor he knew . This fellow used to play ghosts in Shakespearean plays until he was kicked out of the Stage Actors Guild for un-British activities . The two of them hatched a plot whereby the actor would dress up like a ghost , sneak into Scrooge 's room at midnight and frighten the old man out of his wits . I 'm afraid this bit of blackmail worked all too well , be  --  cause poor Scrooge had a cardiac condition and was under doctor 's orders not to get excited . The ghost told him in a deep , scary voice to bring a turkey and two bottles of gin to the Cratchit place on Christmas Day or someone would tell the police that he 'd been dumping blacking into the Thames and polluting the royal swans . So the next morning he sent the Cratchits a basketful of food , and they all got high on plum pudding . Cratchit was so elated by his success that he persuaded his co-workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move his blacking business to India , where the work ethic was still strong . So that 's my story , children . Happy holidays to you all , and by golly , even if it is illegal to teach young people about the Man Upstairs , I 'm going to say it : God bless us , every one ! RICHARD LINGEMAN MINORITY REPORT . Meese ( Continued From Front Cover ) confront three serious contradictions in the bluff testimony Meese gave before the committee last March . These were not recognized at the time . Nor were they emphasized suffi  --  sufficiently in the report of independent counsel Jacob A. Stein see " Minority Report , " October 6 . They are : ? The Barrack Factor . On March 5 , 1984 , Thomas Bar  --  rack , a real estate developer , told the Senate Judiciary Com  --  mittee that although he had helped sell Meese 's house in La Mesa , California ( putting $83,000 of his own money into the deal ) , and had later secured a government post , he " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two events . In a testimony richly larded with " I can not recall " and " at that point in time , " this assertion was one of the few that Barrack made unambiguously . He added , " Did Mr. Meese ever talk to me about a job ? Absolutely not . " Buried in the turgid and evasive text of the Stein report is clear proof that Barrack met at least three times with Meese between the house sale and his appointment as Deputy ... kUnder Secretary of the Interior . He met Meese in Washing  --  ton on September 8 , 1982 , one week after the sale . Stein records a letter concerning that meeting , in which Barrack thanks Meese for his " counsel and encouragement . " Bar  --  rack maintains that this refers to a discussion about the pos  --  sibility of his moving to New York , a city about which Meese knows nothing . He justifies the remark by " reference to a discussion with Mr. Meese of the problems involved in moving a family from the West Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the move was not a difficult one . " Barrack was never asked why he would discuss his moving plans with Meese , or what he proposed to do on the East Coast . Meese , says the Stein report , " had no recollection of Mr. Barrack 's September 8 visit to his office until he found and reviewed the letter in his files . " One month later , on November 9 , Barrack dined with Meese and his wife at the 1789 Restaurant in Georgetown . That very afternoon , he had met with Transportation Secre  --  tary Drew Lewis and Housing and Urban Development Sec  --  retary Samuel Pierce . Next day , he was due to see Interior Secretary James Watt and Energy Secretary Donald Hodel . This blissful round was to culminate on November 11 with an appointment with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Bal  --  drige . Two weeks previously , E. Pendleton James , former director of personnel at the White House and another prin  --  cipal in the La Mesa house sale , had written to each of the above , urging that Barrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention that Ed Meese knows Tom and I 'm sure also would endorse my strong support . " Barrack and the Meeses maintain that they endured a din  --  ner between these two hectic rounds of meetings without ever alluding to the vulgar subject of a job for " Tom . " They supposedly preserved the same reticence over Thanks  --  giving , which the Meeses passed agreeably enough at the Barrack ranch in Santa Barbara . As the Stein report non  --  committally puts it : Mr. Barrack had by this time accepted the position of Deputy Undersecretary of Interior and was planning to begin his work in Washington on December 1 , about one week later . He stated that he instructed his staff at the ranch not to men  --  tion this fact in the Meeses ' presence . He told the help but not Meese ? Why would the help bring the question up ? On December 2 , 1982 , the day after he as  --  sumed his duties at Interior , Barrack went to Meese 's birth  --  day party at Meese 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention his own good fortune to the President 's chief counsel , a man keenly interested in appointments . In light of all this , Meese 's earlier sworn testimony to the Judiciary Committee , and Barrack 's too , seem to hover just on the safe side of perjury . But on one point , Meese can be said to have told the plain truth . The move from the West Coast to the East is , if you approach it in the right style , " not a difficult one . " This brings us to .. . ? The Transition Trust . On March 1 , 1983 , Meese replied to Judiciary Committee chair Strom Thurmond 's indulgent question about the sacrifices he had made to serve his Presi  --  dent by mentioning " the unanticipated expense of moving to Washington , D.C. , none of which was reimbursed by the government . " The next day , under equally soft questioning from Senator Orrin Hatch , Meese phrased the matter in a similar but not identical way : HATCH : And in addition to that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your moving expenses as well ? MEESE : That is right . HATCH : And all of the costs of bringing your family back here as well ? MEESE : Yes , Senator . HATCH : And that all came out of your own pocket ? MEESE : Yes , sir . Facts can be dreary as hell , but as the Stein report shows , Meese received $10,000 for " moving expenses " from the Presidential Transition Trust . On Trust check number 1069 , made out to Edwin Meese , the words " moving expenses " are crossed out and the words " consulting fees " inked in . It 's not even clear whether Meese declared this income or had another of his nagging bouts of amnesia . Again , this nifty little adjustment was unknown to the Judiciary Committee at the time of its hearings . So was the inelegant little shuffle that I 'll call .. . ? The Promotion . Did Meese pull strings to gain promo  --  tion to full colonel in the Army Reserve in 1983 ? Like the staunch soldier that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid rise through the ranks . At his confirmation hearings he boldly claimed that he was " a victim of the Army 's bad judgment . " In fact , the promotion presents an  --  other example of his failure to distinguish between public and private interest . And it underlines , once more , his lack of veracity on the stand . On November 1 , 1982 , the Army 's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel , Lieut . Gen. Max Thurman , wrote a memo  --  randum to the Chief of Staff , Gen. Edward C. Meyer . The memo stated that " constructive credit " for a course in na  --  tional security management qualifying Meese for promotion to colonel could be granted only at the request of Meese or his commanding officer ( Gen. Thomas Turnage , director of the Selective Service System ) . Such a request had to be ap  --  proved by Gen. William Berkman , chief of the Army Re  --  serve . General Thurman 's memo advised against such ap  --  proval , since Meese was taking the requisite course by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generals Tur  --  nage and Berkman overruled Thurman , effectively raising Meese to full colonel . Turnage is described in the Stein re  --  port as " an acquaintance and former associate of Mr. Meesefrom California , who had been designated ( though not yet confirmed ) as Director of the Selective Service System . " Stein points out too that very shortly after , General Berk  --  man was nominated for a second four-year term as chief of the Army Reserve . General Thurman 's memorandum recommending against Meese 's promotion was passed to Secretary of the Army John Marsh , who forwarded it to Meese . Meese says that he does n't recall seeing it , but Stein records statements by De  --  fense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and by Marsh in which they recall the memo and say that Meese urged them to reap  --  point General Berkman . Meese told the Judiciary Committee that he had no knowledge of any Army concern about his appointment re  --  ceiving special treatment . Either he is lying or Secretaries Marsh and Weinberger are . The contradictions in the three areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far . They should be . The matters are not trivial . But all one can find is com  --  plicity among the Republicans and resignation among the Democrats . The following Democrats sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee : Max Baucus , Joseph Biden , Robert Byrd , Dennis DeConcini , Howell Heflin , Edward Kennedy , Patrick Leahy and Howard Metzenbaum . I telephoned all their offices last week . Leahy 's staff told me that the Senator was too busy wondering whether he could " rank " on Intelligence or Agriculture and feared that a new controversy over Meese would be " seen as counter  --  productive . " Biden 's people assured me that " most senators were off campaigning " when the Stein report came out . Heflin 's office said : " It 's too early  --  the members have not focused . It 's the same nomination . " Still others refused to comment or spoke of the psychological effect of the Reagan victory or said " in terms of " or " with regards to " all the time . Kennedy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in his last statement on the matter he said , prematurely , that the Stein report had cleared Meese of any suspicion of impropriety and that such " questions " as re  --  mained were about civil and human rights . As we went to press , Common Cause issued an analysis of the Stein report which , though it did not correlate Stein 's evidence with the transcript of the committee hearings , found against Meese on ethical grounds . Media attention to this was slight . Only from Howard Metzenbaum 's office has there been any sign of an understanding that this is the next Attorney General we 're talking about . Now the Reaganites are going around Washington telling all who will listen that Metzen  --  baum made the HUAC enemies list back in 1954 . Meese will probably have " no recollection " of that little gambit either . One of three things could now happen . The President may , as he should , blushingly withdraw Meese from nomi  --  nation . The Judiciary Committee or the full Senate may vote him down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right questions the first time , the ten Republicans and eight Democrats on the committee may nod into office , as " the People 's Attorney " and the nation 's chief law officer , a man who has already shown that he can not recognize a con  --  flict of interest when it bites him in the leg .
