Clustered around Rond-Point Victoire , a crossroads deep in Kinshasa ' s Cite , where most people here live , are the music clubs that have given birth to Africa ' s most vibrant music . The greats , the up-and-comings and the hopefuls all play here. // These days the talk is of Emaneya Mubiala and his group , Victoria Eleison , who hit the stage of one of the nightclubs three nights a week . The next generation of Zairian music , they say , is happening at this club. // " I ' m modernizing Zairian music , " said Emanyea , as he is known across Zaire , leaning back into the deep cushions of a velveteen sofa in his house in the Cite . " I make it more appealing to the young by making the music progress a little bit , by adapting from American music a little . " <> <> Fortune Lies Elsewhere // Across Africa , from radios in dusty roadside tailor shops and the dashboards of ailing taxis , from cassette decks in beer bars and market stalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Tabu Ley , Franco and Papa Wemba often evoke a recognition akin to that of presidents. // Indeed , for the stars of Zairian music , fame begins at home , but fortune lies elsewhere in Africa and abroad . Tabu Ley , the grand old man of Zairian music , acknowledges that he has sold far more records in the Ivory Coast , a country with one-third of Zaire ' s population of 30 million people , than he has at home. // Emaneya has the local fame . What he wants now , he said , is to be known across Africa , in Europe and even in America . He also wants the fortune , he said. // Teaspoon-sized raindrops splattered down on the red-tile dance floor of the club where he plays shortly after midnight . Around the dance floor , sheltered from the rain , the white metal tables and chairs were mostly empty. // As the evening aged , couples and groups of young men began drifting in . On stage , four teen-agers , aspiring musicians , hacked away on guitars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge on the evening . The tangy scent of marijuana mingled with the heavy perfume of Skol beer. // Toward 2 o ' clock , the rain gave up . Thirty minutes later , the club now crowded and noisy , Emaneya , in voluminous high-waisted pants , his shirt flapping like a spinnaker , leaped onto the low stage with his band members . The guitar player worked on the vaguely rumba-like strains of " Afimiko , " Emaneya ' s current hit and new signature tune . Almost immediately the dance floor was jammed , with people mouthing the song ' s words as Emaneya bent into the microphone . <> <> Songs of Everyday Life // The song tells of a woman advising her daughter Afimiko - the name is that of Emaneya ' s daughter - to be faithful to her husband when she marries and to be true to her family . Like all Zairian songs , the words impart a distinct morality that singers say is rooted in their culture and life . " The songs come from everyday life , from the Bible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement , the structure of Emaneya ' s music that differentiate it from that of established Zairian musicians . They call it musique pour les jeunes. // " Since I was a little kid I ' ve been singing , " Emaneya said . " At the university I studied public administration . Music was just a sidekick then . " While he was at the University of Lubumbashi in southern Zaire , Papa Wemba , the leader of the popular Viva la Musica , asked Emaneya to join his group . Emaneya sang with Papa Wemba for several years before breaking away and forming Victoria Eleison in 1981. // On his own , Emaneya became enmeshed , as do all musicians in Zaire , in a patron-client system that combines to help and hamper young talent . In Emaneya ' s case , the owner of the club agreed to supply instruments and three spots a week at the club . He produces Victoria Eleison ' s records . At the same time , Emaneya believes , his patron keeps a tight rein on the group , fearing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means to make it on its own . <> <> Looking Beyond Local Level // " The guy helps with records and takes the profits , " Emaneya said . " He won ' t let us be popular on more than a local level . He won ' t put out more records . It ' s hard to get beyond the local level . I would have to go to Europe . I don ' t have any way of doing that now . It all comes back to the problem of who can help us along. " // Even so , Emaneya ' s success so far is supporting about 30 people , including band members and hangers-on . And though he worries about breaking onto the larger stage of Africa and Europe , Emaneya is setting trends in style and music in Zaire. // " We have to adapt ourselves , not just to Zaire , but to European and American audiences , but keeping our roots . The problem with older musicians is that they ' re stuck on rumba . Americans are not into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the drums and it ' s now disco a bit , but we ' ve kept the authentic Zairian style . Traditional music is music from our ancestors , from the village and we ' ve introduced some disco into it. " // To a Western ear , Emaneya ' s music still contains a heavy dose of rumba . But to Zairians , his songs have unexpected turns , surprises that generate an excitement that lures a younger audience. // Similarly , Emaneya ' s wide pants and flowing shirts are mimicked by his followers . When he began wearing a huge gold cross on a thick chain , large crosses began appearing around the necks of teen-agers all around Kinshasa . <> <> Music Unsettling to Some // To Zaire ' s big names in music , Victoria Eleison is a bit unsettling . " Victoria has good music , but there is a type of cacophony to it , " said Tabu Ley , the leader of the band Afrisa and the man who in a sense created modern Zairian music and brought it to international attention. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs together . Older people don ' t go to hear Victoria because they don ' t know what to expect . They know what to expect in my music . Victoria ' s music is more spontaneous , more unexpected and younger people don ' t mind that. // " We have to be careful to keep what ' s traditional about African music , " he continued . " I hope people don ' t go overboard in adopting Western music. " // Tabu Ley spread his big hands apart and smiled . " We ' re guarding tradition , moi et Franco , les grandes musiciens . " The next day , Tabu Ley began yet another tour of Africa. // At the club , Emaneya paused to speak to a visitor during a break in the music. // " It ' s easy to be a musician , " he said . " It ' s only hard to be a successful musician. " //
