Chicago 's mayoral race goes down to the wire , and the mire <P> There may be other issues in the Chicago election in addition to the fact that Democrat Harold Washington , 60 , an undistinguished Congressman with a disconcerting disregard for filing income tax returns happens to be black , and that Republican Bernard Epton , 61 , an equally undistinguished former state legislator happens to be white . But it was getting increasingly hard to find any . The racial partisanship that dragged the mayoral race to a new low last week removed any doubt that next Tuesday 's election was , alas , likely to turn out to be essentially a black-and-white matter . <P> It was mainly because he is black that Washington was able to win the Democratic nomination over Jane Byrne , the current mayor , and Richard Daley , son of the legendary mayor . They split the votes of the white population , while Washington took more than 80% of the city 's black vote , which makes up 41% of the electorate . And now it is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a Republican who otherwise could have counted on little more than the votes of his family and a few close friends . <P> Bigotry spewed into the open on Palm Sunday , when Washington , accompanied by former Vice President Walter Mondale , went to pray at St. Pascal Church at the invitation of the pastor . NIGGER DIE was freshly spray-painted on one door of the Roman Catholic church on the city 's lily-white northwest side . " Carpetbagger ! " an angry crowd of about 200 standing outside shouted at Mondale . A cordon of police was needed to protect the pair as they quickly departed . <P> Mondale , who had endorsed Daley in the primary , was part of a parade of national Democratic leaders who went to Chicago to appeal for party unity and cultivate black voters . Congressman Claude Pepper of Florida , the octogenarian hero of the elderly , also was booed by a white audience last week . Douglas Fraser , the president of the United Auto Workers , confronted the race issue headon . Said he : " This election would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Washington is black . " Ohio Senator John Glenn said the Chicago campaign showed that " we 're at the hardest part of the civil rights movement ... How do you change hearts and minds ? " One prominent personality the Washington campaign has been keeping out of the picture lately is the Rev. Jesse Jackson , aggressive leader of the civil rights group Operation Push . At Washington 's primary victory party , Jackson led a cry of " We want it all ! , " which Epton supporters are now using as an anti-Washington slogan .
