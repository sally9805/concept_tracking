DETROIT  --  General Motors Corp. announced a plan to realign operations that will change the way GM designs and makes cars in North America but that doesn ' t appear to be as sweeping as expected . The plan sets up two new groups to take over the functions currently performed by seven divisions . The new **25;27;TOOLONG group , as GM calls it , will design and make only large cars . The Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada group will specialize in small cars . The two groups will eventually absorb all the design and manufacturing activities of the current Fisher body and assembly divisions and the five car divisions , which will remain under the groups mainly as planning and marketing organizations . With the reorganization GM announced a major executive shuffle just below the top ranks , with eight managers taking on significant new responsibilities . In a surprise , GM named a man with a reputation as a small-car expert  --  Robert Stempel  --  currently head of the Chevrolet division  --  to run the group that will make large cars , and it named the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the small-car group . GM sources said the company hopes to encourage fresh ideas with the actions . In announcing the plan at a news conference , GM Chairman Roger Smith and GM President James McDonald threw cold water on two controversial possibilities that had figured heavily in the intense public speculation that preceded the plan ' s unveiling . The executives said the reorganization wouldn ' t necessarily lead to a major reduction in GM ' s white-collar work force . And they insisted it would still be possible , if market conditions warranted , for GM to sell a large Chevrolet or a small Buick by ordering such cars from the other GM group . But Thomas O ' Grady , an auto analyst at Chase Econometrics , said that he would expect " significant reduction of white-collar staff " in the long run . And GM ' s top executives themselves concede that the plan is likely to mean that there will likely be more " distinctions between the products sold by the five divisions . " Mr. Smith , in explaining the aims of the reorganization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics . " Designing and manufacturing them in separate divisions " will enable us to concentrate on them ( the differences ) better . " Some auto experts have criticized GM for making small cars that are essentially shrunken versions of its big cars and have attributed GM ' s lack of success in the small-car business to that . Mr. Smith said the reorganization would enable GM to respond faster to changes in the market . Under the new system , he said , the responsibility for designing and producing cars will fall on managers lower down in the company , and they will have total responsibility , " from bumper to bumper . " " There will be a big change in our systems , a big change in our management philosophy , " Mr. Smith said . The reorganization will " get decisions down to the guy who is closest to the marketplace . . . too many decisions have been coming up too high in the organization . " The GM executives left a number of questions unanswered . Although GM sources have suggested it could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Messrs . Smith and McDonald said they don ' t have a specific timetable . However , GM did appoint a new group vice president  --  Charles Katko  --  to head an existing group whose two units  --  Fisher Body and the assembly division  --  are scheduled under the reorganization for " ultimate integration " into the new groups . The president and chairman also said GM hasn ' t decided yet where to draw the line between small and big cars in dividing the work between the two new groups . And despite the company ' s insistence that divisions in the small-car group might still offer large cars and vice versa , Mr. McDonald indicated GM is continuing to study more " dualing " of dealerships . Under dualing , a dealer handles more than one GM car line ; a Chevrolet dealer might also sells Buicks , for example . Experts who had expected a more rigid division of products among the five divisions had expected GM to do more dualing as a way of giving all their dealers both big and small cars to sell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to play down the effect of the reorganization on those who might feel threatened by it . They said the plan won ' t have any adverse effect on GM suppliers or blue-collar workers . They stressed that dealers needn ' t fear its effects because decisions on models will be based on better readings of what car buyers want . Although analysts consider GM top-heavy with a white-collar staff close to 140 , 000 , Mr. Smith said , " We ' ve already done the paring of our white-collar workers . " Mr. McDonald added that " We didn ' t set out to say , ' How can we reduce our work force ? ' " But , he said , " If that ' s a byproduct , fine . " Mr. Smith said GM began studying the reorganization announced yesterday more than two years ago in response to the " crunch " in auto sales , but didn ' t decide to proceed in earnest with its plan until six or seven months into the study . He said that the company interviewed more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it asked them for ideas about how to improve not only the company ' s organization but its management philosophy and style as well .
