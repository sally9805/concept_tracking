Surgeons in the U.S. implant about 100,000 new pacemakers each year , at an average cost of $12,000 . Last week Cardiologist Allan Greenspan of Philadelphia 's Albert Einstein Medical Center charged that the implantations are often useless . In an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine , he concluded that more than half the pacemaker operations he studied were either unnecessary or of questionable need . Concluded Greenspan : " Not all physicians who prescribe pacemakers know as much about the subject as they should . " <P> First developed three decades ago , the small battery-operated devices transmit electrical impulses that correct both irregular and slow heartbeats . However , many abnormal rhythms do not warrant pacemakers ; some may be caused by medication or associated with circulatory problems . When Greenspan and his colleagues reviewed the 1983 medical charts for 382 Philadelphia-area pacemaker patients , they found that 20% of the implants were completely unnecessary and 36% were not adequately justified . The solution , he argues , includes better training for physicians and more diagnostic tests . <P> No one doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 may be buried with the deceased each year in the U.S. To avoid such waste , Implant Technologies Inc. of Bothell , Wash. , wants funeral directors to recover the devices so the firm can then sterilize and export them to the Third World for $600 to $800 apiece . " In the more than 6,000 cases of pacemaker reuse around the world , there has never been a single reported incident of malfunction attributable to reuse , " declares I.T.I. President John Elsholz . If a pacemaker works , he reasons , why abandon it ? The company has applied to the Food and Drug Administration for approval , and hopes to begin shipments by June .
