The current presidential campaign is widely considered the most dramatic and hotly contested here in nearly 50 years . If so , that is in large part because of Mr. Cardenas , candidate of the National Democratic Front , a coalition of 17 left-leaning political parties and civic organizations , in the July 6 vote. // Mr. Cardenas , 53 years old , is the son of Gen. Lazaro Cardenas , President of Mexico from 1934 to 1940 , military hero of the Mexican Revolution and perhaps the most revered political figure in modern Mexican history . But the younger Mr. Cardenas now finds himself in the position of running against the Institutional Revolutionary Party , the very party his father helped found. // It is an uphill struggle at best : the PRI , as the governing party is known , has never lost a presidential election since coming to power in 1929 , and is not likely to do so this year . But some polls here show Mr. Cardenas capturing as much as 30 percent of the vote , putting him just a few points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slightly ahead of Manuel Clouthier , standard-bearer of the right-of-center National Action Party . <> <> Betrayal Is Charged // Throughout his campaign , Mr. Cardenas , a civil engineer and popular former Governor of the state of Michoacan who was until last year himself a prominent member of the PRI , has charged that the party has betrayed its revolutionary roots and that he alone can bring about what he calls " a return to the original principles of the Mexican Revolution . " On the stump , he pledges a " radical reorientation of the national economy " that will " put an end to the misery and exploitation " he says have emerged as a result of six years of mismanagement and malfeasance under President Miguel de la Madrid. // " In terms of hunger , malnutrition , disease and illiteracy , we ' re not moving ahead , " Mr. Cardenas said in an interview as he barnstormed in Aguascalientes , a small farming state in central Mexico that is traditionally a PRI stronghold . " We ' ve actually gone backward in recent years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation ' s income and wealth if we are to emerge from this situation of backwardness and poverty. " // In addition , Mr. Cardenas has proposed that Mexico " take the money now destined for payment " of its $105 billion foreign debt and use it instead to " reactivate economic and social growth , which is indispensable for the recuperation of our country . " Oil exports , he added , should be " diminished and perhaps eliminated " because " our resources , which are limited and need more careful management , are now being used to pay for the debt. " // Many Mexicans are inclined to take Mr. Cardenas at his word because Lazaro Cardenas made similar promises of nationalist and populist policies - and fulfilled them . During his term of office , General Cardenas took the oil industry out of American and British hands , distributed parcels of land to hundreds of thousands of peasants and created a state-run industrial base that propelled Mexico into four decades of uninterrupted growth . <> <> ' The Name Counts ' // " The name counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been forced to run on a shoestring budget he has not hesitated to emphasize that valuable asset. // " I think he is the one man who can raise Mexico up , " said Juana Torres de Marin , who owns a food stall at the market in Rincon de Romos , a town just north of here where Mr. Cardenas campaigned today . " The others just talk a lot of blah-blah-blah . But Cuauhtemoc is the son of a President who cared about the common folk of Mexico and actually did something for us. " // Though many Mexicans are reluctant to acknowledge it , Mr. Cardenas ' s appeal also contains a racial element . Mexico is largely a nation of mestizos , people of mixed Indian and European stock , and Mr. Salinas is hoping to succeed two presidents who are sometimes referred to pejoratively as " Spaniards " or " creoles " because of their European ethnic and cultural background. // Mr. Cardenas , on the other hand , is clearly perceived as being part of the mestizo majority , even though he studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign in stylish suits of an Italian cut . His brown skin , chiseled Indian features , somber mien and even his first name , which is that of the Aztec emperor who fell resisting the Spanish conquistadors , all emphasize that heritage. // The Cardenas legacy and mystique are presumed to be the strongest in the countryside , and Mr. Cardenas appears to have found widespread support there . At the town of Villa Garcia today , he was greeted by a group of peasants waving red banners whose leader told him , " We are ready to do anything you order . " <> <> The Loyalty Boils Over // Such deep expressions of loyalty have sometimes boiled over when Mr. Cardenas is not present to calm tempers . In February , in an incident in the northern state of Coahuila that received national attention , peasants said to have been paid to attend a PRI rally turned on Mr. Salinas , pelting him with sticks and water and chanting slogans in support of Mr. Cardenas. // But Mr. Cardenas ' s challenge to his former PRI colleagues has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general born out of wedlock recently emerged from obscurity to appear on a top-rated television news program in which they attacked Mr. Cardenas and lavished praise on the PRI as a guarantor of " social peace. " // Nevertheless , Mr. Cardenas continues to conduct an aggressive campaign . At day ' s end here , delivering the closing speech at a convention organizing a new nationwide farm workers ' union , the Cardenista Peasant Congress , that seeks to supplant the PRI-dominated National Peasant Federation , he was cheered enthusiastically when he said the agrarian measures carried out by his father " must be deepened. " // " No matter where we go , no matter how small or remote the place , we always seem to find that Lazaro Cardenas was there too , 50 years ago , " said Manuel Marcue , one of Mr. Cardenas ' s senior campaign advisers . " The historical memory of the lands he divided and the roads and schools he built is still strong , and it has attached itself not to the PRI but to the figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
