Uneasy Allies <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> America 's allies April 28-always there when they need you . <P> <P> ( The Rev. ) Larry N. Lorenzoni San Francisco <P> Who does Carter think he is , trying to dictate foreign policy to independent nations ? Does he not realize that the nations of Western Europe are not puppets of the U.S. and are well qualified to decide on their own what action should be taken toward the illegal detention of American subjects in Iran ? <P> <P> Ian D. Hay Aberdeen , Scotland <P> I am an Englishwoman who was never very pro-American . Now , however , the U.S. has all my sympathy . It is expected to help out every Tom , Dick and Harry as the years go by , and gets precious little thanks for what it does . People say President Carter dithers . Who would n't with the " friends " he has ? <P> <P> Daisy Swindell Minchinhampton , England <P> While we are clogging the roads on the way to the ballparks , race tracks and gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ruin themselves by joining our Iranian boycott ? <P> <P> Jules Kean Philadelphia <P> What surprises me is that countries think that by imposing sanctions on Iran they are only trying to free the American hostages , when , in fact , they are protecting all the embassies around the world . <P> <P> Evelyn Lane Canoga Park , Calif . <P> <P> A Vote for the Veep <P> Why do n't we cut out all this nonsense regarding the forthcoming election of a President April 28 ? Nobody I know is for Carter , but most are also against Reagan . Get it over with and draft Vice President Mondale as the nominee of the Democratic Party . <P> <P> Raymond C. Emery Tempe , Ariz . <P> <P> Capitalism ( Contd . ) <P> The U.S. no longer has a capitalistic economy April 21 . What we have instead is an aristocracy of Big Business-a handful of conglomerates that control every facet of American life . The American consumer no longer has a choice . Whatever " rose " I pick , the name turns out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGill Philadelphia <P> Sorry , but your observation that " capitalism has lifted the vast majority of laborers into the middle class " ignores the historic role of the labor union movement . Without the labor unions , Marx would have been right : workers would have been pushed " deeper into poverty . " <P> <P> Kirk Bell Sacramento <P> To attribute the ills of our current ( mis ) managed economic mess to capitalism is like blaming the victim for the crime . Do not blaspheme a noble ideal by giving capitalism 's name to years of Keynesian meddling . <P> <P> Oakley K. Davidson Clarendon Hills , Ill . <P> <P> Children of the Holocaust <P> It is only now that I am 33 years old that my parents , survivors of the Holocaust April 21 , are finally willing to describe their ordeal to their children . We are in the process of making a taped dialogue that painfully relives their horror and persecution . Why ? I feel it is my responsibility to ensure that my children and future generations of our family will know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30s and ' 40s . My parents can never forget ; I will never forget ; nor should any of us ever forget , lest it happen all over again . <P> <P> Doris Melnick Westminster , Calif . <P>
