@#  | To discover a vigorous artistic avantgarde garde in Poland is a bit like chancing upon a string of pearls in a forest . We expect political drama in the heart of Eastern Europe , not daring art . Pinned between East and West , the Poles have lived under one oppressor after another for more than a century , interrupted only by brief , ecstatic periods of independence . In the last century , playwright Adam Mickiewicz depicted his country as " the Christ of nations , " writhing in eternal torment . In this century , dramatist Stanislaw Witkiewicz defined Poland 's plight in the subtitle of a play : " There Is Nothing Bad Which Could Not Turn Into Something Worse . " Now , the contraband cultural jewels that have been hidden in Poland throughout this century are being unveiled in the West , in an epic three-month exhibition at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris . " Polish Presences " is a cultural event of the first order . Based on the collection of the extraordinary Museum of Art in Lodz , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 30s , the show bombards the Western viewer with exotic new names : Witkiewicz , Strzeminski , Kobro , Stazewski , Opalka , Wodiczko . There are more than 1,000 paintings , sculptures , drawings , photographs and sculptural objects on view , as well as films and videotapes of Polish dramatists and filmmakers , plus performances and concerts in nearby theaters . Also on display are letters , manuscripts and first editions by novelists , essayists and poets such as the exiled Nobel Prize winner Czeslaw Milosz . The show is powerful , comprehensive and disturbing . Nearly everything here challenges traditional esthetic standards . Tadeusz Kantor , who inspired the Polish avant-garde theater in the ' 40s and ' 50s , has filled an entire room with drawings , collages and installations based on his chilling theater pieces . Dominated by a macabre schoolroom in which a life-size puppet sits alone staring into the void , Kantor 's gallery is a symbol of the provocation posed by the entire exhibition . At no point does " Polish Presences " try to soothe or divert the viewer . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of life-and-death crises ? and in defiance of the authorities ? he acts out of fierce emotional commitment . " Polish Presences " is not , in brief , a pretty experience . Underground : Why have the arts in Poland eschewed tradition and opted , time and again , for unconventional solutions ? It is a fascinating question , raised over and over in Paris but never finally answered . In the darkest hours of Nazi occupation , Polish dramatists staged radical theatrical events that foreshadowed not only the existential dramas of Beckett and Ionesco but the birth of the " happening . " During the grim postwar days of Stalinist censorship , art continued to thrive underground . After Stalin died in 1953 , Polish art and theater flowered . The long-lost plays of Witkiewicz were widely published and performed ? first in Poland , then in the West . A surprisingly nondoctrinaire Ministry of Culture supported art museums and galleries that exhibited all the new forms of art , from the most advanced strains of abstract painting to brash experiments in photography , film and video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who visited Poland during these years and was impressed by the size and intensity of the audience for the arts . In this show , Germain Viatte , the curator . in Paris , and Ryszard Stanislawski , director of the museum in Lodz , have focused primarily on two overriding talents . First in importance is the ubiquitous Witkiewicz. who thrived in every medium ? as painter , photographer , playwright and philosopher ? from the 1890s to the 1930s . Not far behind is Wladislaw Strzeminski , a brilliant painter who founded the museum in Lodz in 1932 ? among the first institutions in the world to be dedicated exclusively to " modern " abstract art . Both as men and as artists , Witkiewicz and Strzeminski were wildly different . Witkiewicz , a tall , lusty and extravagant man , was an extreme individualist . He signed his name " Witkacy " to avoid confusion with his painter father . He often strode the streets disguised as a harlequin , shocked his friends by answering the door in the nude and railed at lecture audiences like a drunk-en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays and novels with arcane ref-erences to many cultures and languages beyond Poland . A thorough pessimist , he warned against the inexorable collectivization of the world by " the pulpy gray mob " and predicted the apocalypse of World War II with uncanny accuracy . When the Nazis invaded , he committed suicide . Team Player : Strzeminski , on the other hand , was an incurable optimist and team player . He loved to collaborate with other artists and praised Henry Ford 's invention of assembly-line methods . He founded the museum in Lodz because he believed that art had an educational function ? to " organize " life . He purged his paintings of even the barest hint of realism or the figure , pursuing a spotless abstract beauty . Witkiewicz 's free-wheeling invasion of all media at once offended purists like Strzeminski . In the early 1900s , Witkiewicz invented an ingenious method of close-up photography . He attached a long tube to the lens , then focused exclusively on the faces of his subjects . One spacious circular gallery in the Paris exhibition is ringed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subjects beam like fireflies in the night . They are unlike any other photographs made in this period . So are the endless selfportraits . Witkiewicz believed in the concept of the " double " and in the multiplicity of moods inside the single self . In Paris , his most spectacular self-portrait is a multiple image made with mirrors in Russia in 1914 , @#  | when he was briefly an officer in the czar 's army ; he seems to be interrogating himself ? or his several selves . Not that the organizers ignore Witkiewicz the painter . Inspired by Picasso , whose works he saw as a young man , Witkiewicz began as a flamboyant stylist . Then , in 1924 , he renounced " fine art " for the commercial world of the portrait painter . Partly to provoke the critics who had ignored him , he opened the infamous " Si Witkiewicz Portrait Painting Firm " in Warsaw and Zakopane , his rustic country village . He dashed off thousands of pastel portraits for his elite customers by " type " ? from the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pompidou , the viewer is surrounded by a panorama of these striking portraits , all drenched in cold tones of blue , violet and rose . As a stylist , the prolix Witkiewicz is clearly an impossible act to follow . His value rests elsewhere . " It is his prophetic qualities that fascinate us , " says one Polish critic . The razzle-dazzle plays that poured from his pen in his last years are filled with dark visions of impending catastrophe . But their characters ? mad poets , debauched nuns and comic robots ? are irreverent iconoclasts , who , like their creator , are charged with a fierce spirit of resistance against all odds . Loops and Frames : Strzeminski was a simpler man ; as such he is better served by " Polish Presences . " The clean , white walls are enlivened with his spare but luminous paintings , in which thin planes of oilbrushed primary colors seem to curl in and out of each other , like tiny cars turning a curve . Although he studied in the early ' 20s with the revolutionary Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He communicated his fanatic dedication to abstraction to dozens of colleagues , most of all the sculptor Katarzyna Kobro , whose elegant metal loops and frames cavort on the open floor , and Henryk Stazewski , whose paintings thrive on nothing but flat line and color . After the devastation wrought by World War II , everything changed . The brighthued simplicities indulged by the Polish constructivists were no longer relevant . " Witkiewicz stood for the destruction of what happened here , " Tadeusz Kantor recalls . " We needed an anti-theater . " Echoing the master , Kantor constructed fantastic sets and buffeted the audience with @# @# raw images , movement and choruses of sound . In part , the attempt by Kantor and colleagues like Jerzy Grotowski and Andrzej Wajda ( who directs both for the screen and the stage ) to reach " beyond " language was provoked by censorship . Willing to tolerate stylistic experiment , the government discouraged discussion of social or political issues . The truth could only be suggested ? through mood , gait and metaphor . Vanguard Spirit : But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last galleries that display recent painting and sculpture . Upon close examination , Roman Opalka 's monochromatic gray canvases become rows and rows of tiny white numbers painted by an exquisitely thin brush . Krzysztof Wodiczko has produced a low , wooden rectangle that the viewer is invited to walk across . Two pairs of wheels on the underside begin to roll , carrying the viewer on a voyage at once real and surreal . It is this penchant for pushing mediums , images and ideas to their limit that links these Polish presences ? and explains , finally , the gallant persistence of the vanguard spirit . In an embattled state , the arts can not content themselves with half-measures . Near the end of Wajda 's major new film , " Danton " ( to be released in the United States this fall ) , which is based on the swashbuckling days of the French Revolution , the hero ignores all the warning signs of danger . He proclaims that " the unique man " is " above the masses . " Of course he is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Polish avant-garde incarnate . When the bad times turn worse , art has nothing to lose ? and much , perhaps , to gain ? by blasting free . 15
