Alzheimer 's disease is a devastating illness of advancing age <P> " You look inside your mind and see nothing but black . " <P> -A victim <P> The first signs are small , puzzling and all too easy to dismiss . For Chicago Journalist Charles Leroux , it was his mother 's diminishing ability to manage her checkbook and count change . For Frank Holmes , a retired Boston businessman , it was the wild spending sprees by his once prudent wife and her increasing tendency to garble phone messages . For Eleanor Zimmerlein , an Illinois farmer 's wife , it was the decline in the quality of her husband 's handiwork : " Suddenly the row of shingles he 'd put on the roof would be crooked , and he could n't saw a straight line . " And for Chicago Office Clerk Eleanor Marzillo , it began with her husband 's difficulty in shaving ; first his trim mustache got bushier and bushier , then one day he shaved half of it off . At the same time , Marzillo recalls , rags were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't figure out what Tony was doing with these rags , " she says . " It turned out he knew how to start the car and how to drive , but he could n't figure out how to use the windshield wipers or defroster any more . " <P> Aberrations such as these mark the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , the insidious and heart-breaking malady of advancing age .

By far the leading cause of mental deterioration among the elderly , AD affects between 5% and 10% of all people over 65 . Among them : former Movie Star Rita Hayworth , 64 . Because most AD patients must eventually be placed in institutions , the disease puts tremendous demands on the nation 's health-care resources . Alzheimer 's victims constitute 50% to 60% of the 1.3 million people in nursing homes , accounting for more than half of the $25 to $26 billion spent annually on such care .
