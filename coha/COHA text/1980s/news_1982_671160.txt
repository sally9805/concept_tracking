It was full of surprises , too . Who else in 1962 would have started with a sculpture by Picasso on the left-hand page and a sculpture by Michelangelo on the right ? The fact that the Picasso was made up of the saddle and the handlebars of an old bicycle made the contrast all the more provocative at the time. // When Janson died recently it happened the way he might have wished - instantaneously , in a train between Milan and Zurich , while on a field trip in search of refinements and improvements for the big book . That book will never go out of style , but every decade or two we can use a new one-volume history of art , a book that speaks for a specific moment in the history of taste in a way that makes us all just that much more alive and alert. // As far as the 1980 ' s and 90 ' s are concerned , I fancy that the book in question has just appeared from Prentice-Hall Inc . Entitled " The Visual Arts : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians , Hugh Honour and John Fleming . The latest product of a long and idiosyncratic partnership , it covers even more ground than H.W. Janson managed to traverse , and it is marginally more up to date. // It has , for instance , a color plate of the two life-size bronze figures of naked Greek warriors that were fished out of the sea not long ago and are now drawing visitors by the hundred thousand to the town of Reggio di Calabria . It also reproduces a drawing by Michael Graves for his controversial Public Office Building in Portland , Ore . Among the great sights that are now out of bounds in Iran , they are particularly good on the great mosque in Yazd . A book first mooted many years ago could hardly in fact be more in line with today ' s preoccupations. // But the charm of " The Visual Arts " is quite independent of its topicality . The book is a delight to read because we believe in Mr. Honour and Mr. Fleming as men who know their subjects at first hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far from sitting the seasons round in a library , though they have done their share of that , they seem to have been everywhere , seen everything , looked at it afresh and made it all fit together. // The book is , in fact , a tour de force on the part of two men who have survived as free human beings in a world of curators and college professors . Neither Mr. Honour nor Mr. Fleming has ever to my knowledge had an office , let alone been bound to one . For as long as anyone can remember they have lived in Italy in a house that until quite lately did not even have a telephone . ( Calls had to be placed to a cafe some six miles distant , whence they were relayed by a boy on a bicycle ) . // How they do it is a mystery , but there isn ' t a learned article that they don ' t read , a new acquisition in a museum 6 , 000 miles away that they can not discuss , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this comes out in their book on the visual arts , and I would lay money on its still going strong in the stores in the years 2000 A.D. // It has always been the dream of every French museum director that one day he would get to be in charge of the whole of the Louvre - not just of " the Louvre , " as visitors know it today , but of the entire Palais du Louvre , much of what has been in the hands of the French bureaucracy for a century and more. // In particular , the director of the Louvre has always coveted the part of the great building that was occupied by the Finance Ministry . This was turned during the reign of Napoleon III into one of the sumptuous interiors of its date . The huge reception room , with the musicians ' gallery in which Emil Waldteufel himself struck up his " Skaters ' Waltz , " is one of the unsung sights of Paris. // And the good news for the museum is that the Mitterand Administration has told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to La Defense , a full four miles away . Eventually , therefore , the museum will occupy every last corner of the stupendous building , thereby fulfilling an ambition that for many years seemed chimerical. // But it is one thing to get in , and quite another to devise the kind of lucid , elegant and well-reasoned installation that will show both the building and the collections to their best advantage . Insofar as a new location will be found for virtually every work of art in the Louvre , this may well be the single most taxing task ever presented to an architect , a designer and a curatorial team. // This matter would once have been regarded as strictly off limits to foreigners . But times have changed in France , and the new master plan for the Louvre will shortly be debated by an international jury of experts . ( Among them will be Philippe de Montebello , director of the Metropolitan Museum ) . On the basis of their decision , practicalities will begin to go forward and in due time we shall see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before. // Don ' t call your travel agent , though . This is a mammoth project , and " Some time in the 1990 ' s " is as near as you will get to an opening date. // I don ' t know why it is , but artists in novels hardly ever carry conviction . Henry James got one right , and Emile Zola got one almost right , but then James could do anything and Zola had been a close friend of Cezanne . Elsewhere it has been downhill most of the way. // Even so I turned in great hopes to " A Foregone Conclusion " by William Dean Howells , which has just been reprinted in the noble American Library edition for which the Viking Press acts as distributor . This has as its protagonist - " hero " would be too strong a word - a young American painter who at the time the story opens is American consul in Venice. // All augured well . The American Library makes the physical act of reading an intense pleasure . Howells had been American consul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War , and his account of the duties ( or lack of duties ) of the post could not be bettered . Few people have ever described Venice so well , and he is on top form in that context in " A Foregone Conclusion. " // But as to what kind of a painter young Ferris was , and how he set about it , and whether he would ever have been any good - there Howells deserts us . I didn ' t believe a word of that part of the story . But there is a moment toward the end that anyone who has ever heard one painter talking to another will recognize as authentic. // Ferris has been speaking with a doubtless well-justified modesty about a painting of his that someone wants to put into an exhibition . A sculptor overhears Ferris ' s mumbled demurral , looks at the painting and breaks in on the conversation . " I know what you mean , " he says . " It ' s hard , and it ' s feeble in some ways , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn ' t so infernally bad . " That ' s the real unsparing thing , and for the first and last time I believed in Ferris as a painter. // The story , as a story , is very good , by the way . Howells had not read Turgenev for nothing. //
