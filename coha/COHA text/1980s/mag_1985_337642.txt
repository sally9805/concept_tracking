Moviegoers do n't get many chances to cry together in public these days . The local picture house is a place for belly laughs and slasher screams ; for a cathartic sob one must go to TV for a Movie of the Week or a late show . Once in a while , though , a film will buck the glut of exploitation movies and attract any viewer who still carries a hankie . Critic Raymond Durgnat called them " male weepies " : films to make a grown man , or a baby mogul , cry . They describe a heroic life struggle that may end in defeat or death but never in ignominy . There is nothing like a fighter against the odds  --  a caring father ( Kramer vs . Kramer ) , a troubled teenager ( Ordinary People ) , a young cancer victim ( Terms of Endearment ) or a misunderstood songwriter ( Amadeus )  --  to exalt ! and liquefy a theaterful of adults . Or to win the past six Oscars for Best Picture . <P> With $20 million in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's first strong entry in the weepstakes . Its subject , Rocky Dennis , was the butt of one of God 's practical jokes . This bright teenager had a preternaturally sweet disposition  --  and the grotesque face of Bert Lahr 's Cowardly Lion . Rocky 's rare disease , craniodiaphyseal dysplasia , ended his life at 16 , in 1978 . And yet ( of course ) he was one of nature 's noblemen , loved by puppies , blind girls and the motorcycle gang his mother Rusty hung out with . " I look weird , " says Rocky ( Eric Stoltz , in a wonderfully authentic performance ) , " but otherwise I 'm real normal . " Better than normal . He shines in school , plays Cupid between his mom ( Cher ) and a rowdy old friend ( Sam Elliott ) , and falls into tender love with a City Lights sweetie ( Laura Dern ) who can see only his good heart and humor . Metaphorically , Rocky is the beautiful soul hidden in every shy teenager with a bad case of zits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smash one Hollywood cliche ( in this case , that heroes are always handsome ) in order to reveal several others ( beauty is the beast ; the good die young ) . Anna Hamilton Phelan 's script neither sidesteps nor wallows in these homilies ; it is notable mostly for the bathetic excesses it avoids . So is Peter Bogdanovich 's directorial touch . Bogdanovich may be the last and finest avatar of the classic Hollywood style ; discreet tracking shots , invisible editing , no camerabatics , no teary close- ups for emotional blackmail . Nobody is trying to make a masterpiece here . Mask has a sturdy , disposable feel to it , like the tissues moviegoers are advised to bring with them when they see it . <P> At the moment , it is Bogdanovich who feels disposable . He has his biggest hit since Paper Moon a dozen years ago , yet he has virtually disowned Mask . Seems Producer Martin Starger cut two scenes from the film and replaced music by Bruce Springsteen ( Rocky 's favorite rock star ) with four Bob Seger songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frank Capra , came to Bogdanovich 's defense ; so did an impromptu protest committee , Moviegoers Against Studio Kibitzing ( M.A.S.K. ) . So the picture offers two parables : one of Hollywood devouring its own , one of the man in the lion mask . The second is worth attending to , for it demonstrates anew that there is such a thing as an honest cry at the movies .
