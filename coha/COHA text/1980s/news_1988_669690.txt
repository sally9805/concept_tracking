This fall the longtime dissident leader , whose torture and imprisonment became an international issue , was finally released in an amnesty . ' ' Now I am not being followed , ' ' says the soft-spoken Mr. Kim , ' ' but I believe my telephone is being tapped. ' ' // This is how one dedicated opponent of the South Korean government measures the change brought about by the democratization of political life since the summer of 1987. // // Kim sees a tangible lifting of the blanket of fear of political repression in his country . His view is shared by lawyers and human rights activists. // But , such critics also say , the process of reform has not yet penetrated the structure of control that has been in place for so many years. // ' ' I can feel a change on the surface , ' ' says Cho Chun Hee , vice-chairman of the Korean Bar Association ' s Human Rights Committee . ' ' But I don ' t see fundamental change in our justice system. ' ' // In coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning their attention to such reforms . On the agenda are the treatment of political prisoners , the reform of several laws that have been used to control and punish political dissidents in the past , and the functioning of the feared intelligence agency. // The government and ruling party have recently proposed reforms of these institutions and laws . But the three opposition parties , who jointly have a majority in the National Assembly , have their own stance . A special legislature committee is scheduled to take up these issues shortly. // The government is preparing an amnesty for political prisoners , the most visible legacy of the previous military-dominated regime of former President Chun Doo Hwan . This is the fourth amnesty since June 1987 , when President Roh Tae Woo , then the ruling party leader , announced a sweeping package of reforms in response to violent mass protests that rocked the nation. // Human rights organizations are skeptical about the coming release of prisoners . According to the Human Rights Committee of the Protestant National Council of Churches ( NCC ) , the previous amnesties have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another 200 were released after completing their sentences. // The Rev. Im Kwang Bin , a member of the NCC panel , charges that the government ' ' has been arresting as many people as they are letting go . ' ' The committee says that , as of last month , there are 534 political prisoners , excluding those held as ' ' spies. ' ' // According to the Justice and Peace Committee of the Roman Catholic Church , most of the detainees now are students and workers , rather than underground dissidents . Many have been arrested for participating in demonstrations , mostly for crimes such as obstructing the police or for violating the Law on Assembly and Demonstration , a longtime tool in suppressing dissent. // ' ' On the surface , nobody is being arrested for thinking , ' ' says Mr. Cho , the lawyer . ' ' But if you examine the cases , many times they were arrested because of political attitudes or beliefs. ' ' // The most controversial target of legislative reform is the National Security Act , the main instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally aimed at suppression of communist organizations but has been used to cover all kinds of antigovernment activity . It very loosely defines ' ' antistate organizations ' ' as any group with the purpose of becoming the government or ' ' disturbing the state. ' ' // The provision most often used to silence dissent is Article VII , which makes it punishable with up to seven years ' imprisonment to ' ' support , ' ' ' ' encourage , ' ' or ' ' endorse ' ' an antistate organization . Under this provision , a student can be jailed for saying he favors a North Korean proposal for unification with the South . Another article dealing with the meetings and communication with antistate organizations would , if enforced , bar a meeting between President Roh and North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. // The proposed amendment of this law narrows the definition of antistate organization to exclude communist countries other than North Korea . This is aimed in part at facilitating South Korea ' s active diplomacy with China , the Soviet Union , and other communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade and travel to the North , access to North Korean literature , and exchanges of letters with relatives in the North . The government has proposed such contacts as part of its policy of improving relations with the North. // The Korean Bar Association is sharply critical of these changes , saying the vague terminology of the law bars such activity if it is carried out with the intent to aid North Korean aims. // ' ' Such a law is susceptible to abuse because the government can interpret it anyway it wants to , ' ' Mr. Cho says . ' ' It is legal to read books , but it is illegal to read them with the intent to ' praise , support , or endorse North Korea. ' ' ' // Human rights organizations also feel the revision is aimed at maintaining government control over the issue of reunification of Korea , an issue that has been pushed by the left as a nationalist cause. // The Bar Association and the human rights organizations call for complete abolition of the National Security Act , arguing that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical of the opposition parties for leaning toward a less stringent position. // An equally controversial problem is the law governing the functioning of the Agency for National Security Planning , formerly called the Korean Central Intelligence Agency . The agency has been deeply involved in domestic politics : spying on dissidents , arrest and torture of antigovernment activists , and enforcing press censorship. // Even before his election last December , President Roh had pledged to end the agency ' s role in domestic politics and confine it to external threats . The government recently backed the recommendations of a presidential commission that would limit the agency ' s internal role to investigating sedition and ' ' communist-related activites . ' ' It would be required to remain politically neutral and would no longer enforce the National Security Act. // The opposition seeks to restrict the agency solely to collecting information and to overseas activity . ' ' What the government is planning to do is keep this agency with slight modification , ' ' charges Lee Chul , an independent opposition Assemblyman . ' ' It proves they still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is at stake , claim longtime activists like Kim Keun Tae , is the future of democratization . Without deep reforms , he says , ' ' there is a danger that history will start going backwards. ' ' // //
