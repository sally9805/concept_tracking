Like the Bryant-led Alabama team they face in the Liberty Bowl at Memphis , the Fighting Illini finished the regular season with a record of 7-4 . While that record marked failure for the Crimson Tide , it was applauded here as yet another sign of the Illini ' s return to football respectability. // Much of the credit for the turn in fortune - Illinois teams were 43-92-4 from 1967 to 1979 - has gone to 46-year-old Coach Mike White , whose career has not lacked for controversy. // In his three seasons here , White ' s teams have gained a reputation for a sophisticated passing offense , a huge break from a tradition that had bound the Illini to the concept of 3 yards and a cloud of dust . The new approach has proved so successful , and so popular , that at every home game this year , the team filled 67 , 000-seat Memorial Stadium , where 20 , 000 empty seats were once common. // // Lost Three Close Games // This season ' s squad may have been better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pittsburgh in the fourth game of the season , Illinois lost by a total of 12 points to Ohio State , Iowa and the Big Ten champion , Michigan , all of which later received bowl berths . And , though the Rose Bowl savings plans offered by local banks and " Rose Bowl Bound " T-shirts sold in town were for naught , the program again is on solid footing : In the last two years , grants-in-aid from benefactors to the school ' s athletic program have increased to $2 million annually , from $600 , 000. // Yet , despite his success as a head coach at Illinois and earlier at his alma mater , California , despite the high marks he received as an assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers , despite colleagues ' praise about his imagination and skill as an offensive innovator and molder of quarterbacks , despite overtures from the new United States Football League , there remain questions about White ' s past that , to his considerable frustration , he can not seem to shake. // In 1977 , White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Golden Bears had finished 7-4 that season and had been the Pacific-8 co-champion two years earlier . Athletic Director Dave Maggard , who had hired White in 1972 , reportedly without considering any other candidates , now refuses to speak about him or his dismissal . White maintains that his penchant to criticize and his aggressiveness in promoting his football team alienated him at California. // After his dismissal , he spent two years as an assistant with the 49ers , then was hired as head coach by Illinois . When he arrived here in December 1979 , it was amid published charges that some of his players at California , including the star running back Chuck Muncie , now of the San Diego Chargers , had not regularly attended classes . <> <> ' It ' s Nothing Illegal ' // White said then : " That ' s no big deal . Everyone knows it ' s going on , and , if Cal was an offender , it was one of the least . It ' s nothing illegal . The athletes fill out cards for courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes. " // But White has never denied the charge , and he now says that during his tenure at California , the university had no plan for counseling and assisting athletes who were marginal students . " The accountability is with the university , " he says , though conceding that while he encourages players to attend class and stresses the importance of academics , " I would be the first to admit that it was a two-way street . I was probably a little lax in enforcing . " Last year , he says , he dropped seven players , including Darrell Smith , a starting running back , for not attending classes. // The National Collegiate Athletic Association has never found White guilty of any rule infractions . But the Big Ten Conference did ban Illinois from postseason play last year because of the school ' s support of a suit attacking the conference ' s guidelines for faculty control of athletics . That suit , brought in 1980 by Dave Wilson , then the team ' s quarterback and now of the New Orleans Saints , challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible for only one season at Illinois because he had used up three years of eligibility in junior college . The case is still pending. // Although the conference ruling had no direct bearing on White , it did touch on another controversy in which he has found himself : his recruiting of 39 junior-college students since his arrival at Illinois , primarily to fill the so-called " skilled " positions . White had come to Illinois saying that the team would be only as good as the four-year players recruited from the state . <> <> Disputes ' Quick Fix ' Idea // The transfer students , he now says , were not a quick solution to the moribund condition of the Illinois football program , but rather a lure for attracting the quality four-year players that Illinois was losing to other Big Ten schools and to nearby Notre Dame. // " My approach here wasn ' t a quick fix , " he says . " It wasn ' t that I felt I had to win at all costs . To me , it was just a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of player , you need an attractive program . We had no edge . I ' m a pretty good salesman , but it was obvious to me that we lacked so many things that it was going to be tough . The University of Illinois was not the place to come. " // Wilson and this year ' s much-heralded quarterback , Tony Eason , are both products of California ' s extensive junior-college system and were among the four transfer students whom White recruited his first year . The following season he brought in 18 ; the next year he recruited 17 more , along with 20 four-year players . In the future , White says , the emphasis will be on recruiting four-year men. // Already , recruiting at Illinois has improved , says Gary Horton , the university ' s national recruiting director . High school coaches who once ignored Illinois , he says , are now directing their better players toward it . " Now we can walk in and meet with any kid in the state and have a chance with him , " Horton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function of White ' s skill as a recruiter . ( " He could sell ice to an Eskimo at a good price , " says Darryl Rogers , the coach at Arizona State , who is a friend of White . ) <> <> Envy Called a Factor // Having blossomed under White ' s tutelage , several college quarterbacks have gone on to successful professional careers , among them Craig Morton , Steve Bartkowski and Vince Ferragamo . The list also includes Jim Plunkett , whom White coached at Stanford , where he was offensive coordinator for teams that won the Rose Bowl in 1971 and 1972 . John Ralston , the head coach for whom he worked at Stanford , says that White has the talent to succeed at virtually anything he tries and that , if he has made enemies , the reason is that they envy his success. // Ike Keiffer , the coach at Merritt Junior College in Oakland , says that White has been straightforward and fair with his players , several of whom have been recruited by Illinois since White ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly recruited quarterback , says that White impressed him with the importance he placed on academics , as well as his record in developing professional quarterbacks . Brunet has not yet decided on a senior college. // As for White ' s view of himself , he believes that he has matured . Where once he was volatile and occasionally misdirected , he says , he has learned to trust himself . He also now delegates some responsibilities , after years of trying to take too many of the wrong ones upon himself . But , rather than trying to emulate Ralston ' s organizational approach , in which a great deal is delegated , he has adapted techniques acquired in a management-training seminar to his more intense personality. // " My entire career at Cal was learning to be a head coach , " he says . " I sold that university . I got further and further away from football . John was the best I ' ve ever seen at delegating , and I did what John did at Stanford . And I delegated out my football. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than promotion . He now concentrates primarily on coaching the offense , leaving other coaching and the promotional activities to subordinates. // " Now , " he says , " I ' m Mike White , the football coach.
