Masters No. 2 for Ballesteros <P> In Craig Stadler ( 1982 Masters ) , Ray Floyd ( 1982 P.G.A. ) and Tom Watson ( 1982 U.S. and British Opens ) , Severiano Ballesteros had the defenders of all the major golf championships to contend with last week in the final round of the 1983 Masters . " They are one of the best three , " agreed the adventurous Spaniard , 26 , who showed he is one of the best himself , easily winning his second Masters championship in four years . That is , if the following can be termed easy : <P> At the first hole , Ballesteros struck a 7-iron within 8 ft. and made the putt for a birdie ; at the second , a 4-wood within 15 ft. , an eagle ; at the fourth , a 2-iron that scarcely missed being a hole in one . Starting one shot behind Stadler and Floyd , he now led the tournament by three . Watson 's game plan to recoup two strokes against the leaders had been to shoot 34 on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall four behind Ballesteros . <P> Then , when the eminent Americans forcibly pressed Augusta National for birdies , the rolling course fitfully responded with bogeys . Unwittingly , Texans Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite overtook them all to finish second , four shots behind Ballesteros . " Play the course , " the winner had counseled himself , " and be cool . " Asked how his second Masters victory compared with the first , Ballesteros said , " I tell you , they are both very sweet . But the first is always the best , like when you marry the first time . " He is a bachelor . <P> The fourth son of " a farmer , a rower , a very strong man , " Ballesteros learned golf from the swing of his brother Manuel , 34 , and practiced " on the beach from the age of nine , on the golf course since 15 " in Santander , Spain . At 16 , Seve turned professional , a handsome boy with a wild talent . His early dedication extended to playing late after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round in hopes of cramming the last 36 holes into a marathon Sunday . To Arnold Palmer 's relief , they did not quite make it , and the tournament was prolonged a day . <P> Palmer , 53 , winner of four Masters titles , shot a four-under-par 68 in a nostalgic first round , making his incorrigible followers wonder if he could win again . " Damn right , " Palmer said , but then he shot 74 , 76 and 78 . Jack Nicklaus , 43 , who has won five Masters , was asked who he thought would win . " When I 'm not here any more , " Nicklaus answered softly , " I 'll pick somebody else . " Following a first-round 73 , Nicklaus had to withdraw with a creaky back . Ballesteros has a bad back too , but at the mention of it after his closing 69 , he said , " My back is very good . Is yours all right ? "                  @ @ @
