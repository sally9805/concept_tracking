Charleston , W.Va.  --  In the spring of every year , fiddlers , singers , banjo pickers and virtuosi of the lap dulcimer , among other instruments , celebrate the music of West Virginia at the state ' s Cultural Center on the State Capitol grounds here . It ' s called the Vandalia Gathering , and participants come from the " hollers " ( the hollows hidden in the steep mountains ) , and they come from Deadfall Mountain , and most every county . The families , like the music , go way back . One of fiddler Ernie Carpenter ' s forebears , for instance , was born under a rock overhang during an Indian raid in the 18th century . Older than that ancestor is the tune , " Billy in the Low Ground , " performed here by fiddler Delbert Hughes . The farewell to Billy goes back to the reign of William and Mary . In another song , the Morris Brothers toast their colleagues : " There ' s fire on the Mountain and there ' s fire in the fiddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the music never dies . " The West Virginia Department of Culture and History , which hosts the annual Vandalia Gathering , took a line out of the Morris Brothers ' song for the title of its lively two-LP set , " The Music Never Dies : A Vandalia Sampler , 1977-1987 . " Folklorists can find multiple layers of cross-cultural connections over centuries in the music , but you don ' t have to be a specialist to be drawn into the dreamlike high , lonesome sound of " Elkhorn Ridge " as sung and played by Ron Mullenn , who learned it from his mother on the family sheep farm . And there ' s a wide range of bravura fiddling for high-stepping dancing . Among the sizzling banjoists is Phoeba Paroons , who learned to pick from her father many years ago . As she says on the recording : " My music that I play is old time from way back . I never learned no new tunes , and I ain ' t figuring on it . " Many of the players , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the spirit of the music that can move new generations to create songs in the tradition . One of the founders of the Vandalia Gathering , David Morris , a practitioner of the auto-harp , told Southern Living magazine : " I used to look over my shoulder and worry that the music wouldn ' t continue . But it will . It ' s the language of our mountains . As surely as we learn to talk , we learn this too . " But it takes some doing to successfully expose youngsters to these indigenous sounds . After all , their forebears didn ' t have radios and the homogenizing sounds of the outside world during the centuries the Vandalia tradition was being shaped . Connecting West Virginia ' s young to their heritage is a priority of Norman Fagan , the state ' s commissioner of the Culture and History Department . " One thing we do , " he told me , " is bring young people into the annual gathering . They ' re able to listen to , talk and learn from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , through our heritage programs , we bring West Virginia musicians into the schools . Teachers can apply for grants to bring the performers into the classroom . . . Furthermore , appearances by musicians , the kind who are heard at Vandalia , can be arranged by us for any college , university or community group . " The Department of Culture and History produced " The Music Never Dies : A Vandalia Sampler , 1977-1987 " on its Elderberry label . It ' s available through the Cultural Center Shop , the Cultural Center , State Capitol Complex , Charleston , W.Va. 25305 ( $12. 50 plus $3 for postage and handling ) . Another distinctive recording in the shop  --  though not produced by the state  --  is " U.S. Senator Robert Byrd/Mountain Fiddler " ( $7 plus $3 for postage and handling ) . On the floor of the Senate and in his many television appearances , Byrd is invariably formal , meticulously conscious of his position and privileges , and without  --  as blues singers might say  --  much " soul . " The senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different plumage . He plays hot , foot-tapping fiddle , and on the recording he credits his initial passion for country music to his wife ' s father , a coalminer who played the violin . But it is the singing Byrd who provides the most tender surprise . The senator becomes gently , hauntingly compelling in " Come Sundown She ' ll Be Gone . " Waking , barely hearing the front door closing , Byrd remembers " the soft touch of her lips , Lord , was like a whisper on my cheek . . . the soft sheets still feel warm where she laid upon my bed . " How many other U.S. senators can sing of love  --  not votes  --  with such authentic power ? In " The Vandalia Sampler , " the Morris Brothers sing : " They say the fiddle is a riding horse , and the devil is in the night , but I believe the fiddlers are touched by God ' s own clear blue light . " It could be that in the music of West Virginia , there ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the fiddle , and in the blood.  --  - Mr. Hentoff is a New York-based writer and jazz critic.
