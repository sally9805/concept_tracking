 | About 90 minutes after you fall asleep tonight , your brain will awaken with a start , crackling with mental electricity . The brainstem , at the base of your skull , will begin firing a random barrage of high-voltage impulses , nonsensical and chaotic , and unleash waves of chemicals that will lap into the forebrain . There the gray matter will desperately seek coherence in these neuroevents , almost as if it were faced with a Rorschach . You are paralyzed , a helpless voyeur of events unfolding just inside your forehead , where images as familiar to Dali as to Jung race by . You 're dreaming . Before dawn breaks , you will probably experience four more dreams , though in all likelihood their details will never lodge in your conscious memory . Instead the images will disappear , as if into the collective unconscious ? for the act of dreaming is part of mankind 's evolutionary heritage , so basic that it can be traced back 135 million years . Now , spurred by new research , science is unlocking the mysteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain . For psychotherapists , this nocturnal theater of the mind remains a mother lode of symbols ( following story ) . For scientists , dreams are even more provocative . Some find that dreams may serve as a sort of early-warning system for illness . Others track how dreams start as the simplest of snapshots and grow more complicated as a child ages ; by mapping that development psychologists gain insight into the blossoming of cognition . Still other researchers believe that memory may be controlled by the same polysyllabic chemicals that trigger dreams . For all their promise , dreams seemed , until very recently , like a vaguely disreputable way for a scientist to make a living . Even after the 1953 discovery of the brain state in which dreams occur , " the feeling was dreams were ephemeral things , not something to base solid science on , " says Dr. Robert W. McCarley of Harvard Medical School . Once Freudians began to use other paths to the unconscious , dreams became the province of pop culture , the first sign that a new age was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose members swapped dreams over herbal tea ; they snapped up books that promised to reveal meanings as easily as looking up " tunnel " in the index . What was a fad is now mainstream . Even executives are asking their dreams to solve business dilemmas . One " creative management " course at the Stanford Business School uses " Living Your Dreams , " a book by San Francisco psychologist Gayle Delaney . " We are trying to put to bed the notion of dreams as meaningless epiphenomena of the firing of neurons , " says Delaney . Here 's how it works . I was visiting my Uncle Fred and Aunt Jean , said James Schrager , chief financial officer of a trading firm in San Francisco . He had gone to sleep intent on having a dream about a new wheelchair he 'd been working on . They had all the material goods in the world , but they seemed so very sad . Although the dream did not tell Schrager how to advance his invention , it told him something else . " He was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold out . It showed what 's keeping me from getting into the state of mind necessary to create " ? the same concern with material success that his dream uncle had . Schrager still has n't invented a better wheelchair , but his dreams did give him an idea for a new business : taking companies public in Japan . Dreams never seem more powerful than when they solve a problem . Robert Louis Stevenson said he got the idea for Dr. Jekyll  | and Mr. Hyde in a dream ; Elias Howe , trying to invent a machine that sewed , reportedly dreamed he was captured by savages carrying spears with holes in their tips . Upon waking , Howe realized he should put the hole for the thread at the end of the needle , not the middle . Such inspirations truly seem like gifts of the gods , and mere biochemistry ca n't fully explain the creativity of dreams . It may be that dreams give us greater insight because they weave together , in unique and creative ways , current experiences with ones from the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images that arise during " rapid eye movement " sleep . REM sleep is characterized by darting eye movements , paralyzed limbs and irregular respiration and heartbeat . If sleep-lab volunteers are awakened after every REM episode , 85 to 90 percent of the time they say they were dreaming . Fetuses as young as 23 weeks experience REM sleep , as do all birds and mammals ( except the spiny anteater ) . This suggests that REM developed when these creatures branched off from a common ancestor , more than 135 million years ago , long before humans were even a glimmer in evolution 's eye . Now dreams fill everyone 's nights . Such common dreams as flying , falling or walking naked in public can visit anyone , for these experiences seem to capture universal human aspirations or fears . But dreams also bear the unmistakable stamp of gender . " Dreams of American women have more in common with those of Aboriginal women than they do with those of American men , " says Dr. Milton Kramer , director of the Sleep Disorders Center of Greater Cincinnati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homey scenes ; men of the outdoors . Women 's dreams featured more conversation and emotion , and portrayed the dreamer as a victim of aggression . Men 's dreams tended toward mechanical images .

I go get a hose to fill my gas tank but it wo n't reach . Says Dr. Rosalind Cartwright of the Rush-Presbyterian-St . Luke 's Medical Center in Chicago , " No woman would dream a sexy dream in those terms . " But men 's and women 's dreams are becoming more androgynous . Women are dreaming more of the outdoors and of torrid sex . They are as likely as men to dream of themselves as aggressors . Concludes Kramer , " If one accepts the dream as  | a reflector of inner processes , these themes no longer serve to discriminate between the sexes . The sexual revolution may have indeed contributed to meaningful internal change . " Age also influences dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3- and 4-year-olds to his lab . For nine nights he woke them from sound sleep and asked them what they remembered . The children reported snippets , not narratives . " It was like a slide show , with moments frozen in time , " says Foulkes . The static images of storybook animals ? rabbits , frogs , birds ? had little emotional content and the kids themselves made only rare appearances in their own dreams . For the next five years , Foulkes brought the youngsters back for more interrupted dreams . By the age of 5 or 6 , some children began dreaming in stories ; there was action and movement , but the dreamer still did not star in her own dreams . Only by the age of 7 or 8 did some children , especially brighter ones , put themselves into their dreams . " For the first time the dream proceeds at the psychological as well as the physical level , " says Foulkes . By 8 or 9 , children dream like adults . What mental circuits must be wired to create " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of symbols . Dreams are n't replays of specific events , notes Foulkes , but " fusions of pieces of memory and knowledge " that the brain weaves together . This requires an ability to analyze concepts and meld them into novel wholes . Foulkes concludes that " dreaming develops along the same lines , and at roughly the same rate , as waking intelligence . " By noting when various abilities blossom , he hopes to use children 's dreams to write a timetable of cognitive development . As every parent racing to the crib of a crying toddler knows , children between 3 and 5 are especially prone to nightmares . So are people who have what psychologists call " thin boundaries " : they are acutely sensitive to their own emotions and inner world as well as to others ' , and are very trusting . " They have a flower-child aspect , " says Dr. Ernest Hartmann of Tufts University School of Medicine . They gravitate to the arts and to such creative professions as teaching and therapy . They also suffer many more nightmares than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking in the park but got caught by nightfall . There had been people all around , but they had disappeared .

The distinguishing trait of all nightmares is that the dreamer is endangered . Parents are the exception : they dream their babies are in trouble . One way to overcome nightmares may be through a technique called lucidity , in which the sleeper recognizes a dream as it 's unfolding . The ability to dream " lucidly " comes naturally to just 10 percent or so of the population , and even they report only one lucid dream a month , on average . But lucidity can be learned , claims psychologist Stephen LaBerge of Stanford University . He has volunteers wear sleep masks with sensors that detect REM sleep and turn on a red flashing light . When the sleeper sees the light it becomes incorporated into the dream and alerts him that he 's dreaming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideally a recurring one , and train oneself to recognize that when that situation or image pops up , it 's a dream . Children as young as 5 seem able to learn lucid dreaming , especially to fight off nightmares . A shark was chasing me in the reservoir , dreamed the 7-year-old girl . I was so afraid he was going to eat me . LaBerge told her that next time she had this recurring nightmare , she should climb onto the shark 's back for a ride . She did , and the nightmares stopped . During REM , most dreamers are immobilized . But Dr. Mark Mahowald and Dr. Carlos Schenck of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center have been studying 75 people , primarily elderly men , who are anything but paralyzed : these calm , friendly , happily married men act out violent dreams . I was deer hunting with my grandfather , says Mel Abel , 75 . The deer was n't quite dead so I was strangling it . In reality he was strangling his wife .

When he awoke , says Dorff , " I had knocked lamps , mirror and everything else off the dresser , hit my head against the wall and my knee against the dresser . " Although the Minnesota researchers are n't sure of the exact cause of the syndrome , they suspect it 's neurological or related to aging . They have eliminated it in 90 percent of their patients with clonazepam , a drug prescribed for epilepsy . One dogma that remains unchallenged is that dreaming of one 's own death does not portend doom . But there are hints that dreams may whisper something about illness . In a 1987 study , Dr. Robert Smith of Michigan State University analyzed the recent dreams of cardiac patients for references to death , including images of graveyards , and for scenes of separation from family or friends . " Men who dreamed of destruction , mutilation and death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those who did n't , " says Smith . Such dreams became more frequent as cardiac problems became more severe . Since the patients did n't know the severity of their condition , it 's unlikely that worry shaped their dreams . Perhaps dreams might be used as warning signs of disease . " Dreaming may let us know if something is wrong , warning us of vulnerability , " says Hartmann . Whatever dreams reveal of the body , they seem to provide a peek at the subconscious . But their language is cryptic ; interpreting what Delaney calls " their metaphorical , visual language " is akin to literary analysis , a parsing of images , an analysis of symbols . " Dreams are very much like poetry , " she says . " You understand them if you get the metaphor . " It was dark , and I was being chased by a man with a knife . When I turned to confront him . I made him come into the light with me so Icould see him . When he did , he turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was cognac . Delaney asks her client to define and describe every image as if to a Martian , for different images hold different meanings for every dreamer . What is a knife ? What is cognac ? Then the dreamer summarizes the plot , describes the feelings of the dream and recapitulates the definitions . Last , Delaney asks the woman to think which situation in real life the images or feelings resemble . This client realized she had been running from her fear that all men would turn into alcoholics like her father . A similar sequence IRA WFUAN FOR NEO W FEK Tickling neurons : Hobson of Harvard The brain is so determined to find meaning , it makes dreams out of random signals 1 '  | would mean something else to another person , but would still shine a light on things he might have known only vaguely . " Dreams show us what we do n't dare confront directly when we 're awake , " Delaney says . Even some scientists who tickle neurons and map brain chemicals have a newfound respect for dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. J. Allan Hobson . The psychiatrists developed a theory to explain how dreams are generated by neurons during REM sleep and how the mind makes sense of the signals it receives . Dreams , they conclude , are born in the brainstem , which controls such basics as reflexes . In the brainstem are two kinds of neurons known to control sleep , each using a different chemical to communicate . One type uses acetylcholine ; they are " on " during REM . The others use norepinephrine and serotonin ; they are " off . " Only when these latter neurons are turned off can the acetylcholine neurons turn on . Then a dream is born . The acetylcholine neurons send rapid bursts of electrical signals to the cortex , the seat of higher thought and vision . The cortex takes this information and weaves it into a coherent story , say Hobson and McCarley , interpreting the signals by referring to pre-existing memories . Acetylcholine may be the very stuff that dreams are made of . ( The dream cocktail is C7H17NO3 , or 7 parts carbon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evidence : when researchers led by Hobson and McCarley inject drugs that mimic acetylcholine into the brainstem of cats , they undergo REM sleep . Recently they 've shown that the neurons responsible for REM connect with neurons containing acetylcholine emanating from the brainstem . And in people , drugs that increase the availability of acetylcholine hasten the onset of REM and dreams . Such research draws bitter criticism from researchers who think it dismisses dreams as mere random products of REM sleep . But that may be an unfair reading . In " The Dreaming Brain , " published last year , Hobson bends over backward to say dreams are not meaningless . To the contrary : he claims that the brain is so " inexorably bent upon the quest for meaning " that it takes essentially random , automatic signals from the brainstem and imbues them with sense . What kind of sense reveals the dreamer 's " drives , fears and associations , " he writes . Far from belittling dreams , Hobson offers a coherent explanation of why dreams are so bizarre , why they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dream in metaphors . I dreamed of cleaning out my garage . I took out all the summer furniture and piled it on the street . A man in a pickup came along and started to load up my stuff . I yelled at him and asked what he thought he was doing . He told me , " If you did n't want someone else to take it , you should n't have left it out there and available . " The patient immediately realized the discarded " stuff " was his wife and children . Call him The Man Who Mistook His Family For Chaises Longues . Hobson maintains that dreams are full of such vivid images because " the brain works associatively . High-level associations are metaphors , which pack lots of material into an economical unit . " The ubiquity of symbols may also reflect how memory works . Since we dream in metaphors , perhaps we store knowledge in that form , too . Studying dream , symbols , says Emory 's Foulkes , may reveal whether we organize memories by their emotional content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may explain other puzzles . Dreams are visually vivid yet nearly devoid of tastes and smells . The reason : it may be that visual neurons , but not taste or olfactory neurons , fire intensely during REM . Also , dreams are bizarre . Hobson argues that 's because the cortex receives signals from the brainstem and not the outside world ; trying to make a coherent story from chaotic signals produces strange plots and events . They still have a link to real life , however , because the brain draws on actual memories to spin the stories . Finally , dreams seem frenetic , with chases , flights and falls . The reason may be that during REM , neurons in the part of the cortex that control movement fire as rapidly as when the dreamer is awake and active . During REM sleep , neurons that permit the dream-inducing neurons to buzz with activity are themselves out of action . Normally , they are involved in attention and self-awareness . Hartmann suggests that this dormancy may explain why people remember better in their dreams than they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories are unusually accessible . But once awake , some 95 percent of dreams vanish . Hobson speculates that 's because dreams are stored temporarily in short-term memory , but the chemicals necessary to " print " them in long-term memory are serotonin and norepinephrine , which are shut off during the dream . Scientists ' new respect for dreams has pushed them to ask what these dramas are for . Finding an answer is problematic because it is so difficult to tease apart the function of REM from the function of dreams themselves . The sleep of newborns has twice as much REM time as that of 5-year-olds ; might REM sleep help the brain develop ? In fact , learning a new , challenging skill induces heightened REM activity , and people deprived of REM sleep have trouble recalling things . Some studies show that the more people dream the better they remember a bedtime story . Or perhaps REM is basically restorative : since some neurons are dormant during REM sleep , Tufts 's Hartmann says , REM 's function may be to rejuvenate these systems . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams prepare us for the challenges of the new day by " revving our cerebral motor , " says Hobson . Walt Whitman cursed the astronomer for his dispassionate analysis of the stars , for such dry wisdom ruined the joy he felt in the twinkling sky . For those who regard dreams with mystic adoration , explaining them as products of biochemistry is just as insulting . But even hardheaded researchers retain a sense of wonder at these enigmatic missives of the night . Whatever science discovers , dreams will remain among the most beguiling children of the mind .
