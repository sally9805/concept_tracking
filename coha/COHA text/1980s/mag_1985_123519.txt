Maybe what they were saying about Gene Mauch mellowing was true after all , for there he was , stretched beneath the afternoon sun wearing nothing but his undershorts and looking for all the world , his unconventional attire aside , like some middle-aged layabout catching a few rays at Malibu . Could this inert sunbather possibly be the same human dynamo whose intensity has always been so palpable that , according to one of his former pitchers , Bruce Kison , you did n't have to see him staring at you , " You could feel it on your back " ? // Well , appearances can be deceiving . Mauch was n't on any beach ; he was just outside the visitors ' dugout down the first base line at Baltimore 's Memorial Stadium . And he was n't sunbathing ; he was sweating . " I love to sweat , " he explained . " I love the feel of it . " It was a good day for sweating  --  99 and air so thick you could see it . And Mauch was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His statistical charts were at his side , and he was conjuring up ways for his California Angels to clobber the Orioles that night . // Mauch 's busy manager 's mind is never ever at rest , for that matter . It is a beehive aswarm with statistics and stratagems , situations and alternatives . Charlie Metro , an old baseball hand , once said of him , " You can outpersonnel Gene Mauch , but there 's no way you can out-maneuver or outslick him . " Or outwork him . Mauch was out there sweating and thinking in the ball park on that brutally hot September day a full seven hours before the game was to begin . That 's normal for him . Anything short of an 11-hour workday seven days a week is considered criminal indolence . His wife , Nina Lee , once said of him , " There 's no doubt in my mind that if Gene were single , he 'd sleep at the park . He 'd move in , in fact , and live there the year round . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , Mauch is flogging an undermanned and overmatched team to exceed itself in a pennant race . " He 's doing it with mirrors . " even the reporters covering the team say . The Angels were picked by preseason forecasters to finish no higher than fourth in the American League West . This very magazine rated them 24th among the 26 major league teams . But with Mauch shuffling the aged and infirm , the beardless and the incompetent , in and out of his constantly fluctuating lineup  --  145 different orders in 155 games  --  the Angels were poised at the top of the AL West with a week to go . // The Angels are dead last in the American League in hitting . They will finish the season without a top 10 hitter , a 100-RBI man , or a 20-game winner . But they will shine in two areas their cerebral manager swears by , defense ( the Angels are second in the AL in fielding ) and one-run victories ( they are 29 and 13 ) . They 're also good at coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have blown them out by scoring 10 or more runs . Nine times the Angels have come back the next day to win . " The job he 's done keeping that team in first place is just unbelievable , " says infielder-DH Roy Smalley III of the Minnesota Twins , who is Mauch 's nephew and hardly an unbiased observer but nevertheless reflects sentiments heard around the league , even on Mauch 's own team . // Mauch is considered even by his severest critics to be probably the game 's most astute and daring tactician , a manager who will try anything anytime and yet never without some contemplation of the consequences . Against Baltimore last month he used five infielders and two outfielders in a bases-loaded , no-out ninth-inning situation . The gamble failed when the Orioles ' Mike Young drilled the game-winning hit past the first baseman . But there is no question that Mauch , who never joins the finicky multitudes that second-guess him , will try it again if the circumstances arise . " It takes a good manager and a gutsy manager to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl Weaver afterward. // For the most part , Mauch 's gambits and ploys , conventional and off-the-wall , have been successful this year . " Just look at the one-run games , " says his former general manager , Buzzy Bavasi , now retired . " Walter Alston always said that a good manager wins the one-run games . " Still , it is outside the white lines where Mauch , who has never been known to be especially chummy with his players , seems to have found himself . The old Mauch could be a chilly presence . // " You 'd walk by him in the hotel lobby and he would n't even look at you , let alone say hello , " says Cleveland Indians manager Pat Corrales , who caught for Mauch when he managed the Phillies in the ' 60s . " He was from the old school , a real hardnose . He could intimidate you without ever opening his mouth . " Mauch is , by all accounts , a changed man . After a two-year hiatus and a crushing personal trauma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassionate and , yes , mellow human being  --  although no one would hazard suggesting that to his face . // " We have superstars on this team who are n't great players anymore , " says Reggie Jackson , who calls Mauch the Prime Minister instead of the customary Little General because " it has more class . " Mauch let Jackson , a DH the past few seasons , play in the outfield for much of the early season , and Jackson feels it rejuvenated his career . " Gene respects his stars , " he says . " I know I 've been handled right . My ego has changed , but I 've still got one , and he 's recognized that . I think since he 's come back he 's better able to see the big picture . " // " He 's the best prepared of all the managers I 've played for , " says Doug DeCinces , who played for Weaver in Baltimore . " Playing against him you get a whole different view of him . You see him in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach is positive , so much so that I feel like I 'm letting him down when I ca n't play or when I have n't played well . " // " He 's the perfect manager , " says Jackson . " He communicates , he disciplines , he fires up young players , he fires up stars . No player beats him to the ball park . He 's all baseball . He 's the perfect manager . Except he has n't won . " // Ay , there 's the rub . Most of Mauch 's career numbers are on the debit side of the ledger . " If it 's true you learn from adversity , " Mauch once told Nina Lee , " then I must be the smartest sumbitch in the whole world . " He holds the major league record for the most consecutive seasons without a championship  --  23 . His 1961 Phillies set a modern major league record for losses in a row with 23 , and though he is eighth on the alltime list in games managed ( 3,610 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fourth in games lost ( 1,876 ) . These milestones have been reached with a succession of teams that were barely major league . // In his first big league job he took over a Phillies team in 1960 that had finished last the previous two seasons and had such unpromising prospects that Mauch 's immediate predecessor , Eddie Sawyer , quit after the Opening Day loss , informing owner Bob Carpenter , " I 'm 49 years old and I want to make 50 . " Mauch managed the Phillies longer  --  from April of ' 60 to almost the middle of the 1968 season  --  than anyone in the modern era , and he returned the franchise to a measure of respectability . He moved directly from that reclamation project to an expansion team , the Expos , that was fully as dreadful as any he had had in Philly . By the time he departed , after the ' 75 season , the Expos were close to .500. // In 1976 he pressed on to Minnesota , timing his arrival with owner Calvin Griffith 's unhappy realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys in the modern world of free-agent baseball and wildly escalating salaries . Mauch presided over the precipitous descent of the Griffith enterprise , exercising all his wiles to cushion the fall . His ' 77 team , picked as an also-ran , led the American League West for 51 days and was in contention until September , when pitching weaknesses were finally exposed , and it lost 18 of 27 games to finish fourth , 7 games behind Kansas City . Mauch stayed in Minnesota , through not much thick and increasing thin , through 125 games of the ' 80 season . // Then it was on to California and an owner , Gene Autry , who , unlike Griffith , was willing to spend prodigiously , but often for stars who either succumbed immediately to crippling infirmities or established beyond dissent that they had passed their primes . And yet with all this travail , Mauch won Manager of the Year awards in 1962 , ' 64 and ' 73. // He was widely and justifiably acclaimed for making silk purses out of sows ' ears . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at least two demoralizing occasions he took mostly undeserving teams to the brink of success , and then when they failed at last , it was he who took the rap for their downfall . // Mauch is an unnerving man to talk with because he does not immediately respond to questions , no matter how inoffensive they may seem . A grim silence may well follow " How are you ? " Then , just when you surmise that he has rejected your inquiry as the prattling of an imbecile and are prepared sheepishly to pursue a different conversational avenue , the words cascade from him . It is n't that he has ignored what has been said , it 's just that he has actually been thinking about it . Imagine that . Here 's someone who actually thinks before he speaks . Extraordinary ! " He 's probably never made a move in his life that he has n't thought out , " says his sister , Jolene , who 's married to Mauch 's former Cubs roommate of years ago , Roy Smalley Jr . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both his brother-in-law and his nephew . ) " Gene works things out , " says Jolene , who lives in Manhattan Beach , Calif . " There 's always a Plan B. When he does n't answer , he 's sorting out which answer to give . " // After a particularly tough loss to Kansas City last month , Mauch was asked by a courageous reporter if he thought his young pitchers , who had thrown so well early in the season , were now all going sour at once . The reporter was armed for the death rays that Mauch 's steel gray eyes discharge to penetrate human flesh . There was , of course , no immediate answer . Then , after an excruciating interval , Mauch replied mildly , " I 'm still thinking about this game , so that 's a little complicated for me to answer right now . It 's not that your question does n't deserve an answer , it 's just that I 'm not up to it tonight . " Talk about mellow . // And so , under that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been the cause of so much hurt has also been fun for him . Now there 's a question deserving of a double whammy from those twin grays . Pause . The lighting of a Marlboro . A hand through the short-cropped silver hair . A puff of smoke . The application of clogs to bare feet . A slow unfolding from the chair he has set up alongside the dugout . A stretch . The pack of Marlboros dropped contemplatively into the undershorts . A quick descent of the dugout steps . And then , when all seems lost : " The most fun was the first 150 games of ' 64 . That little team could flat play . Nobody thought we had a chance to win , but for the first 150 , nobody played better than those kids . We did n't have great talent , but we had great execution . In all my years , I do n't think I 've ever seen anyone play both sides of the game hitting and fielding as well as Doug DeCinces did in ' 82 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had n't screwed it up , he 'd have had the MVP locked up . You know , they 've always said I pitched Bunning and Short too much at the end . Let them have their fun with that version . I 've never told anyone what I thought happened , and I never will . The funny thing is , some people seem to think the only year I managed was 1964. " // The ' 64 Phillies , a ragtag bunch with two good pitchers in Jim Bunning ( 19-8 ) and Chris Short ( 17-9 ) , a hot Callison ( 31 homers , 104 RBIs ) , a rookie flash , Richie ( later Dick ) Allen , and not much else , had won 90 of those first 150 games and were 6 games ahead in the National League pennant race with 12 games left to play at a time when there were no divisions and no playoffs to clutter things up . They had been picked to finish no higher than fifth , and here they were , Whiz Kids reborn , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look to be a Cakewalk , and Mauch knew it . Frank Thomas , acquired to provide righthanded power in August , had carried the team over a 32-game stretch , driving in 26 runs . But on Sept. 8 , he jammed a thumb and was out for the rest of the year . Starters Dennis Bennett and Ray Culp had sore arms . The bullpen , anchored by Jack Baldschun , was shaky . Mauch decided that if he was going to hold on , he had better stick with his aces , Bunning and Short , pitching on short rest . Actually , says Toronto pitching coach Al Widmar , the Phillies ' pitching coach at the time , " it was their idea . Bunning and Short came to him and told him that 's what they wanted to do . " // With the pennant there for the taking , Mauch 's Phillies lost 10 in a row and dropped out of first . They won their last two against Cincinnati and tied the Reds for second , a game behind the Cardinals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to that time , and Mauch beat out Johnny Keane of the winning Cardinals for Manager of the Year . His contract was extended . The terrible collapse haunts him still . He has heard the names , Bunning and Short , as often , presumably , as another failed leader has heard those of Ehrlichman and Haldeman . He managed the Phillies until 1968 , feuding along the way with stars Callison and Allen , both of whom he had nurtured in their baseball infancy . When it came to a showdown with the eccentric and rebellious Allen , Mauch was sent packing , 55 games into the ' 68 season . // Counting this year , Mauch says he has had three legitimate chances to win it all . His second chance came in 1982 , when he took an Angel team that had finished fifth in the AL West the year before to a division championship . The Angels of ' 82 , already graying at the temples , had some power in Jackson , DeCinces and Don Baylor . The starting pitching , only fair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . The bullpen was weak , its closer being a rookie , Luis Sanchez . Still , the Angels swept the first two games of the playoffs with Milwaukee 's Brew Crew behind John and Kison . The pennant seemed virtually assured since no team in either league had lost the first two games and come back to win the playoffs . The demons that dog Mauch 's footsteps would change all that . The Brewers took the third game at home 5-3 , and Mauch came back with his ace , John . But John , 39 and unaccustomed to pitching with three days ' rest , was bombed as the Brewers evened the series with a 9-5 win . // In the fifth and final game , the Angels were leading 3-2 when Milwaukee loaded the bases with two out in the seventh . Sanchez , a righthander , was the Angels ' pitcher , but a lefthander , Andy Hassler , had been warming up in the bullpen . The percentages called for Mauch to bring Hassler in to face the next hitter , Cecil Cooper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ace . Cooper lined a single to left that drove home the tying and winning runs . Mauch had missed the brass ring again . Bunning and Short ! // Mauch was roundly criticized for starting John and leaving Sanchez in too long . His players disagreed . " Hell , even if you give him one loss , we still lost the other two , did n't we ? " said Jackson . " The whole thing was so unnecessary , " said DeCinces . " The blame did n't lie with him at all . We had a lot of players who just did n't have a good series . When he did n't come back for the next season , a lot of us felt bad . " // As in ' 64 , Mauch felt no need to justify his moves . But others have . Says Roy Smalley III : " Gene had seen both pitchers Sanchez and Hassler all year . Sanchez was the stopper . With Hassler , if you make him throw strikes , he 's not as tough because his strength is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Gene did n't have that kind of leeway , because Cooper does n't swing at bad balls , and he could n't put him on base without walking a run in . So Cooper gets the hit . You can second-guess , but Gene believed with all his heart he was right . " // There was perhaps even more disappointment in the front office over the Milwaukee calamity than there was on the field . Autry , who had just turned 75 , saw this team as his best and perhaps last chance for a champion . He is a kindly man , but the appalling defeats left him angry and querulous . When asked if Mauch was returning as manager in ' 83 , he gave no reply . Bavasi , who had built the team for Autry , was even more devastated by the loss than he was by that most famous of all playoff games , in 1951 , when he was the Dodgers ' general manager . " To me that was a bigger disappointment than Bobby Thomson , " he says , rehashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Dodgers at least had won the pennant before . We had n't , and we had it right in our hands . We were all unhappy about it , but I can assure you not one of us said one word of criticism about the way the series was managed . In retrospect , I think the mistake we made was in not telling Gene right away that we did n't think it was his fault . But then it was our understanding that Gene would be back for another year . When we offered him a contract , he turned it down . He just said he 'd like to get away for a while . " // So Mauch , hurt , angry , disillusioned , seemingly abandoned , walked away from baseball . He was going back to the home he and Nina Lee had on the ninth hole of the Sunrise Country Club in Rancho Mirage , near Palm Springs . He would play golf and bridge and spend more time with the wife he loved so dearly and who had been so patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had weathered disappointment before . He was worried about not caring anymore . Within a short time , he would cease to care about anything in the world , for there was nothing in his long experience to prepare him for what would happen next . It would nearly finish him . // Gene William Mauch was born Nov. 18 , 1925 in Salina , Kans. , where his father , George , ran a profitable bakery business until the Depression wiped him out . " He went from being a very successful man at age 26 to where he did n't have anything , " Mauch recalls . " And he still had to put bread on the table for my mother , my sister and me . " At first , George Mauch worked as a roughneck in the oil fields of central Kansas . " We lived in all those little towns , " says Mauch . " Concordia , Hays , Dodge City , Schoen-chen , Ellis , Russell , Jetmore . Jetmore had 914 people , 910 when we left . " On one night shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mauch 's hands were so frozen to the rig that he had to be pried loose by his fellow workers . // In the summer , Gene and Jolene walked to school " carrying bologna sandwiches in brown paper sacks through dust so thick you could n't see the sidewalk . " In the winter they plodded through snow . One day , when Gene was 12 and his sister nine , they took a forbidden shortcut home on the banks of the Smoky Hill River in Salina . Jolene slipped and fell through the ice into the freezing water . Gene jumped in after her and struggled to get her ashore . The two made it to the bank and then slipped back in again . " We were like frogs climbing out of a well  --  we 'd go three forward and two back . " After what seemed like hours , they finally clambered to safety , but the experience remains riveting to Mauch . " We were nine and 12 , and I thought that was as far as we were going to get . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolene . " He kept calling me that in the water . He was much more frightened than I , because this was his little sister and he was responsible . He was always responsible . I always felt I had three parents  --  my mother , my father and Gene . My brother was and is a unique personality . He intends to be good . " // It was n't long after this that George Mauch decided to move the family to California . He went first , living by his wits in Los Angeles as a " car chiseler , " someone who buys cars from one party and sells them to another for a profit . Eventually , before his death at 49 , he would become general manager of an auto dealership . After several months in L.A. , George sent for his wife , Mamie , and Gene and Jolene . The children were anxious to move . " What the hell , " says Gene , " I was never in one town long enough to become attached to anything . Besides , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . " // His father had an extra motive for moving the family west : Gene had shown great promise as an athlete , and George wanted to give him every chance to play . At 13 , the boy was cocky , aggressive and smart , " a hot ticket , " as he describes his young self . He was good at all sports and he was student body president of Berendo Junior High School . It was there he met Nina Lee Taylor , a lively girl who was then , and would remain for the rest of her life , pretty as a picture . They became sweethearts and stayed that way . Seven years after they met , in December of 1945 , they were married . // Mauch decided to go to Fremont High in L.A. , the best baseball school in town . It was outside his district , but he was willing to travel the 40 minutes crosstown on the S streetcar to play with some of the hottest athletes in Southern California . Gene wanted the action . He is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notre Dame alum is of his . He can recite the names of virtually every Fremont graduate who has played major league baseball , beginning with his first idol , Bobby Doerr , the brilliant Red Sox second baseman . He played all sports at Fremont and was president of the student council . He was a handsome , well-built youngster , 5 ' 10 " and wiry , and the Fremont coeds took notice . But Nina Lee was his girl . // His American Legion team , Sunrise Post of L.A. , won the national championship in ' 42 , whipping along the way Stockham Post of St. Louis , sparked by a hard-hitting outfielder named Lawrence Berra , who would be called Yogi . Mauch 's nickname was Skippy or , prophetically . Skipper . Eight players from that championship Legion team signed major league contracts , and Mauch was one of them . Branch Rickey signed him up personally for the Dodgers in 1943 and sent him to the Durham , N.C. farm club in the Piedmont League . He was barely 17 . His roommate there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18-year-old fireballer from Omaha , Rex Barney . " Gene was a smart player even then , " recalls Barney , now the Orioles ' public address voice . " He was very aggressive and scrappy , a Stanky type . He 'd fight at the drop of a hat , but he always had Nina Lee , his girlfriend back home , to calm him down . I remember Mr. Rickey liked him because he had brains and desire . " // In 1944 Mauch , at 18 , was to be the Dodgers ' shortstop . It was a war year , and Pee Wee Reese , the once and future shortstop , was in the Navy . Mauch took the assignment in stride . " Nothing overwhelmed me then . I 'd never done anything but good . I had it all figured out . But what did I know ? " Working out with manager Leo Durocher in spring training , he fired a double-play ball to Leo , playing second , and broke his right thumb . It seemed an unpromising start . Not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . It was out of gratitude . He did n't want to play anymore , and I gave him the perfect excuse . " // Mauch played only five games for the Dodgers that year before being sent to Montreal . He was in the Air Corps in ' 44 and ' 45 , and for the next 14 years he bounced back and forth between the minors and six major league teams . He was a Stanky type all right , fearless and canny , but he lacked even that prototype 's minimal talent . // Typically , Mauch was harder on himself than any manager , other than Mauch , could ever be . Del Crandall , who played with him on the Braves , recalls a furious Mauch snatching up a razor in the clubhouse after a game in which he had stranded five or six base runners . " I did n't know what he was going to do , " says Crandall . " Well , he did n't cut his throat , but he did dry-shave . Blood was coming down his cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Mauch may well have been more dangerous with a razor than a bat . In 304 major league games , he averaged .239 . But he did not go unnoticed . Billy Southworth , his manager with the Braves in 1950 , was the first to tell him he was managerial material . " Just one word of advice , Skip , " he told Mauch , " do n't ever fall in love with your ballplayers. " // Mauch did manage the Atlanta Crackers in the Southern Association in 1953 to a third-place finish , but it was a debilitating , if instructive , experience . He was only 27 and still playing , and he fought with everyone in the league  --  umpires , opposing players , his own players . The strain was too much . He went from 173 to 153 pounds , and he learned that " you ca n't tell your players off if they 're better than you . " When he finally got his chance to manage again , in 1958 , he was ready . He took the Triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International League champion two years in a row . And in 1960 he finally got his break , if you can call it that , when an old friend from his Braves days , Phillies general manager John Quinn , summoned him to take over for poor Sawyer . // For all of the frustration he has endured , Mauch has had one helluva lot of fun at the helm . With the Phillies he once transposed his first-and third-base coaches , explaining afterward , " Everything was so fouled up I thought I must 've had my coaches in the wrong place . " Twice he has overturned postgame food tables after tough losses , prompting Baylor to inquire of him on his first day with the Angels , " Will the food be served on the floor ? " He has belabored his office door with a fungo bat , challenged Steve Carlton to a fight , been a merciless bench jockey , provoked brawls and baited umps with the worst of them . // If anything , Mauch 's posturing and apparently superior attitude may have worked against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating his teams . Joe Nuxhall , the old Reds pitcher , once said of Mauch : " I especially like to beat that little so-and-so . Do you see him showboating out there ? He is n't even saying anything to the umpires , but he 's still standing there . And I do n't like the things he says . Who does he think he is ? " // Mauch is unmoved by such vituperative outbursts from the opposition . He once knocked a ball out of an opposing catcher 's mitt after that player had charged into his dugout to make the catch . He was , it develops , within the rules in doing so . He has made enemies of his players , but most respect him and some love him . Butch Wynegar , his catcher at Minnesota , called Mauch aside after he learned the manager was leaving , to say thanks and goodby . He cried so hard he could n't utter a word . Mauch was deeply touched . Like all " tough guys , " he 's terrified of the sentimentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister laughingly calls him " mid-Victorian " in his morality . And he would learn a lesson about himself . // " My parents were ... well ... just like two people going steady , " says Leanne Epling , now 35 , sitting in the living room of her farmhouse outside Sacramento . " In all my years of growing up , I never heard them really upset with each other . Oh , he would get upset when Mom called him cute . ' I 'm not cute ! ' he 'd shout . But he was  --  and is  --  such a handsome man . He was always a changed person when he got home from the ball park . We did n't do a lot of things outside the house because he just liked being with the two of us , although we did see a lot of Jolene 's family . Big Roy would play the ukulele and we 'd all sing together . We had good times together . " // " Nina Lee was my idol , " says Jolene . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'd ruin my brother 's reputation if I told you how tender and caring he is. " // Not long after Mauch left the Angels , Nina Lee fell ill . She seemed to recover , but then on April 6 , 1983 , the family was informed that she had a melanoma , a usually fatal form of cancer . She told her husband that she was sorry because she knew how hard this was going to be on him . Four months later she died , five months before what would have been the couple 's 38th wedding anniversary . Mauch had known it was coming , but he could n't control his response . " Everything else in his life had been planned , " said his daughter . " This was suddenly humbling . Now nothing mattered to him . Everything he had worked for seemed meaningless . He was a wreck . " // " He 'd never tell you it was a depression , because he hates words like that , but that 's what it was , " says his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never dreamed he 'd be left alone . I did n't know if he 'd ever come back from it . I remember thinking he 'll die a bitter old man . He kept asking , ' Why ? ' Why should this happen to someone who was so good ? Well , I told him I 'd always been a good girl , and I lost a daughter when she was only eight . I told him he was negating everything that Nina Lee lived for . I told him she wanted him to continue to be the man she loved . " Jolene smiles sadly . " Well , if there 's one characteristic that typifies my brother it 's his resiliency . It was a matter of time . " // In mid-September of ' 83 , Bavasi asked Mauch to rejoin the Angels as director of player personnel , a job he had originally held in 1981 before taking over as manager for the first time . It 's a position Mauch had always considered a sinecure , a way of " stealing money . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the house , but he found it impossible under the circumstances to become even remotely involved with the team . He had lost the will to care about anything . // Mauch commuted to the ball park in 1984 from Rancho Mirage , an hour and 40 minutes away . He would take his seat in the rear of the press box and sit there silently through a game , a forbidding , gloomy , unapproachable presence . But toward the end of that season , his love of baseball began to tug at his grief . It was a gentle pull at first , but with the Angels in the pennant race again he felt a stirring inside , a rekindling of old fires . // The Angels were playing in Kansas City the last week of the ' 84 season , and Mauch surprisingly made the trip with the team . The Angels still had a mathematical shot at the division title , so the games were critical . It was also understood in the front office at that time that manager John McNamara did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat in the rear of the press box . As always , he was left to himself . But something was happening to him . Late in a close game . Willie Wilson hit a sharp ground ball to second baseman Bobby Grich . Rod Carew was late covering first , so Grich held up his throw for an agonizing moment as Wilson , one of the game 's swiftest runners , sped down the line . Then , from the rear of the press box there came a mighty roar , a sound familiar to any who had been with this team for a while . " Throw the goddamned ball ! " There was a surging urgency to that cry . It was compelling . Heads turned in astonishment to where Mauch , silent these many months , was sitting . But he was already on his way to the door . He was n't going anywhere . He was coming back . " A man , " he says , " has to care . Or he 's nothing . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
