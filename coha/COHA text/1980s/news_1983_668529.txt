FAIR OAKS , Calif. - It was then , and is still , a rather incredible story . Just imagine . A half-Indian boy , orphaned at 12 , rises from wretched reservation poverty , has moderate success as a college distance runner , becomes discouraged , joins the Marines , somehow makes the US Olympic team - and wins a gold medal at the Olympic Games . If someone really did that , they would make a movie about his life . It would be track and field ' s " Rocky . " Well , it took nearly 20 years , but they really are making a movie about Billy Mills . So far , the title is " Running Brave , " and the film is to be released sometime before the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics . Mills is 44 and 25 pounds over his weight when he won the 10,000 meters at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo . Later this year , he will be a grandfather . He is a successful insurance agent in Sacramento , Calif. , and lives with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A married daughter , Christy , 20 , lives in Anchorage , Alaska . Lisa , 15 , is a track star at Bella Vista High School ( 5:22 in the mile ) and Billie-Joanne ( B.J. ) , 12 , is a soccer player and piano player . " My daughters and their friends all know I won a gold medal at the Olympics , but it ' s kind of insignificant to them , " Mills told an interviewer . " To them , it was a long time ago . But they like showing new friends the gold medal , and they ' ve really banged it up over the years . " It took Mills 15 minutes to find the medal to show it to a visitor recently . And it is banged up . Its silk ribbon is torn off and the metal is dented . And , the hinges are broken on the black onyx case in which he keeps it . Indeed , it was a long time ago . Mills still runs , with his wife . " Pat and I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we run very slowly , " he said , grinning . " It ' s a 28-mile trail and we do six slow miles at the most . " Six miles . That is an important distance for Mills , one he used to erase the " fluke " label after he won at Tokyo . In the six-mile , at the AAU championships in San Diego ' s Balboa Stadium in June 1965 , Mills beat Gerry Lindgren in a photo finish in 27:11.6 , a world record . " I really needed that world record , " Mills said . " In a way , it was more important than the gold medal . The world record gave me peace of mind . It was a real growth period in my life . The gold medal was considered a fluke by some people . So my world record was my way of saying to them : Any questions ? ' " A lot of people never believed this , but I thought I had a good chance all along to win in Tokyo . I knew this much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last lap , I ' d win . " The last lap was one of the Olympics ' great finishes . Clarke , Gammoudi andMills were together when they rang the bell , Clarke ahead by a stride . With 350 yards to go , Clarke knocked Mills into the third lane trying to emergefrom being boxed in . Mills lost five yards , but made it up quickly . On the last curve , Gammoudi tried to steal the race by bursting between Clarke andMills , nearly knocking Mills down . But it was Clarke who regained the lead . All three were together in the final straight , and then Mills pulled the trigger . His devastating sprint caught both with 50 meters left . He breasted the tape exultantly , arms raised . Mills ' time was 28:24.4 , an Olympic record ; Gammoudi 28:24.8 , Clarke 28:25.8 . Mills is still the only American to win an Olympic 10,000 . He is the only American to finish higher than fifth since 1912 . Calling him an unknown before that day considerably understates the case . Afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d worried about Mills before the race , he snapped : " Worried about him ? I never heard of him . " Track &; Field News , in its pre-Olympic issue , had six experts handicap every race . Not one had Mills even finishing sixth . Small wonder . Mills did most of his training on the back roads and jeep trails of Camp Pendleton , running with another Marine , marathoner Alex Breckenridge . Mills had left Kansas University in 1962 with modest achievements : 4:11 in the mile , 9:03 in the two-mile . " I ' d never done any quality distance training until I met Alex at Camp Pendleton , " he said . " We used to run a 20-mile coursefrom Area 13 to the Main Gate and back . And we had a 34-mile course , back in the hills . That ' s where I toughened myself for distance running . " Every day on those runs I imagined Ron Clarke right on my shoulder . Every day I beat him . So I went to Tokyo thinking like a winner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had run a total of five 10,000- meter races . In two , he did not break a half-hour . He also made the US marathon team that year and finished ninth in Tokyo , despite not having run a marathon until the 1964 Olympic Trials . " Something like that can ' t happen in the Olympics anymore , " Mills said . " It ' s like looking back to the days before starting blocks . All the distance runners in the L.A. Olympics will be proven , known people . It ' s so competitive now . In ' 64 , I was one of a handful of Americans who ' d ever broken 14 minutes for 5000 meters . " In 1982 alone , according to Track &; Field News , 56 Americans ran 5000meters faster than 13:41 . How big of an upset was it ? An Associated Press poll of sportswriters and broadcasters in late 1964 gave Mills the Upset of the Year award , nosing out the University of Southern California football team ' s 20-17 victory against Notre Dame , and Cassius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some anguish . Today , he seems happy and secure with a loving family in a comfortable , lushly landscaped suburban home . There is a pool in the back . But every day , a little bit of Billy Mills dies . One recent afternoon , daughter Lisa entertained a boyfriend on the pool deck . His wife , Pat , left to shop . In the living room , B.J. listened intently as her father described for a reporter the old days at the Pine Ridge , S.D. , Oglala Sioux reservation . Mills , the son of part Indians , grew up in a locked-in world of alcoholism and despair . " You have to fully understand what happened to American Indians over the past 150 years to understand their problems today , " he said . " Not only was an entire way of life destroyed when Indians were put on reservations , but an entire philosophy of living was destroyed . " So I grew up in a no-philosophy world . No one I knew had goals , a reason for living . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . It was living in a vacuum . In a world like that , young people can ' t recognize an opportunity when they see one . " Unemployment at Pine Ridge is anywhere between 50 percent and 80 percent . I ' ve gone back to visit every year since I left the reservation , since the early 1960s , and I still see a tremendous consumption of alcohol . " The hardest thing I had to do when I began training to be a runner was to say no to my friends , my peer group , when socializing ' meant going out and drinking . A lot of drinking . So when I wouldn ' t socialize on their terms , I pulled away . I went away to school ( Kansas University ) , track became my world , and I married Pat , a non-Indian . " So , when I return to Pine Ridge for visits , people are friendly to me . But I ' m different . Sure , I won a gold medal at the Olympics . But I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Much of what I ' ve seen hurts , very much . In a six-year period beginning in 1974 , of less than 600 young people who entered high school at Pine Ridge , 42 died of alcohol or drug-related causes . " I was one of the first from Pine Ridge to graduate from college . " Mills is seven-sixteenths Oglala Sioux . In 1965 , tribal leaders presented him with their own gold medal , a ring made of Black Hills gold . He has worn it ever since . In 1966 , a Pine Ridge school gymnasium was named for him . He speaks to Indian youth groups these days , part of his Billy Mills Indian Youth Leadership Program . He imparts a message of confidence and goals . He encourages young Indians to set their own goals , not what others expect of them . " I see a spark in young Indian people , today . Every time I return to Pine Ridge , I see more personal development in young people . I didn ' t see it in the past . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some - not a lot - are entering the health fields . I see a few Indian doctors , dentists , nurses . " I see a re-identification in young Lakota people . Lakota is what Sioux call themselves . Sioux is a French word . " Mills , from 1971-74 , was an administrator in the Bureau of Indian Affairs , specializing in physical-education programs . An older brother , Sidney , now 55 , was an undersecretary of the interior for Indian affairs in the Carter administration . Briefly , Mills considered a political career in South Dakota . His ties to Pine Ridge continued when , in his insurance business , he began selling group health and disability insurance plans to Indians . Today , he estimates , 30 percent of his insurance business is Indian-related . In fact , the Ira Englander-produced film about Mills ' life was Indian- financed . Mills : " We went to the Ermineskin Band ( they ' re " bands , " not " tribes " in Canada ) in Alberta and asked if they ' d be interested in investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From there , things happened like that ( Mills snapped his fingers ) . " Robby Benson portrays me in the film , and some Indian people let it be known they were unhappy a non-Indian portrayed me . It so happens every other Indian role went to Indian actors . But we couldn ' t find one who looked like me . Benson does , right down to the crewcut I wore then . " We filmed it all in Alberta . The Olympics scenes were done at the Edmonton football stadium , during a football game , so we ' d have lots of people in the stands . " Twenty years after the fact , Billy Mills will at last earn something besides a medal and lifetime running injuries for pulling off one of the Olympics ' great upsets . " If the worst happens , if the movie opens and closes , then becomes a TV movie of the week , Pat and I could earn a million to a million and a half , " he said . " But it ' s a quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it will do well . " Mills sounds like an old NFL running back when he talks about what running did to his body . " I have to wear these now , " he said , pulling orthopedic pads from his shoes . I ' ve got bursitis in both heels . Some mornings , I can ' t walk at all . There isn ' t a day in my life when I don ' t walk with pain . " I ' ve got constant hamstring and lower-back problems from those years of running . I ' ve got a calf-muscle tear on my left leg that never did heal properly . " During two hours of talking about running , the Olympics , and Indians , the theme was the same : goals . " Every time I meet with Indian youth groups I talk about the same thing - goals , " he said . " I often talk about Ron Clarke as an example . He trained as hard as I did , up to 120 miles a week for years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He failed . But he didn ' t lose the goal . I assumed he would retire after Tokyo but when I asked him after the race what his plans were , he said : I ' m going to start all over and the next time we race , Billy , you ' d better be ready . ' " Well , we raced five more times - never at 10,000 meters , though - and he beat me every time . And do you know what he did right after the ' 64 Olympics ? He went to Europe and broke 12 world records in six weeks . "
