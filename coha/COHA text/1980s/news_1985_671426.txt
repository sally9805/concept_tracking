Legislatures in five states , including New York and New Jersey , have approved mandatory use of seat belts . If enough follow suit , proponents of the air bag , which inflates upon impact in a collision to protect riders , fear the device will never achieve widespread use. // Mrs. Dole issued an order July 11 requiring all new automobiles to be equipped with passive restraints , such as air bags or seat belts that automatically snap on when the door is closed . However , the requirement would be waived if states representing two-thirds of the United States population enacted mandatory laws on seat belt use by April 1 , 1989. // The lobbying has included a talk by the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation , Lee A. Iacocca , a staunch opponent of air bags , with Gov . James R. Thompson of Illinois at Chrysler headquarters in Highland Park , Mich . <> <> Chrysler Chief ' s ' Pitch ' // Governor Thompson , who later signed a seat belt law , said Mr. Iacocca had made " a very strong pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would forestall the mandatory use of air bags , which he claims are not all they are cracked up to be and which he also claims are virtually useless without using seat belts as well. " // Mrs. Dole ' s decision to press for seat belt laws was applauded by automobile manufacturers and their allies , which maintain that air bags represent an unproved and expensive technology . It was criticized by many insurance companies and consumer organizations , which contend that air bags would save far more lives than seat belts. // Besides sending representatives to lobby Illinois legislators , Chrysler and the General Motors Corporation hired a former Illinois Secretary of State and a former majority leader of the State House . " The big heaters were all over this one , " a legislator said . " We had Chrysler , Ford , G.M. We had banks they run their financing through . They were all working on us . I haven ' t seen a bill this heavily lobbied in a long time . " <> <> G.M. Denies Assertions // The lobbying has gotten so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate its multibillion-dollar plant for the Saturn car has become intertwined . Lobbyists who oppose the mandatory seat belt laws have asserted that General Motors has told states they will not be considered for the plant unless they pass such a measure. // General Motors has strongly denied the allegation . " It is absolutely ridiculous , " said Donald Postma , a General Motors spokesman . " There is no truth to it . We don ' t do business that way. " // But the assertion was repeated at a Congressional hearing last week by Senator John C. Danforth , Republican of Missouri , a strong supporter of the air bag . He said Missouri legislators , who tonight passed a bill that require use of seat belts in the state , had told him G.M. had spread the word. // There are many ironies in the issue , not the least being the position of G.M. , which developed the air bag technology more than 10 years ago but has since abandoned it. // The Ford Motor Company has long opposed mandatory air bags but , alone among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags available to fleet purchasers. // " We have felt that there are many questions that have to be answered with so-called passive restraints and that one way is to get them on the road , " said John Manikas , a Ford spokesman . <> <> Extra Cost of $815 // Ford has agreed to sell 5 , 000 cars with air bags to the General Services Administration , the Government ' s housekeeping arm , and 600 to Travelers Insurance . The extra cost is $815 for a driver-only air bag , but the ordinary motorist can not walk into a Ford showroom and buy a car with air bags. // To help make their case , the auto makers flew members of the California Legislature to Detroit to tour auto plants . While not every legislator has been given two days in the nation ' s auto capital , reports from several states point to a high level of lobbying. // In Connecticut , a new group , the Connecticut Safety Belt Coalition , received a $137 , 000 grant from Traffic Safety Now , which is financed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a seat belt law in that state. // It describes itself as a coalition of medical , business , government , industry and law-enforcement officials . Its vice president , Dr. Carl Dila , a Stamford neurosurgeon , said , " I work on too many traumatic head injuries that could have been avoided if the person only had been wearing a seat belt. " // Evidence From Texas // His argument is similar to that of Larry Todd , spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety , which is supporting a seat belt law being considered in that state. // " I rarely ever hear our state troopers unbuckling somebody that ' s dead , " Mr. Todd said , noting that more than 98 percent of Texas highway deaths involved people who were not using belts. // " The majority of drivers and passengers don ' t wear them , and yet they ' re there , " he said . " We ' re talking about a behavior modification that is a lot more difficult than a safety approach. " // Mr. Todd ' s view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use seat belts if required by law , even if the law was not widely enforced and even if the penalty was modest . They cite the experience in New York , where the nation ' s first law requiring seat belt use took effect Jan. 1 . Samplings cited by Federal officials indicate that 70 percent of front-seat occupants in New York now wear seat belts. // There are strong indications that there will be legislative action in Connecticut on seat belts this year , although Gov . William A. O ' Neill says he has not decided whether to endorse it. // Last October Mr. O ' Neill ordered all state employees driving state vehicles to wear seat belts. // " I wouldn ' t want to rely on an air bag popping up in front of me or not popping up in front of me if I knew I was going to crash , " Mr. O ' Neill said . " However , if you do have a seat belt on , you know it ' s there and it does work. " // Law Expected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the House Transportation Committee , said he expected some kind of seat belt law to be passed in his state this year. // The picture is less clear in California . Asked about his position , Gov . George Deukmejian said , " I ' m not prepared at this point to say that I would push for that kind of legislation , but I ' ll certainly be happy to consider it. " // In Virginia , a state with a conservative Legislature , the seat belt law was rejected by lawmakers who invoked the state ' s historic opposition to attempts by the Federal Government to impose its wishes. // In Maryland , a liberal state , the bill has been held up on the ground that a seat belt requirement would impinge personal freedom. // Some of the major proponents of air bags , such as the State Farm Mutual Insurance Company , the Allstate Insurance Company and Joan Claybrook , a highway safety official in the Carter Administration who is head of the consumer organization Public Citizen , are finding themselves in the difficult position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they acknowledge will save many lives. // 1983 Supreme Court Ruling // The air bag forces tasted victory when the Supreme Court ruled in 1983 that the Reagan Administration acted arbitrarily when it revoked a decision requiring the installation of air bags in new cars . But they now find themselves on the defensive. // Upwards of 40 states may consider seat belt legislation this year , and if enough states pass such requirements the air bag , which the insurance and consumer advocates consider much more effective , would be dealt a severe blow , they believe. // One insurance spokesman said his side ' s best hopes now appeared to be in either delaying state actions or in getting states to pass seat belt laws that did not comply with Mrs. Dole ' s requirements . Such an apparently noncomplying bill was passed with the support of the insurance industry in New Jersey , which set a $20 fine for people who do not buckle up . Mrs. Dole called for a minimum fine of $25. // A New Jersey legislator , Assemblyman Walter M. D. Kern Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many when he said it was naive to believe that the light penalty would lead to a requirement of passive restraints . " When the time comes , " he said , " they ' ll just change the requirements in Washington to include our law , and the manufacturers will be let off the hook. " //
