The two utilities , Cape Cod Gas Co. of South Yarmouth and Lowell Gas Co. , serve approximately 83,000 customers . Both are owned by the Colonial Gas Energy System of Lowell .

Among the manufacturers that would be affected are Wang Laboratories and Prince Macaroni of Lowell and Raytheon Corp . of Tewksbury . Lowell Gas serves 45,000 residential customers and 3000 other users in 11 municipalities : Lowell , Chelmsford , Tyngsboro , Tewksbury , Billerica , Dracut , Dunstable , North Reading , Pepperell , Westford and Wilmington . Cape Cod Gas serves 35,000 customers , 85 percent of them residential users , from Orleans to Hyannis . The conservation measures apply to Cape Cod Gas users as well .

Yesterday afternoon Joseph Fitzpatrick , the state ' s energy secretary , said he had arranged for Lowell Gas to receive two emergency gas shipments from other utilities . The shipments were not expected to arrive in time to relieve the Lowell firm ' s supply problems during the weekend or avert some shutdowns on Monday . An unspecified quantity of liquefied natural gas obtained from Brooklyn Union Gas Co. of New York was being hauled by trucks from Everett to Lowell . A transfer of 180,000 gallons of propane gas was also arranged with the Boston Gas Co. , the state ' s largest distributor of propane , which can be used as a natural gas substitute . Half the shipment was to be delivered to Lowell today and the other half tommorrow . There was no announcement of any emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was angered that officials of Lowell Gas and Cape Cod Gas had not contacted the state about their supply difficulties earlier last week . " When the state ' s largest distributor of propane gas has that gas available and Lowell Gas did not even ask them for it until today , " Fitzpatrick said , " I don ' t consider that adequate planning . " City Manager Joseph Tully , who was among Lowell officials informed of the company ' s conservation measures during a 2 p.m. meeting yesterday , said he too was angered by the short notice given by Lowell Gas . Tully said the city planned to set up temporary emergency shelters at city schools that are not gas heated . Eugene Hart , vice president of operations at Lowell Gas , said the company had asked its customers to conserve gas in advertisements that started appearing in local newspapers on Wednesday .

" The presidents of the Lowell Gas , Cape Cod Gas , Boston Gas , Fall River Gas and Haverhill Gas companies were invited to attend the conference . Doris Pote , the chairman of the Mass . Department of Public Utilities and Harold J. Keohane , regional representative of the federal Department of Energy , were also expected to attend . Hart said the spells of frigid weather that started just before Christmas have pushed Lowell Gas and Cape Cod Gas to new records for usage on a single day . The average daily consumption experienced by both companies has increased 25 to 30 percent , he said . Due to high natural gas consumption thoughout New England , the pipeline company that supplies Lowell Gas and Cape Cod Gas has been sending its full volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipeline is up to capacity , we have been unable to draw upon our underground storage supplies in New York and Pennsylvania , " he said . Hart said executives of the two firms hope the weather will get warmer by Wednesday , providing some relief . The National Weather Service was forecasting continued cold in eastern Massachusetts during the weekend , with low temperatures between 5 and minus 5 degrees expected last night and tonight . High temperatures in the mid-teens were forecast for today and tommorrow . David Samson , president of the Boston-based New England Gas Assn. , said the unusually cold winter has tightened heating fuel supplies of the 37 gas utilities in the six-state region . " It ' s not as if two companies were in dire straits and the rest are all fine , " Samson said in a telephone interview . " Most companies will be all right through January . " But the real question is , How long is this unseasonably cold weather going to continue ? ' "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
