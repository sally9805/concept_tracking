Ms. Simon ' s first trip to Guatemala , one she thought would be a three-month visit and a ' ' steppingstone ' ' in her photography career , became a seven-year obsession with the country. // Simon , now considered the leading authority on human rights in Guatemala , has compiled her work , both photographs and research , into a book called ' ' Guatemala : Eternal Spring - Eternal Tyranny. ' ' // The book documents the most recent episode in Guatemala ' s violent history . It begins with the year 1980 - when the country was ruled by Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia , considered the nation ' s most brutal head of state - and ends with 1987 , the second year of civilian rule in nearly two decades. // // The book opens with two aerial shots of Guatemala ' s western highlands , characterized by a plush mountainous terrain and towering volcanoes . The photographs take a closer look : One shows a man and a vulture at home in the Guatemala City garbage dump , while a mansion owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another picture shows the mutilated body of a law student who was ' ' hacked to death ' ' a day after civilian President Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo took office , and a third shows Army officers giving candy to children in a war zone. // Guatemala is a land of contrasts and complexities where nothing is black and white , and very little is what it seems. // Foreigners commonly say it is difficult to understand the country immediately , and Simon says that is one reason the international media have ignored it . But the main reason , she says , is the United States government ' s lack of attention. // ' ' My frustration that it ' s not better known abroad , I think , is a very compelling reason to stay , ' ' Simon said. // Simon first came to Guatemala in December 1980 to do some work for the London-based human rights organization Amnesty International and to develop her photographic career . She was then , and still is , one of the few foreign journalists in the country , and she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation here. // Simon said she expected her first trip to Guatemala to be a three-month visit . She talked about her introduction to the country from her one-room efficiency in downtown Guatemala City. // ' ' The first time I came here , I was really frightened . . . I saw a gun under every pillow , every stone . I changed my hotel room 12 times in 12 weeks . It was a time when I didn ' t have a reason to feel endangered , but the situation was so bad you could feel everywhere just how tense it was. ' ' // Although the government began its counterinsurgency campaign in the 1960s , it wasn ' t until the early 1980s that the violence reached its peak . Between 1978 and 1985 , 500 university students and professors were killed and about 100 , 00 children orphaned . Since 1966 , there have been 100 , 000 political killings and 38 , 000 disappearances . According to Americas Watch , Guatemala has the worst human rights record in the Western Hemisphere. // Simon stayed in Guatemala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights abuses for Amnesty International and Americas Watch . Her work has been published in Harper ' s , The New Republic , Time , and Geo . She has also written three publications on Guatemala for Americas Watch. // Because of the sensitive nature of her work , Simon faced a great deal of personal risk . From the early days on , Simon has been watched by Army intelligence and has been the victim of other intimidation tactics . After The New Republic ran a piece she co-wrote with Allan Nairn called ' ' Guatemala - Bureaucracy of death , ' ' armed men stood outside the entrance to her hotel room for days and a van like the ones commonly used in kidnappings was parked around the corner. // The article denounced Army officials linked to human rights violations . Some of those mentioned hold official posts in the current government . She left the country after the article was published and did not return for nine months. // ' ' It ' s a scary situation to be in , ' ' Simon said , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guatemalans live with . If you were a Guatemalan doing what I ' m doing , you ' d either be in exile or underground or disappeared. ' ' // Simon ' s work has involved not only a great deal of personal risk but also a high emotional cost . Several of her friends have disappeared or been killed since 1980. // One was Lucrecia ( Lucky ) Orellana Stormont , a 35-year-old psychology professor from an upper-class family. // ' ' I got this call in the States that Lucky had been kidnapped , ' ' Simon said . ' ' The first thing I thought of was how Lucky herself had called me a few months before to tell me about the kidnapping of a mutual friend. ' ' // Lucky died five months after her abduction . Word got out that she had been tortured to the point that she could not use her hands , and her fingernails had been ripped off. // ' ' What was so frustrating was the knowledge // that during this entire time , she was probably held in government bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' Simon said . ' ' She wasn ' t at the end of the earth . She was right here in Guatemala City all that time , and here I was sitting in my hotel room totally unable to do anything. ' ' // Simon says President Cerezo ' s civilian government has not fundamentally changed the human rights situation here , nor has it challenged the Army ' s authority on any one issue . Although the number of political killings has dropped since President Cerezo took office , assassinations and disappearances continue in the death-squad style of the past. // And no legal action has been taken against military officials for any of the assassinations or disappearances. // ' ' Anyone who lives in Guatemala knows that the military controls almost every aspect of life here : political , economical , social , and cultural , ' ' Simon said. // Although President Cerezo has appointed a congressional human rights commission , a judge , and an attorney general to handle the human rights issues , not a single case has been cleared up. // Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotes him in her book as saying : // ' ' We are not bringing anyone to trial , because Guatemala is not Argentina . In Guatemala , we are going to try and get along with the Army which considers itself successful and victorious and not with an Army that came out of a war with its tail between its legs. ' ' // Nonetheless , Cerezo , an opposition leader who survived three assassination attempts under military rule , did raise hopes that the violence would stop. // From Guatemala , Simon will move on to law school to study human rights law . Her career , which was actually headed toward linguistics when she was an undergraduate at Georgetown University before she chose to become a photographer , will undoubtedly change direction again. // ' ' Leaving won ' t be easy . I have friends here . Half my life is here , and Guatemala for me now is my work , but it ' s a lot more than a way to make a living. // ' ' It ' s my life and in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said. // After law school , Simon said , she might come back to Guatemala , but she said she is also interested in working with the homeless in the United States . For example , before she even went to Guatemala , one of her first projects was taking pictures of bag ladies spending the night in the bathrooms at Penn Station in New York City. // ' ' Homelessness is like Guatemala , ' ' she said . ' ' Hardly anyone chooses to be homeless . Hardly anyone chooses to live in a violent society . It ' s not inherent , it ' s not in anybody ' s blood. ' ' // Whatever the focus , Simon is sure to be campaigning for human rights . As poet and journalist Charles Seibert wrote in an article on Simon for New York Woman magazine , ' ' It is as though she was a roving conscience looking to go wherever unconscionable acts were being committed.
