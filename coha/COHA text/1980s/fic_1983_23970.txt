t MpectS A story .. by Lamar Herrin ARRY , are you crying ? " " What ? " " Arc you crying ? You are crying ! Harry , sweetheart , what 's wrong ? " " Nothing ... it 's just sweat , Lois , it 's an awfully hot day . " " Harry , I 've never seen you cry before . " " I 'm not ... " " Harry , you just sobbed ! " " No ... " " Please pull over . Please stop . You ca n't drive if you cry . How can you see ? " " I 'm fine . " " You 're not fine . You 're crying . There ! ? you just sobbed again . Please pull off at once . " " All right . For a minute . We want to make Amarillo by dark . " " Should I cut you a slice of cantaloupe ? " " Please . That 'd be nice . It 's this heat . This heat is . demoralizing , " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or maybe some pollen , .. " " Harry , I 've never even thought that you could cry . " " Lois , stop ... Awwwgh , if we sit here these trucks will blow us over . And that diesel smelt is horrible . " " There 's no use eating this cantaloupe until you finish crying . Finish crying first , Harry . " " Be quiet a moment , Lois , okay ? " " All right , sweetheart . " " Do n't say anything . Do n't ask me anything . " " No , dear . Cry . It 's all right . " " I 'm going to . " " And later you 'll tell me why . " Lamar Herrin is the author of American Baroque and " The Rio Loja Ringmaster ( Avon ) . ' M AS surprised as you are , Lois , " Harry said . " When I was nineteen I fell in love with a girl from Oklahoma . We were sophomores in school together . It was a long , warm fall that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the games . One day she old me she 'd have to miss the homecoming game because she was going home herself , but that I was not to worry and not to write , She 'd be coming back soon . But she did n't The next thing I knew , she was dead  --  a rare blood disease , I finally found out . Until this morning I had never set foot in her state , but it had all been so long ago I had no reason to think that driving across it would bother me in the least . Then we began to pass all those small towns . What happened is I kept imagining that one of those towns ? or one of those farms  --  might have been hers , and in the beginning the feeling that gave me was almost pleasant , a little bittersweet , really , like looking through an album of old school photos after everybody 's become the one person they were destined to become . Then ... I do n't know what happened . The bottom fell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if all the towns were her town , all the farms , and I had nowhere to stand .... I 'm sorry , Lois . It 's so pointless , so childish . I have n't thought about her in years and years . " " Was she in love with you ? " " I do n't know . I believe so . She was nineteen too . She smiled a lot . She had a wonderful drawl . And this was her state . I think after a while I just forgot about the person she was and began to think of her as Oklahoma . It was a way of getting over her , I guess . " " But you 're not over her , are you ? " " Maybe I 'm not over Oklahoma . " " What was her name ? " " I do n't know . / really ca n't remember . That 's one of the things that went when the bottom fell out  --  one of the reasons I started crying . " " Or the town where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state and here 's where it hit me the hardest . She could have lived anywhere . Maybe she lived there . You see what I mean ? " He raised his arm and pointed beyond his wife , past the elevated shoulder of the interstate , into the the fields . A half mile or so of cottonwoods shaded a small blue farmhouse , a red barn , a grain silo . There were meat cattle and dairy cattle in an adjacent field . Last season 's hay had been harvested in huge , shaggy loaves . Black-eyed Susans grew in among the fence rows , and the pale green of the cottonwoods and the rolling green of the pastureland and the yellow sunspots of the flower petals became flags , banners in the breeze , marking the spot : Here . It started here . It ended here . Or there . Or farther over there where on the horizon car-dealer and fast-food signs grew on stilts out of a much greater clump of trees . A caravan of trucks rocked their car , flung back waves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " his wife said . HE asked her husband to stop at a nearby roadside park . They took the cooler to a shaded picnic table and there she fed him slices of chilled cantaloupe , in between cuts smoothing out a map of the Great Plains states on the table . With the tip of the knife she traced their route along Interstate 40 to the point somewhere east of Oklahoma City where she believed they had stopped . Then , edging the knife tip southward , she said , " We-woka . " " You 're asking if that 's the town , " her husband surmised , " if that rings a bell . " " Yes , Wewoka . " " No " " Caddo . " " No . " " Here 's a funny one  --  you should remember this . Stringtown . " " Stop . " " Stringtown ? " " No , look , Lois , I 'm over it . ' I was just a kid . In a couple of hours we 'll be in Texas . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Tecumseh ? Calvin ? Coalgate ? " " It 's not like you to treat this as a joke . " " I 'm not treating it as a joke . Tecumseh , Oklahoma . Calvin , Oklahoma . Coalgate , Oklahoma . " " No. / do n't know . " " How about Antlers ? How about Calera , Okla-homa ? " " She lived around a small town , a very small town . She would call herself a hick . " " Place called Boswell looks like the smallest I 've got . " The trees in this roadside park had been planted not Iong ago and gave a thin and inconstant shade . In it Harry sat sweating and shaking his head . His wife cut him a final slice of cold cantaloupe , holding it back until he raised his eyes to hers . His were no longer red , but they ached at the center with a fine , precise weightiness . Hers were full of youthful animation . She offered him the cantaloupe , whose aroma rose between them like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Harry now ate while his wife spoke wonderingly , shaking her head . " In twenty years I 've never seen you cry . For twenty years you 've been faithful to me , have n't you , Harry ? " " You know I have . " " And you 've been a good father , a good provider . Wo n't you admit to that ? " " I 've tried . " " You 've succeeded . " She smiled , her lips settling a moment later into the expression of an emerging  --  perhaps wise , perhaps fanciful  --  idea . " I think we should find her , " she said . " Find her ? " her husband repeated tonelessly . " I think we should find the town she lived in . Then we should find the grave . " She drew closer to him over the table , over the cantaloupe rind . " Yes , " she warmed to the idea . " Yes " she touched the heavy damp flesh of his forearm , three fingers , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll know why you 're crying . " " Ail of Oklahoma ? " Harry began . " No , so you wo n't be crying for all of Oklahoma . I do n't want you crying for all of Oklahoma . " Sweetly and quietly she added , " If you must cry I want you to cry for her . " " But we 'll have to look over all of Oklahoma , " her husband protested . " That 's what I mean . " " Maybe not , " his wife intimated . " This is our vacation , remember . This is our first vacation in years without the kids . Remember the Grand Canyon and the Painted . Desert . Remember Las Vegas . You wanted to see the West . " " You could n't get through Oklahoma , " she reminded him . " I win  --  do n't you worry about that . " " Oklahoma is west enough for me right now . " His wife gave him a winning , complicitous smile . The land around the interstate rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . White clouds hung on the heat of the sky like settlements themselves , reconfigured each time he raised his gaze . He gazed instead at his wife , Lois Ross , born Lois Coskins , sister to three , mother of four ; he knew her vital data . Ohio girl , born and bred . " Lois , you 'll have to believe me , " Harry said . " 1 ca n't even remember what she looked like right now . No face , no name , no town . " " It 's this map , " his wife decided summarily , folding it up . " This is for the whole Great Plains . We need one just for Oklahoma . A state map . We 're in no hurry , but let 's go get one of those . " tits is Little  --  Little , Oklahoma . Is that its real name ? " " That 's it , lady , and that 's the way it 's stayed . " " It was n't Little , was it , Harry ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Little . " " You 're sure about that ? " " Yes , she was more ... colorful , more assertive than ' Little , ' Oklahoma . Lois , this wo n't work . " " Sure it will . Look at all the dots on this map . We have to be patient  --  and careful , that 's all . " " Anything I can help you folks with ? " The gas station attendant was a fully fleshed man and probably the station 's owner . He stood behind his cash register rocking from heel to toe on his boots , his weight centered , spotlessly clean except for his hands , which had dirt worked into the calluses . He looked richly fed on town jokes , town gossip , travelers ' pleasantries , travelers ' comical predicaments . " We 're looking for a town in Oklahoma I ca n't remember the name of , " Harry said . " Someplace around here ? " " I ca n't even be sure of that . Someplace in Okla-homa . " " Wheeeeew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lois for the mess her husband was in . " It 's a very small town , " Lois said , party to her husband 's mess , the attendant 's good-humored disbelief , " where a girl was born . brought up , and died at the age of nineteen . A pretty girl . Was n't she pretty , Harry ? " " Yes , pretty , " Harry said , and for an instant his gaze went absent and his tone took a bit of a plunge . " Pretty as Oklahoma , " he added . " Very pretty , " Lois said . The attendant rocked back on his heels , looking out through his red-lettered window at the main street of Little , where the sun struck car-chrome and asphalt melted  --  grinning . He was being put on . He enjoyed that too . He enjoyed people . His philosophy was that sooner or later they always performed . " Ca n't you help us ? " Lois wondered . " Ma'am , Oklahoma is full of small towns and those small towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died young . " Harry made a sound , a groan of confusion , weariness , disapproval , or despair ; it may have been a stifled sob . The station attendant shot him an instant 's unamused glance , and another for his wife . Then he smiled . " ' Bout forty miles south of here there 's a town called Happyland . That might be where she 's at . " " Harry ? " Lois said . " Happyland ? " " No . It 's not funny , " Harry said . " I know it 's not , " Lois sympathized . " Then maybe fifteen miles east of there , there 's one called Non --  -- Non , Oklahoma . Folks like to joke about it because that really means someplace that 's not . " " Non , Harry ? " " Let 's leave , Lois . Did we pay for the gas ? " " Gas is paid for , " the attendant assured them . " Did you pay for the map ? " Harry asked his wife . " Map 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , then within half an hour , at the exit for Shawnee , they got off . Minutes later , they 'd checked in at a Ramada Inn and gone to the two double beds . Harry lay on his in a state of exhaustion so absorbing and vast it had as its image the wheat fields and corn-fields of Oklahoma as they clung to the soft , edge-less roll of the land . He felt both boundless and pinned to that bed . For an instant he entertained the insight that identified that state of fixity and form-lessness as death , then came back to the chemical sweetness of the room deodorizer. the driver 's ten-sion in his back , this busted leg of their trip , the curious interest his wife had taken in this long for-gotten sweetheart of his youth . A bed away , more than just interested , deeply intrigued , his wife lay looking at him . She was trying to imagine the distance those tears of his had traveled , the depth out of which they had come , after twenty years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy years had deposited on the one sad one her husband had known . She had not known that he 'd known death . Both their families were long-lived . Their four par-ents still lived , their aunts and uncles . Their broth-ers and sisters , nieces and nephews . No stillbirths , as far as she knew no miscarriages . They had four healthy adolescent children divided up among friends and grandparents so that their parents , these two . Harry and Lois , could take their trip . Yet over Okla-homa hung this cloud of death . Through which the sun shone , the grass , the trees , the birds , animals , flowers , homes . It was a beautiful state . The cloud of death  --  like a perfectly pure solution  --  brought every speck of its beauty out , every sparkle . Was that what her husband was thinking ? Was that his mood ? She continued to observe him . Years ago , many pounds lighter , he 'd been a boy of nineteen , lean , healthy , happy , and then suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How quickly he 'd forgotten the girl and come to mourn Oklahoma , how easily Oklahoma had bled off into Texas , New Mexico , Colorado , Kansas , Missouri , and Arkansas ? it touched them all . She had taken out her map . With her fingernail on Route 40 , passing through Fort Smith , Henryetta , past minuscule Little , stopping near Shawnee , she 'd called , Harry , very quietly , as though addressing a sleeper whose dream might shatter at the first worldly noise . Harry , she said , Lima , Harjo , Wye . She breathed soundlessly , then held her breath altogether . No , he whispered . Bowlegs , she smiled . Said , Bowlegs , Wolf , Maud . Then had to wait for travelers with kids to climb the staircase outside , pass down the corridor , and get into their room before even hoping for an answer . She was about to repeat the names when Harry obliged her . No , he said , then : Try farther south , find the smallest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skirted it . He said , I remember her drawl . One of her friends called her Tex . Lois studied the northern fringe of Texas . The looping Red River formed the state line . The mapmaker had given it a sort of intestinal thickness . Tucked down in those lazy , thick loops were the towns . Enos , Oklahoma , she said , Enos . she repeated silently to herself , searching through her mind 's eye for the figure of the girl her husband might have known from there . She saw Shirley Jones leaning on a cornstalk and a musical , applescheeked Gordon MacRae riding down the rows . She smiled , nothing lost , mildly disappointed in herself but  --  only human  --  deserving a bit of fun . This was their vacation . Not Enos , Harry said . Willis then , she said . She had strong , straight bones , Harry said , but not one of them stuck out . That 's not Willis . That 's ... something else , and he faltered , his voice falling around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught himself , and she heard the springs jump . He shook , reacquiring vigor . What the hell are we doing here ! With a fine , tightly compassed panic her finger sought the line of the Red River . Kemp , she said . holding him off . Yuba . Gay , she said , and struck him between the eyes as she crowed it a second time , quietly : Gay , Oklahoma ! It knocked him back onto the bed . Overwrought , unprepared , in that instant he saw her , but before he thought to record the sight she was gone . The after-image was of size and space where something clearly female had stood , fashioned with a series of fresh rough cuts , the hair sunnily thatched . The mouth made an exuberant round . He still saw the teeth and the tongue . Not Gay , he said . Gay is not the word . E ALWAYS slept later than she . She brought up styrofoam cups of coffee . She parted the curtains just enough to let the sun of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thinly cushioned armchairs she had already spread the map . Her husband sat up in bed . " Yesterday , " she said , " we were like kids playing detective , and like kids we forgot the first rule of good detectiveship . We tried to stand at the scene of the crime itself , right at the center , but in order to see what was at our backs we had to keep spinning around . We got dizzy . Dizzy from too much detective work is a pretty good way to describe what happened to us yesterday , do n't you think ? " She spoke with a poised , matter-of-fact , not unkind enunciation , which , like the coffee , she passed on to him . Answer accordingly , she seemed to be saying ; how 's this for a sensible tone . " And the heat , " her husband said . " You cried yesterday , Harry . That was our first clue . " " ... the heat ... , " he muttered lamely . " No , we know better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Legs crossed , she sipped from her coffee . She seemed to be waiting until Harry sipped from his . To please her he did and , surprised at himself , caught a bit of her crispness , a bit of her collected air . " You cried , " she continued , " because you could n't make it across Oklahoma . You could n't make it across Oklahoma because here , you said , a teenage love of yours had died . Am I right so far ? Clarity in these matters helps . " Her husband assented . " Because here is where we 're forced to speculate a bit . In self-defense. to enable yourself to enjoy our marriage and children and reasonably happy twenty years together , you blanked out this girl 's town , you blanked out her name and face , and more or less gave her all of Oklahoma . She became Oklahoma , which was fine as long as you did n't venture near the place . But once you did it was as if you had to move from east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . You thought she had died , and she had , but in your mind she had taken on the beauty and vitality of all this . " Here , with a theatrical gesture , Lois pulled the curtains back to their full extent . White light flooded the room . Behind the glare arced the blue sky , and inside the arc hung the billowy clouds . " She had come back to life , " his wife declared authoritatively . " She had come enormously and beautifully back to life , " permitting her voice a small oratorical swell , " and you had missed her . You had settled for me , and I could n't compete with her  --  with that . " Where she might have jabbed spitefully toward the expanse beyond the motel window she offered it to him , palm up , and smiled . " That was when you cried . We sometimes get a taste of our missed opportunities , and yours were too sweet to stand . You cried and I fed you cantaloupe . " She rose now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swath of light she allowed to enter she sat back down , " I think , " she concluded , " we had better find that grave . 51 He had no argument . Beyond the light he sought his wife 's face , found its oval , the brittle graying line of the head of hair . From memory he filled in the rest . " How ? " he asked . " I know the name of the town , " she disclosed . " Will I recognize it ? " " You already have . " " I do n't understand . " " For two hours I 've sat here with this map watching you sleep . Every fifteen seconds or so I named a town , very quietly so that you would n't wake up . You chose the one , you repeated it , and then you moaned . You made a good choice , I think. - " I dreamed I was taking a test , " Harry suddenly recalled . " I was sitting in a room full of students and all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was being examined orally . They were embarrassing questions  --  questions about shoplifting and masturbation and all sorts of typical adolescent brutalities  --  and the examiners kept changing . My jaw felt muscle-bound and my mouth would n't work . Finally I broke down and cried . Then all the examiners and my fellow students filed out , like in a procession . " " Was I an examiner ? " his wife asked . " No , I do n't believe so . " " Let me be one now . " " I can barely see you in that light . " " Listen , Harry . I 'll name you five towns . I want you to choose her town again . " He nodded at her to go ahead , Could she see him ? It occurred to him that in spite of the coffee he might still be asleep , in fact , more deeply asleep than ever . Asleep dreaming of a clearheaded awakening , the day fully under way and the light a radiance he 'd come back to and earned after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list written on the back of a Ramada Inn envelope she read : " Bray , Oklahoma . " " Clarita , Oklahoma . " " Amber , Oklahoma . " " Gene Autry , Oklahoma . " " Nido , Oklahoma . " He stared at her , the light a dazzling veil , just her height when she stood to it . " Nido , " he repeated in a hush . " Nido , " he wondered out loud . " It 's a Spanish word , " she told him . " I went downstairs and asked until I found someone who spoke Spanish . It means ' nest . ' " " Nest ? " " Nest , " she nodded . " That 's where you 'll find her . " " You 're positive ? " She stepped through that veil of light and into the overcast margin at the head of his bed . She came quickly , like a nurse , he thought , tired of pampering her patient , determined to set him homeopathicallyback on his feet . Her overexposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . He wasn't. o WYE , Pearson , Asher . Route 39 to 3E South , and Konowa , Byng , Stonewall , Tupelo , Wapanucka . Route 48 now , and Clear Boggy Creek , unboggily bright . Everything shone . The clouds , the grass , the long , flowing stalks of corn . The hides of cows , their willow-ringed ponds . The sun-dappled paint on the houses , the lines of wash . A dog . If he looked closely . a very small child . Then the distances , the wheat fields blowing blue-green in the morning breeze . Scattered throughout those fields he saw thickets of dense green scrub oak marking the sinkholes , and nearby , along the edges , up the first few feet of the rows , poppy petals , tissue-thin and an unclotted red , freshly fallen to the ground . Everything  --  he drove while his wife read off the routes and towns  --  gave back an inaugural newness and shine . The very air , the air had a rain-cleansed luster that may have come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen  --  but it did n't matter . It was what he saw . They 'd exchanged the elevated monotony of the interstate for the two-lane state and county roads . Those roads obeyed the undulations in the land . It was what he desired and feared . Farther and farther south and those undulations overtook him like a drug . " It 's not fair to the children , " he voiced his doubts . " The children would n't understand , " his wife assured him . " I mean the time away from them was supposed to be time we took for ourselves . That was how we justified it . It was to be our second honeymoon  --  our trip west . " " You 're slowing down , Harry , " his wife said . " Do n't slow down . " " We misrepresented it . " " We did n't know . No one knew about Oklahoma . I do n't think you even knew . " " We 'll have to explain it to them . We 'll have to account for ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine them sitting in the backseat right now . What would happen to ... to your mood , Harry ? They 'd look out the window and see cows and horses and barns and corn . What do you see ? " " Cows and horses and barns and corn . " " What do you really see ? " " I see her . " " Of course you do . " " I feel guilty . I ca n't help it . " " Of course you ca n't . " Outside of a colony of grain elevators and a main street of stores called Kenefic , she navigated them onto their narrowest road yet , 22 West . It was so slender-shouldered that crops grew up to the asphalt on both sides . They might have been riding down a wheat furrow , a corn row . The wind from their passage blew cowlicks in the wheat and blew the green corn leaves and blew from the long , moist , tufted tassel the smell of corn , powerful and rank , more animal than vegetable , vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed . He nearly swooned . His driving grew wobbly . This , his wife said to steady him , to aim him as straight as the uncurving road , is her country . And that , she said , as the cornfield ended and a pasture provided a vista , is her town . HERE was no town ; he knew it the second he entered its one shaded street . There was no house , not one of those old white Victorians with wraparound verandas , not one of those small , slumping clapboards , patchy with screens . No stores , no church , no movie house , no dentists ' and doctors ' offices , no hotel for visitors , no jail . No main street . He pulled over so that his wife could inquire the way to the cemetery , and there were no townspeo-ple of hers to talk to , just men and women , boys and girls . The one his wife had chosen was an over-fed girl who held by the fist a sullen , towheaded boy , and neither the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind their anonymous flesh to become neighbors of hers . The town  --  three or four blocks of short sandy store buildings , trucks , cars , wires , hanging signs , cracked pavement , and sun  --  howled desolate white noise in his ears . There was no cemetery . His wife directed him to it . Just north of town it stood on the only thing thereabouts resembling a hill . He drove to its highest point and got out . This was Nido , Oklahoma , and out there , through notches in the surrounding bushes and trees , was more , a lot more , of that low , undulating , taw-ny-spotted , glistening green countryside . In that in-stant , while his wife went to find the caretaker and bring him back so that her love-stricken husband could hear what he had to say , Harry felt the first grazing touch of a breeze blowing back from that countryside , following , as he had , the gentle up-sweep of the land . It found his temples and eyelids , broke off , and traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin . He trembled . Re-motely , as at a distance of twenty-five years , he groaned . Then the breeze embraced him , blowing up richly and broadly from all that he saw below . She was in it . She visited him in places he 'd never been visited before , her movements as agile as the flashes of fish . He stood in her , a bath the size of her state . What glory ! he thought . What love ! Then , abruptly , without apology , it was over . In the sudden pore-prickling heat he felt the flesh sag over his knees . " Maybe this man can help us , " his wife aroused him , and true to her word she 'd brought the cemetery 's caretaker with her . Behind him Harry now saw the graves . " My wife should n't have bothered you , " he apologized . " No bother , " the caretaker said , but Harry could sec that it had been and was . The man had a clipped , businesslike manner about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lois were not business . One look at them and the man could tell that . " I 'm afraid we 've wasted your time . " " Your wife said you 'd come a long way . " " Ohio , " Harry said . " Do n't expect you folks will be passing through Nido again . Every so often you see someone new here . You never see ' em twice . You 've come to find a grave . " The man stated his question , saved Harry the ordeal of the answer . The night 's dream came back to him . Like a lump of gristle in the back of his throat he felt his paralyzed powers of speech . Speechless , he wondered just what this sour-faced caretaker did : grounds-kept certainly ; drove off pranksters and vandals ; stood against fire , flood , famine , and drought ; dug the graves and filled them , sealed them with a stone . Ran a tight ship . The transcendental thanklessness of caring for the dead ! Not a trace of that inspiriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , a dead space , a thickening mortal soup . " We 're not sure . This may not be the town , " he managed . " Nido , Oklahoma , " the caretaker said . " Yes , I know , " Harry said . " Been here fifty years . I know what goes on down there and I know what goes on up on this hill . " He followed this tight-lipped boast with an even tighter-lipped show of generosity . " Here 's your chance , " he said . " Twenty-five years ago , " Harry began , " I knew a girl ... an Oklahoma girl . , " then failed . From the caretaker 's eyes , flat like small , tarnished coins , he turned to the fields . One after another  --  wheat , grasslands , cows , and corn  --  they carried him to the horizon , where he placed the side of his fist against his pouring brow and searched his mind : wheat , grasslands , cows , and corn . Who was she ? Where had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And where he heard Lois , his wife , in her stead , say : " She came from a small Oklahoma town ? that we 're sure of . " Then the caretaker : " Oklahoma 's full of small towns . " Lois : " This one was probably located somewhere near Texas . " The caretaker : " Quite a few of ' em are . " Lois : " This girl was pretty . " The caretaker : " Pretty girls all over , Oklahoma 's got its share . " Lois : " And she died young . She was only nine-53 teen years old . " The caretaker : " The pretty ones always do . " Lois : " My husband believes she lived in Nido . " Then the caretaker , taking his leave : " Your husband can be my guest . " E WALKED the graves with his wife . Most were marked with stones of gray granite , and as they moved down the first row they paused before each to read the inscription . At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dispirited husband would never last if they stopped at each of the graves , so with a steady pace and a resolute selectivity she began to lead him past those not to their purpose . In that way they failed to honor the remains of the elderly dead , the infant-dead , the dead-in-their-prime , the **32;2549;TOOLONG , the **36;2583;TOOLONG , the **25;2621;TOOLONG . Lois led him past the broad-shouldered monuments of the rich , ostentatiously engraved , and past the simple slabs of the poor . As they had stood in life , so they stood in death  --  on this hill rested the tonnage of Nido 's forfeited wealth  --  but she barely remarked on that . She was steering her husband through . Like a sunning snake they lay loop on coiling loop and were somewhere near the cemetery 's center when they came to the **42;2648;TOOLONG . There , in a gentle , guiding , cautionary whisper , she alerted her husband . " We 're here , Harry . This is where we start . Do you want to go ahead ? " With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to bid farewell , she watched her heavyhearted husband nod . Then read : " ' Sally Jean Livingston . Born 1945 . Died 1965 . We miss her . Our days are dark .

" " Emily Appleton . " " Susana Wells . " " Nancy Brooks . " " Rosemarie Miller . " " Elizabeth Olmstead . " " Hope Bryant . " Then only half of those : - Dorothy . " " Missie . " " Kate . " " Amy . " " Penny . " " Melanie . " " Phyllis . " " Claire . " The cadence in her step had come into her voice and with it , finally , came anger . She found herself pronouncing each name with a mournful and measured defiance , calling to account the unaccountable , accusing the defense of the indefensible , but it was like spitting into the wind . There was no beginning or end to this wind , not this one , which rose off the farmlands of Oklahoma and blew insatiably over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Nido 's nestlings or those kicked out of the nest ? Where , please , had the Mother Bird gone ? " Katherine Lee Lovejoy , " she read . l3eside her , her husband released a single groan , quiet and mindful , as though in deference to the dead . His eyes , like two large hanging pools , filled up with tears . " That 's her , is n't it , Harry ? " she said . He stood there motionless , earth pulling at his legs . buttocks , belly , chest , arms . face , and long-lobed ears . Undoing his already humid shirt and pants . Unlacing his shoes . She read : " ' Born 1938 . Died 1957 . Kathy , dear , do n't be sad . In life you made each day our pleasure . In death you show us to our proper home . Be brave , obedient , generous , busy , and glad . Be you , Kathy , many times over and many times grander than this poor flesh allowed you to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " She looked back at her husband . His entire face now was streaming wet . " Is that sweat or tears , Harry ? " she asked , but did n't have to . She knew it was both . " This is the one  --  this Kathy Lovejoy  --  is n't it , Harry ? " she whispered again . He 'd begun to heave , his knees to tremble . With great effort and even greater reluctance , she thought , he shook his head . " But you 're crying . Why are you crying then ? " she asked him . " There 're just so many of them . Lois , " he said at last , each word a near sob , barely intelligible , best understood as a tiny outpouring to water the grass on the graves . " There 're just so many more than I ever thought . " ?
