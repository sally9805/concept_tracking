So he took the opportunity today to debunk that when he stopped by Kennebunk High School and played a couple of innings in a softball game between the White House and the press corps. // The President , who was captain and first baseman for Yale ' s champion baseball team in 1948 , showed elegant form with a glove , making four putouts in two innings. // One ball was thrown by the shortstop over Mr. Bush ' s head . " Hey , I am not 13 feet tall , " the President said afterward , explaining why he could not catch it. // When it was his turn at bat , he popped a soft fly ball out to short center field , but Scott Lee , a local shipyard worker playing on the press side , snagged it .

Once he was certain the cameras were set up and reporters were lining the shore , he would throw the throttle forward , departing in a dramatic spray of water. // On Friday Mr. Bush found himself relatively alone , and moved quickly to remedy the situation . He invited a couple of the pool reporters covering his morning activities to come for a ride in his boat Fidelity. // When the ride was truncated after the boat ran over something - rocks or driftwood or a lobster pot - and broke the housing of the starboard propeller , the President hustled the reporters off to the house to pitch horseshoes with his son Jeb and a grandson , George P.
