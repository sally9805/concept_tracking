A country fiddler scores with a city boy 's great tune <P> It is a match-up that has all the makings of a barroom brawl . On the right of the room , Charlie Daniels , roof-raising country rocker , the good ole fiddler who a couple of seasons ago sang about the devil going down to Georgia and about solid American spunk : " This lady may have stumbled , but she ai n't never fell/ And if the Russians do n't believe it , they can all go straight to hell . " <P> On the left of the room , Dan Daley , New York City born and raised , at 28 younger than Daniels by 17 years , and at least 75 pounds lighter . A singer-songwriter with a solid dose of urban angst who has been plugging away in the music business for over a decade , with little to show for it but a cassette full of promising tunes . <P> Part of the peculiar physics of rock ' n ' roll , however , is the ability to fuse opposites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his demo tape is a hit song called Still in Saigon , featured on Daniels ' new album , Windows , already 24 on the singles charts and climbing fast . At this bleak and uncertain moment for rock ' n ' roll , Still in Saigon is not only the best single of the year so far ; it would be a standout in the most bountiful of times . <P> Harsh , haunted , as chilling as a fever dream , Still in Saigon is music made from the silence of the dead . Like John Fogerty in his great songs for Creedence Clearwater Revival ( Run Through the Jungle , Fortunate Son , Who 'll Stop the Rain ) , Daley writes with ruthless simplicity . Still in Saigon has no patience with protest . Its power comes from undeflected imagery and reflective compassion : " The ground at home/ Was covered with snow/ And I was covered with sweat/ My younger brother calls me a killer/ And my Daddy calls me a vet ... / Damned if I know who I am/ There was only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saigon . " : <P> Some have argued that the unlikely success of such a song demonstrates that the war in Viet Nam is now , securely , a safe issue . But Still in Saigon does not play it safe in the writing or in Daniels ' slightly rowdy , defiant delivery . This is a war memorial of present and continued agony , about flashbacks that never stop and bad dreams that do not end with daylight : " Every summer when it rains/ I smell the jungle/ I hear the planes/ I ca n't tell no one/ I feel ashamed/ Afraid some day/ I 'll go insane ... " It shows that popular music can still express strong and complex feelings , not mere sentiment . The true rock spirit may not be languishing after all , just waiting .
