" Blam ! " has to tell us at the Whitney Museum . ( Curated and catalogued by Barbara Haskell of the Whitney , it can be seen through Dec. 2 . ) For those who were // around New York at the time it will come with a heavy freight of nostalgia ( or , it may be , of exasperation recollected in tranquillity ) . To those who were not , it may suggest a period in which imaginations were loaded , even if pockets were not , and new art was savored for its own sake and by small but committed groups of people. // In physical terms , the show is undeniably peculiar . There are classic examples of self-contained and self-sufficient works of art that were executed between 1955 and 1965 by Carl Andre , Walter de Maria , Roy Lichtenstein , Jasper Johns , James Rosenquist , Robert Rauschenberg , Frank Stella and Andy Warhol . We can never see some of these too often , and some of them we don ' t see often enough . The chance of seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance . Andy Warhol ' s " Dick Tracy " of 1960 is not only a key image of its date , but an unexpectedly painterly one as well. // As for Lichtenstein ' s " Washing Machine " of 1961 , it drove people crazy at the time , because it was thought to take high art out of the private chapel and into an altogether too humble part of the house . But in 1984 we note primarily that the mistress of the house looks as if she were leaning down from the very bar of Heaven , thereby lending a transcendental air to a famously humdrum activity. // // // It is also worth saying that the role of the art critic was being filled at that time by a particularly perceptive bunch of people . A time at which we could count on John Ashbery , Fairfield Porter and Robert Rosenblum to keep tabs on the new had nothing to be ashamed of . Fairfield Porter had nothing in common , where his own practice was concerned , with Pop art , but as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential nature of painting " and that he " gets it down in one spontaneous layer , and gets it down right. " // But " Blam ! " is not " an art exhibition " of a straightforward kind . It is an essay in interdisciplinary cultural history , in which mainline works of art are , if not outweighted , at any rate outspaced by historic souvenirs of quite another sort . From the moment that we cross the bridge from Madison Avenue and find that the Whitney ' s moat is filled with score upon score of wornout automobile tires we know that we are back in the age when it was perceived that a refuse heap could function as art , just as silence could function as music. // We are also back in an age when artists did not only not make money . They actually made fun of money , as when Oldenburg and Dine printed bills on the stencil machine at the Judson Memorial Church and made sure that everyone who came in that evening was given a million dollars . We don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we do see complete stage sets by Red Grooms and Robert Whitman , together with 10 sculptures from Oldenburg ' s " The Street " ( 1959 ) and 38 sculptures from his " The Store " ( 1961 ) . Though necessarily short on live action , the show is rich in video recordings and also aims to cover the achievement of the American independent cinema as it was represented during the period by Stan Brakhage , Bruce Conner , Andy Warhol , John Cassavetes and others. // ' Blam ! " deals , therefore , as best it can with the moment at which the overlap of the arts - mooted above all by John Cage in 1952 at Black Mountain College , and later at the New School in Manhattan in 1958-59 - suddenly made perfect sense . During the heyday of Action Painting , painters were people who painted , period , even if there was said to be an element of the ritual dance in the way that some of them went about it . But in the late 1950 ' s it turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could dance , they could sing , they could improvise plays and appear in them , they could open small retail stores , they could make movies . Above all , they were given what Red Grooms , then very young , later called " a license to do dumb things . " And al though some of those things were indeed dumb , others were not. // Among the artists who literally put themselves on the line in theatrical activity of one sort or another were George Brecht , Jim Dine , Red Grooms , Allan Kaprow , Robert Morris , Claes Oldenburg , Robert Rauschenberg , Lucas Samaras and Robert Whitman . If Oldenburg , Rauschenberg , Grooms and Whitman make a particularly spectacular impact in " Blam ! " it is because their work is shown there on an environmental scale , whereas the achievement of others in the same domain is by now a matter of legend only. // It is important to remember that the late 1950 ' s and early 60 ' s were a time at which it was assumed that everybody could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general feeling of heightened potential . Traditionally a place of solitary confinement , the studio opened out . It was given over from time to time to proceedings that had something of group therapy , something of the bohemians in Act I of " La Boh eme , " something of a commedia dell ' arte updated by Dr.R . D. Laing , and something of benign conspiracy . What was done in those studios was patently and absolutely uncommercial . In kind , if not always in quality , it was related to the Dada evenings of music , poetry and polemic in Zurich during World War I , and to the Society for Private Musical Performance that Arnold Schoenberg organized in Vienna in 1919-21 , and to the virtually clandestine performance of Picasso ' s play " Desire Caught by the Tail " that was given in his studio in Paris during World War II . Versatility was taken for granted . Larry Poons is known today as a pure painter , but at the time in question he ran something called the Epitome Cafe in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motorcycle , an electric guitar and a basketball might on occasion take equal rank as instruments . It is also relevant that in the daylong performance carnival that Allan Kaprow organized at George Segal ' s farm in New Jersey in May 1963 the participants included a composer , La Monte Young , two dancer-choreographers , Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown , a visiting German painter , Wolf Vostell , and an American sculptor , Charles Ginnever . Something in all this affected the future of dance , the future of music and the future of art . Nothing quite like that universal freemasonry has happened since , and although many of the people represented in " Blam ! " have gone on to become rich and famous , not all of them have kept either the spontaneity or the improvizational quality that comes out so strongly in the present show . How could they , after all ? It is one thing to make something out of nothing in first youth , and quite another to operate in what to the outsider looks like optimum conditions . As Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of emotional tension " that had somehow seeped away from it in the late 50 ' s . Jim Dine for one brought to his performances an element of confessional nightmare and a degree of emotional commitment that certainly could not have been maintained for long. // Miss Haskell tells us that his " Smiling Workman , " which lasted a bare 30 seconds , " consisted of Dine , dressed in a paint-smattered smock with his face painted red , his mouth black , rapidly scribbling ' I love what I ' m doing ' in orange and blue paint on an empty canvas ; he than drank from the jars of paint , drenched himself with what remained , and finished by diving through the canvas . " The least one can say is that this was not work for a dilettante. // The difficult thing is to maintain anything like that degree of tension and surprise when there is virtually nothing in current technology that is not readily available to an artist who is riding high . Claes Oldenburg ' s plans for monumental sculpture had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a watercolor drawing , that they do not always have when they are realized as engineering projects . Quite apart from that , there is a sense in which society , which at the beginning of the 60 ' s seemed so open to restructuring , has closed ranks again . People dislike ago . Given a choice between experiment and orthodoxy , they opt for orthodoxy most of the time . They don ' t believe that the world can be made over , and they rather hope that no one will be in a position to try it. // All this being so , " Blam ! " may well seem to commemorate what was to our own time what the Children ' s Crusades were to the early 13th century - a visionary but foredoomed adventure . Be that as it may , this is a fascinating if lopsided exhibition , and one whose ingredients have remained remarkably fresh. // //
