vacationing families and conventioneers the world over . Those who have been to Blue Springs agree it is unforgettable . Small wonder then that nine years after picnicking on the banks of this deep , 25-foot-wide spring of indescribably blue water , Callaway remembered it , too . Secluded , primeval , situated at the foot of a flint cliff 30 miles from industrial La Grange , the enchanting forest stirred responsive chords in Cason Calla-way 's nature . Where better to take life a little easier and indulge his passion for the outdoor life ? Purchasing a 2,500-acre tract that embraced both the Blue Springs and the Barnes Creek watersheds , he had workmen cut timber and form an earthen dam for the creation of Lake Ida ( named for his mother ) . Here he escaped the cares of the industrial world and settled down to experimental farming , from strawberries and ducks to blueberries and turkeys . Here he planted and grew his exciting horticultural discovery , Azalea pruni folium , and eventually cultivated more than 20,000 varieties . To Blue Springs came everyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world : the great , the lowly , the small farmer , the rich landowner , the agricultural student , the county extension agent , the soil conservationist .

Some come by plane to Atlanta and take the shuttle service to Callaway Gardens/Harris County Airport , only five minutes away from this 2,500-acre tract that has become a complete vacationing spa . No longer do the crowds come just to study farming . The hoe has been replaced by the tennis racket , the Ferguson tractor by the riding horse . The crowds come to enrich their lives and elevate their spirits around 13 lakes bordered by thick stands of azalea ( at least one million of 700 varieties blossom in April and May ) , laurel , rhododendron , dogwood , chrysanthemums and thousands of other species of flowers and shrubs .
