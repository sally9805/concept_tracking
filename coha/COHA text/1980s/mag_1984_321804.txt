Smile , Mr. President . It really was stunning . It was supposed to happen , we saw it happening , it happened . Well , Coleridge said that anticipation is more potent than surprise . Even the overwhelming landslide came as no shock , though it may unnerve a country accustomed to contentious opinions to face evidence of such astounding unanimity . We ought to know , then , what this long-anticipated re-election means , what it says about America . Do we know ? Mondale supporters suggest that we have become a nation of hedonists and Mammon worshipers . Reaganites , that we want a muscular America and Government off our backs . Does anyone here regard things so simply ? <P> For some reason there has been a tendency to mythologize this campaign , to portray Reagan as an abstract force that has settled at the heart of the country and held it in thrall . Our barefoot boy . Our monarch . Reagan has contributed to this view by being at once highly visible and unreachable , creating a public presence so pleasantly familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him around . But people vote for facts as well as feelings . There is nothing abstract about the appeal of lower personal taxes , lower inflation , lower interest rates ; of greater national pride ; of relative peace in our time . If the majority has chosen current prosperity over a deficit 's shadow , how mysterious is that ? <P> There is , too , the fact of Walter Mondale . Admirable as he is , Mondale did not run an effective campaign . He began his quest for the White House on the odd note of promising to raise taxes . Near the end of his campaign , he drove home differences of principle with the Republicans , but the passion came too late . In terms of abstractions , it may be said that Mondale represented the past of Big Government , now seen as less appealing than the past of free enterprise represented by Reagan . But most people recognize such polarities as the stuff of speeches ; realism always tugs toward the middle . Reagan beat Mondale because to huge numbers of Americans he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else was happening in the election may take longer to assess . Political observers tell us that Reagan makes people happy , and that Americans love to be happy . But where are there people who do not want to be happy , and what proof is there that Americans , more than anyone else , seek happiness at the expense of reality ? For that matter , what proof is there that Americans are especially selfish , or that those who preferred Reagan care not a whit for the poor , or are cruising for a war with the Soviets ? Most citizens are as generous as they are competitive , and have mixed and turbulent feelings on everything from public education to the arms race . A vote for Reagan hardly settled these matters . One thing may be said of this election : individuals , more than voting blocs , did the electing , and individuals are very private concerns . Reagan 's triumph is at once straightforward and paradoxical . He may be an embodiment of the country , but it is a country no one sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
