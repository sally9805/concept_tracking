East Germany first competed in the Olympics under its own flag at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich . The hammer-and-compass banner was hoisted in victory 66 times , countering the G.D.R . ' s image as a walled outcast with the impression of an athletic marvel . Four years later , in the last Summer Games not boycotted by a major competitor , East Germany , with 17 million people , earned 40 gold medals ; the U.S. , with over 200 million , won 34 . National medal counts and per capita ratios are , of course , hardly the stuff of Olympic ideals , nor should athletics be pursued for political value . But East Germany is not the only nation to concentrate on such goals . It just seems to be the most successful at it . <P> In Seoul , a disciplined East German contingent is ready to demonstrate its prowess again , with strong competitors in everything from swimming to marksmanship . Many analysts expect the country 's 307 athletes to take home more metal than the 645 Americans , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The astounding success of the G.D.R . team has raised inevitable questions of secret drugs or revolutionary training methods . " That 's all nonsense , " says Karlheinz Gieseler , secretary-general of the West German Sports Federation and a longtime observer of East German sports . " What makes the G.D.R . so great is the successive pruning out and systematic training of their talent . " <P> The process begins with the statistical assessment of the nation 's second- and third-graders , who are measured , weighed , timed and questioned . The resulting data is churned through a computer at the German College of Physical Culture in Leipzig , which determines whether a child might have a special aptitude for a certain sport . Says Renate Vogel , a former world champion G.D.R . swimmer and now deputy coach of the West German women 's Olympic team : " No one with talent falls through the sieve . " <P> The talent , in turn , is coddled and honed . Promising grade schoolers are channeled into the country 's 2,000 training centers . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on to some 25 residential sports schools , where 2,000 full-time trainers , plus doctors , masseurs and cooks , begin building Olympic winners . <P> " For a top athlete , the G.D.R . is still paradise , " East German Swimmer and Defector Jens-Peter Berndt , now a member of the West German Olympic team , told the Bonn daily Die Welt . " Nowhere else do athletes work so intensely and with such concentration . All your problems are taken off your hands . " Exhibition meets , medical bills , sponsorship , job worries , troublesome journalists  --  all such distractions are largely unknown to them . But there are other pressures . Academic performance and political education are closely monitored . A " socialist family tree "  --  no close relatives in the West  --  is required for international competition . <P> An all-powerful state sports apparatus invests this carefully nurtured human capital where it brings the highest dividends in Olympic medals . Little effort is wasted in sports that require large teams or expensive equipment , like water polo , field hockey , fencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
