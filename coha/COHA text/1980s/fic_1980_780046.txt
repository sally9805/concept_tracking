 | Lionel was eating an early dinner in the big bright kitchen of the Inn-Tavern . He was not one to savor food or good wine . They were of no interest to him personally , though he realized the deep importance of them to the guests , and so had made himself an acute judge of liquors , wines , and viands . He could taste a dish and decide on its excellence or mediocrity , and a wine for its fragrance and body , but he craved none for his own enjoyment . He ate merely to satisfy hunger . His teeming mind was centered on other matters , and his eyes would move from side to side restlessly as he ate his own meals . His quick face turned everywhere , his fork moving very fast , and he was mostly unaware of taste . The two chefs eyed him , as usual , with no particular favor , offended as they were by his lack of appreciation . From time to time he would take his watch out of his vest pocket and study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon be entering . He must be ready to greet them . The chefs did not like the Sunday crowds , for usually they had drunk too much in the back rooms so that their taste was numbed . Lionel had never seen Jason in a disheveled or emotional state since old Joe Maggiotti 's death . So when Jason , in soiled overalls and patched blue shirt , exploded into the kitchen by way of the employees ' entrance , Lionel was astonished . Jason 's face was actually afire with excitement , and sweat ran down his cheeks . His body emanated frenzy and disarray . He was panting , breathless . As the others in the kitchen also stared , he shouted , " Where 's Mr. Mulligan ? " " Hey ! " exclaimed Lionel , putting down his fork and half-rising  | in his chair . " What 's the matter with you ? It 's your Sunday off . You ca n't come in here . . . in those clothes . " Jason waved his arms . " The hell with my day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he ? " Lionel , studying him for an intense moment , felt a strange excitement . His yellow eyes became alert . Intuitive , he had an odd premonition , Jason would never get into this state over a minor matter . " Put down that damned fork ! " Jason yelled . " I 've got to talk with Mr. Mulligan , and you come with me ! " The chefs gaped from the stoves . Lionel put down his fork and stood up . " Mr. Mulligan 's in one of the upstairs private dining rooms with Mrs. Lindon and a couple of her . . . young relatives and two banker friends . You ca n't go up looking like that .. . Ca n't it wait ? " " No ! It ca n't . " Jason took his friend by the arm and began pulling him toward the staircase in the kitchen , which led up to the three private dining rooms on the second floor . " Lionel . I ca n't tell you here . No time . You can hear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost hysterical shout . " If things go right . . . we 'll be rich , rich ! " Lionel stared even closer at Jason . Jason was never extravagant or enthusiastic in speech , but he was today . The air seemed to vibrate about him . Never hopeful or expectant , but always judicious and thoughtful , he was not one to catch at rainbows or to believe mica was made of precious metal . All his judgments were sound . So Lionel followed him . At the top of the stairs , Jason turned and said , " Which dining room ? " " Here , " said Lionel , and knocked on the shut door , forgetting to be wary . Mr. Mulligan said from behind the door , " All right . Come in . Who 's there ? " Lionel pushed the door open on a pleasant scene . The room was large and nicely decorated , with whitepainted walls , gilt moldings near the ceiling , a bright chandelier gaslit even this early on a spring evening . It was a circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building 's tower and so was called the Tower Room . The round rug was blue and gold , the furniture excellent , the big table covered with linen with a lace overlay , the sofa and chairs upholstered in yellow velvet . There was a fine rich odor of roasted beef and onions and potatoes floating tantalizingly in the air , mingled with the scent of wines and brandies and broiled new mushrooms and hot cream and fresh warm bread .  | The weighty silver gleamed in the gaslight . The guests put down their wineglasses and stared with amazement at the sight of Jason in his workman 's cheap clothing . Mr. Mulligan stood up , frowning . " What the hell , " he said . " Jase , what 's this ? Lionel , what 's he doing here today , dressed like a farmhand ? " Mr. Mulligan strove for umbrage , but he did not feel it . He simply wanted his distinguished guests to believe he was angry . His bald head shone with perspiration induced by the warmth of the day , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcloth suit , very sober and proper , his subdued cravat with its pearl pin , his embroidered vest , all very expensive , could not conceal the fact that here was a hearty , even gross man who loved life and knew how to make it enjoyable , and that , in spite of grim experience , he also loved people . " What the hell ? " he repeated , then bowed to the three ladies present . " Pardon me , " he said . The ladies nodded graciously . The two middle-aged gentlemen with them inclined their august heads . The rings on their thick fingers glittered under the chandelier . Lionel recognized them , of course , as Mr. Gordon Rumpell of the First National Bank and Mr. Edward Sunderland of the Belleville Savings Association . They were both presidents of their organizations , and were very distinguished indeed . They could have been brothers in their mutual rotundity , their florid coloring , their disillusioned and watchful brown eyes , their black eyebrows and their carefully waved white hair , their discreet cologne , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous farmers , they had done well for themselves and had gone to college . They were despairingly hated by those who owed them money , for they were men completely ruthless even when they smiled and were most agreeable . Mrs. Clementine Lindon was at her imperial best today , clad in a very costly dress of black silk with many ruffles and much lace . A long string of pearls lay on her big and handsome bosom , and there were diamonds in her ears near her vast pompadour of redly tinted hair . A white velvet hat , broad and very chic and swaying with many-colored ostrich plumes , perched on that fraudulent but tidy mass of polished strands and curls . Mrs. Lindon was extremely dainty and fastidious , and her voice was refined , her airs ladylike to parody , her scent advertising Paris , her shoes handmade , and her rings and bracelets testifying to wealth . But all of  | this could not overcome the coarse complexion , the hard if smiling eyes of an indeterminate hazel , and her thick and sensual mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was evident , even more ruthless than the bankers , and far less kind and sympathetic than Mr. Mulligan . She gave out an aura of corruption and exigency which her splendid apparel could not hide . However , she had moments of tolerance and even generosity . She had cultivated an aspect of gentility and graciousness which would have done credit to the late Queen Victoria  --  whom she had greatly admired ? though she was at least a foot taller than the deceased monarch . She could even appear brutal in a nice way , and was very intelligent , and was known not to endure nonsense . No one had ever been known to successfully cheat Mrs. Lindon . Attempts were greeted with implacable vengeance . Foolishness was not to be tolerated . She was a lady of immense common sense . She had invented a genteel background and a well-bred family in Philadelphia , but her remarks on this subject were pleasantly vague and dismissing , as if she were too modest to boast . No one persisted in any questioning . Mrs. Lindon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisitiveness which she proclaimed was vulgar anyway . Vulgarity was her favorite epithet , and condemnation . Mrs. Lindon could be very formidable when the occasion required it , and her corsets would creak in subdued agreement . Her young " cousins , " seventeen and eighteen , respectively , were like fresh daisies beside her ; Mrs. Lindon was fifty-three , or so she claimed . The girls were her prettiest , and were the dear friends of the two bankers , who had exclusive rights to them by careful negotiations with Mrs. Lindon . Mr. Sunderland , a widower with two adult sons in their thirties , was much enamored of little Loraine , with her innocent blue eyes and thick flaxen hair , the latter overpowering in its high rolled pompadour above her delicately tinted little face with its fine bones , its soft babyish mouth , and its fragile skin . She exuded an air of tender virginity , though she had been a whore since she was fourteen . Mrs. Lindon was very fond of Loraine , and had hopes that Mr. Sunderland would marry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprightly and lively brunette , as pretty in her way as Loraine , for she was all dark sparkle and vivacity , with a dark rose complexion , a lovely figure approaching  | womanly opulence , and a lot of perfumed black hair . She had a merry smile , very charming , and her teeth were sound and white , and she was known for her wit and quick laughter . She was eighteen , at the height of her beauty . Both girls were demurely clad , if one did not look at them too closely , for their white silk blouses , with the boned high necks and the ruffled tops to the chin , were of an extraordinary seduction and lewdness , composed of exquisitely frail handmade lace , almost imperceptible over nude flesh . At fleet moments one could glimpse rosy nipples , coy and rapidly disappearing . Their waists , however , were tightly corseted and seemed like the stems of flowers . Their skirts were of black velvet , their belts of silver leather . Each wore only a jeweled watch pinned precariously on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as white as the blouses , dexterously used to reveal and conceal . Mr. Rumpell was enchanted by Elsa . He was very generous to her  --  and to Mrs. Lindon . He had a short , lumpish wife , extremely sullen and unamenable , and three dowdy daughters , all much older than his young paramour , who , like Loraine , had been an experienced whore from the age of fourteen . Mrs. Lindon felt it incumbent now to lift her regal lorgnette ? only plain glass  --  to survey the young men who had so precipitately burst into the dining room . She knew them well . She especially favored Lionel , whom she had designated , not without admiration , as a scoundrel , but she respected Jason and had often told Mr. Mulligan he could be " absolutely trusted , " a trait that did not always appeal to her . Trustworthy men could often get in the way of clever negotiations , if these negotiations required a certain fleetness of foot and manipulation . However , she preferred , as lawyers , trustworthy men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and trustworthiness were frequently mutually exclusive . But a lawyer one could trust personally was one the law could trust too , which led to difficulties . Semantics , too , often were inconvenient , and trustworthy lawyers were apt to keep doggedly to the plain wording of the law . Well , she would say , one can not have everything in this world , though she did , herself , do rather well . " Lionel . . and Jason , I believe , " she said pleasantly . Though a heavy drinker of good whiskey , she did not possess the deep and husky voice of cheaper women . Jason might appear at this mo-  | ment as a lout , and Lionel might seem apprehensive , and stood in the background , but Clementine was not perturbed . She could see under appearances . That Jason was excited and agitated also excited her , for solid men were not easily made excitable . One had to beware of such as Lionel , who were very temperamental at times , and hasty . They were optimists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one money in the long run . " Well , what 's all this ? " demanded Mr. Mulligan , trying to make his voice irascible . Jason pulled a wide slim book from under his arm , a book Lionel had not noticed before . " I want to talk to you , Mr. Mulligan . Now . It ca n't wait . " It was as if he and Mr. Mulligan were entirely alone , though Lionel was acutely conscious of Loraine and Elsa , and their shirtwaists . Mr. Mulligan slowly seated himself , but he continued to stare at Jason . He , too , was now aware of something unusual . He said , " I 'm among friends , Jase . Say what you will . " For the first time Jason became fully aware of others at the table . Two were . . . bankers . There was also Mrs. Lindon , whom he liked in spite of his knowledge of her . He ignored the girls , who eyed him favorably . They were too accustomed to effete men , whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . Jason exuded masculinity , and a certain roughness . Both girls had had one encounter with Lionel , whom they designated to each other as " strange , " with very naughty giggles and some disapproval . " You might as well sit down , " said Mr. Mulligan . " Pull up a chair , Jase . " He hesitated . Then he filled one of the glasses with good wine and pushed it across the table . " You need calming down , " he said . " Drink it up . " He glanced at Lionel . " Reckon we do n't need you , Lionel . " Jason drank impatiently . He hardly tasted the wine . " Yes ! " he said . " I want Lionel here . It 'll be his business , too . " Clementine fixed her light hazel eyes with some compassion on Jason . Here was another innocent , always looking after a friend 's interest . Well , he 'd learn , God help him . Lionel , all fox 's ears now , stood deferentially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music from downstairs . Jason produced Mr. Schultz ' card and gave it to Mr. Mulligan , who stared at it in perplexity . But when he passed it on to the  | bankers , they became immediately tense and alert . They gave the card ceremoniously to Mrs. Lindon , then exchanged long glances . But they said nothing . " What 's it all about ? " asked Mr. Mulligan . " What 's Schultz got to do with you , Jase ? " Jason kept his voice quiet but strong . " You know the Shoulder , Mr. Mulligan ? Yes . I own fourteen acres oi " ' it , smack in the middle of the other eighteen acres . The best part . " " Oh , " said Mr. Mulligan , at sea . " Mr. Schultz wants to buy them from me , to build , he said , a resort hotel for us yokels here in Belleville . I do n't believe him for a minute . " Mr. Sunderland said , " I know of Mr. Schultz . He owns very fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also believe he owns family-resort hotels in other places in the Poconos . Farmhouse types , all clapboard and porches , which are full of children in the summer , and dogs and such . And croquet for the ladies , and tennis for the gentlemen , and ponds nearby for rowing . Very . . . rural . " Mr. Rumpell coughed . " Mr. Schultz , I believe , was looking for you , Jason . He came into the bank . We , by the way , hold nine of the acres on one side of your . . . property  --  estate dealings , I believe , and ? " Mrs. Lindon said , " And I own the other nine acres on the other side of your property , Jason . " " Good God ! " said Mr. Mulligan . " Why did you buy them , Clem ? " Mrs. Lindon lowered her eyelids . " I did think of an elegant establishment on the Shoulder , Pat . Fine food . Entertainment . But there were those fourteen acres right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your deed offices in Belleville are very slack , Patrick . And there is no decent road up to the property . " Mr. Sunderland gave Jason an understanding smile . " So , your land stands in the way of Mr. Schultz . Did he offer anything for them ? " Jason told him , and Mr. Sunderland nodded . " Are you considering selling them ? " " No , Mr. Sunderland . I have other ideas . " Mrs. Lindon leaned her great bosom on the table . " What do you want for your land , Jason ? "  | His gray eyes studied her . " I 'm not selling , Mrs. Lindon . " She smiled at him . She was so acute that she comprehended , and her regard for Jason increased . " I know , " she said . Her bosom heaved with excitement , and her mind with visions . " Why would anyone want to build a resort of any kind on the Shoulder ? " asked Mr. Mulligan . " Nothing here in Belleville to attract wealthy people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A marvelous view . I go there often , and I can see it . I even go in the winter . Beautiful . Secluded . Quiet . " He hesitated . " I 've been reading about skiing . " " Skiing ? " asked Mr. Mulligan , now completely perplexed . " Is n't that a Swiss sport or something ? Nobody would be interested in this country . " When Clementine spoke , everyone paid attention . " A magnificent exclusive year-round hotel ! Summer sports . Dancing . Gowns . Jewels . Pretty , entertaining young . . . ladies . Shops , such as they have in Paris . Boutiques . . . " " Shops , in a hotel ? " asked Mr. Mulligan , floundering . " Indeed , Pat . An exquisite restaurant . Wine cellars . Promenades , with a view . Tennis courts . Entertainers from New York . Hairdressers . Fashions . Oh , I see it all ! Pennsylvania never had such a thing before ! A whole center in itself ! Who would need a city nearby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding towns and country would be lured there also . And people would come from New York , as well as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . And even from Virginia . Just as they go down to Palm Beach . Flager did a wonderful job there , Pat . Built in the very middle of a jungle and marshes . People laughed at him . Now they are laughing on the other side of their faces . They could have bought the land . One must use one 's intelligence . . . " She saw the hotel she had in mind in a glorious fantasy . Four or five stories high , gorgeous suites , a ballroom , an arcade filled with expensive shops , soft green grass and gardens and grottoes and fountains , discreet dining rooms , luscious food , moonlight dancing , elegance , a small theater , a pool for swimming , tennis courts , rooms for gaming , a gracious European atmosphere . There were ten acres beyond the Shoulder . She would speak to Mr. Sunderland tonight . A golf course . Golf was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entranced by mere vi-  | sions . She had it all laid out in her practical mind . It only needed financing . And experience . She looked fondly at Mr. Mulligan . " No children , " she said . " A resort hotel such as I have in mind would be no place for children . Children do dirty up beauty and elegance . And the people who would come would not like the presence of screechers . " " But resort hotels always mention they are good for children , " said Mr. Mulligan , who felt he was quite out of his depth . What would a summer resort be without children ? " Does it ever occur to you , dear Pat , " said Clementine , " that not all people want the presence of children ? No children are admitted to Delmonico 's in New York , or other famous establishments . They belong in nurseries and schools , not the sort of resort hotel I have in mind . " She coughed delicately . " And the gentlemen . They are often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hotel . " Oh , no , thought Mr. Mulligan . Not a gilded brothel ! " The fine wives of New York , and their husbands , would find such a hotel a lovely escape from city life and families , " said Clementine . Mr. Mulligan felt appeased , but still was uneasy . " We could invite French designers , " said Clementine . " To show their offerings . " They had forgotten Jason . He said , " I own those acres right in the middle , Mrs. Lindon . " Mrs. Lindon regarded him . " So you do , Jason . Would you consider fifty dollars an acre ? " Jason looked at her long and coldly . " No . I want to be part of this . " He pushed his book towards her . " My grandfather , who lived in England for a time , bought this book . " Clementine slowly inspected it . " Um , " she said . She had forgotten exteriors and furnishings . Slowly she turned pages , while the gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surreptitiously fondled Jason 's knee , and he was oblivious . Loraine widened her blue eyes at him , and he did not see them . They were very perspicacious young ladies . They thought of their savings . The book concerned Hadley Hall , near Ipswich , and was luminously illustrated by drawings , hand-painted , of its appearance and interior . Built in the latter part of the eighteenth century , it was constructed of a very pale yellow brick and stucco , the center retracted between two large wings . It was two and a half stories  | high , with latticed windows and a great bronze door in the center , and a red-tiled roof and huge brick chimneys . It was definitely Georgian , but still had a light and airy atmosphere , strong yet not ponderous . Masses of enormous trees were gathered at the side of the wings and reared from the back , though the facade was clear and bright and open . A long straight driveway marched between clipped lawns and flowerbeds . Clementine turned the pages to the gardens . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick paths , grottoes , statues , fountains , flowerbeds of celestial color and beauty and form , topiary trees clipped in whimsical designs , and flowering hedges , and pools in which was reflected the tranquil foliage . " Yes , " said Clementine very softly , " I 've seen this for myself . It 's even more charming . I visited there for nearly two weeks . " No one thought to question her about this , which was just as well , because it was not true . She looked at the others with a sweet smile and passed the book to the gentlemen , who looked on it together , murmuring under their breath in appreciation . They came upon drawings of the many rooms , some very massively furnished with invaluable antiques , enormous carved staircases , or moldings of silver and gold , painted ceilings , floors like brown mirrors , wide-planked and satiny , pillared doorways with cornices of blue or white or green marble , azure walls or walls of the purest white or the most sanguine red or minty green or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs of subtle and delightful shadings and designs , draperies heavy with tassels and hung over filmy pale silk , portraits and landscapes and seascapes or serene mountains and valleys decorating every free space on the walls , candelabra of glittering silver and chandeliers dripping with prismatic light . There were a library , ballroom , and music room , faultlessly designed and equipped . " Must have cost millions , millions , " said Mr. Rumpell in a reverent voice . " Of pounds , that is . " Clementine leaned over to examine a page of text , and her swift eye read it all . " Well , no , " she said . " Five hundred thousand pounds in 1788 , which even now would be only four million dollars . " " Four million dollars , " Mr. Sunderland breathed , even more reverential than Mr. Rumpell . Mrs. Lindon slapped her jeweled hand loudly on the book . " We  | can build it for not much less than that on those thirty-two acres on the Shoulder . " Jason did not hear this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his dream . For over two years now he had pored over this book , studying the pictures of every room , the garden , the house itself . He thought of great bedrooms , silks , velvets , laces , canopies , commodes , carpets , carved doors , ornate glass lamps , marble bathrooms , a vast dining room with crimson damask walls and a yellow marble fireplace and round tables with gleaming linen and cutlery . He had thought of this , vaguely , but it had not come alive as a possibility until today . Now he looked at the others with passionate eagerness , and Lionel leaned from the doorway , his yellow eyes sparkling . " There is nothing like it in all of Pennsylvania , perhaps not in all the rest of the country , " said Mrs. Lindon . " Why , presidents could be entertained there ! Ambassadors ! We could call it . . . " ? she glanced at the text again ? " Ipswich House . " Mr. Sunderland cleared his throat . " There is the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red lips under a white mustache . " And this mansion was built over one hundred and eighteen years ago , " said Mr. Rumpell . " The cost today would be nearer seven million dollars . " " The Dow Jones averages are going down in the stock market these days , " said the other banker . " Everyone is prophesying a monetary crisis in 1907 . " " Pish , " said Clementine with a large wave of her hand , superbly dismissing the crass talk of money and panics . " You must take the spacious view , gentlemen . " She smiled kindly at Mr. Mulligan , whose mouth had fallen open . " How much can you borrow , Pat ? " " Me ? " Mr. Mulligan stuttered . " Five hundred thousand at the most , and that 'd include all my assets , I 'm thinking . Everything . " " That 's a good start , " said Clementine briskly . " I can borrow a million or so . " They all knew she was rich , but only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned in Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , New York , and Washington . Only the bankers knew that judges had respectfully suggested she remove her colorful presence from those cities , in lieu of onerous incarceration . She had left her properties in the very competent  --  and  | honest  --  hands of a gentleman rogue who was wanted in various other cities for some peculations and embezzlements , and whose history only she possessed . The stout bankers leaned back in their chairs and waited . Clementine turned to them . " Gordon ? Edward ? What do you say ? How much can your banks lend Pat and me ? With good interest , of course . Or , you could become partners , using your own money . " " Clementine . . . " said Mr. Sunderland , as if she had used a vulgar phrase . She shrugged . " Well . We can do it , one way or another . We do n't need the whole sum . Dear me . You 'll have to figure those odious things out for yourself . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeably . " Clementine , dearest , you must be mad . " " So are the Rockefellers , then , and the Morgans and the Belmonts . Faint hearts never made fortunes , and this could make us incredibly wealthy . Only the best people . The best prices . Discretion guaranteed . " Mr. Sunderland lifted a meaty palm . " Clementine . This would n't be a . . . a . . . " He glanced at the avid young ladies . " Not what you have in mind , my dear . Discreet , yes . Secluded , yes . Refined and cultured , yes . Distinguished , yes . " " I 'm happy to hear some yeses , " said Mrs. Lindon merrily . " How much , Gordon , Edward ? " Mr. Mulligan came to himself . He looked at his two employees . " Jason , Lionel . I think it 's time for you to leave . The Sunday guests will be arriving in about half an hour . " He looked with disapproval first at his watch , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive your blundering in here in that . . . cowshed attire , if you leave at once . " " I think , " said Jason in his firm strong voice , " that you have all forgotten something . " " And what is that , my lad , " said Mr. Rumpell with condescension . " I own fourteen acres of land right in the middle of your site . Without my land , all this will come to nothing . " The bankers glanced quickly at each other . " Very well , " said Mr. Sunderland after a very long and silent pause . " I 'll make you an offer for them . Fifty dollars an acre . A fortune . "  | " No , " said Jason . Lionel took a step closer to him . " Good God , what impudence , " said Mr. Rumpell . " Do n't you realize , young man , that we 've offered you a lot of money , more money than you 've ever seen before ? " Jason 's cheeks colored and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I also realize that nothing can be done up there without my acres . Mr. Schultz knows that . He wants my land . " Jason lifted his book . " I 'll let him see this . And I thank you for your interest , and for what I 've heard you say . You 've filled in spots I was n't certain of , so thank you again . " The bankers clenched their hands on their knees . " How much , then ? " " I want to be a partner . I want to manage it  --  under Mr. Mulligan , of course . And I want a chance for Lionel up there , too , as manager of the dining room and kitchens . All under Mr. Mulligan , of course . " He smiled at the confounded Mr. Mulligan like a son . " Dear me , " said Clementine , whose mind had been going like fireworks and whose thoughts had been as colorful . " Jason does have a point . And I know how competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about Lionel , too . They may be young , but they are sharp . And with Pat managing everything . . . why , it could be wonderful ! " Mr. Sunderland leaned toward Jason and deliberately let his eyes wander over his oafish clothing , his scoured hands , his dusty workman 's boots , his soiled blue shirt . " I think the less we have to say to this bumpkin , the better , " he said . " Now , see here , " said Mr. Mulligan . " He 's like a son to me , Jason . You ca n't insult the lad like that , in front of me , even though you 're a friend . Jason 's got a damned fine mind , and a lot of character . " He paused , for he was scarlet with anger . " And Lionel , here . You could n't get a better boy in any of your fancy cities , to do what he does . " His brogue had thickened . The bankers looked at him with incredulity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand the . . . the magnitude of what has been proposed to us , the money ? And you let this . . . this young man prattle about partnerships and whatnot , he who probably has n't two pennies to his name ! " In spite of his indignation , Mr. Mulligan was not without common sense . His dangerous color retreated . He gnawed a thumbnail and his eyes blinked furiously . He , too , for two years had been  | thinking of a certain matter . He suddenly beamed like a fat and rosy angel . He said , " Well , a partnership for fourteen acres  --  it does seem like too much , does n't it ? Jason , we are talking of millions of dollars  --  and you want a goddamned partnership for fourteen acres . " " There are ladies present ! " Mr. Rumpell said sternly . Mr. Mulligan waved grandly . " My apologies . Jason , do n't you understand ? For those fourteen acres you will get fifty dollars apiece . A fortune ! And I guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid salaries . " Jason looked at him with dogged pain . " Mr. Mulligan , why not put out shares ? I 've been reading the papers ? " " You mean , Jason , go public ? " asked Mrs. Lindon , who knew all about stocks . " But a closed concern ? Better ? " She had lost Jason now . But Mr. Mulligan had been listening . " Shares , " he said . He sat up very straight in his chair to impress the bankers . " Small salaries , but some shares . Lionel , you can put in some money if you want to . " Jason looked aside , and the pain was deeper on his face . " I have nothing , " he said , " Yes , you have , " said Mr. Mulligan , loving him like a father . " You have yourself , Jason , you have yourself . And that 's worth more than money . " " You talk as if this . . . preposterous matter is already settled , Pat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing . I 'm willing to talk about it , if Gordon also is willing . It will probably come to nothing . Millions of dollars are involved . Chairmen of the board to be consulted . Investors . Other banks . It 's a wild dream ! We have n't even broached the whole matter . We 're not playing tiddledywinks . We 're talking about money ! And the land has n't even been surveyed yet ! " He pursed his lips in outrage at all this nonsense . Clementine became very cheerful . " I think everyone has forgotten that I own nine acres on that Shoulder . Gordon , would your bank sell me the other nine ? " Shaken but smiling , Mr. Rumpell said with loverly indulgence , " And what would you do with them , Clem ? " She took up Mr. Schultz ' forgotten card and studied it thoroughly through her lorgnette . " I think I will talk to this Mr. Schultz , " she said .  | As Jason and Lionel went down the stairs , Lionel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am I dreaming , or dippy , or drunk ? " " I feel the same way , " said Jason . " I do n't know what will come of it , but I 'm sure there 'll be something . " " They were talking in millions , " said Lionel , awed . " And I was thinking of a modest hotel ! " said Jason , stunned . " Never tell them that , " said Lionel . " Or they 'll have you by the balls in two seconds . Think big , as the president says . " He laughed almost hysterically . " When it comes to millions , what are a few more or less ? " " I thought of a smaller resort than Hadley Hall , Lionel . " " Think of a bigger version . Well , back to work . See you tomorrow . " Jason slowly rode toward home on his bicycle through the Sunday-still streets , where only the sounds of raucous gramophones could be heard and the muted whine of children and the annoyed complaint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ragtime " pouring through open windows . Church bells had begun to ring for early-evening services . A few men sat on the steps of small porches or on stoops , conversing quietly together and smoking , or indulging in some half-suppressed male laughter . Wheels ground at a far distance , and occasionally there was an explosive snort from an automobile . Otherwise the quiet was undisturbed . Usually the squalid atmosphere of Sunday in a small town depressed Jason . Today he saw and heard nothing of it . At moments he felt incredulous ; at other moments he felt a surging exhilaration which resembled drunkenness . Sometimes his breath caught short  | in his throat ; sometimes he felt he was wheeling on air , far above the pavement . Money . What would it do for his family ? Everything . His grandfather had once said , " If money ca n't buy happiness , nothing else will , and niver you mind the nonsense of poor ' happiness . That is for the very young or foolish , or for one who lives only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry or with the rent not paid , and no job ? Only a babby wetly bubbling in its cradle . Money will give freedom ; freedom must be bought in this accursed world , and mind you , bucko , freedom is worth more than life itself . " Freedom . Jason thought of his mother in the hospital . He had visited Kate that morning . For some mysterious reason , she had appeared fragilely radiant , as if expecting some wondrous boon or joy . Her poor haggard face had taken on a hectic bloom ; her ravaged lips had been pink , her hand not so hot . " Yes , love , " she had said . " I feel much better . " Jason had looked about the small wretched room which was so determinedly clean , at the two sagging beds , one of which his mother occupied , at the curtainless little window , at the two commodes and the single kitchen chair . Poverty . The other bed contained a very old woman , a gray shadow of a human being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a grim world , forgotten , nameless . She had stared sightlessly at Jason and then had called him " Jim . " Her almost inaudible cry had been full of longing and despair . It was from this atmosphere that Jason and Bernard wished to remove Kate : a room of her own , undisturbed by the anguish of another human being . Kate worried about her roommate and the natural indignities of very old age and abandonment . " Mrs. Flood does n't know , " Jason had told his mother , and his mother had gazed at him with pain in her fever-bright eyes . " Who told you that , then , Jason ? " she had asked , and he had no answer . Kate also worried about the money being spent for her in the hospital . She never said a word , but she hoped she would die soon so as not to be a burden on those she loved . A week ago she had received extreme unction , and had raffled , a miraculous event not unknown to priests . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair near the window . From that day on she had coughed less than usual , and the blood did not appear so often from her riddled  | lungs . She claimed to " enjoy " the miserable food , the food of a poverty-stricken little hospital . Never once had she complained during the weeks of her confinement here . The nuns said she was a " saint , " at which Bernard had nodded his head . Jason 's strong pedaling legs slowed . There would be money ? but it would not be in time to help Kate . He thought of his fourteen acres , so necessary for the phantom hotel gleaming in pale gold on a far horizon , a horizon in the future . He had time ; Kate did not . He had been offered fifty dollars an acre . It was an enormous sum . It would remove Kate immediately from her disheartening environment . It would provide her with better food and a nurse for herself  --  at home . It would give her the comfort she never had had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry . His heart sickened as his dream retreated . But his mother was more important than dreams . She had never asked for anything . It was time for her to receive , late as it was . The pedaling came to a stop at a corner . Dusk was increasing ; the forlorn street melted into it . A chill wind chased away the day 's earlier warmth . The mountains became mere ashen ghosts against an ashen sky , and most of them faded into obscurity . A gust arose , bringing grit against eye and teeth . I must think of my mother , said Jason to himself , and it seemed to him that his heart sank like cold lead with this resolution . But above all there was his mother  --  he could wait . Something stirred in him as if someone had spoken , but he could not distinguish what was said . He went on more quickly , without hope but with less pain . The euphoria was gone ; he moved as one under a drug . He would tell his grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pragmatic Bernard would not agree with him , for above all , Bernard was a realist , and not even love could delude him . There would be hundreds of dollars for Kate . That would be enough to tell Bernard . The kitchen gaslight had been turned on in the dreary small house . His grandfather , at least , should be there . It was not time for him to take up the last hours in Mr. Saul Weitzman 's shop , the shop Bernard had sold years ago on inheriting it from Joe Maggiotti . Joan should be there , home from her outing with the " woman . " But Jason had the alarming sensation that the house  | was empty . He did not , in his haste to go inside , notice a bicycle leaning against the wall . He flung open the door of the kitchen . There at the table sat Bernard , not moving , with a bottle of cheap whiskey at his elbow on the table . And there , also , was Father Sweeney , as silent , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men looked up at Jason as he entered , and he felt that something calamitous awaited him . " Where have you been , then , all these hours ? " asked Bernard , but his voice was without emphasis . It sounded both indifferent and exhausted . " On the mountain , as usual , " replied Jason . He glanced at the priest , and a chill ran over his flesh . " Joan ? " he said . " Something 's happened to Joan ? " The gas mantle was suddenly surrounded by a wavering halo . He felt a nauseating drop in his stomach . " No , " said Bernard , and he shifted in his chair . He took up his glass of whiskey . A tear slowly ran down his cheek . " It 's your mum . She is dead . " He drank deeply . His head dropped , and he looked old and broken . The priest gazed at Jason compassionately . " No , " said Jason . Bernard began to speak , as if he were alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering . His voice was slow and hoarse and without emotion . He looked at nothing but the glass in his hand . Jason stood near him , motionless . The brick walls , the varnished ceiling , all the furniture in the room became stark , strange , unfamiliar . Bernard had worked that morning and until two o'clock at Mr. Weitzman 's shop . Then he had gone to see Kate at the hospital . She had greeted him with her own sweet and gentle smile . He had sat beside her , holding her hand , while the very old woman in the next bed peevishly complained about her children " messin ' up my kitchen . " She had been unusually restless . Bernard had seen too many consumptives to be deceived by Kate 's brightness and soft chatter , her quick lucidity , her appearance of restored life . He had gone out to the elderly nun who patrolled the hospital . She had assured him that Mrs. Garrity was " much better today , " though she had not got out of bed even once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweeney . " But  | Father Sweeney had been called in an emergency and was not expected back soon . " I sat there . I looked at her . She chattered . She even laughed . She talked of you , Jason , and Jack and Joanie . She said , You 'll be looking after them , wo n't you , Da ? ' I said I would . She sat up , and kissed me , and smiled . She lay down , still smiling , still looking at me with those dear eyes . . . . Then I knew she was dead . " Bernard took another hard swallow of whiskey . " The old lady near Katie  --  she said , An angel just walked out of the room , ' and she clapped her hands . I knew she was right . An angel . . . left . " Jason blindly reached for a chair and fell into it . He could as yet feel nothing . " So , " said Bernard . Now he turned ponderously to the priest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Tell me , bucko , " he said . " What did Katie do to deserve her life and her death ? Tell me ! " and he struck his clenched fist with sudden violence on the table , and the glasses and the bottle jumped . " Tell me , " he shouted , " damn you ! " " Bernard . . . " said the young priest . But Bernard shook his head like an old wounded bull . " Give me none of your homilies , Bill . Tell me no lies of the sufferings of the just . ' Why should they suffer ? Are they an amusement to your God , Bill ? A sacrifice  --  to what ? Why do n't the wicked suffer ? It 's in your Bible , is n't it , that the wicked flourish like a green bay tree and their children dance with joy in the streets ? Why is it that the gentle and the good and the innocent are tortured ? Why are the faithful always deceived , the trusting betrayed ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world ! Who made him the prince , who allowed him to be the prince ? Your God . So . . . our Lord suffered on Calvary . Was it worth his sacrifice ? Who made this evil world , the murderer of the sweet and pure and honest and just ? Your God , damn you ! " Katie knew no comfort in her poor loving life . No peace , no laughter . Only work and pain . What did she do to offend your God ? Did her virtue outrage him , and so he sent suffering to her in revenge ? Do n't tell me that she 's now at peace , among the angels , playing a harp ! Is that a reward for her blameless life , then ? Christ ! " He put his veined hands over his eyes and wept the racking and terrible tears of the old . " There is no God , " he said behind his  | hands . " There is only the Devil . Perhaps we should worship him instead of ? " " Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified only four years ago , but was now only dismayed by the old man 's pain . " I 've lived a long time , " said the hidden Bernard . " And niver have I seen the good protected and rewarded . But I 've seen the wicked given the fruits  --  I 've seen the innocent hanged and stabbed . I 've seen the bad drink , laugh , and wench while the women and children starve . I 've seen the noble despised and kicked , and looted and driven to starvation . I 've seen thieves prosper and die a holy death . " He dropped his hands and his whole face was ablaze . " Tell me ! Tell me your lies , your excuses , your fairy tales ! " Father Sweeney drew a deep breath . He thought of his teachings in the seminary . He said , " I do n't know . God help me , I do n't know . " He would not have said this earlier . Something in his voice alerted the desolate Bernard . Pity moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and held it . " For the first time you 're honest , Bill . " The priest said in a low voice , " Job asked the same questions . " " And what was the answer , then ? " The priest 's young face saddened . " God 's own questions of Job are more . . . enlightening , more inspiring , than any answer . " He looked into the distance . " Where were you when I laid the foundations of the world  --  Arcturus with his sons ? " " Shit , " said Bernard . " We 're only men , only human . Did he expect us to converse in eternities ? " He threw the priest 's hand from him . " Yes , " said the priest , " because we , too , are eternal . " The priest looked inspired , uplifted , as if he had heard a question that was an answer . " Do the wicked have the consolation of God ? Do they hear his voice ? No . But the good hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the gift of life . The evil have only death . In the end they are betrayed by themselves . " " Silly lies , " said Bernard , and he wept again . The priest stood up , and his youthful face looked very old . He said to Jason , " Console him . " " I ? " said Jason out of his stupefied agony .  | The priest contemplated him for a long moment . " Yes , " he said . " You . " He walked to the door , paused , and said , " It is vespers . I will return in the morning . " He left the house . Jason drew his chair closer to his grandfather . He felt his own grief lifting like a torch in his chest . He looked about the kitchen ; he heard the silence in the house ; he felt the loneliness . Always he had believed that his mother would return here , restored to health . That she was dead was incredible to him , not to be believed . Mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mum ? At any moment he expected to hear her loving voice in answer . The chill breeze outside had become a wind . It hammered at the wall , against the windows . The gaslight flickered in a draft . The stove was cold ; the brick walls had become remote , freezing . Bernard 's loud weeping had diminished , the now silent tears testifying to a sorrow too deep for words . When Jason put his hand on his shoulder Bernard started . " Da , " said the youth . Bernard said in a voice totally devoid of any feeling , " I 've sent a telegram to Jack . Joanie will stay the night with Molly Nolan . The woman will be here in the morning . " " Da , " said Jason again . Now his face became like carved old wood , hard and harsh . " You were right . God is the . . . adversary . We ca n't contend with him . He 's our . . . enemy . " He thought of the bankers he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harlots ; he thought of the wine and the rich sauces and the silver . Jason added , " That is , if there is a God . I do n't believe it . The world would be a different place if he existed . Let 's forget him . Mum 's safe from him  --  if he lives . He ca n't hurt her any longer . " Bernard stared . The tears dried on his cheeks . His mouth became tremulous . He rubbed one calloused hand slowly over it . His eyes never left Jason . " lase , " Bernard said , and then halted . He rubbed his mouth again . " If there is no God . . . there is n't anything for Katie , either . She deserves a God . " " She deserves rest and peace more , Da . " Bernard 's vivid gaze moved about the room . He listened to the silence , disturbed only by the hollow thud of the wind . He said , " I 'd like to think there is a God  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she saw an angel . . . . I 'd like to believe it was Katie , going home . "  | Jason looked down at the table with its oilcloth covering . " Let 's believe it , then , " he said in a voice as emotionless as his grandfather 's had been . " I do n't want to believe in lies , " said Bernard . " A lie is the cruelest thing in the world , I 'm thinking . " Jason said with loud bitterness , " What is it you are always saying is the motto of the Irish ? We endure . ' That is all we can do . It 's the only truth any man has , the only hope he has  --  to endure . " Bernard poured more whiskey into his glass . He turned it about in his fingers , staring down into the contents . " I could n't think , I do n't want to think , that six feet of dirt is all Katie is going to have . " Jason shivered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard sipped a little . " She had some moments , Jason . She loved us . Perhaps she still does . Who can tell ? And we loved her , you and I. If you love someone , you never forget . You never move far away . " Jason went to the sink and pumped himself a glass of water . Oh , Mum , he thought . He felt the tears burning behind his eyes . He looked at the wall above the sink and saw his face in the little mirror that hung there . He saw the mountain and the valley as he had seen them this morning . He saw the sudden unearthly incandescence on them and felt the peace . There was something he had forgotten . What was it ? Mysterious , exultant , promising . A lie , he thought , and dashed the water into the sink . He felt Bernard 's big hand on his shoulder . He felt Bernard slowly turning him to face himself . " Jason , " said the old man . " All we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when we hate him and demand of him and scream at him . What else is there ? A wilderness full of stones . A desert . For our own sakes , we must believe . " " We must be cowards and believe in a lie ? " Bernard moved his hands down to Jason 's arms , and he gripped them . His eyes filled with tears again . " Can we prove he is a lie ? The invention of priests ? What ca n't be imagined does n't exist , never comes to the mind of a man . I was niver one with words . If a man thinks there is Something , there must be something . How else can he think of it at all ? " " Being afraid , " said Jason . Bernard gently shook him . " The fear of God is the beginning  | of wisdom . ' Why do we have fear ? Is it in our souls , then , that we fear what is ? Can you imagine being afraid of something that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ? No . " He looked down earnestly into Jason 's tormented eyes . " No one has proved the existence of God . But no one has proved he does n't exist , either . It is better for a man to hope that he is than to deny that he does . " Jason turned away his head . " Then , Da , you believe in him . " Bernard dropped his hands . There was a little silence . Then Bernard said , and his voice shook , " I believe . . . I believe . . . even when I hate him . " Jason made a sound in his throat , the beginning of derision . Then he remembered those moments of awesome enlightenment , of glory , of encompassing love , of complete understanding . From what source had they come ? He had not invited them or even desired them ; he had never known there were such things . He wanted to tell Bernard , but how do you describe the ineffable , that which can not be comprehended but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . Bernard looked at him , waiting . " Oh , Da ! " Jason groaned . They fell into each other 's arms and cried together , and were comforted .  | " We must all come to dust , " said John Garrity after his mother 's funeral . He spoke with the cold and unctuous voice of reproving authority . His brother looked at him with considerable of the grandfather 's bitter rage and disgust . " So we do , " he said . " But why should Mum have come to it with so much misery , eh , and so much pain ? She never had , in my memory , a truly pleasant day . " " She ? " began John . Bernard lifted his hand . They were sitting in the kitchen on this dull April day so unlike the day Kate Garrity had died . Rain slashed the windows , and storm clouds , black and heavy , rushed across the sky like galleons with open sails . It was only three in the afternoon of Kate 's burial day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan , wrapped in a shawl , was whimpering in the background . Bernard sat at the table , wearily slumped , with a bottle of whiskey at his elbow , and Jason drank tea laced with the whiskey . The " woman , " overcome , as she said , by the funeral , had left for the day . John sat stiffly upright in his chair in his black seminarian 's suit , white shirt with stiff collar , thin black tie , and stiff white cuffs . He looked fleshless and ascetic , as usual , and his prominent cheekbones gleamed in the gaslight like polished stone , and his small slate-colored eyes were remote and censorious . His hair was cropped . He was only a seminarian , and one on probation , yet he resembled an archaic priest of the Inquisition , a zealot , an icy fanatic , and Bernard , looking at him through an alcoholic haze , wondered if his grandson had bowels and blood and human flesh , or possessed any human emotions whatsoever . Bernard doubted it . This was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sorrow , never a grand-  | son or a son or a brother . He had been as apart from the family as a statue , except for a great fondness for his sister . On a few occasions Bernard had had unpleasant and unspeakable thoughts about this . He had encountered such in his own seminarian days . Bernard said , " Katie 's life has made me an atheist , to some extent . " " We must accept the will of God , " said John , and glanced at his sister for approval . She nodded eagerly at him . " If we do , always , we 're damned fools , " said Bernard . " Seems to me , I 'm thinking , that we get out of the mud and stench by our own will , and God , it was , who put us in the mud and the stench ? by his will . Should we stay there ? Ah , shut up , Jack . Do n't give us your homilies on this tragic day . You noticed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us of the blessedness ' of poor Katie 's life , nor did he suggest she was singing her head off in heaven now . He said , with truth , that she was at peace at last and was resting from her labors . Sure , and he 's made progress from the early days , when he was almost as stupid as you are , Jack . " His red-rimmed eyes sparkled derisively at his grandson . " And a fine altar boy you were , too , glaring at the younger lads who were fumbling their best at Mass . What Christian charity ! But you never heard of that , did you ? " Jack had clasped his slender bony hands on his black fleshless knee , and those hands involuntarily clenched with affront . He looked at his grandfather 's hostile face , at the closed hard face of his brother . Hastily he directed another glance at his sister , at her pale luminous face , her black-lashed blue eyes . For a moment he wanted to weep , but it was not for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . Only Joan . Kate had been a loving , foolish woman whose duty it had been to serve her family . John granted that in most instances she had done her duty , feeble as it was . I truly tried , he thought , to be forbearing and patient with her ineptitude . I have tried and prayed , in connection with Da and Jason . But they are intransigent and obstinate and dull of wit , and often impious . I can only pray for them now . Bernard said , " Thank God I had saved a bit of money over all these years to pay for a funeral for Katie , so she would n't lie in a pauper 's grave . And there is enough left as an offering for a few Masses for the repose of her soul , though I doubt she needs them . "  | " We all do , " said John . He was already restive . He wondered how soon he could decently leave for his seminary , where there were no sardonic men like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring like a great black Irish bull . John was hungry . He had always been hungry , from the earliest childhood , though he had invariably eaten much more than his brother . In fact , he had eaten far more than his brother , grandfather , sister , and mother combined . Yet , never had he been comforted and replete . There had always been a hunger in him , which he now believed was a hunger for God and godliness . Yet , still , even in the seminary , that hunger did not abate . He believed , however , that when he was ordained , this tearing hidden appetite , this consuming desire , would be satisfied , as it was never satisfied by food . He had heard much of the rapture and ecstasy of the saints , and he lusted for it . It would come , he was certain , when he was ordained . Jason said , " I hope , my only hope , is that Mum does n't remember anything of her life . I hope she is dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have peace . " His young man 's voice was almost brutal as he looked at his brother . " That 's a sinful thought , " said John . He would never have admitted that he hated Jason ; that was a mortal sin . But the hate , a lifelong hate , was there , though John called it disapproval . He often prayed that Jason 's soul might be saved . He looked at the two huge baskets , covered with white linen , which had just been delivered from the Inn-Tavern , courtesy of Patrick Mulligan . The linen could not completely smother the rich fragrance of roasted beef and fresh bread and fruit and cake and ham and baked beans . John 's mouth watered . It was going on for four , and his hunger gripped his middle like iron fingers . When could he suggest eating ? There was no sign of hunger in the rest of the family , he thought with resentment . The wind rattled the stovepipe ; the rain was a long drumming on the window . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surly and threatening , and a flash of lightning . Neighbors , who had called to console the family , and who had attended Kate 's funeral , had long departed . Bernard had shown , unmistakably , that their absence would be appreciated . It had been a grand funeral . Mrs. Lindon had given all the flowers for the altar and for Katie 's simple wooden coffin with the brass han-  | dies . Katie 's grave had been heaped with flowers from the same source . Mrs. Lindon and all her young relatives had been at Mass , wearing solemn and decorous faces . John thought it a scandal , and he wondered why Father Sweeney had permitted this evil intrusion . When he had protested the flowers , Bernard had looked at him with a threatening face . " Seems like our Lord was grateful to Mary Magdalen when she brought him ointment to soothe his feet , " Bernard had said . " But then , and for sure , you do n't understand that , do you , Jackie lad ? Think on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the fine ladies who bedded down only with their husbands . " John had forgiven his grandfather , who , of course , was only a rude peasant , for all he had had a teacher for a father and had studied for the priesthood . John was always forgiving his family . It made him feel very holy . None of the family knew , of course , that Mrs. Lindon , who had been a caller after the funeral , had looked at Joan with thoughtful shrewd eyes , saying to herself , " There is one of us , and that is certain . I 'm never mistaken . If it were n't for her crippled state , she would be a very successful courtesan , not a mere whore . I wonder how twisted her legs are ? There 're some perverted men who like disabled women , even ugly and deformed women . This girl is the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen , and no doubt she is a virgin , too . " Mrs. Lindon always detected corruption ; she knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corruption had nothing to do with experience . It was a matter of spirit . Joan , who had heard some vague rumors that Mrs. Lindon was a scandalous woman , did not quite understand where the scandal lay or what it implied . The " woman " had mentioned " men , " but Joan had had no explicit understanding . Kate , of course , had had no words with which to instruct her daughter , nor would she have thought it necessary . But Joan had looked at Mrs. Lindon , and the two had felt an instant kinship . Mrs. Lindon , thought Joan , was " nice " and " kind . " And very stylish and handsome . Joan had looked covetously at Mrs. Lindon 's jeweled hands , her beautiful suit of dark blue wool , and her fur and her smart hat and her rope of pearls and her well-coiffed hair . Joan had been much impressed that Mrs. Lindon had arrived in a new automobile , followed by another containing her young cousins and nieces , all richly and suitably clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | pearls . Joan thought them lovely and magnificent . Some were younger than herself , she thought enviously , but none was prettier . How wonderful to have wealthy parents ! How wonderful to have such a cousin or aunt ! Joan had heard of dances and parties in Mrs. Lindon 's house . She nurtured a dim hope that someday Mrs. Lindon would invite her , too . So she had fawned sweetly on Mrs. Lindon and had given shy radiant smiles to the young relatives , who were much amused both by her recognized depravity and by her naivete . Joan had seen people whispering behind their hands , and had been impatient . It was only envy , of course . What on earth were such as Mrs. Lindon and her relatives doing in Belle-ville ? Mr. Mulligan and his daughter , Patricia , " that stuck-up girl , " had been at the funeral , though they had not gone to the cemetery . Mr. Mulligan had put his arm about Jason , but had given John only a brief nod . This had puzzled Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but John was studying for the priesthood , and that was a vast difference in status . Joan had resented Patricia 's haughty air and condescending nod , but had consoled herself with the silent observation that Patricia was very plain , and no match in appearance for Mrs. Lindon 's beautiful young relafives . Patricia had drawn her velvet skirts aside when Mrs. Lindon and her charges had passed her in the pew , and Joan thought that had been very rude and was no doubt inspired by jealousy . Patricia had given Joan a swift look of acrimony because of Joan 's beauty , but was mollified when she saw Joan 's wheeled chair , pushed by a small nondescript woman , obviously a servant . A slight contemptuous smile had lifted Patricia 's pale lip . Lionel and Molly had been there , of course , and Joan 's shriveled heart had expanded at the sight of Lionel . He in turn was freshly struck by Joan 's imperial loveliness . What did it matter that she was a cripple ? Her body itself was perfection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frock , the old wool coat . Joan 's blue eyes were spectacular . She made the young whores look like drabs and strumpets . There was a regality about her , an untouchable delicate splendor . Lionel , too , had long ago sensed Joan 's innate corruption of spirit , just like his own , and he loved her and was determined to have her , one way or another . When Joan had passed him in her chair , Lionel had bent and kissed her chastely on the cheek , and had touched her shoulder in  | consolation . Joan wondered at the sudden wild fire in her vitals , and her trembling . Lionel had felt this even more violently in himself , but he had not wondered . Molly , with her acute perception , had sensed something of this exchange between Joan and her brother , and she had been disturbed . Innocent though she was herself , she felt something wicked had transpired , or that dangerous people had touched each other in a manner inexplicable to her , and had known each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle to the door , Molly had seen that Lionel 's eyes followed her and were filled with a curious deep longing and a forgetfulness of where he was . It was the first time he had kissed the girl . There was still a tingling on his lips , and a sharp thirst . When he finally turned and looked at his sister , he was surprised to see alarm in those clear yellow eyes . Molly 's hair , like his own , was a blaze of red in the shadowed gloom of the little church . The organ moaned dolorously , but Molly continued to eye her brother with that confused apprehension . Jason , one of the pallbearers for his mother , had gone before , but Molly had looked at him with yearning , and he had not seen her . She had wanted to touch him , desperately , but that was not possible for a girl so innocent , so truly innocent . The peal of the bell tolled , in her heart , like a dark premonition , leaving desolation behind . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guided her out of the church . Their parents were not there . They were too busy . Joan had watched , in the approaching rainstorm , the lowering of her mother 's coffin into the wet brown grave . She had cried . That was not hard , thinking of Lionel and his kiss and the ecstasy it had brought her . They were the first tears she had shed , and people thought them very touching . Even Jason thought so . Bernard was not deceived , though he did wonder at the source of the tears . They were certainly not for poor Katie . Nor was Joan sentimental , nor could she produce tears at will . There were but two real mourners at that funeral , Bernard and Jason . They were not resigned . They had not been consoled by the funeral Mass . They were consumed by bitterness and sorrow . They were almost alone at the cemetery . Rain struck their faces . John was becoming ravenously hungry . The fragrance of the waiting food was unbearable . He had to wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that Father Sweeney came in to console the bereaved family . Jason and John rose , Joan stirred in her chair , but Bernard surveyed the priest irascibly , and merely leaned back in his chair . " I congratulate you , Bill , " he said mockingly , lifting a glass of whiskey in salute . " You did n't utter one hypocritical or pious word at Katie 's funeral . " John said , dropping to his bony knees , " Your blessing , Father . " The young priest hesitated . He looked at Bernard 's bitterly smiling face , at the silent Jason . Father Sweeney thought that he would have preferred to give the old man and Jason his blessing , rather than John , and he was alarmed at this , which was surely uncharitable and unfitting . Coloring a little , he murmured the requested words , but he felt a faint coldness in himself . John was improving somewhat at the seminary , but he was still on probation . The old fathers were still ambiguous about his vocation . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloth . The fathers were inclined to believe in the " unworthiness , " considering his scrupulosity , but they could not condemn him for sloth . " A busier bee was never known here before , " one old priest had said , with some dissatisfaction . After the requested blessing , Father Sweeney looked about him with some helplessness . " You 'll be having a drink with us , Faether , " said Bernard , lapsing into his richest brogue . " To Katie , for her blameless life , and in hope for her peace , at last . " He poured a large dollop of Irish whiskey into an empty glass and extended it , as a challenge , to the priest . Father Sweeney , like all Irishmen , could not resist a challenge . He took the glass , still standing , and said thank you . He saw that John was regarding all this with coldly furious umbrage . So the priest lifted the glass , sipped at it with the other two men , and said , " Amen . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This family was blessed in Kate Garrity , " Father Sweeney continued . " A noble lady in all her ways . Her memory will be cherished , her presence dearly missed . I have never known , Bernard , a more tender and gentle soul , devout and kind , almost sinless . If sins she had , they were the sins of putting her family before all else . But I do not think our Lord will hold that against her . "  | " If he did , he would have to hold it against his blessed Mother , too , " said Bernard . " There is a difference , " said John . Bernard gave him one of his formidable looks . " There is , eh ? " he replied . " And how would you know of any difference , you who never loved anyone ? " John involuntarily glanced at his sister , who gave him a slight sympathetic smile . Then his hunger assailed him . He went to the cupboard for plates . " Will you join us , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain stiff grace . " Ah , yes , " said Bernard . " It seems you always did have a fork in your hand , bucko . Well , get at the victuals . Your damned mouth is watering . " Jason sat , his big arms folded over his chest , and he looked at his brother with open hostility . Joan said , " We have n't had anything since breakfast , after the funeral . I 'm hungry , too . " Her usually delicately tinted cheeks were flushed with remembrance of Lionel . The priest sat down after furtively inspecting his watch and then replacing it . " I have about half an hour , " he said . John was eagerly uncovering the hampers of food . " I 'm going back to the seminary tomorrow , Father , " he said . " Thank God , " said Bernard , putting a slice of ham and another slice of roast beef on the priest 's plate . " A small blessing , but an appreciated one . " " Da . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joanie , " said Bernard . Jason looked at the food and felt repelled . His sorrow was like an iron ball heated to fire in his chest . He would never , now , be able to do anything for his mother , to make her life more pleasant , less painful . He felt her presence in the kitchen , that gentle , tender presence , and his eyes darkened with tears . There was no mercy for the blameless , the kind , the trusting . Yes , God was the adversary . Man had to contend with him all the days of his life . But even in his pain Jason thought : Better a terrible world with God in it than a painless world without him . He was stunned by his own thought . John , forgetting everything completely , devoured the food piled on his plate . His expression was orgiastic , his eyes fixed and glazed and intent on what he was eating . He bent over the table as a priest bends to kiss the altar .  | Observing this , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he wants , what is he really devouring , what is the source of his hunger ? He was not revolted by John . For the first time he felt an awful compassion for him . Of all the Garrity family , he was the most needful of pity . As if in counterpoint , the wind howled dolorously in the chimney .  | Patricia Mulligan sat with her father in the huge ugly dining room of Patrick 's house . It was a warm Monday afternoon in late May 1907 . Patrick felt it was his paternal duty to dine with his daughter once a week , instead of eating at the Inn-Tavern . Besides , he liked his own dining room better than the one at the hotel , with its lighter furniture and its numerous windows and scintillating chandeliers . His taste , and the public 's , collided ; he conceded gracefully to the public . But he was happiest here , among the enormous furniture of dark red mahogany , brown velvet draperies , and wavering gaslight . Patricia thought her father 's table manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gulped at his wineglass ; he shoveled in his food , in a very ill-bred haste . He was also getting very fat , she thought with distaste . He ate in his shirtsleeves , despite her protests , wearing his vest open , his watch chain strained across his ample belly . He often took off his collar , too , and his tie , in what his daughter thought was a deliberate affront , and often she was right . But she was the center of his heart , for all , he would reflect , the poor colleen did have her airs and pretensions and lack of real intelligence . He gave her no credit for her secret shrewdness , for he did not know she had any . While she was not corrupt in spirit , as was Joan Garrity , she knew the world much better than did the other girl . She was also sly . And she had a Problem , which must be handled with dexterity . Her agate-colored eyes studied him tonight . Though he had little taste for formality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patricia was always dressed elegantly at the table . Today she wore a white silk shirtwaist , buttoned to the throat , with a pearl-  | and-diamond pin and pearl-and-diamond earrings , and two pearledged combs upholding her brown pompadour  --  filled out with " rats " ? and a black silk skirt and soft kid buttoned shoes . There was a pearl ring on her finger which had belonged to her dead mother . She looked almost pretty ; there was a pink tint in her thin cheeks , and her eyes had an unusual sparkle and her tilted nose gave her an expression at once haughty yet flippant . She had a slightly dreaming expression , alien to her , for Patricia was a very practical girl . Though she had little of a figure , she had discreetly filled it out on the chest with pads of cotton under her camisole . There was also padding over her narrow hips . Patrick thought she had begun to " bloom . " He did not know of the artifices , of which he would have disapproved . Glancing fondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , he thought again of something he had been earnestly considering for over two years . After all , she was twenty years old now , and an heiress . Her own mother had been a wife and mother for two years at this age . Patricia was getting on . She had nothing but disdain for the eligible young men in Belleville , and never encouraged them . But she did speak too often of the fine young gentlemen who courted her when she was visiting her aunt in Philadelphia . Patrick distrusted them . He would not have his daughter leave him for another city , and for what were rakes in his estimation . Opportunists . Adventurers . Patricia said , in her light voice which was always a little petulant , as if she were chronically displeased , as she was , " Dada , I do think that , as your daughter , I should visit the Inn-Tavern occasionally for dinner . In your company , of course . " " No , " said Patrick . Then he looked at her with surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She shrugged her shoulders . " I never thought it concerned me , Dada . Now I know it does . After all , I will inherit it , wo n't I ? I should know about it . You agree with that , do n't you ? " Patrick was about to disagree ; then all at once , and for the first time , to his surprise , he saw that Patricia 's eyes were quite sharp and knowing , and not soft and girlish at all . He was not entirely pleased , however , for girls should be vague and soft and womanly , not concerned with business or the world . But then , she had a point there . She was his heiress . He decided , with sudden pleasure , that Patricia resembled him in spirit . But he wavered . He refilled his wineglass , before the housemaid  | could do so , and Patricia frowned . Really , Dada 's manners were execrable . Her thought did not distract her . She leaned toward her father , waiting . Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every moment . " It 's time you got married , my girl . " As he had hinted this  --  more than hinted  --  several times , to Patricia 's cool indifference , he was surprised to see the sudden hot flush appear on her cheekbones . She also averted her eyes . " Who ? " she murmured . Her heart was making her silk shirtwaist tremble with its quick pounding . Patrick reflected . Too soon , perhaps , to tell her whom he had in mind ? " Well , " he said , watching her , " there 's Dave Muirhead , Frank Flaherty , and others . " He paused . " And my young assistant , Jason Garrity . " Patricia was about to say , throwing up her hands , at the lastnamed , " Oh , my God , Dada ! " But she was a very careful girl . She knew of Patrick 's affection for Jason Garrity , whom she despised as ill-bred like her father . He was not in the least elegant ; he was not , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graces , no delicacies , no subtlety , no fascination . He was a lout . His hands and feet were too big , his body too forceful in appearance , his step too hard and firm , his face too overtly male . So unlike . . . So Patricia merely folded her hands on the table and looked at her father with meekness . " I do n't really like any of them , Dada . But . . . give me time , wo n't you ? I do so want to be your little girl for a while longer . Please ? " Patricia could be very artful and she knew how to manage her father . Patrick 's rosy face blushed more deeply as she continued . " And I do n't want to marry someone who does not live in Belleville or who would take me away from my home . " Astonished delight shone on Patrick 's face . " And I thought you always wanted to get out of this town , love ! I was always afraid you would marry someone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetest smile , which was an effort for her . " I 've come to my senses , Dada . I do n't want to leave you , ever . " " Love , love , " said Patrick , sentimentally close to tears . " And I 'll have grandchildren to dandle on my knee every day ! " Patricia blushed violently , and her whole meager body tingled and her heart bounded . She dropped her eyes in a virginal fashion ,  | and seeing this , Patrick was remorseful . A man should not speak to his daughter in any way which suggested Bed . He was touched by her deep blushes . He was a crude bastard , that he was , to offend her maidenly sensibilities in this fashion . It was bad enough for a poor colleen to face the realities of matrimony on her wedding night , without implying them beforehand . That " good " women ever had lusts of their own , Patrick did not believe . Passion was reserved for mistresses and whores . " Good " women merely endured conjugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forgive me , love , " he said to Patricia now . Patrick was well-softened , to Patricia 's satisfaction ; she said , " Well , may I dine with you once a week at the Inn-Tavern , Dada ? " Patrick thought . He would have to ask Mrs. Lindon not to come to the tavern too early with her young relatives , of a Sunday . That Patricia had any idea of Mrs. Lindon 's profession , he would not have believed , even if she had told him herself . " There are characters , Patricia , who come to the place that I do n't want you to know . " " But you will be there , Dada . I 'll dine with you . " She smiled at him . " I 'll think on it , my dear , " said Patrick . His daughter sighed gently . She had won . Now she could relax and remember the day that had so changed her life . It had happened on a sweet Sunday afternoon of flowery trees and warm grass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dada 's insistence on High Mass , which was too long and boring , as usual . Early dinner at home had been tasteless and heavy , and Dada had gone promptly upstairs at two o'clock for his Sunday nap before he left for the Inn-Tavern . Patricia , who was supposed to occupy Sunday afternoons with a Sunday nap , also , and to read an improving book , or to visit one of her few female acquaintances , was restless . There were strange urges in her twenty-year-old body , and her mind was filled with amorphous fantasies of knights in white armor . Patricia was not , by nature , romantic , but her body had its secret and imperious impulses . She knew , by intuition , far more than her innocent father would ever have suspected , though the in-  | tuitions were not explicit . She understood that men were different from women , and her female instinct was alerted . But exactly in what lay the " difference " was still not understood by her . She had viewed fig-leafed statues of men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken her , and had wondered what the fig leaves concealed . That they concealed something " naughty " but delightful , she was positive . She had heard the girlish giggles of her young cousins , and had listened to their whispered comments . All this had stirred and excited her without informing her . She had seen a celebrated painting of Adam and Eve in one of the galleries . Adam , of course , had a decorous fig leaf . But Eve had had one , too . One of the cousins giggled and whispered , " Why does she have one , for heaven 's sake ! " Patricia had smiled knowingly , and had inspected Adam 's fig leaf intensely , if covertly . What did it hide ? It bulged . But what did it hide ? There were no overt contours . However , she instinctively guessed that it had importance for women . At this thought she had felt a dismaying hotness in her virginal loins , and had been ashamed , if deeply excited . Because her cousins knew almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction from them . Her aunt , sorry for the motherless girl , had attempted some instruction , but it was mostly of warnings about men . A girl did not allow any intimacies , such as kisses in lonely places , or embraces . A girl kept herself " pure " before marriage . Men did not marry bad girls . There were dark hints of unwanted babies , and fates worse than death . In some fashion , babies were implicit with intimacies , but exactly what those intimacies were , Patricia did not know . Did one have babies if one sat in a chair a gentleman had just vacated ? Did a kiss , however innocent , bring about a child ? Finally Patricia guessed all this did not . It needed Something Else . But no one told her exactly what . Her aunt had , with an embarrassment which intrigued 11 Patricia , gone through the routine of the birds and the bees , without details except those concerning stamens and pistils , and Patricia knew she possessed neither . Patricia had finally resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse . " What did that mean ? There was another word pertaining to something which only men possessed . Patricia looked it up in the same dictionary . There was no  | illustration , just babble about " glands . " That was the extent of Patricia 's knowledge , while her young body demanded insistently , again without exact information . So , though Patricia was baffled , she was still confronted by the imperatives of her young flesh , and grew increasingly restless . Her aunt had told her that men were predatory and they put upon unwary girls . Patricia yearned to be put upon , though her aunt had warned of dire consequences such as " unwanted children . " Too embarrassed at last , the aunt had burst out , " There are good girls and bad girls ! Men do n't marry bad girls ! Bad girls show their legs and entice gentlemen ! " Patricia began to long to show her legs . Her aunt had warned of " the pit . " Patricia wanted to peer into it . She began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase it . She had noticed that men discreetly stared at the fronts of shirtwaists and dresses . She envied the women in portraits who had large white bosoms . Apparently men liked them , though in Patricia 's opinion they were neither beautiful nor useful except to nurse infants . But how , exactly , did women get infants ? She found herself dreaming at night , but when she awoke , sweating and trembly , she could recall nothing of what she had experienced in her sleep except that it had been body-shaking . She was ripe for seduction . She had guessed long ago that Mrs. Lindon 's young relatives were not relatives at all . She had come upon servants who whispered and snickered behind their hands . Mrs. Lindon 's girls were evidently " bad , " and were to be avoided by " good " girls . What did they do in the bedrooms of that house ? wondered poor Patricia . That they did something very deplorable , but interesting , was evident , and there was money involved . But how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young " relatives , " but for what explicit reason , she did not know . They did things only married women did  --  but what the hell was that ? Patricia was shocked at the sudden vehemence of her own question . Once , half-asleep , she had involuntarily masturbated . The wild explosion had unnerved and profoundly shaken her , and she had gasped and sweated and had thought of evil . Somehow , in some mysterious way , men were involved in this savage experience . She took to reading the Bible . " Adam knew his wife , Eve . " How ? On this lovely May Sunday , Patricia had not gone upstairs for  | the customary afternoon nap after noon dinner . Her restlessness overcame her . She had got out her bicycle from the stable and had furiously ridden off , pedaling with all her strength . That she was desperately seeking an encounter she did not know . The exertion exhilarated her and she pressed for the outskirts of the town . The gentle heat made her sweat ; her breasts tingled wetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited her . Her loins , on the seat of the bicycle , began to burn . She took off her straw hat and tied it on the handlebars . The wind lifted her light brown hair and she laughed . She felt alive and vibrant as never before . She felt her femaleness and was proud . It was naughty , of course , but in what way ? She passed carriages and automobiles and did not see or hear them . She was intent on something , though it remained hidden from her . She searched with her eyes , and did not know for what she was looking . Her heart was beating very fast . An unimaginative girl , she had never noticed beauty before . Now she was entranced by the countryside which bordered the narrow road . Everything elated her , the new green of the trees , the scent of the warm grass , the sight of wildflowers shyly clustered in the shade of great trees  --  purple , yellow , red , and blue  --  the mauve glisten of the mountains in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the comfort of the sun on her face and her hands . She smiled , and she wanted to cry in her delight . Patricia Mulligan had discovered life . She felt she was part of it and that she was beautiful , too . Her heart expanded . She began to sing . There was a break in the thick trees lining the road . Patricia got off her bicycle and entered the break . There were shrubs here , but beyond them she could see a small oval glade surrounded by trees that threw cool shadows on the high grass . It was shiningly silent here and secluded and very still . Patricia pushed her bicycle to the ' end of the shrubbery and looked about her with pleasure . Buttercups and tall wild daisies mingled with the grass , sweetening the air with an aromatic if rank fragrance . To Patricia it had a compelling fierce power which excited her . The leaves of the trees were polished by the spring so that they seemed to be coated with a green lacquer . She touched a trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She leaned her bicycle against it . Beyond the glade she could see the green-and-purple mountains and the small distant walls of the rising Ipswich House . It was not being built very fast ;  | that , she had heard . It had something to do with the Panic , lack of credit , and money , and other tiresome things with which men engrossed themselves . Dada had a mortgage now , on his InnTavern , for the Ipswich House , and was depressed by it , which seemed silly to Patricia , who had no idea what a mortgage was . When she had last gone to Philadelphia , the money her father had given her was less than the year before , and when she had wailed he had said , " There 's a Panic , love , and money is short . " She had pouted for two days , but Patrick , though sad over this , did not increase the gift . He had not tried to explain . Ladies should not be concerned by Finance , even if they were hurt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she pulled the pins and rats from her long fine hair . She laughed aloud with a nameless exultation . She unbuttoned the high lace neck of her blouse and turned it down . Her heated flesh accepted the cool breeze with gratitude . She took off her shoes and stretched her toes . She stared at the hot blue sky through the leaves , and laughed again . She picked a buttercup and rubbed her nose in the yellow pollen . She yawned and lifted her arms and observed their thinness . She wanted to hug something , she wanted to embrace with all her tall lanky young body . She pulled up her skirt , now dusty from grass pollen , and surveyed her long lean legs and thighs , which were not at all voluptuous . She sighed . She had a prodigious appetite but never gained weight , though she stuffed herself with pastries on the sly and drank cream . Her aunt in Philadelphia had comforted her by saying , " You 're just slow in developing , dear , " and then had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " That was another exciting thought . An hourglass figure was much to be desired . She had not noticed another bicyclist less than a quarter of a mile behind her , which had paced her . That bicyclist was Lionel Nolan , for he had the Sunday off . He was an extremely gregarious young man , most of the time , but when he wished to think , and plot , he looked for solitude . He had seen Patricia Mulligan pedaling fast on the road and had been surprised , for she usually drove her buggy . Always curious about other human beings , he had followed her , amused by her agility , for she usually gave the impression of ladylike languor . On the few occasions when he had seen her , she had hardly glanced at him . The encounters had almost always been in church . Lionel had chuckled to himself . Who in hell  | would want such a skinny tall girl , with nondescript brown hair , a constricted face in which the nose was too big , a pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no hips , and with a neck that was like a stem ? Of course she was very stylish in her rich clothes and had a certain contrived grace of movement but to Lionel she was only amusing in her pretensions and airs , and " old-maidish " in her gestures . Her voice was without resonance or sweetness or beguilement , almost a monotone , which she apparently considered refined . A very dull and uninteresting girl , Lionel had concluded , and had often wondered at Jason 's continued preoccupation with her . She had no feminine lures , no flirtatiousness , and did not know how to use her eyelashes or her smiles , which were reluctant and without warmth . But then , he would conclude , with his usual lack of self-delusion , people would probably wonder why he himself loved a cripple . True , Joan Garrity had a beauty which entranced all who saw her , but that was not enough , according to general opinion . It was more than enough for Lionel . But had Joan been a silly simpering girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lionel would not have spared a moment 's thought on her . So he was sorry for Jason Garrity and felt himself very superior to his friend , who apparently was obsessed by a girl with a mind as small as a hen 's . It was odd that Lionel , so astute about the majority of people , and who had known that Joan was extremely intelligent and aware , had not even guessed at Patricia Mulligan 's exceedingly sharp shrewdness and ability to exploit . She was as clever a plotter as he himself , and he did not know it and would have laughed at anyone who had told him of it . He saw that Patricia had left the road . He stopped his bicycle at the gap . Should he follow her , or not ? It would give him some secret hilarity to intrude himself upon her and watch her discomfiture at his presence . He dismounted , and as quietly as possible pushed his vehicle through the shrubbery , and then he stood at the edge of the glade . His mouth opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . For Patricia had pulled her skirt and petticoats to the top of her thighs , revealing drawers of shimmering satin and lace . She was lying back on the grass , her lifted folded arms shutting out the light . Her hair was spread in astonishing disorder about her . Her blouse was unbuttoned down to the camisole , which was a mass of  | cascading lace and pink ribbons . Patricia had an air of innocent abandon , childlike yet female . To other than Lionel this would have appeared touching . He was not touched . He was just entertained and curious . His foxy yellow eyes narrowed ; his wide freckled face broke into lines of mirth . He thought : I am not a gentleman ; a gentleman would cough and move himself back a few paces , to give her time to rearrange herself . But as I am not a gentleman , I wo n't do that . So he whistled a ribald cadence and strode into the glade , laughing . Patricia flashed upright , pulling down her skirts , pulling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her agate eyes bulged with mortification and embarrassment . She flung back her hair and fished in the grass for pins . " How . . . how dare you ! " she cried . Lionel advanced slowly and casually into the glade . " Why , what are you doing here ? " he asked pleasantly . " This is my favorite place . Did you find it too ? Nice , is n't it ? " He sat down in the grass , not too near her , and his smile was ingratiating . " Glad to find someone who likes this little spot . I often come here , " which , of course , was a lie . He had never seen the glade before . Patricia 's scrambling had put her out of breath , but now she was decently covered . Her hands closed on a " rat . " But ladies never let men know they wore " rats " under their huge pompadours . It was almost as bad as showing legs . So she began , in flurried hot silence , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as possible . Lionel tilted his head with its high burning crest . " You have pretty hair , " he said . " It glistens like polished wood . " He was pleased by his own poetry . He must use it on Joan , with greater veracity , except that he would mention polished jet . " And pretty hands , " he added , and this was not an untruth . Patricia paused in the braiding of her hair . Young men in Philadelphia , and in Belleville , had always told her how stylish and fashionable she was , and how superb was her taste . But they had never mentioned anything complimentary about her physical person . She had hungered for such compliments . " I 've always admired your fine teeth , " Lionel added , seeing he had made an impression . The poor dippy stupid girl , he thought . She can be fooled by a few kind words . Patricia was staring at him as if seeing him for the first time . She saw his slender trim body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his slim restless hands with their clean buffed nails , his long vital legs neat even in their old trousers , and , above all , his knowing intelligent eyes and springing red hair , which was carefully combed into large waves . He wore no collar or tie ; his shirt was open at the throat , and Patricia could see his strong freckled neck . She had never really seen him before . He had been only one of Dada 's " help , " and therefore not worthy of consideration . Now she saw him clearly , as a man . Her eyes dropped briefly and involuntarily to his crotch , and Lionel grinned to himself with both surprise and fresh secret hilarity . This was becoming interesting . He was even more amused seeing sweat appear over the girl 's upper lip . " I 've got to go , " she muttered , but she did not look away from him . Lionel lifted his red eyebrows . " Why ? It 's early yet . And it 's cool here , and refreshing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes , extracted one , put it slowly in his mouth , and struck a match on the sole of his dusty shoe . He did not ask permission to smoke . For some reason this fascinated as well as vexed Patricia . He was not awed by her , nor subservient to her , as were Dada 's other employees . His voice was not fawning and placating , anxious to please . He was treating her boldly  --  and rudely . Patricia , to her dismay , felt a passionate excitement , and her breath caught . She should reprimand him , she told herself . But she suddenly understood that a reprimand from her would not disturb him at all . He would only laugh at her . Her agitation grew . She felt a tremendous urge toward him , and she cowered in confusion and alarm . Lionel shifted a little nearer her . He looked at her feet in their black silk stockings . " You 've got pretty insteps , too , " he remarked idly . " And very pretty feet . Aristocratic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pulled them on with trembling hands and with primal seductiveness managed to reveal a well-shaped if not luxurious calf . It was all instinctive , and not deliberate . Lionel knew this . Women were easy to understand , if one took the time , and Lionel always took time . He had long ago found that women could be exceedingly useful to him . She said in her thin voice , " I think you are very forward . " He pretended bewilderment . " Why ? Are compliments , if sin-  | cere , forward ? What 've I got to gain by telling you the truth , Miss Mulligan ? " Patricia 's heart throbbed . She fumbled in her pocket for her handkerchief to wipe her wet palms . Suddenly Lionel was extending his own , a very white handkerchief , carefully folded , and of good quality . Dazed , Patricia took it . She found herself wiping her face and her hands ; the cloth smelled of tobacco and fine linen . A sweet warmth filled her . She mutely returned the handkerchief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she were asking a question . All her hauteur had become humility . Her keen mind reminded her that he was only " help . " Her instincts told her differently . Lionel decided the time had come to give her a little indifference . He turned his fiery head and looked at the mountains , and thoughtfully smoked , one hand hanging on his bent knee . He frowned slightly . " It 's taking a long time to build the new hotel , " he said , as if to himself . " And too much money , which we ca n't get just now . " " We ? " murmured Patricia . He turned to her as if surprised . " Why , yes . Did n't you know , Miss Mulligan , that I have a share in Ipswich House ? Jason Garrity got that for me . He would n't sell his fourteen acres to your father , but took shares for himself , and me , in the hotel . If we ever get it built , we 'll have our fortunes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of this . Her eyes widened in honest and overwhelming interest . " I 'll have charge of the kitchens and the dining rooms , " Lionel went on . " And the menus . Have n't you seen the plans ? " " No , " said Patricia , and was angered at her father , who told her nothing . He thought she was too fragile ! For the first time Patricia resented that . Lionel was shaking his head as if both amused and disbelieving . " An intelligent girl like you , too ! " he said . " Your father 's oldfashioned , is n't he ? I always thought of you , Miss Mulligan , as one of the new women . ' " As Patricia had thought of herself as that , too , she was overcome . But she stammered , " I . . . I do n't . . . I do n't believe in votes for women . " " Why not ? " asked Lionel . " Many women are as bright as men . " He studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Patricia flushed again . " Well , I 'm a girl . . . " she began . Lionel treated her to one of his invincible tricks . He let his eyes wander very slowly from her eyes to her lips , let them linger on her small breasts , dropped them to her narrow waist , then her thighs , her calves , her feet . A violent trembling invaded Patricia 's flesh . She felt she should be outraged at this insolent long survey . Instead , she was intoxicated . All at once her body felt seductive , enticing , irresistible , steaming with virginal passion . " Obviously , " Lionel said . His yellow eyes brightened as if with desire , and Patricia saw this and trembled even more violently . She did not know that this was another of Lionel 's clever tricks . He really desired her as much as he would have desired a gargoyle . But she could be valuable to him , even more valuable than other women . Shyly , as if unable to resist his impulse , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew his hand with a quick gasp . " Sorry , " he said . He could seduce her , he thought . He could manufacture a reasonable facsimile of lust . He considered . But . . there was Dada . A man had to be careful . Ensnare a girl , for one 's own advantage , but not a complete ensnarement . That was dangerous . It committed a man , and often ruined him . A playfulness , perhaps , implying future intimacies ; a few tragic sighs at the hopelessness of it all . A woman never tired of deception , for she never knew she was being deceived until the last devastating and hopeless hour . By that time she was powerless to do anything but grieve and despise herself . Lionel understood women too well . If all worked well , he could make a lifelong slave of Patricia ; that is , if he himself worked well . It would take finesse , and Lionel possessed a lot of that . He had had experience , even with Mrs. Lindon , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pretty " relatives " without cost . Mrs. Lindon had once said , " You have all the ways of a gentleman , my dear Lionel , but you do n't have much education . It does n't take a lot of study to give the appearance of education ; it just needs a little reading , a lot of listening , and a knowing air . " So she had given him books to read , and though they bored him , he had gained considerable polish . She taught him phrases to use to imply erudition . Thinking of this , with gratitude , Lionel almost forgot Patricia , who was fixedly regarding him with moist eyes . Her mouth had  | fallen open . She was like one bewitched . Lionel , with pretended humility and hesitancy , reached for her hand . He pressed it . Pleading with his uplifted eyes , he timidly kissed that hand . Patricia shivered . Her little breasts swelled and tingled . His fingers burned into her hand . She wet her mouth , and her lips became tremulous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " Forgive me , Miss Mulligan . But I could n't help it . " All the longings and nameless urges Patricia had been lately enduring gathered in her with a tremendous force . She wanted Lionel 's arms about her . She wanted . . . She did not know just what she wanted , but her instincts urged her . She wanted to lie in his arms , close to him , held by him . In short , she was in love , entranced , helpless , overcome . She had a sudden vehement desire to take off her clothing , to reveal herself to him . In the black hot whirlpool of her female yearning she wanted his hands on her body , seeking . Lust dissolved her ; she felt herself helplessly surrendering . Lionel , sighing heavily , released her hand . Through a mist she stared at him . She saw his sad face , his ardent eyes . " Forgive me , " he murmured again , and averted his head . Then he stood up . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . if I 've offended you , Miss Mulligan , please forgive me . But I just could n't help it ! You are so . . . beautiful . . . so desirable ! Forgive me for a momentary weakness . . . " He passed his hand despairingly over his forehead and shook his head as if stricken . Then , uttering a slight sound of sorrow , he turned and ran away . Patricia heard the crashing of shrubbery . Then he was gone and she was all alone in a brilliant daze of light and ecstasy and shaking passion . That is how it began . She had not seen Lionel for three weeks . She dreamt of him , desiring her , embracing her . Now her dreams became more explicit , except for the final act . She could not bear it . Her days were filled with visions of him . . . and beds . And , of course , marriage . Patricia began to live in a world almost too exciting . The aspect of things changed . They became portents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with music . Even Dada 's grossness became less exasperating . But Patricia had a very shrewd mind . It was all very well to  | dream . But one had to plan to make those dreams come true . Patricia was nothing if not practical . She had now succeeded with Dada . She would see Lionel often . Her heart melted with tenderness for him , for his pain . She would soon let him know that his suit was not unwelcome . She began to plan the fine house Dada would build for his daughter and her husband . Happiness surged in Patricia . She acquired a sort of radiance . Jason Garrity saw this in church . When he shyly smiled at Patricia , she smiled back . He did not know that she did not really see him . She was always looking for Lionel . She went very often to the glade . That she did not find Lionel there only confirmed her blissful belief that he was avoiding her to avoid his own pain . Soon she would console him . Soon she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see him in church . She guessed he went to an earlier Mass , because of her . She sighed with joy . Of course , it was impossible for her to know that Lionel had counted on all this , and was biding his time , waiting for her to make the next move .  | On a hot July day , Patrick Mulligan called both Jason and Lionel into his office . Lionel for one startled moment had the fear that Patricia had blabbed . He was almost overcome with fear and his red freckles stood out vividly on his suddenly pale face . He said to Jason , " What do you suppose he wants us for ? " " Probably to discuss the hotel and the finances . Things are n't getting any better in this Panic , you know . " " I do n't have a damned cent in that business , " said Lionel , " so why is he calling for me ? " " Come on , and we 'll find out . " Jason was impatient . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loved  --  and had tasted and approved a new dish the youngest recruit had invented . Unlike Lionel , he enjoyed food and had subtle discrimination . The menu was definitely improving since the new arrival in the kitchen , with touches of wine here and there , and brandy on duck . The Inn-Tavern 's reputation was at its highest , in spite of the Panic . That is , the dining room was comfortably full except for Monday , but there were no longer many late guests for supper . Sometimes , at ten o'clock , there would be hardly more than a dozen people at the tables . Jason had introduced a very elegant addition to the dining room , a pianist and a violinist of fair competence , and this was much admired and appreciated . But recently these musicians were engaged only for Saturday and Sunday nights , much to Jason 's regret and his sympathy for the employees . This was a Wednesday evening , and again the dining room was practically full except for a table near the kitchen door . Jason sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had  | been told that he would play but two nights " for a while , " and had mentioned his five children . Jason had put a five-dollar gold piece into the man 's hand and then had run off to escape gratitude . Mr. Mulligan 's office was very cramped and dark  --  for it had no window  --  and smelled of dust , old paper , and ancient plaster . It was equipped with Mr. Mulligan 's rolltop desk , reminiscent of Sister Agatha 's with its crowded pigeonholes and general clutter , a set of filing cabinets always half-open , and a table which caught the overflow from the desk , and another small table at one side where Mr. Mulligan 's " typewriter " sat six days a week , writing Mr. Mulligan 's business letters , desperately trying to reduce the daily devastations of the files , and answering his telephone . It was also her duty to keep the office clean , to wash the globes of the gaslit chandelier hanging from the mildewed ceiling , and to carry messages to various places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done her best on the faded Brussels rug in a turkeyred shade , and this was the real cause of the dusty atmosphere . The " typewriter " was Molly Nolan , and Pat called her " the smartest girl I ever knew . Does everything right . " He had had a male clerk previously , a pimpled youth who had a habit of falling asleep several times a day , and another habit of slinking out to the kitchen to snatch food at odd moments , though he was obese , and , as Mr. Mulligan said , " damned stupid . " Mr. Mulligan equated fatness with stupidity , but no one had courage or malice enough to indicate that he himself was hardly a skeleton , except , of course , his daughter , Patricia . Lionel fully expected to see Patricia there when he entered the office , but to his profound relief there was only Molly , busily clacking away at her two-tiered typewriter , and a stranger , a man , about thirty years old . He was sitting near Patrick , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to resent the stiff old chair in which he sat , though he was obviously a young man of substance . He turned his head as the two young men entered , and regarded them with sharp interest . " Boys , " said Patrick , his rosy face happy and pleased , " meet my favorite nevvy , Daniel Dugan , from Philadelphia . Danny , this big black Irisher is Jason Garrity , and the one whose hair looks like a burning bush is that rascal Lionel Nolan . Could n't get along without them . " His voice was rich and heavy with brogue , and  | there was a bottle of whiskey on his heaped desk and it was evident that he had been sampling the liquor in unusual quantities . Daniel Dugan rose and shook hands with the two young men . " Uncle Pat 's been telling me a lot about you over the past two days . Glad to make your acquaintances . " He stood , smiling at them , tall and broad-shouldered and as at ease as only an urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Though his movements were measured , he gave the impression of agility and great strength and innate self-control . His expensive boots shone like black glass . He wore a loose jacket of fine gray flannel , but apparently there was something unrestrained in his nature , for his trousers were of a violent and very large green-white-and-maroon plaid . His linen was immaculate and heavily starched , and his red tie bore a tie pin in which was set a flamboyantly big diamond , which winked in the gaslight . His watch chain had many trinkets , including a Phi Beta Kappa key . His cufflinks were also set with diamonds and there was a diamond ring on his big left hand . He had a blunt rectangular face , and the flesh was firm and slightly browned , as if he had spent much time in the sun . This implied that he was an athlete , an impression enhanced by his disciplined movements . He had prominent eyes the color of shining brown marble , and they were penetrating and restless under thick arched brows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little wide , with flaring nostrils . His mouth was unusually pink for a man 's and very sensual , and he had magnificent white teeth , which he was displaying now to Jason and Lionel . His wavy brown hair was thick and glossy . Jason thought , as his hand still tingled from the other 's emphatic clasp , that here was a man who was not as friendly and as amiable as he appeared , and that under certain circumstances he could be ruthless and daunting and without compromise . He was a man to be feared . I do n't like him , Jason thought . I would n't want to get in his way . But Lionel was more impressed . He , too , had come to the same conclusion as Jason ; however , he felt only admiration and respect for Daniel Dugan . He was more than worth pleasing . Both young men were still wondering why they had been called from their duties to meet this paragon of importance and wealth . The typewriter clacked away like a score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her riot of red curls tied back with a huge blue ribbon . Her tall slender body rested , with her brother 's alertness , on her chair ; her waist was firm yet delicate , and encircled by a broad gleaming belt of patent leather with a brass buckle . She wore a neat if coarse shirtwaist of unblemished white cotton , with pearl buttons and a loose black tie , and her brown skirt had no wrinkles in it . She had beautiful feet and hands , which Daniel Dugan had observed with appreciation when meeting her . This appreciation had increased at the sight of her scrubbed face with its bright freckles , its impudent snub nose , its pretty , resolute mouth and small white teeth , and , above all , her unusual eyes , the color of fresh honey , large and honest and direct . Here , he had thought , was a young lady of breeding and wit and bravery , one whom the world would never conquer . Daniel liked brave men and women . He had no patience for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Molly looked at life clearly and openly and would never be deceived . She also had the strength of integrity and disillusioned innocence . Compared with Molly , his cousin Patricia was colorless and without the vitality this girl possessed in unusual quantity . There was a verve emanating from her , an intrepid verve which would meet evil head-on and probably rout it . " Sit down , sit down , buckos ! " exclaimed Patrick , his hearty voice somewhat blurred . " Bring up the chairs ! This nevvy of mine , " and he jerked his thick thumb at Daniel , " is named for me , his middle name , Patrick . His dad did that , and a grand man he was , Mike Dugan , may his soul rest in peace . My brother-in-law . Married to my sister , and I never knew why , a measly colleen with a whining voice , and airs . My God , her airs ! Worse than her sister , that Episcopalian . Not that I 've got anything against Episcopalians , " Patrick continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But that sister made a joke of her new religion , that she did . " He beamed at Daniel with moist affection . " If this lad were n't my nevvy , and Patricia 's cousin , I 'd arrange a marriage , then . " Daniel laughed . He had a deep loud laugh , but it was not offensive . It often inspired trust in others . " Almost got disbarred in Philly , " Patrick went on , as if this had been something to be proud of in some fashion . " Too sharp for those Philadelphia lawyers you hear about . Sharp as a needle ,  | Danny . Knew more law and how to get around it than a barrel of lawyers , there in Philly . Got to know most of the judges , too . A politician , like all us Irishers . That 's what got him in trouble . " " Uncle Pat . . . " said Daniel , and his wide smile was not too pleasant . But he winked at the silent young men seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do , eh ? " Patrick bellowed , and reached out and slapped his nephew vehemently on the shoulder . " Who diddled the chief of police , eh , with a nice fat bribe ! " He beamed at Jason and Lionel . " Could n't prove it , though . Danny 's got too many friends . Danny 's a criminal lawyer , knows all the tricks . That 's what vexed the lads in Philly . Well , then , and it 's a happy man I am ! Danny 's going to handle all my affairs , legal and " ? Patrick chuckled juicily ? " and illegal . For a long time , perhaps , until things cool down in Philly and he can run for Congress . Need him in this business , what with the new hotel and all . I 've got ideas . I 'm not going to stop with this Inn-Tavern and the Ipswich House , though God knows when it 'll be ready , with this Panic . Ca n't get credit for love nor money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . Well , then . Danny will be here for a long time . " Molly had been listening intently . The clacking slowed on the typewriter . She pretended to be absorbed , at last , in a file on her table . She had seen her brother 's pallor when he entered the room , had seen the fright in his eyes , and had wondered with a quick spasm of dread in her heart . She had never seen him apprehensive before . What had he expected in this room ? An accuser ? But of what ? She knew her brother very well ; he would never be guilty of small , or even big , pilfering . But she knew he was exigent and often reckless , in spite of his natural caution . A cold uneasiness came to her in this small , stifling room . Then she looked at the silent Jason , and her heart was full of pain . She had hoped , when taking this position for five dollars a week , that he would come to notice her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . When he came across her , he would look at her remotely if courteously , but he never stopped for a word , and rarely smiled at her . It was as if she did not exist for him , and Molly , with grief and despair , guessed that she , indeed , had no impact on him at all . Lionel , with brotherly malice , had hinted that Jason was " mad about " Patricia Mulligan , who , in Molly 's opinion , was a dreary girl of no character and certainly not pretty , and who possessed a  | voice like tin struck by a pencil . She was also , Molly would tell herself bitterly , stupid if sly . But Molly , unlike others , had noticed that Patricia sometimes had a piercing gleam in her agate eyes , a calculation . " Well , " said Patrick with jovial impatience , " are n't you buckos going to say something about all this ? " Jason colored with embarrassment . He had been studying Daniel very closely , and his dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to say , Mr. Mulligan ? I 'm just your assistant , and Lionel here manages the kitchen and the dining room . Are you asking us for our opinion about this . . . this new arrangement ? " Patrick scratched his neck . " Well , then . I just wanted Danny to meet you . You 're important boys here , and are going to be more important  --  if that damned hotel ever gets built . " He looked at Lionel . " Anything to say ? " Lionel smiled . His admiration for Daniel had become intense . He bowed his head quickly . " We are glad you will be here , Mr. Dugan . Of course we know that , with the new hotel , and expansion , Mr. Mulligan will need all the assistance he can get , an experienced lawyer and " ? he looked inquiringly at Daniel ? " business administrator ? " " Yes , " said Daniel . He had not underestimated this young man with the swift comprehension and ingratiating manner . This one would bear watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and curious . He had sensed the tight malaise in Jason ; he had seen bitterness in that strong mouth ; he had more than guessed at a maturity beyond Jason 's actual age . Life would never hurt such as Lionel . Not so with Jason Garrity . Patrick puffed at a very huge and rancid cigar . Daniel produced a silver case of cigarettes and lit one . Jason 's embarrassment grew . He said , " I must get back , Mr. Mulligan . We were taking inventory of the linens and inspecting the rooms . We 're expecting the summer people . " " All right , then , all right , you young buckos can go . Just wanted Danny here to meet you , seeing we 'll all be working together . " He smiled happily at his nephew . " Rumors got around about the new hotel , and now we 've got a few summer people from the big cities coming in for a week or two at a time . Sharpies , they look like . But gentlemen . Walk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doxies , too . "  | Mr. Mulligan did not often watch his language when Molly was present . He knew that the girl was no innocent , that she had a mind like a man 's . So he was very fond of her , very open with her , and felt paternal toward her . A nice girl , and no fool . A real lady , one with whom a man could be honest and not watch every word he said . She had brought much order to his slovenly office , and her bookkeeping was perfect . He would give her an extra dollar a week beginning Saturday , though the wages of a " typewriter " in Belleville averaged much less than that . She had been working for him for two months , and he appreciated and relied on her . Sometimes he would pat her shoulder , but it was a fatherly pat and she never resented it . Lionel bowed deeply to Daniel , and Jason nodded briefly , and the two young men left the room . Patrick poured another drink for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , then , eh ? " Daniel glanced at the absorbed Molly , whom he had noticed had not turned a page in the folder for several minutes . He inclined his head toward her , and Pat said , " Molly , love , would you leave us alone for a few minutes ? " Molly rose at once , and without a glance , left the room . " Lionel 's her brother , " Patrick said . " How 'd you know it ? " " The resemblance , of course , Uncle Pat . And the way they looked at each other . Now , that Lionel . He was frightened when he came in here . The interesting question is , why ? I do n't trust him . He 's not one who 'd ever get his hand in the till . Too careful of himself for petty business . You could even trust him around the safe . He 'll serve you well  --  as long as it serves his own interest . He would never diddle you . Not that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's after bigger things than petty larceny , or even big larceny . But he 's a trickster , for all that . He 's got a criminal 's soul , but he would never be involved in anything questionable . It would all be nice and legal . " Patrick scratched his nose thoughtfully . " Well , I had an idea about that when he was just a spalpeen . I gather you do n't like him ? " " Of course I do n't . But that wo n't interfere with my appreciation of his cleverness and his real value to you . He 's got imagination . He 's a runner . The other chap is inclined to plod , under ordinary conditions . No , I do n't like your Lionel . I 'll be watching all the time . A very complicated character , and complicated charac-  | ters interest me . Criminals are fascinating . They 've got gusto , the big ones , and Lionel 's a big one . " Patrick grinned . He said , without malice , " You recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A big criminal is quite a study . All our important and powerful entrepreneurs are like Lionel Nolan . And gentlemen , all , though even the president fears them . It 's the little criminals I resent and hate , the little mice and rats , with no brains , no courage , no derring-do , no intellect . They 're hardly human . Yes , your Lionel will go far and be very valuable to you . As long as you are valuable to him . " " Hum , " said Patrick . He blew out a huge cloud of noxious smoke . " And what of Jason Garrity ? " Daniel reflected . " I like that young man . I admire him . There is a rock of rectitude and honor . He 's not clever and volatile like Lionel . But his mind is far superior . He 's not self-serving ; you could trust him with your life . He 's the kind great saints are made of , and generals , but never politicians . Ambitious , yes . But always with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to go than it will take Lionel . But he 'll be a fixture . The other 's a dancer , a prancer . Jason never even danced in his soul . " Daniel paused . " There 's something there I encountered only once before , and I still remember it , though I was only about eighteen at the time . It was when my dad and I took the long tour of Europe , during my holidays from Groton . I met an old priest in a tiny village in Italy . The poor people thought he was a saint . He was , too . " Daniel 's expressive face changed , became almost somber . Then he shrugged . " Saintliness can be hard to endure for more than a minute or two . Your Jason 's no saint . There 's violence in him , hidden and held , but there . There 's bitterness in him , too . And he 's very perceptive . But . . . he can be deceived , especially if he loves someone . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stake your life on that . You can rest easy with Jason Garrity . Meanness is beyond him . It is impossible for him to betray anyone . A good man , and when I say that , it is an accolade . " I like him . But he does n't like me . The other does . We 'll see . " " He 's got a brother who 's studying for the priesthood . " Patrick laughed . " Now , there is one of your real rogues . Jack Garrity . Looks like a monk hoping everyone else is going to bum in  | hellfire . Gives me chills when I see him . His grandda told me about him . He detests the lad , and no wonder . Yet he was never in trouble , that Jack , and all the nuns loved him and predicted great things for him . Jase does n't love him much , and I think Jack hates him . " Patrick sank into momentary thought . Then he said , " I 'm going to have Jason marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ? " said Daniel , sitting up with interest . " Are they en-gaged ? " Patrick frowned . " Now , then . Patricia is a very strict little girl , and loves her dada . Told me she does n't want to marry and leave me . I keep mentioning Jason , and she turns up her nose . But she 'll marry him , and that I am going to make sure of . He is just what she needs . I have only to say the word . " Daniel doubted that . He knew his cousin very well . Like all her kind , she could be very obstinate , and her father adored her . It would take a mighty effort to get her to marry Jason Garrity , a very mighty effort . He said , " I 've noticed she is blooming , Uncle Pat . Really maturing . She 's got a kind of glow she never had before . It makes her pretty , and Patricia is no beauty , you know , even if you think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money in Philadelphia , and gave parties for her . But the young men were n't interested . Now , I 'm not trying to insult you . I 'm just giving you facts . Patricia 's no siren . She has n't any charm . Let 's be honest . She 's got style , which she was taught , and she 'll make a very shrewd wife for someone , and knows her pennies . A pragmatic girl " ? even if she has no spirit or real character , Daniel added to himself , and no real virtues . She 's not like that Molly girl , sad to say . He had never met anyone like Molly Nolan before , at least not any woman . He smiled faintly to himself . Patrick was annoyed . " You never did like my girl , " he said . " Not even when she was a toddler and you were fourteen years old . " Daniel came suddenly back to his present situation . " Oh , after all , could you expect a young boy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that there is a lot to admire in Patricia . She 'll make an excellent wife , watching out always for her husband 's interests , which she 'll make her own . I know you think of Patricia as a soft little girl , but she is n't , Uncle Pat . There 's granite in her , some-  | where , believe me . " He had a sudden thought , and was surprised . " And I 'll tell you something else about Patricia . If she ever falls in love , it 'll be for life . No flightiness about her , except superficially . " Patrick was appeased . Yet , he felt some uneasiness . Patricia had become very absentminded of late . She often smiled to herself , and her smile was excited . And as Daniel had said , she had taken on a sudden and noticeable bloom . She had become softer in speech , and her eyes sparkled . Patrick had heard her sing early in the morning , when she usually was the most irritable . Daniel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if very practical , wife . I hardly knew her this time . She looks like a woman in love . " Patrick laughed . " I hope it 's Jason . Even if it is n't , I 'll make it so . It ca n't be some bucko in Philadelphia . She 'd mention it fast enough if it was . And she never gets any letters , except from her aunts . And she does n't go out with any young fella in Belleville , at least not often . She does n't like the fellas she knows here . They send her flowers and candy and she never even looks at them . She knows I want her to get married ; she 's old enough . And she 'd tell me if there was anyone . No . I think she is just thinking of a wedding . We 'll put Jason there as the groom . " Well , thought Daniel . Perhaps . He was amused at himself when he thought : I hope for Jason 's sake that Uncle Pat does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Molly entered . " May I come in ? " she said . " Seems like you 're already in , Molly , love , " said Patrick , and his kind face beamed brightly . " Now , love , will you get me out the Schultz folder ? I want to discuss some things here with Mr. Dugan . " Molly passed Daniel on the way to the files . She moved lithely , he noticed , like her brother . And she had a lovely rear , like a young Psyche , full of innocent seductiveness . The movement of her thighs under the poor brown skirt was supple and enticing . It was most evident she did not know this . She had no voluptuousness that was overt , but it was there just the same , for all her slenderness . Daniel was charmed . He was more than charmed . And he was interested by his own emotions . Not a beautiful girl by any standards , but there was something alluring about her , something strong yet pliant . When she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel noticed her hands again . And he wanted to take them and hold them against his cheek . That she was unaware of him , and did not look at his virile handsomeness as all other women did , and had never once smiled at him , stirred him . He thought of the girl in Philadelphia to whom he was tentatively engaged , and she was suddenly vapid and without form . He could hardly remember her features now . She was dissolving in his memory . Patricia , fulfilling Lionel 's expectation , had " made the first move . " She appeared in the dining room with her father on Sunday , almost two months before her father arranged the meeting with Daniel in his study , meticulously arrayed in a blue lace dress draped enticingly about her narrow hips and over her bosom , which had acquired extra padding . This enhanced her waist . She wore blue silk shoes and silk stockings . Her pompadour was really enormous , and shining , and upheld by tortoiseshell combs studded with blue stones . One tubelike curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavaliere , very dainty , was of gold inlaid with diamonds and aquamarines , as was her bracelet . She , indeed , had style and taste , and her nondescript face had a pretty glow in the light of the chandeliers . Lionel was impressed , and pleased , and for the first time felt a quick desire for the girl , which made him inwardly laugh at himself . She pretended to be haughtily unaware of Lionel as he bowed and presented her with the menu . She looked about the dining room with pretended ennui . It was too early  --  Patrick had planned this  --  for the Sunday-evening guests , who were in the rear bars or upstairs in the private dining rooms drinking and discreetly roistering . The diners were still few , and rather elderly and very decorous . " The duck with brandy and oranges is very special today , " Lionel murmured to her . Patricia gave her father a quick glance ; then , seeing he was bowing and smiling to some guests , she whispered to Lionel , " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He whispered in a very fast tone , " This is my day . I will be here late . Next Sunday ? I will be off then . " Patricia had not known of the Sunday arrangements . Her bright color faded a little with disappointment . Then she nodded . Patrick  | turned to his daughter . " We have a grand chef , young and with ideas . Try the duck , love . And the burgundy . My special vintage . " He said to Lionel , " Jason left yet ? " " Yes , sir . An hour ago . " Patrick felt his own disappointment . He said with unusual irritation , " I do n't know you young fellas . Always running off . " But Patricia was relieved . She simply could not bear that lout , so big and stupidly silent and always staring at her . She knew her father wanted her to look on him kindly as a possible husband , and this outraged her . Her father just did n't have any sense , to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had been courted in Philadelphia by young men of the very best society ! She had not encouraged them , of course . Patricia , like almost all of humanity , had the human capacity to deceive and flatter herself . Patrick , always perceptive , noticed that his daughter 's glow had faded somewhat . He said , with solicitude , " Not feeling well , love ? If so , we 'll leave . There 's a good dinner at home . " Patricia was jolted . Leave Lionel ? Even if he were only in the room as the headwaiter , his presence , however directed to others than herself , was a source of contentment and tenderness . At least she could watch him . She said , almost sweetly , " No , Dada . It is just the heat . I feel . . . rosy . " Ladies did not sweat . Gentlemen perspired . Ladies became " rosy . " She glanced up at the slowly rotating fans on the ceiling . Patrick had lately installed electricity even in the chandeliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans created a hot breeze . Patricia 's neck became wet . She wiped it daintily with a perfumed handkerchief ; then , as she consulted Lionel again , she discreetly permitted him to have a waft of the carnation perfume . Lionel thought of death ; for some reason carnations were always at funerals , pungent and overpowering . He wrinkled his pointed nose , but smiled . " I think , Dada , " she said , " that I 'll have the chicken broth and the broiled bass . " A lady always pretended she had little interest in food ; her physical necessities were never gross . Patricia had a great appetite , but never revealed it . " And only a little lettuce , with lemon juice and oil . " Her mouth watered . She would have dearly loved the luscious duck and mashed potatoes and dressing . But Lionel would be offended by such plebeian taste . Later , at home , she would have cold beef sandwiches and would pilfer one of the servants ' bottles of beer , and some pickles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of huckleberry pie and a lot of coffee . Later would come tea itself , with attendant pastries . Patrick , of course , would be at the Inn-Tavern , and she could eat in peace and savor every morsel . Patricia was really a hearty girl . But she could never gain weight , as was the fashion , and her legs were long and slender and not fleshy as other girls ' legs were . She craved fat . She lingered over newspaper drawings of Lillian Russell , so enticing with her white double chin and portly little arms . Patricia hated her own height and thinness . She had noticed that gentlemen were attracted to obese girls , especially if they were short . " No higher than my heart ! " as the song went . She hated her eyes . " Five-foot-two , eyes of blue " ? again the popular song . She envied her father for his bright blue eyes . Why could she not have inherited them ? Why did she look like her dead mother , who had been so unfashionable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Patricia 's face became discontented as she surveyed the chicken broth put before her . She drank it , her little finger stiffly thrust out . She did not know it was a vulgar affectation . Patrick said , with concern , " You 're not hungry , love ? Do you feel unwell ? " " Oh , Dada , " she said with impatience , " you know I have no appetite . " Patrick sighed . " You should fill up , Patricia . You look like a girl of thirteen . " Patricia flushed with vexation . She knew that only too well . Lionel , with great ceremony , came back with two small slivers of broiled bass with a slice of lemon . Patricia closed her eyes for a moment . She kept swallowing water . Then Lionel presented her with a dish of hot buttered mashed potatoes , and her stomach lurched . She took a small spoonful . There were fresh peas . Another austere spoonful . There was scrapple . She shook her head , and her stomach protested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured a little oil on it , and squeezed a drop of lemon on the green leaves . Her hunger grew . But when she looked at Lionel , she was overwhelmed with sweetness and innocent desire and her eyes became wet with love and longing . She almost forgot her hunger . Her father , of course , had an immense slab of hot red beef and gravy , and he heaped his plate with a mountainous serving of mashed potatoes and peas , and he was also devouring cornbread muffins with melting , dripping butter and taking vast drafts  | of wine to wash it all down . Patricia felt faint . When he had a side dish of scrapple , she became fainter . It was one of her favorite dishes , especially with maple syrup . For dessert she had a few scarlet strawberries dusted with fine sugar . Patrick had a truly gigantic slab of hot apple pie surmounted with ice cream , a dish newly fashionable . Pie a la mode , it was called . Patricia adored it . But she was certain Lionel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know he was thinking : That girl has no bowels . Maybe she has n't anything else , either . The thought made him smile . Perhaps , soon , he would find out for himself . He wondered if her bones would bruise him . But . . . there was Patrick . Lionel knew how to be careful . He would use the girl for his own purposes , but Patrick must never know . That would result in his instant dismissal , the end of his dream . Patricia was torn between two desires  --  to rush home and gorge , or linger to look at Lionel . It was a measure of her yearning love that she preferred to see Lionel and suppressed her urge to run to the kitchen at home , while the servants dozed in their third-floor hot rooms sleeping off their own heavy dinner . Later , later . She was sick with hunger  --  and love . It was true that Lionel was only a glorified waiter , but she had begun to delude herself that he was really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would think with happiness . He looked like an Englishman . He was so elegant ; he had such graceful gestures . He spoke like a gentleman . She remembered her father 's stories that most Irishmen  --  except Dada , of course  --  were convinced they were descended from Irish kings . She believed it . Dada was only a peasant . As for that clodhopper Jason Garrity , he , too , was a peasant , with such big hands and feet and gloomy , craggy face . But Lionel , to Patricia , looked like a thoroughbred horse . Patrick looked at his watch . " Time to go , love , " he said , as he patted his lips . He wanted to get back to his guests in the lounge . Patricia rose . Now her hunger was impelling . Lionel materialized from the front of the room and slowly helped her put her white feather boa over her shoulders . She looked at him from under her lashes . Her heart trembled with bliss . As if he knew , he pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed her eyes for a moment , swimming in ecstasy and with what she did not  | know was healthy lust . Her face was luminous under the wide blue silk hat with the pink silk roses on it . Driving home in the new Oldsmobile , which snorted and exploded and belched out smoke , she sat in a dream , smiling , and her thin lips became lustrous . Once there , and Patrick gone back to the Inn-Tavern , she rushed to the kitchen and devoured quantities of food , standing by the icebox in an ecstasy of voraciousness . She drank two bottles of beer ; then , unusually sleepy , she went upstairs to her huge ornate bedroom and fell on the bed , to dream of Lionel . Daniel Dugan sat in the narrow Mulligan garden and smoked , and thought about the new hotel . Nothing moved there . The whole damned country had come to a stricken standstill . He thought of the hunger riots in the streets . He thought of the foreclosed houses and frantic people selling their goods , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a man of compassion , but he did think of the starving faces of women and children , encountered everywhere . He knew the causes , and he felt a deep hatred and anger . He knew what was in the air . The Panic had been contrived . It had been arranged several years ago , and Daniel knew why . War . Or slavery . Perhaps both . He himself would profit , but he was not old enough as yet for this to give him full satisfaction . That would come later . From somewhere in the neighborhood came a doleful wailing of a gramophone that delivered a popular song , a negro spiritual : O Lord , remember the rich and remember the poor , Remember the bond an ' the free . And when you done rememberin ' all ' round , Then , 0 Lord , remember me ! Yes , indeed , thought Daniel Patrick Dugan sourly . Yes , indeed . A soft wind suddenly swept the warm garden and the street outside , and Daniel heard the startled jingling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was silence again except for the distant clatter of wheels , a drowsy clatter . Everything was so still , so warm , so shimmering with yellow sun , so peaceful .  | What an innocent country we still are , in spite of the politicians , thought Daniel . Regrettably , it wo n't last much longer . Regret-table ? Not for people like me ! thought Daniel Patrick Dugan.  | To Patricia , the long days crawled to the next Sunday . She counted each hour . What if it rained ? She prayed ardently for the first time in her life that it would not rain . She even visited the Blessed Sacrament on Friday to make that naive petition . She amused herself by considering what clothes she would wear . As she did so , she hummed : Sad news ; bad news ; Anything but glad news ! What do you suppose they 're saying At the fashion show ? They declare the shirtwaist girl Must pack her trunk and go ! But even in Philadelphia and New York they were still wearing shirtwaists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mused , she could n't go on her bicycle in a plain frock , and certainly not in an afternoon dress . She pondered if she should take her buggy . Then there would have to be an explanation to the stableboy , who reported to Patrick whenever Patricia used her vehicle . Patrick was under the happy delusion that as females were so weak , they could not go far on a bicycle ; they had not the strength for it . But a buggy was a different matter . For the first time Patricia was faced with a dilemma common to other girls : how to hoodwink a guarding father , how to go to a rendezvous furtively . She had heard of rendezvous ; very romantic . The lovelorn damsel rushing into her lover 's arms . Beyond the " rushing , " she knew nothing .  | The lover 's arms were all that mattered , and Patricia tingled , then shivered with a nameless anticipation . She decided on her best silk shirtwaist , green , with puffed sleeves and a high ruched collar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists . With it she would wear her white duck skirt , daringly cut to the ankles , and a silver belt , and white slippers . The shirtwaist had cost , said Patrick , a fortune-twentyfive dollars  --  and had been imported from New York . But it was all handmade , all hand-tucked . Even the lace at the wrists was " real " and was not the cheap machine-made kind . The garment was crepe de chine of a very superior kind . " A man could buy the finest overcoat for winter , for that , " Patrick had said ruefully , remembering the Panic now devastating the country . Patricia had shrugged . With the outfit finally determined , Patricia looked over her jewelry . Mama 's large cameo for the throat , with a rim of tiny diamonds and emeralds . And her pearl earrings . She had a new watch , too , to be pinned on the shirtwaist . Patrick had given it to her on her recent birthday , and it was very small , though heavy , and the pin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a serious question . Gloves it was , then . A lady did not go to a rendezvous gloveless . All week long Patricia had expanded like a rosebud . Her cheeks glowed with new color ; her lips became ardently pink , thin and tight though they were . Her brown hair took on a gloss , and her eyes widened , showing golden specks in their agate depths . Daniel , who lived with the Mulligans while he looked for a house for himself , regarded her with amusement . Miss Prim was beginning to look very naughty ; she had an exalted appearance , as if preparing herself for bed . An unknown lover ? That , of course , was impossible in this dreadful little town , impossible for a protected girl like Patricia , who probably had not the slightest idea about sexual congress . She would n't even know the words , thought Daniel . He would watch his cousin covertly . She had begun to move like a woman suddenly conscious of her thighs for the first time . His disillusioned eye had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , he would think , good for the poor homely little thing , so long as she does n't bring a bundle home . By Friday he no longer believed that it was impossible that Patricia had a lover unknown to her father . I hope it 's no one disreputable ,  | for Uncle Pat 's sake , he said to himself . But girls did not sneak off with respectable and approved young men . So it was most likely an unacceptable scoundrel , and for a moment or two Daniel felt uneasy . Should he hint something to Uncle Pat ? No , he finally decided . Let the girl have her fun  --  provided she had the sense not to go too far . Daniel was somewhat afraid that Patricia did not have this sense . Well , it was no business of his . He was a selfish young man who prudently minded his own affairs . He began to watch Patricia , however . Patrick said to his daughter on Saturday , " Looking forward to tomorrow to have dinner with me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , Patricia looked undecided , a new deceit of hers . Then she shook her head . " I think not , Dada , not tomorrow . I 've had a headache the last day or two . I think I 'll stay home and rest . " Daniel looked on with amusement . He saw that she fluttered her short eyelashes demurely . " Take a tablet of that new aspirin , " said Patrick , worried . Patricia promised she would , and tried to appear fragile . Because of the " headache , " she was excused from attending Mass on Sunday , a rare thing . But Patrick , who stayed home for Sunday dinner , was cheered that his daughter had quite recovered at noon , when Mass was safely over . Daniel was always inwardly hilarious at Patricia 's enormous appetite , though Patrick insisted that she " ate like a bird . " After dinner , in the warm still afternoon , Patrick went up for a nap . Daniel said to his cousin , " Would you like to take a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " vulgarized " her name . She said , with haste , " Oh , no thanks , Daniel . I think I 'll take a nap , like Dada . " There was an apprehensive glint in her eyes as she stared at him . But he said with kindness , " Well , so I will take a walk alone . I 'd like to look at the hotel again , on the mountain , though God knows when it will ever be finished . " Patricia sighed deeply . She did not like or trust Daniel , but this time she gave him such a happy smile that he was touched . He wanted to say to her , " Take care , Patty old dear , take care . " But he refrained . Why were n't girls , these modem days , informed about the result of indiscretions ? This was n't the age of Lincoln , for Christ 's sake . It was the new twentieth century . The young ladies he frequented , some younger than Patricia , were well-informed indeed . Patricia carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sailor hat with a red ribbon , and a heavy veil to protect her complexion , pulled on her best white kidskin gloves , and crept down the stairs , avoiding every step that might creak . She heard the snoring of her father and relaxed . She looked for Daniel and saw the smoke of his pipe in the garden . So , she was safe . No servants were around in the hot Sunday quiet . Her bicycle was in a shed behind the house . She wheeled it out . Once on the street , she mounted it and swiftly pedaled off . The streets were deserted . There was no sound but the dry rustling of trees and an occasional whining of a phonograph or the mechanical tinkling of a player piano . Sunday in Belleville was truly a torpid day of rest , religiously kept . No children skated , laughed or shouted , or played ball . Instead they rocked silently on porches , smoothing dolls or reading an improving book , or moved with prim sedateness in back gardens , or sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their feet . Everyone hated Sundays , if he was young , and especially if it were summer . Local stores were tightly closed , shades drawn , awnings up , and passersby saw only languid reflections of themselves on glass . Patricia loathed Sundays . One could " call " on " at homes , " but she found these visits dull , sipping lukewarm tea and eating damp sandwiches and tasteless pastries , and talking about politics and scandals . The one other permissible Sunday activity was a picnic . Anyone who had a carriage or a buggy or other vehicle was out on the road looking for picnic spots , which Patricia found equally as depressing , with hordes of children , baskets of cold fried chicken , potato salad , greasy ham sandwiches , crumbly cake , milk , flies , bees , hornets , ants , and mosquitoes . Patricia , as she pedaled , did not escape the dust of the well-traveled road , and soon there was a yellowish deposit on her duster and on the beautiful white kid gloves . She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the sun was burning , and no lady ever had sunburn , or , heaven forbid ! did she ever acquire a parched , tanned complexion . Her eyes began to smart even in the shade of the white straw sailor hat . She was becoming too " rosy . " Carriages and buggies clopped past her and automobiles belched a stench of gasoline in her face . Patricia kept blinking her eyes free to search for the entrance to the glade . It seemed to elude her . What if there were picnickers there , too , with their screaming children , dogs , and baskets and tablecloths  | on the grass ? She felt outrage that such a lovely place would be violated . Then , just as she was getting desperate , she saw the narrow opening between the trees and brush . She dismounted , looked about her at the traffic , then wheeled her bicycle through the breach , walking on tiptoe as if frightened of causing any noise . She found the glade , and murmured a sound of thanksgiving that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fragrance of the hot grass and wildflowers floated intoxicatingly on the air . Beyond , the green-and-purple mountains were painted against a sky too brilliant for the eye to endure . Patricia took off her duster , veiling , hat , and gloves and shook them . The disturbed dust made her sneeze . She was dismayed . She had earlier coated her nose and chin with rice powder , but had forgotten to bring the bag . Carefully she wiped her nose and wet eyes . Lionel was not here as yet . She consulted her watch . Half-past two . For a terrible instant she wondered if he had forgotten . Or had he another lady-friend ? Her heart quailed , then lifted . He had no one like Patricia Eleanor Mulligan , so rich , so stylish , so desirable ! She pushed the long pollen-filled harsh grass aside and tramped her feet on what remained , making a hollow . She sat gingerly and spread her white duck skirt about her to avoid creases , opened her purse , and brought out a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion : she saw beauty , not real reflection . She puffed up her pompadour , smoothed the long brown curl on her shoulder , assumed a posture of careful grace , and waited , her heart thudding against her spare chest . She heard the muffled rumble of traffic and distant voices ; she heard the lethargic drone of insects , the subdued comments of birds too sluggish in the heat to go searching for food . Patricia , leaning back in her hollow , felt the pressure of her elbows on the flattened grass , the prickling of stiff twiglike stems . But she did not move . She kept her eyes on the break in the wild shrubbery . She looked at her watch again . Had the minute hand crept only ten minutes ? It seemed an hour . Still , it was almost three o'clock , and she had learned from her father that the " Sunday lads " left the Inn-Tavern at one . What was keeping Lionel ? He ought to have been here nearly forty-five minutes ago , waiting for her , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the little fool wonder if he was coming or had forgotten her . He had learned that a lover 's  | promptness received a woman 's disdain and made her condescending . But delay made her more eager with concealed relief when he finally arrived . He knew how to time such matters . Women were such imbeciles , except for Joan Garrity and , he admitted , his keen-eyed sister , Molly . Joan might love him passionately , as he loved her , but she was never carried away by her love . She was always there , her magnificent blue eyes seeing everything calmly and coolly even when her hand was warmest , her lips the sweetest . As for Molly , Lionel had never loved his sister , or even liked her , but he respected the steadfast bedrock of her spirit , her inability to deceive , her scornful awareness . He had a suspicion , however , that Molly was far more vulnerable than the crippled Joan , and in this he was correct . Molly , in spite of her inner strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Merely thinking of Joan made Lionel 's whole body throb , but almost with reverence . Joan was sheathed steel . But Molly could be bent under severe circumstances . Lionel , as yet , had never seen her bend , not even when her father  --  her favorite parent  --  had died a year ago . Lionel also suspected that under Molly 's intrepid exterior , her refusal to compromise on a matter of principle , was the gentlest heart , a heart Joan did not possess . So Lionel had more honest respect for Joan than he had for his sister . He could not imagine Joan melting mawkishly at the sight of a man  --  not even himself  --  but he had seen the golden lovelight in Molly 's eyes when she encountered Jason Garrity , the helpless drop of her capable hands , the sudden weak aspect of her compact body . On the few occasions this past week when he had seen Daniel Dugan , he had also seen Molly , and with great alertness and conjecture he had observed that Daniel always greeted Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she passed him in the hall , looked long and intently after her . Lionel had carefully put away this most intriguing and possibly valuable piece of information . People were Lionel 's " business . " They were participants in a great game on which he could gamble . Only Jason Garrity had ever come close to Lionel in real friendship , and Joan was the only creature he had ever loved . Jason he could trust , and Joan was part of himself . He had known , even as a child , that villains had more in common and were more loyal to each other than were the virtuous . His father , who was rarely profound , had once said , " There are no quarrels in hell ; only in heaven . " Lionel had  | wondered , briefly , what unspoken terror had inspired that remark . But he was not to know . His father was too silent a man , and he had never before or after made such a subtle remark . If anything had distinguished that dedicated workingman , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that toil was all . He had left nearly all he had to his wife , some two thousand painfully saved dollars , one hundred dollars for his funeral , and fifty dollars for Masses for his soul . He had never known that his son had thousands of dollars in savings . He might have approved , but he would not have been interested , so long as the source was honest . These things ran through Lionel 's mind like a thin streak of mercury as he pedaled  --  not too fast  --  to his meeting with Patricia Mulligan . He never doubted that she was waiting for him . Then , as he neared the entrance to the glade , he went over his planned approach to her . Should he , or should he not , seduce her on this second lonely meeting ? He would see . Lionel was seldom precipitous . He tempered all things by nuances . Forcing matters was often disastrous and defeating . Pedaling along easily , he was suddenly startled by the loud rasping horn as an automobile roared past him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With high good nature he yelled , " Get a horse ! " They waved at him , and two women jiggled their parasols . No one was offended . Lionel was careful not to offend people . He found the entrance to the glade . He had picked out landmarks the Sunday he had met Patricia there , and so was not uncertain . Lionel had a very orderly mind . There were rare occasions when he could be reckless , but he always got away in time , and to his advantage , leaving others confused . He was careful to move as soundlessly as the fox he so resembled , stirring hardly a twig of the scrambled shrubbery and hardly bending the tall grass he crept through . He left his bicycle against a tree and slipped like a tawny shadow to the edge of the glade . There was Patricia in what the poor girl thought a most beguiling posture . She had practiced this sedulously at home , studying reflections in her large mirror . The padding artfully thrust up her tiny breasts . Her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the duck skirt . Lionel was highly amused , as usual , on encountering human pretensions . He never had compassion , no matter how innocent they were . He studied the unaware girl , and  | wanted to laugh . It still seemed unbelievable that he had seen passion in those unattractive eyes , on that meager mouth . The ricepowdered nose stuck out glaringly from the pallid complexion . Well , he had seen worse in the cheaper brothels , where starving girls waited hopefully for a dollar or two . Last Sunday , elegantly clothed , Patricia had seemed passable . In less lavish and bejeweled dress today , she seemed more like an ordinary girl than a fine young lady . Still , she was Patricia Mulligan . He stepped back a few paces , as silent as a drifting leaf , then began to whistle rollickingly . He reached the glade again . Patricia 's pale face had turned pink , her eyelids drooped alluringly , her cheeks gained color . She opened her eyes as if greatly startled , but kept her pose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a good tenor voice , very lilting , which he often used to advantage . He wore a neat summer suit of light linen , his best , and his straw hat was tilted over one merry eye . Patricia saw him in his Sunday finery from under her eyelids , and her heart pounded very heavily now . She murmured something which she hoped was nonchalant . Lionel advanced on her , removing his hat and revealing the blaze of his hair , which had been carefully combed into glistening waves . His new white shoes were immaculate with chalk . He sailed his hat on a bush , grinned to show his excellent white teeth , pulled up his trousers so as not to wrinkle them , and in one sinuous movement sat down , crossing his legs . " I did n't expect you today , Miss Mulligan , " he said . Patricia did not know what to say . What did a girl say to her " lover " ? She frantically tried to remember romantic phrases from some novels she had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , is n't it ? " said Lionel . He looked about swiftly for a less open spot where " the dark deed , " as the nickelodeons called it , could be consummated . He saw one , some feet to the left of Patricia . He was quite clever in discovering such hidden spots . Would the girl be amenable ? Or would she , at a strong overt gesture , get indignantly to her feet , slap his face , and run home to Dada to complain ? He studied her closely . He would not be too aggressive . He would let her show him the way , all by her ignorant self , and he would follow very judiciously , alert to genuine resistance . For a moment or two he was bored ; then he remembered this would be quite a conquest if he could manage it . Of course ,  | the girl was a virgin , and virgins could be difficult in the clinch , and they always cried  --  or worse , they screamed . He listened intently to the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could always keep one hand hovering over her mouth to muffle any shriek . Besides , he was too deft and experienced to really hurt her . He said , " I thought you were the most fascinating lady I had ever seen last Sunday , Miss Mulligan . " Then softly he added , " Patty ? " Patricia 's breath became choked . " Thank you . " She had no coquetry , so it was with sincerity that she added , " And . . . today ? " " Lovely , too . But different . You are always different , every time I see you . " Patricia 's face glowed quickly , as if light had flashed upon it . She smiled . When she smiled like this , which was rare , there was a certain shy sweetness on her face , and Lionel was pleased . She murmured , " Do n't call me Patty . " She thought of her cousin who called her that . Then she stammered , " Patsy . . . perhaps ? " " Charming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to within a foot of her feet . " It suits you . Devilish . " He waited . Patricia 's face glowed . How well he understood her ! No one else did . For a moment her eyes moistened with self-pity . Lionel imperceptibly moved a little closer . Finally he reached out , as with a timid uncertainty , and put his hand lightly on her ankle . She started like a young deer , began to move her foot , then let it remain . She trembled . " Forgive me , " he said in a very humble tone , though keeping his hand on her foot . " But you have the most delicate . . . ankles I 've ever seen . " " Thank you , " she replied in a voice that was genuinely fragile and shaking . His fingers felt hot through her white silk stocking , and a long thrill ran disconcertingly up her leg . More tears came into her eyes , and her breast heaved . She could hardly bear these new sensations , yet longed for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand reach a little higher , and he felt the girl 's increased trembling . But she did not recoil . He looked about him , as if absently . " It 's hot out here , " he said . " You must be uncomfortable . . . Patsy . Over there , there 's more shade , deeper , under those bushes and under that big tree . "  | Patricia 's instincts caused her to pause . A young lady never went into a secluded spot alone with a gentleman . Never . That was very compromising . Suddenly Patricia wanted to be compromised . The fingers were tightening on her calf , urgently , pleadingly . Then Lionel was on his feet , smiling down at her and holding out his hand . She hesitated for a long warning moment , then recklessly gave him her hand and let him pull her to her feet . She let him draw her , stumbling , through the high grass to the shadowy spot . Her whole body was suddenly shaking , and this was both frightening and importunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find herself half-sprawling on thinner and gentler grass , the fronds of a willow drooping about her . Again , she was dimly afraid as she stared at Lionel . He was casually taking off his coat ; he carefully laid it at a small distance . Then , laughing happily , he was sitting beside her . He took her hand and said , " This is nicer , is n't it ? And no one can see us . " There was a duskiness here , a smell of moss and toadstools , infinitely exciting , like musk , to the entranced Patricia . Lionel had opened her hand . He was slowly and enticingly stroking her palm with one finger , and watching her . More thrills ran up her arm , across her breast , down over her corseted belly , and then to what were referred to as private parts . Shameful , indecent ! But how overpowering , how sweetly paralyzing , how tenderly voluptuous ! Her eyes , stretched and distended , her mouth open and wet , her throbbing throat , confronted Lionel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be easy . He had come prepared . But . . . how to prepare under her gaze ? Well , that would be easy too ; the girl knew nothing . That she was in love with him , most terribly in love , did not occur to him , or , if it did for an instant , he dismissed it as irrelevant . He wanted only to arouse her so he could take her with the least possible difficulty to himself . Watching her very closely , he slipped his fingers under the lacecovered wrist ; he felt the wild throbbing of her pulse . Good . She was ready for more liberties . " What a stylish shirtwaist , " he said . " Silk , " she whispered . For the first time in her young life she felt heat in her underdeveloped breasts , a sharp rising against the satin of the camisole , and a frenzied desire for more intimate contact . Lionel was slowly unbuttoning the tiny crystal buttons of the shirtwaist . Patricia moved , distantly shocked ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly flaccid . She could  | hear nothing but the roaring of her heart , compelling , demanding , surrendering . The camisole was rolled down with gentle mothlike movements , and then Lionel 's lips were on a bare little breast . Patricia cried out once , then was helplessly undone . " Beautiful , beautiful , " Lionel groaned , and proceeded . Patricia 's body arched . When Lionel 's hands were on her drawers , untying the ribbons , she blindly and without real volition assisted him . Now his own ready passion was obliterating even his caution . He closed his eyes and thought of Joan . He had his own fantasies . He began to sweat in his urgency . The girl 's flesh under his seeking hands was wet also . He unbuttoned his trousers . His cold mind still was in control , however , and he thought : No need to rumple them if I 'm careful . He fumbled for something in a pocket and with one hand covered himself with experienced swiftness . Patricia did not see this . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see his face , very close , and to her chaotic senses it was the most beloved in all the world . In the turbulence of her unfamiliar emotions , she was lifted into desiring joy . Her head was on the grass ; tears ran down her cheeks . When she felt the weight of Lionel 's body on hers , she closed her eyes with rapture ; without her knowledge , her arms lifted and enclosed his chest . The heat of his flesh became hers . Then , without warning , she felt an intense and piercing pain , and was struggling , her legs thrashing , her arms and hands pushing him away in terror . But he was stronger ; the pain became more unendurable . She opened her mouth to scream , but a quick hand was on it , smothering her . She was certain ! she was being killed . All at once the pain was gone . She could hear Lionel panting in her ear ; his sweat mingled with her tears . She saw his face , his eyes shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , alien yet again exciting . It was then that she felt an explosion of ecstasy , unbearable , blinding , violent beyond all violence , running in tides over her body . She did not know that Lionel 's passion was far more than her own , and that it was the untouched Joan he was deflowering and to whom he was making savage and adoring and total and tumultuous love . It was Joan Garrity 's beautiful face he was kissing . It was Joan 's full red mouth he was devouring . It was Joan 's body he  | was possessing . His own tears now joined Patricia 's , and he cried over and over , " My darling , my love , my darling , darling ! " His chest pressed Patricia down ; it was as if he were trying to absorb her half-naked body into his , merging it into himself . In the final climax he felt that his blood had joined the blood of Joan , and it was , running riotously together in an ardent stream , rising in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he was strangely reverent , awed . Patricia came to consciousness first . Lionel 's arms were gripping her with a pain that was also joyous . She did not feel unclean . She had loved Lionel before ; now she loved him with her new womanhood , her new knowledge . He was hers  --  forever . That he had not made love to her but to another girl never occurred to her , and never would . That he had taken , not herself , but another woman , would have been beyond her comprehension . She was only sure , with elation and selfless delight , that she was loved and that this love would never end . The pragmatic Patricia Mulligan was no longer practical . She loved as a woman , as she would never love again . She would give herself , over and over , with no end to the giving . She felt Lionel rolling off her body . Leaning on his elbows , he looked down at her with astonishment . He was fully shaken for the first time in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His face was absolutely white ; the freckles seemed to start out upon it . He swallowed hard , catching his breath . But he came back to reality very fast . He covered himself hastily , after removing the object he had put on , burying it in the grass . He reached for his coat , and took a handkerchief from it . He thrust it into Patricia 's hand . He averted his eyes from her exalted face . " Here , " he muttered . " Wipe yourself . " Patricia thought he was overcome . She waited for more kisses , for touches of tenderness . But Lionel was buttoning his trousers . His hands were shaking . Patricia saw this with gratification . Her heart became tumescent with adoration and fresh desire . She wiped herself . Then she was horrified to see blood on the handkerchief . She cried out , staring at it . " It always happens . The first time . Nothing to be frightened about , " he mumbled . Well , it had n't been too bad He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along , not this miserable girl whose face had begun to pucker , preparing for tears of fright .  | " It is n't anything , " he said roughly , then remembered that the girl was Patricia Mulligan . " Always the first time , " he added , more gently . " Will it . . . will it last long ? " Her voice was faint and weak . " No . It 's just about over . Do n't be afraid . " He knelt , dressing himself . He heard her say in a changed and timid voice , " Do you . . . do you love me , Lionel ? " Oh , goddamn , he thought . The silly bitches always ask that ! There was only one reply . He patted her flank , smiled , and said , " Why , of course . . . Patsy . " " I 'll love you always , " she whispered as she buttoned the shirtwaist and pulled down her grass-stained skirt . " I 'll love you always . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual . It made them feel less dirty , less used . Continuing with the ritual , he said , " I hope so . " Putting her hand on his shoulder , she said , " How soon can we be married ? " He looked at her and was aghast . Married ! " You did say we 'd be married . . . " She faltered . " Over and over . " But he had been crying that out to Joan Garrity . It had risen spontaneously from his enraptured heart . He knew that he was in danger . He shuddered in spite of the heat of the day . He said , " Patsy , we must talk of that later . Later , much later . We have so much to think about . Do n't we ? " His voice was actually entreating , he was so fearfully alarmed . Her head still lying on the grass , Patricia nodded in submission . She stroked his arm , and he shuddered again , but did not draw himself away . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of this to anyone , will we ? It . . . it is too . . . precious . Is n't it ? " " Oh , yes , yes ! " cried Patricia . " Too precious ! It 's ours alone . " She was almost lovely in her meekness , her understanding . He helped her to her feet and brushed the grass blades off her clothing . She held up her face , like a child , for his kiss . Closing his eyes , he obeyed . She did not feel the kiss was dry , reluctant . " And . . . the Sunday after next ? " she pleaded , her eyes glowing . " And the next , and the next , and the next , " he said .  | Patricia never fully remembered pedaling home . She was not on a bicycle . She was being carried on wings , her body tingling and content . Lionel , cautiously taking another road home , was very thoughtful . He was not at all on wings . His mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mention to the girl that his salary was very low , too low as yet to acquire a wife . Step by step . That was the way . Of her secrecy he could be sure , for she had a father . Had she had a mother , that would have been dangerous . Girls did not confess indiscretions to a male parent . He looked at his watch , a " turnip , " as it was called  --  for it was nickel and cheap  --  and saw it was five o'clock . He smiled again . He would go to Joan , as he always did on Sunday evenings , and he would look at her , and remember . His mind , always orderly , was teeming with plans . If that damned hotel ever got built , he could marry Joan . He had not asked her , as yet , but he knew that she was waiting for him and would always wait . He thought of her face again , the face he had really kissed with such terrible ardor in the glade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan with whom he lay , never the girl of the moment . Joan , Joan , he thought . My darling , darling , darling . My darling , thought Patricia , and even as she smiled on her bicycle , her eyes filled with happy tears .  | Patrick Mulligan and his nephew Daniel Dugan sat in the garden of Patrick 's house this golden late-September day . The mountains were the color of oranges against a benign and gentle sky tinged with gilt . The autumn flowers in the garden flared with violent color , as if in denial of their coming death . And , why not ? thought Daniel . Even in mid-season they had not been so vehement ; each petal glowed with light and hue ; each flower face lifted itself to the warm air and the scented wind , a wind that had not been so pungent a month ago . White butterflies and the great black-andyellow striped monarch butterflies blew from bush to bush , from blossom to blossom , their wings luminous . A tranquillity lay on the garden , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves , which were turning to scarlet and bronze . It was Sunday , but the sabbath peace had dwelt on the land since the end of August . Daniel smoked his pipe , and Patrick smoked one of his thick black cigars . They had not talked for several moments , content in silent companionship . But Patrick 's face had an overcast of anxiety . He said , " This damned Panic . When will it end ? " Daniel said , " When our invisible government wants it to . You know , this was contrived , to force the passage of that private organization of bankers , now calling themselves the Federal Reserve System , which has nothing to do with government at all . The bankers call it federal ' to deceive the people . Under our Consti- ' tution , only Congress has the right to coin money , but the bankers do n't like that . They want to coin money themselves . We 've been over that before , Uncle Pat . Once that amendment to the Constitution passes  --  the Federal Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our currency and bring about the rule of what they love to call the elite . ' " So , now we have a Panic which was planned a long time ago . The plotters are now telling the American people that if there is a Federal Reserve System there will be no more panics , no more depressions . They will control ' that . Teddy Roosevelt knows what they are up to . William Jennings Bryan , that passionate and incoherent bumbler , knows , too , and that 's why he is screeching about crucifying mankind on a cross of gold . But he is too hysterical to be taken seriously . " " Ah , God , " Patrick said . Daniel nodded . " And along with that amendment there is proposed another : a federal income tax . The government has promised that only the rich ' will be taxed  --  for the people 's social benefits  --  but the people will discover that the real victim is the ' little man . ' Like Ben Franklin once said , a national income tax will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Patrick . " That happened in Ireland . The Irish were taxed to the death , Danny boy , by the English aristocrats . Queen Victoria said that after the Irish were eliminated in Ireland , by taxation and starvation and confiscation , of course , she would help the English aristocracy to resettle ' our country with their own kind . I know , I saw it for myself . " " I know it , too , Uncle Pat . And it can happen here . " " You do n't have any faith in the American people , " said Patrick . " They wo n't allow a federal income tax . " Daniel laughed , and the laugh was not pleasant . " Oh , yes , they will ! Their greed will be appealed to . Envy , one of the deadly sins , is very deeply rooted in human nature , Uncle Pat . And God always punishes it . This time the punishment will again be slavery through taxes  --  as it has always been . " He looked at his uncle kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Federal Reserve System , and the financiers behind the federal income tax , who will cause the passage of those two amendments to the Constitution . Very soon , too . As I 've told you before , a government needs money through taxation to conduct imperialistic wars . There 's something brewing in the world , a war of governments against each other to control the world . " Patrick shook his head . " Danny boy . No American would go to war . "  | " Yes , he will . There will be wonderful slogans . The old Romans were expert in that . The Senate and the People of Rome . " One nation , one government , one people . ' Yes , indeed . But all the time , it was only the government , and the men who controlled it , who wanted more and more power . This will happen to America , too . " " I hope I die before it does , Danny . " Daniel looked at him with affectionate commiseration . " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is too nice a day . Let 's enjoy it . As the Roman gladiators said in the bloody arena , Hail , Caesar , we who are about to die salute you . " " We who are about to die . . . " ' murmured Patrick . He paused , then looked at the distant mountains . " Lord , have mercy , Lord , have mercy , Christ , have mercy ? " Daniel said , and his face was grim , " Yes , I know the kyrie . I wish every American knew it . And there 'll be the day , in America , when the despairing will chant it , without hope , I 'm afraid . For the despairing will be responsible for their own doom . " Patrick rocked heavily in his chair , his bright blue eyes clouded with thought . He said , " That damned hotel . I 've gambled all I had . Mortgaged the Inn-Tavern . Everybody 's up to their ears in debt , for the hotel . And we ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Daniel . " The big chaps are careful . If this Panic goes on much longer , there 'll be a revolution . They 'll stop short of that . " Did n't Mrs. Lindon buy thirty acres each side of the property ? Do n't worry too much , Uncle Pat . " " Easy enough for you to say , Danny . " " I 've put half a million of my own money into it , have n't I ? I believe in it . Half a million , Uncle Pat , is a big investment , and I 'm not an optimist . I do n't invest in losing propositions . " Patrick gave him a smile of love . " Wish you were my son , bucko . " " I am , almost . I 've been studying this business of yours . It will be a great thing , Uncle Pat . I know it will . " He stood up , yawning and stretching in the golden warmth . He looked at his watch . He thought of Molly Nolan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabled rose . She 's got a sheen on her . She 's actually getting some flesh on her bones . Like a woman in love . Where is she today , by the way ? "  | " Gone off on her bicycle . She does that , sometimes , on Sundays . " " Where does she go ? " " Well , today she 's with the Sinclair girls . One of their teas . " Daniel glanced at his uncle , and then away . " She 's becoming more sociable , then ? " " Yes . Glad of it , too . Patricia always was . . . well , a little snobbish . She 's improving . " Patrick laughed fondly . " Know what she told me a week ago ? She said to me that I was n't paying the boyeens in the dining room enough . And the ones helping me manage . That spalpeen Lionel Nolan , and Jase Garrity . In this Panic , too , when a man 's lucky to have a job ! Made me promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even looked at Jase , but now she 's telling me how poor he is . Who is n't ? Well , I promised . Anything to please my little colleen . " Daniel studied his uncle . " And so you are going to increase the wages of Jason Garrity . . . and Lionel Nolan ? " " Well , then . I promised the girl . " Daniel put his hands in his pockets and looked at the mountains . " I thought she did n't like Jase Garrity . " Patrick smiled fatly . " Seems like she does , does n't it ? I 'm that glad , Danny . It 's a lad after me own heart . " " But Lionel is n't ? " " Ca n't raise one without the other , now , can I , Danny ? " " I suppose not . " Clever Patty , thought the young man . Clever , indeed . He thought again of Molly , and the conversation he had had with her a few days ago . For several weeks he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday in his new automobile , a luxurious Packard , and she had politely declined with a remark that her widowed mother needed her . Daniel loved her voice ; it was lilting and musical , a feminine copy of her brother 's , but hers had a sometimes disconcerting sharp edge to it , like the point of a knife in honey . She was all business , swift , efficient , clear-minded at all times , and would tolerate no shiftlessness in others . When Daniel called her into his own office with some question on general procedure , she was almost instantly there with a file folder under her arm , and she would respond crisply and without hesitation , looking directly at him with her extraordinary eyes . He had never known a woman  | like Molly Nolan before , forthright , frank , honest , and without coquetry or pretense or pretended coyness , and with an intelligence , he thought , as acute and discerning as any man 's . Yet , with all this , she was certainly not a " new woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was most unaware of it . It was not a deliberate charm like her brother 's ; she was never ingratiating ; she rarely smiled , she did not try to please everyone ; she was deft in every way and often implied impatience with fools . In short , Daniel had observed , Molly was a realist and could be domineering . Still , under it all , he had guessed there was a kindness , a fidelity , a tenderness , even an innocence , all hidden for fear of appearing weak . Once a young assistant cook appeared in Patrick 's office , only to find him out for the day . He then told Molly , on her insistence , that he needed more wages . Molly had stared at him . " Times are very bad , " she said , " and Mr. Mulligan has not reduced the wages of anyone , though other employers have had to do it . He takes the loss himself . But why do you need more money ? " The cook had mentioned his five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mulligan is not responsible for your children , " she had said , with that knife point in her voice . She had then swiftly motioned with her hand in dismissal . No one argued with Molly , not even Patrick . Daniel had first been intrigued and amused by the girl ; then he had come to respect and admire her . There were no blurred edges on Molly , no ambiguities . A little later he was captivated by her . If I do n't take care , he would tell himself with humor , I shall fall in love with the damned girl , and then God have mercy on me . He did not find the prospect disagreeable , however . He had soon found out that Molly disapproved of her brother , and he guessed why . He also knew , to his vexation , that she was in love with Jason Garrity , and he knew that it was hopeless . Daniel was by nature a keen investigator , and as a business administrator and lawyer for his uncle , it was his duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certain conclusions , and with no dangerous delay . He knew all about Lionel and Jason now . Patrick had told him of the incredible beauty of the crippled Joan Garrity . Once Molly , in a moment of unusual despair and fear , had confided to Patrick that her brother was besotted by Joan , " who is just like him , I 'm  | afraid . He needs a better wife than Joan is ; they will just aid and abet each other . I know exactly what Lionel is ; I know exactly what Joan is . " Patrick had told Daniel of this confidence , not out of a desire to gossip  --  one did n't gossip about employees  --  but because of his fondness for Molly , who should not be upset . " The colleen takes life too seriously for her age . " Patricia appeared with her father for dinner every other Sunday at the Inn-Tavern , and it had not taken long for Daniel to see that Jason Garrity was in love with her . This amazed him . He had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's short answers . Daniel was impressed by Jason 's total lack of falseness , his tremendous intelligence and integrity , his profound depth of character . That Jason disliked and mistrusted Daniel himself was only too evident . Daniel knew himself to be exigent , but in this world a man had to be , or he perished in his weakness . Jason had an almost feminine intuition . What he saw in Daniel inspired his dislike , and Daniel understood this . " There 's some rock-bound intolerance in that lad , " he had told Patrick . " He 'll never compromise for the sake of his own advantage . Funny thing , though , he 's at war with something or someone , in his mind , or his soul , if you will . " Daniel dutifully attended Mass with his uncle . He did not see Jason there very often , and when he did , Jason would sit with his eyes unswervingly regarding the great crucifix above the high altar . When he prayed , it was with a strange intensity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or incomprehensible father and demanded answers to unanswerable questions . In his spirit he is a priest , Daniel would think with a curious mixture of compassion and mirth . That such a young man should be in love with Patricia Mulligan was inexplicable to Daniel . Patricia was both stupid and shrewd , sly and meanly obdurate . That a whole world existed beyond her and was unconcerned with her did not enter her mind . She was pretentious , haughty with those she considered her inferiors , and devoted a great deal of time to her appearance . Daniel had never seen her reading even a newspaper , except for the local society column . She was pettish too often , would sulk if crossed , and had a hysterical temper if anything displeased her , which it did often . But if she wanted something , she could be sugary sweet to her father , for whom she had much contempt as well as fear .  | Daniel admitted that she had style and a certain cultivated flair , and that she could quote what she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted she fully understood what she was quoting . Daniel found her boring , and he disliked her . He knew the dislike was strongly returned . Patricia had a quickness about her ; her intuition had warned her that Daniel would never find her admirable . When Jason , on his Sundays on duty , would stop at Patrick 's table and politely inquire if anything else was desired , Patricia would give a small flounce on her chair and avert her eyes as if from an offending spectacle or intrusion . But Jason would helplessly linger , looking at her , and Daniel felt annoyance at this . Jason was intelligent ; how did it happen that he did not really see this girl ? But then , Daniel would conclude , does any of us ever really see the obvious , or care to see it ? Daniel was an astute observer and was deeply interested in his fellowman , partly because it was necessary in his profession and partly because he had the Irish tendency to look for meanings beyond the merely patent . In the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed his uncle 's affairs and knew more about people than the genial Patrick would ever know . A little over a week ago Molly had come into Daniel 's office with a downcast face and an unusual timidity . He was very pleased ; she had never entered before unless called . He stood up and smiled , his polished-marble eyes alight . He offered Molly a chair , but she preferred to stand before his desk , her hands nervously clasped before her . He waited . She did not speak , but he saw the anxiety and trouble on her freckled face , that face which he was coming to find endearing . " Is there something I can do for you , Molly ? " he asked . Now she looked at him . Her firm mouth actually quivered . She swallowed . " I do n't know how to begin , " she said , her voice shaking and subdued . " I suppose I should talk to Mr. Mulligan . . . and then I somehow feel I should n't . " Daniel was delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick . That implied trust of a kind . " Well , " he said , " do you want to tell me ? " She glanced over her shoulder . She had closed the door . She wet lips he saw were dry . " This is confidential , Mr. Dugan , " she said . " Please . "  | " Of course , Molly . You can trust me . " Now she lifted her head and regarded him sharply . " Can I , Mr. Dugan ? " " You can , indeed . I give you my word . " The clean white and starched shirtwaist was trembling over her breast . Everything was so crisp about Molly except for that riot of red curls , which even the ribbon tying them back in a huge blue bow could not completely control . The curls seemed to twinkle and laugh , shimmering with copper highlights . The piquant features were very sober now . She studied him as if begging mercy , but there was pride on her face also . " It would be terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I think I need help . " " Go on , Molly , speak up . " All his interest was engaged now . Again she wet her lips . " It 's about Miss Mulligan . Patricia . You 're her cousin . I thought you might help . . . " Daniel sat down and took up a pencil in his fingers and twiddled it . " Patty ? Something wrong with Patty ? " Molly almost whispered , " I do n't know . But I 'm afraid it will be . " Daniel waited , and then he said with gentle impatience , " For God 's sake , Molly , speak up . " Molly drew a deep breath , and her eyes never left him . " It was two weeks ago . I had rented a buggy for a ride , on a Sunday . I 'd saved the money . It was a beautiful day , and my mother told me to go out for a while . She 's an invalid . So I rented the buggy and took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's where I wanted you to ride with me , Molly . " She was silent a moment . " I drove , all by myself . And then Patricia passed me fast on her bicycle . " Daniel 's alertness increased . " Yes ? She often rides on it . " Molly apparently did not hear him . " I called to her , but I think she did n't hear , or if she did , she ignored me . Patricia and I are n't really friends . Anyway , she . . . came to a break in the trees . She was quite a distance beyond me now . She got off her bicycle . . . went through the break . The trees and the shrubbery are very thick , you know . She disappeared . And then . . . And then . . . " " Yes , Molly ? " " I . . . A minute later my brother , Lionel , passed me . I was very surprised . I called to him , but there was a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She paused again , and now her eyes were somber with trouble . " He . . . went through the same break in the trees . Both of them  --  they acted as if they knew the place . I think they did . " So , thought Daniel with cold alarm . That explains many things . " I . . . I 'm not a spy , Mr. Dugan . I think that 's . . . despicable . But I was frightened . You see , I know my brother , Mr. Dugan . He is n't . . . well , the kindest person . Please understand . And I know that Patricia is . . . " " Very stupid , " said Daniel . " I 'd say she does n't know , perhaps , how to take care of herself . Mr. Mulligan has always sheltered her . She 's never had to take care of anyone but herself ; she 's never worked out in the world . She 's like a child , in spite of all her . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not my business . But I thought of Mr. Mulligan ; he 's such a good man , such a good father . And so I drove on a little , and then I hitched the horse to a tree and went back to the break . I was really frightened about Patricia . She . . . she never seemed to notice Lionel at the Inn-Tavern or in church . She . . . does n't pay attention to any of the people who work here . " Molly gave him a tentative smile . " She thinks we 're beneath her , I suppose . And yet , there she was meeting my brother . I wanted to make sure . " " And so you followed them , " said Daniel when she became silent . Her fingers were twisting together in agitation . " Yes . I did . I went through the break , very quietly . I just had to see . I just had to ! " " I understand , " said Daniel . She sighed in despair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from the road . Patricia . . . Lionel  --  they were standing there , hugging each other , and Patricia . . . well , she was sort of crying and laughing and saying , My darling , my darling ! " Molly looked at Daniel as if waiting for an explosion . But he was only nodding , and his square face was thoughtful . " That was all ? " he said . " No . " Now there was a rush of violent color into Molly 's distressed face . " I do n't know how to say this . But Lionel took her hand , and they went to the other edge of the space , under a willow tree . The branches and leaves covered them . They just disappeared in there . I did n't hear anything . I went away . "  | There was silence in the neat office . Daniel twiddled the pencil faster in his fingers . He wondered about Molly . How much did she know about these things ? " What do you think I should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her honey-colored eyes were filled with tears . " I thought . . . I thought you might tell Patricia about my brother . Mr. Dugan , he is n't a good man , my brother ! I could n't talk to him . He 'd only laugh at me or call me names . Lionel . . . he does n't care about anything but himself . I know it 's terrible for a sister to talk this way about her brother , but it 's true . He . . . he 'll hurt Patricia terribly . I . . . I like Mr. Mulligan . He 'll be hurt , too , if he knows . I 'd do anything for Mr. Mulligan , anything ! He 's such a good kind man , like a father to me . It 's Mr. Mulligan I 'm afraid for , but I just ca n't tell him . " " You do n't want me to tell him ? " Molly was aghast . She leaned on the desk and gazed at Daniel imploringly . " No ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry Jason Garrity , but she does n't . . . Patricia would n't even look at Jason . " Molly was almost sobbing . " I just do n't understand why she should meet my brother like that ! She does n't know the slightest thing about him . When I saw them together , I could n't believe it . " Molly , who was never distraught , was incoherent now . " I thought . . . perhaps you could say something to Patricia , but not telling her about this . In a conversation , perhaps about the Inn-Tavern , and tell her about Lionel . In an offhand way . Never letting her know you know . Mr. Mulligan . . . he relies on my brother , and Lionel is very smart and ambitious . I . . . I do n't want to hurt my brother , either , Mr. Dugan . " " Urn , " said Daniel , looking at the pencil . He leaned back in his chair . " You 've tied my hands pretty well , Molly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just do n't want anyone to be hurt . But Patricia should be warned . " Now Daniel was curious . " What do you think could happen to her , Molly ? " Molly swallowed very hard and averted her face . " Well , if she . . . if she fell in love with my brother . . . if she loves him . . . it would be terrible for her . He . . . he 's in love with Joan Garrity . He 's planning on marrying her when he has more money . I know that . And she 's in love with him , too . They 're the same kind of people . It 's hard to explain , Mr. Dugan , but they are . Patricia  | is n't Lionel 's kind . I do n't know why he is meeting Patricia . I still ca n't believe it , really . Why is he ? " Daniel smiled grimly . " I 'm sure I do n't know either , Molly . " Molly looked exhausted . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary next week . " " He 's raising Jase Garrity 's , too . " Molly nodded . " And times are so bad . Even at dinner now , the dining room is not over half-filled during the week . It 's just Saturdays now . And people are n't buying much whiskey or wine , either . I do n't understand why Mr. Mulligan 's raising their salaries , except that he 's such a good man . " She hesitated , then forced herself to speak . " I think Lionel 's using Patricia ! " Daniel could not help himself . " In what way , Molly ? " " To . . . to advance himself . And I think he got Patricia to ask her father , and so she had to ask for Jason , too . And I think Lionel put her up to all that ! I really do . " " And , to do that , he 's making love to her ? " Scarlet washed over Molly 's face . Then she cried , " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's telling Patricia he cares about her , and so he 's using her . " Daniel was still curious . He said again , " Um . Well , Molly , girls will be girls and boys will be boys . As for Patricia  --  what 's a silly flirtation , Is there ? " He leaned toward Molly , somewhat amused at her confusion . " But what if Patricia fell in love with him and he married someone else , Mr. Dugan ? " Daniel sighed . For God 's sake , did n't the girl know anything ? Now he was no longer amused . He said , " Do you think Lionel might really want to marry Patricia for her money , for a big position with her father ? " Molly shook her head wretchedly . " Under other circumstances , I 'd suspect that . But Lionel wants Joan ; he 's always wanted her . If he could marry Patricia for her money , and have Joan too , he 'd do that . I know he would . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . No . Lionel wants only Joan . I 've watched them for years . They are . . . one person , really . " Daniel tapped his very white teeth with the pencil . " If Lionel is truly ambitious , and all for himself , he 'd marry Patricia and forget Joan . Other men have done that . "  | " But . . . Mr. Mulligan . He 'd never consent . I know that . Lionel . . . he 's very strange . He 'd never give Joan up , never . You 'd think he would , but he would n't . It would be like cutting half of him off . " She added , " And there 's the new hotel . When that is built , Lionel will have money too . He 's . . . I do n't know the word for what he feels for Joan . . . " " Obsessed , perhaps ? " Molly considered . Then she nodded . " Obsessed . It was always that way . Lionel can be reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's there . " Daniel sighed . " I see I have to be tactful . I 'll do all I can , Molly , I promise you . And thank you for telling me . . . . Molly , you ca n't control other people 's lives , you know . " " But he 's my brother ! " Daniel was touched . " Yes , Molly , I know . I 'll do my best . And then I 'll report to you . " He stood up and took her hand and looked down at her , and she was comforted and reassured . She wiped her eyes and blew her nose , then tried to smile . " Thank you , Mr. Dugan . " She pulled her hand away and left the room lightly and swiftly . Daniel stared at the closed door . What a hell of a situation . Stupid Patty . Then all at once he knew that he was in love with Molly Nolan , and he was amazed at himself .  | The next Sunday threatened rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window of the dining room as she , her father , and Daniel were eating breakfast . They had just returned from Mass . The day had darkened ; the mountains looked rough and brown and there were wisps of fog drifting through the lower reaches of the great hills . The air had become chill , and a new wind was battering the walls of the big , ugly house ; wood had been lighted in the fireplace . As yet , there was no rain . The gaslight in the overhead chandelier glimmered on the silver dishes on the table . " I hope it does n't rain , " said Patricia . " I promised the Comstock girls to drop in on their mother 's at-home today . " " You can take the buggy , love , " said Patrick , eyeing more sausages on the silver platter .

It makes me feel so fresh , after this stuffy house and the Inn-Tavern . " " Glad you visit the Comstock girls now , " said the doting Patrick . " You used to look down on them , love . " Patricia glanced at him covertly . She said , " Well , I 'm more tolerant of silly people now . " Thunder followed the lightning , and Patricia stared through the windows , almost visibly praying .  | Daniel watched her closely . " You are n't friends with Molly Nolan , Patty ? " " Oh , dear , no , " said Patricia . " And please do n't call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works for Dada . You do n't cultivate employees . Very injudicious . They do take advantage .

Your father treats him like a son , and he never takes advantage , as you call it . " Patricia 's face changed subtly . She sipped at her coffee . Patrick said , " Oh , and it 's a grand rascal that Lionel is ! " He smiled widely . " A real card , he is . But bright as new steel . The ladies all love him at the Inn-Tavern . " " So they do , " said Daniel , glad of this opportunity . " An Irish Don Juan . Love ' em all , leave ' em all . That 's his style .

If women do n't have any position or money these men can exploit , then they are n't worth a second look . " Patricia 's face closed , as if guarding a secret . But her eyes were stealthy and knowing . " Jase told me that Lionel is in love with Joan Garrity , " said Patrick , succumbing to a seventh sausage . Patricia suddenly exclaimed , " That 's a lie  --  it 's not true ! " Her voice was high and emphatic , and she put her coffeecup down on its saucer with a clatter . Her father regarded her with innocent astonishment . " Lionel would n't even look at that . . . thing ! " Patricia added with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that , love ? I 've never seen you talking to Lionel , and you know very little about that beautiful cripple . Face like an angel . Pity . Burden on poor Jase and his grandfather . " Daniel shrugged . " I still do n't know much about all these younger people . But I , too , have heard that Lionel is infatuated with Joan Garrity . " " Never ! " cried Patricia , outraged .  | " How do you know ? " asked Daniel with an air of indifference . He chose another muffin and regarded it critically and so did not see the glance of hatred his cousin gave him . " It 's just common sense ! " she said . " Lionel 's going to be quite well off when the new hotel is built . Why should he want a beggarly cripple ? It 's an insult to him . " " Hah , " said Patrick , hovering over the basket of muffins . " Jase is going to be rich , too , and so is his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that lovely colleen Joan could melt any man 's wits , with that face of hers . Like an angel 's . I hear she 's very smart , too . She looks like a grand princess in church . People look at her . No holy statue is as perfect . If she had n't been crippled , she 'd have turned the heads of crown princes . " He tapped his flushed forehead . " One thing I know , love , is people . That girl has a mind . I should n't wonder the gossip about her and Lionel is true . " Oh , what stupid , absurd lies ! thought Patricia with profound scorn . She was about to say something with furious anger when she felt an enormous wave of nausea , something she had been suffering lately . Indigestion , of course . It had been that immense dish of spareribs and sauerkraut she had eaten last night . She could never resist it . And the morning eggs and ham and bacon were frequently stale , she was sure . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always did upset her . She must speak to Dada about the kitchen , not only here but also at the InnTavern . He was so careless and too amiable with the help . She would have to speak to the family doctor about her morning nausea and her frequent vomiting . The nausea mounted . She clapped her hand over her mouth and ran from the dining room . Patrick 's round pink face wrinkled with concern . " I do n't think my Patricia is well , " he said . " She 's run a few times after breakfast . Must call Dr. Hanrahan tomorrow . " Oh , my God , thought Daniel with genuine alarm . Did n't that bastard protect her ? Or is that one of his schemes ? I should break his neck , thought Daniel , and maybe I will . What if he 's forced to marry that idiotic wench ? That would break Uncle Pat 's heart . I know him ; he 's set on Jason Garrity as a son-in-law . Good God , what a mess . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafty and inquisitive housemaid  --  a little sinewy girl with a vicious face  --  found Patricia vomiting helplessly in her bath-  | room , kneeling on the tile floor and clutching the seat of the commode , heaving , as Elsie thought , all her guts up . Elsie had seen this before , and had wondered . Miss Patricia was very healthy for all her skinniness , and a big eater . She said with false solicitude , " Miss Patricia ? Something wrong ? " Patricia gulped . She was very white and trembling . She wiped her mouth and looked up at the servant . " Elsie , there 's something wrong with the food ! I think I have ptomaine or something . " She shivered . " I 'm going to the doctor tomorrow to find out . I have a very delicate stomach . " She glared with accusation at Elsie . " Nobody else 's sick , Miss Patricia . Nobody 's been complaining . " " Nobody has a stomach like mine , " said Patricia with a touch of pride . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me help you to bed so you can lie down . " Patricia 's sweat had left her face slimy and cold . She stood up , weaving . Elsie put her hand on Patricia 's shoulder with pretended concern and guided her to the bedroom . Patricia collapsed on the edge of her silk-covered bed , wiped her face with a damp handkerchief , and panted . " Maybe typhoid , " she said with terror . " There have been cases lately , in Belleville . " " Oh , dear , " murmured Elsie . " Here , let me take your shoes off , dearie . You do need the doctor . I 've seen you like this other mornings . " " It 's Mass , " said Patricia , hitting the bed with her clenched fist . " I get so hungry . Nothing to eat from midnight Saturday until after Mass on Sunday . I get so faint . No wonder I throw up after I 've finally eaten . " " Shame , " said Elsie , kneeling and taking off Patricia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God I 'm Protestant . " Patricia leaned back carefully on the lace pillow shams , still gulping . She stared at the ceiling . " I must really be ill , " she said . She paused , and her pale face colored slightly . " Elsie , I . . . I have n't come sick ' for two months . Do you think that 's part of it ? " Elsie 's face became alert . She sat back on her heels and looked closely at Patricia , trying not to smile . But . . . when ? The wretched thing was always guarded by her father . But she was a  | sly one , she was . There were the Sundays on the bicycle . Like all servants with empty lives , Elsie was inordinately curious about her " betters , " and with vindictiveness . She pretended growing concern . Patricia sat up . " Do you think it 's typhoid , Elsie ? " Her terror grew . " Could be . " At eighteen Elsie was an expert dissembler . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did hear . . . only ladies , married ladies , get this sometimes when they are going to have a . . . baby . " Patricia became rigid . Her slender throat tightened with a new convulsion . A baby ! But that was impossible . A woman had to do certain things  --  but what were they ? Surely not just . . . that ! It had to be arranged and decided upon . But she and Lionel had neither arranged nor decided on anything much , and certainly not that . She had mentioned marriage often , and Lionel had sighed and said , " Not just yet , darling , not until I am worthy of you . " Patricia thought about the breakfast conversation , and her whole spirit writhed in violent denial . Lionel loved her , but she felt despair and a gigantic fright through all her body . She whispered , " What if you do n't want the . . . baby , Elsie ? " Elsie grinned . " Oh , Miss Patricia ! I should n't be talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ; she 's got all those girls there . " " What does she know , Elsie ? " " Well , there are doctors with knives . . . They take the baby away . " Patricia shuddered and was freshly nauseated . Her head whirled ; she had to clutch the side of the bed to keep from falling off . Everything rocked and swayed . She felt she was in a nightmare , grotesque , ominous . But it could n't be ! She and Lionel had done nothing to make a baby ! " But how do you get a baby in the first place , Elsie ? " Elsie stood up , trying not to burst into laughter . She lifted her skirts and pointed lasciviously and with certain gestures up between her legs . Patricia watched her , turning as white as snow . " No more than that ? " she whispered . Elsie giggled . " It 's enough ! " she said . " But what am I doing talking to a lady like you about such nasty things , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lip with assumed contrition . " You did n't know about it ? " " No . I did n't . " Patricia 's whole body was running with sweat . " Are you sure . . . that 's all , Elsie ? " " Yes , indeedy . A girl 's got to be very careful , Miss Patricia . Men ai n't no good , ever . Get a girl into trouble all the time . Sometimes they marry the girl , but not often . Just run off and let the whole town make fun of her , pointing . And sometimes she goes away and has the kid . . . or gets rid of it . " " But that 's murder , " said Patricia . Elsie shrugged . " Better than having the kid , anyways . But you got to be careful . You can die under the knives . Blood poisoning . That is , if you can get a doctor to do it . He charges a lot of money and could go to prison if he 's found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a shame . Men ! " But not Lionel , not her beloved Lionel . All at once Patricia experienced a spasm of overwhelming joy . She would tell Lionel today . And they would be married . Her eyes began to sparkle with brown lights . She smiled feebly . She looked through the window . There was pale yellow sunlight peeping through the eddying clouds . Lionel . But how should she tell him ? She turned crimson with shame . She and Lionel had never discussed what had happened during their rendezvous in the glade . It was too precious , too exciting , too ecstatic . It was . . . sacred . Lionel would marry her . She almost laughed in a sudden huge delight . She would whisper to him . . . Her color deepened . He would be so happy . They would tell no one , no one , until they were married . Of course Dada would go out of his mind . But he loved his daughter , and he would be reconciled . But he must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it , anyway . " Are you sure , Elsie ? " she asked , with a great hope that it was true . " Sure . " She watched Patricia sit up and run the bag of rice powder over her flushed face . She watched as Patricia smoothed down her navy-blue skirt with the rows of black silk braid just over the instep . What was the crazy thing thinking now ? The rich ought to be shot . They had everything . The poor had nothing . It was n't fair . Elsie wished she could tell the other servants . But she would lose her job , and jobs were hard to find .  | Patricia went downstairs and found her father dozing over his newspaper in the library , which was filled with books no one ever read . " Dada , " she said , and he started awake and beamed at her fondly . " Dada , I do n't think I should go to the Inn-Tavern with you today . " The very thought of food made her retch again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I feel better , I 'll go to see Amy Comstock and her sisters . " " Good , " said Patrick . " Rest . Ladies are very weak , need all the rest they can get . But take the buggy today . There 's a cold wind up . " Yes , Dada , " said Patricia . Later , she wheeled out her bicycle . The day was too threatening for many people to be on the road . The dun-colored sky was darkened rather than lightened by the intermittent thin yellow sun . It was also sharply windy , and the trees moved restlessly from side to side . Patricia 's felt hat veiled her face ; the mackintosh was none too warm even over her dark blue wool suit with the white silk shirtwaist ; the thin black kid gloves could not seem to keep out the chill . She pedaled fast against the wind . She began to plot what she would say to Lionel . It was only when she thought of him that her body warmed . She glanced anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it rain ! " she said aloud . She was glad that when she was married they would no longer have to be out in the open for love , but safe in the rich house her father would build for her . In the meantime she and Lionel would live with her father . She gave little or no thought to the child slumbering in her womb ; she felt no maternal thrill or anticipation . There was only Lionel . Like a colossus he stood astride her soul ; she was possessed by him . As she pedaled eagerly to the rendezvous , he filled her entire universe . " Please do n't let it rain ! " she prayed to some amorphous deity . If it rained , Lionel would not come . The very thought was devastating . She hungered and ached for him with the most powerful desire she had ever known and would ever know . Not for an instant did she believe he would abandon her . He had assured her too often of his deep love . No . Rain or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting for him . He would be as desirous of meeting as she was . She came to the break in the blowing trees and pushed her bicy-  | cle through the brush . Nettles caught at her silken ankles ; she hardly felt them . When she saw Lionel 's bicycle against a tree , she laughed aloud in joy . She stood her own beside his , then ran into the glade . He was there , standing and smoking and looking up at the sky , his hands in his pockets , his hair a ruddy glow in the increasing gloom . To Patricia he seemed like a god , tall , restless , beautiful beyond describing . Her heart clenched with rapture and adoration and she sang , " Lionel ! Lionel ! " He turned . He was frowning . He was thinking : So , the little idiot came on a day like this . I should have known . She has n't any sense at all . He smiled and opened his arms , and she ran into them and nestled her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , murmuring incoherently . He was wary at once . Never before had she greeted him with such a fierce display of emotion . He pushed her face from his shoulder and looked down at her . Her cheeks were flushed under the dark blue veil , her eyes glittering as if with a fever . His alertness increased , and his self-protectiveness closed about him . He said , " What 's the matter , dear ? Did n't you think I 'd come on this kind of day ? " She gulped with sudden jubilation . " Oh , I knew you 'd come . You knew I would be coming ! " She was still clutching him , still breathing as if she had run all the way . He had decided this would be the last time he would meet her . It was too damned dangerous . He had been rehearsing , just before she came , what to say to leave her with her dignity  --  so that she would not be vengeful and ruin him  --  to give her the impression that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plan to use her , though she had caused his wages to be substantially increased . For only yesterday Patrick Mulligan , in a fit of expansiveness , had mentioned positively that he would marry his daughter off to Jason Garrity very soon . It was odd that Lionel , the exigent , had wanted to say , " No , not Jase for your daughter ! Jase is my friend . He deserves better . " He had been both aghast and amused at his impulse ; he had not thought he loved Jason that much . Human entanglements . They could raise hell with a man . He gently removed Patricia 's arms from his neck and looked critically about him . " Do you think we ought to stay ? " he asked , pretending concern for her . " It looks like rain , and you would n't  | want to get lung fever . I should have got word to you not to come ? " " Oh , I do n't care about the rain ! " cried Patricia , her eyes glowing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain  --  it does n't matter so long as I 'm with you , Lionel ! Nothing matters ! " His uneasiness heightened to alarm . He saw she was trembling . His lips felt cold and stiff , and he looked at her with something like ferocity , trying to discover the reason for her sudden wildness , the shaking of her mouth , the fast rise and fall of her breast . That she was exultant and elated frightened him even more . He said with caution , " You act as if you 've got a wonderful secret . What is it , darling ? " He forced himself to smile . She clapped her gloved hands together in joy , and her smile was wide . " I have , I have ! " " Tell me , " he said , and wanted to slap the silly fool . An awful premonition came to him . There had been that one time , just that one accident . Though one time was enough to knock a woman up . " We 're going to be married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , tears of happiness . " Right away ! " He said , and even his knees felt cold with fear , " Right away ? " She wanted to say , " We 're going to have a baby . " But she could not . Her throat worked , but a hot shame came to her , an enormous embarrassment , a trepidation . He would want to know how she knew , and she simply could not explain her new knowledge . It would be shameful , unladylike , obscene . Good girls never talked of things like that to a man , even a man one was going to marry . She had heard some whispers in her aunt 's house to the fact that young Mrs. So-and-So was " enciente , " but even women alone together did not speak openly of such things . She was appalled at the thought of telling Lionel , like a disgusting shopgirl . Her face turned red , and seeing that , Lionel was aghast . He thought of Patrick Mulligan . He was ruined , ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature . He wanted to kill her ! He lusted to take her by the throat and strangle her , and leave her here alone in the glade for animals to find . But he would not give up his last hope . He said , and his voice was hoarse , " You have n't told anyone of this . . . have you ? " " No , no . Not yet . Not until after we are married . " He breathed a little easier and studied her with an intensity filled with hatred and disgust . But he forced himself to take her  | face in his hands . She turned her head suddenly and kissed one of his palms . He shuddered . He wanted only to leave her , to forget that she ever lived and that he had been fool enough to get embroiled with her . He forced himself to speak tenderly . " Your father would never permit it , Patsy . You know that . He wants you to marry Jason Garrity . " " Oh , I know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never do that . I love only you , Lionel , and he is only a clodhopper . He 's got Dada mesmerized , the crafty thing ! Lionel , we 'll go away somewhere , tomorrow perhaps , to a little town  --  how about Spring Valley ? and we 'll find a minister to marry us at once , and then when it 's done we 'll come back and tell Dada , and he 'll forget all about Jason and be so pleased for us . After all , he 's so fond of you already ; you know that 's true . " " A minister ? " said Lionel incredulously . " Why , we 're Catholic , Patsy . We ca n't do that . And you know how priests are . They want to know everything , and ask lots of questions , and they 'd want to talk to your father first . " " Oh , I . . . I 've thought about that , too . We could say I 'm an orphan . But what 's wrong with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were married we could always be remarried before a priest . " She was jumping with excitement . " Lionel , do n't you see ? It 's so easy . And then , when all the hubbub is over Dada will build us a beautiful house and we 'll be so happy together ! " She was again seized with ecstasy and took his arm and shook him almost fiercely . " Do n't you see ? " Yes , I sure as hell see it , thought Lionel with fresh hatred . He said , " I ca n't do that to your father , Patsy . " Again the extreme impatience took her . " Why not ? He 'll be happy for me , knowing how much I love you . " " You have n't told him that , for God 's sake ? " " Of course not ! " The tight muscles of his chest relaxed and he could breathe without that iron band across it . He said , " Let 's be reasonable , Patsy . Let 's . . . wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be built , and I 'll have enough money , and a strong position , and in the meantime I 'll get around your father and make him under-stand ? "  | " We ca n't wait ! " Patricia almost sobbed in her agitation and fear . " Why not ? " Once more he was terrified . The red swept over her face again . She almost told him . But she controlled herself . " I . . . do n't want to wait , Lionel . I love you too much . I 'm twenty years old . I want to have our life begin now ! Now ! In a beautiful new house of our own , the one Dada will build for us . " " Patsy , " he pleaded . " Let 's be sensible . When I 'm soundly established , your father wo n't be so against it . It wo n't be more than a year , I hope . " Patricia paused . Oh , if it were n't for that . . . condition , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a little waiting , and in the meantime they would meet like this , every other Sunday , in a sheltered spot somewhere . But that baby , that horrible baby ! It threatened to come between her and Lionel , and she tensed with her hate of it , her tremendous repudiation of it , her denial of its existence , and she felt a longing for it to die . A tempest of thought roared into her mind . Elsie had mentioned Mrs. Lindon and had hinted that Mrs. Lindon would probably know a doctor . Patricia no longer thought of " murder . " She wanted only to rid her body of this vile intrusion into her happiness , and again she knew hatred for the thing in her womb . A memory like lightning slashed into her tumbling mind , a remembrance of words , she had repeated hundreds of times without any consideration of their meaning : " . . . and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . .. " It had never occurred to her what a womb was in all reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something in her body which would later contain an infant , still later to be born . But the process had been lost on her . Besides , she had believed that Plans were made for such an occurrence , special measures , until Elsie had enlightened her that morning . Knives . Blood . Blood poisoning . Death . And for what ? She was struck by a maddened , frenzy of despair . She was beginning to remember whispers of " bad girls , " of " girls sent away . " Servants . She had been curious , but no one had explained , and the subject had been changed abruptly . She herself was not a " bad girl . " Her thoughts became incoherent , jumbling around in her mind like leaping , insane balls . She twisted her gloved hands together , staring up at Lionel with a face stark and white .  | He took a step back from her . Yes , it was possible . She looked mad . But why did n't she say something , if it were true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reticent about voicing their fears . Mrs. Lindon , thought Patricia in her frantic groping for a solution . But Mrs. Lindon was Dada 's friend , an investor in the new hotel . Mrs. Lindon would n't help her . At the thought of Clementine , Patricia cringed . Mrs. Lindon would tell Dada . Dada would then know . . . Patricia almost screamed in her terror . Dada would kill Lionel . Or he would throw poor Lionel out , to walk the streets . It would be all her fault , not his . No , it was the baby 's fault , for daring to be conceived , for entering into her bright magic world of love and hope . Lionel was watching her with a fiery acuteness . " You see how it is , Patsy , " he said , and his voice was actually trembling . She whimpered , " Let 's get married , Lionel . Dada will come around . I know he will . We 'll ? " " Patsy . I 'm a poor man just now , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got over my father 's death , is an invalid in her bed . It takes nearly all the money I earn , and nearly all Molly earns , to have someone take care of Mum so we can work . We live in a three-room cottage , Patsy . You 've never seen poverty . A shack . Ice-cold in winter , a furnace in the summer . I have n't any money , Patsy . Where would we live if we were married now ? In that shack that leaks when it rains ? You 'd have to sleep with me on a cot in the kitchen . You 'd have to help the woman who takes care of my mother , washing her clothes , feeding her . . . You 'd be a drudge , Patsy , as poor as death . You do n't know what poverty is ! " His hatred grew as he contemplated the past years of his lean and deprived life . That stark , still face stared up at him , slowly comprehending . " I know your father better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forgive us . He would n't give you a cent . Within a few months you 'd be ragged , your hands sore , your shoes broken . He would n't let you take a coat from his house . And , Patsy , he 'd throw me out . Where would I go ? Who would give me a job ? We 're in the midst of a Panic . There 's no work to be had . We 'd be in the breadlines , at the door of the soup kitchen . Think ! Think just for a minute , for God 's sake ! " His own terror was mounting , and he was sweating with his ur-  | gency . He took Patricia by her stiff shoulders and shook her . " You must understand ! " That . . . thing would destroy my Lionel , thought Patricia . Dada would ruin Lionel 's life . It was a measure of her love for Lionel that she did not think of herself just then . But she felt a consuming flame of savage hatred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would see Lionel and herself homeless , starving . She believed Lionel implicitly . Men knew more about men than women did . There had been times when she herself had had to confront her father on some trivial thing he opposed , and he had been like a stone wall , inexorable in his refusal . How could she have forgotten ? In a last pathetic convulsion of despair , as she saw her whole life going down into a black chasm , she whispered , " I would n't care where I lived if I was with you , Lionel . . . . " He stood straight and stiff and assumed a noble expression . " But I would care , Patsy . How could I drag you down to such poverty and degradation ? I ca n't do that to you , dearest , I ca n't , not even if it kills me to lose you ! I 'd sacrifice everything , everything I 've hoped for , for you . But I have n't anything in that hotel myself except the offer of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrity is putting into it . I have nothing . What have Ito offer you ? Nothing but my bare hands . Patsy , I ca n't do that to you . I would hate myself for all the rest of my life . Do n't tempt me any longer , Patsy , my dearest . Do n't weaken me . Or I 'll be guilty of everything you 'll suffer . " There were tears of fear in his eyes , and she believed they were for her . " Patsy , send me away , now , at once , for your sake . For your dear sake . " No , she thought in her desolate heart . Not for my sake , my darling . For yours . But the baby remained , and her father would send her away , possibly never to return . The shame . Or . . . the knives , and possible death . What had Elsie said ? There was prison for such girls as herself , if they survived . Prison . There was no escape for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die herself rather than to do that . Suddenly she thought of Jason Garrity . She shivered with horror and revulsion . Dada would be out of his mind with joy if she  | married him . And Lionel would be safe , safe from hunger and vagabondage . Lionel would be safe . Patricia closed her eyes , and her face was white and still . There was a menacing rumble of thunder , but she did not hear it . She looked tragic , and for the first time in her life she had assumed a pathetic dignity , the dignity of sacrifice . Lionel was not moved . He felt only the exhilaration of victory . There was a deathly luminousness on the girl 's features , and Lionel stepped back from her , dimly intimidated . Then she opened her eyes , and a less implacable man than Lionel would have felt compassion and shame . But he felt nothing but his own triumph , his own release . He was convinced that he had induced her to think of herself , and poverty . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patsy . .. " " No , Lionel . For yours . " She held out her hand to him , and he , after a moment 's hesitation , took it . Even through the glove her fingers were icy . She said in a voice suddenly mature and strong , " Kiss me just once , Lionel , before we say good-bye . " Again he hesitated . Then he bent his head and kissed her chastely on her cheek . In a moment she sought his mouth , and now tears were gushing down her cheeks . But he was too clever to let her succeed in seducing him . He dropped her hand . " Good-bye . . . my darling , " he said , and let his voice shake with assumed anguish . " Good-bye . " He turned , and rushed noisily through the shrubbery . He let her hear a terrible moan . Then he got on his bicycle and pedaled away as fast as he could . Patricia stood alone in the glade . Rain fell heavily , but she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair . Water penetrated even through the mackintosh , drenching her clothes . She began to tremble with cold . She went home , surrounded by storm and blue lightning and rain , and never remembered it . She never remembered that while on the way home she kept repeating aloud , as if in prayer , " For you , my darling , only for you . My Lionel . My heart . Lionel , Lionel . . . "  | Bernard Garrity sat with his friend and employer , Saul Weitzman , on a bench in the warm sun of a late-April Sunday , in what was called , by the people of Belleville , " The New Park , " but had been named by the town fathers " Mountain View . " It was not entirely a grandiloquent label , for the view of the mountains beyond was resplendent in the sunlight , but the park itself was very small and triangular and was surrounded by an iron fence whose gates were severely closed at sundown and never open at all in the winter . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one in Belleville  --  and an expensive one . Property taxes had had to be raised to level ground in what was once a rocky slum covered with weeds , to demolish the derelict buildings , and to plant trees and flowerbeds and shrubs , and to erect an iron statue of William Penn in the center of it all . But Belleville , it was argued by the harassed mayor , " deserved a park , " like other communities and towns , and besides , what would the grand guests at Ipswich House think of a town that could boast of no such green oasis . Besides , the mayor had added , the hotel would bring prosperity to Belleville . Belleville had only to " clean up , paint up , " and shops would open and the value of property would rise , and things would be rich indeed for all and sundry . The mayor did not quite believe this himself , but his prophecy came true in a fine manner that even the carpers could not denigrate . So Belleville had its park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many new houses were built , and new people moved into them to enjoy the prosperity also , and some elegant little shops appeared  --  elegant to the inhabitants of the town at  | least  --  and there was even a medium-sized new factory producing " crafts of the region " and other mendacities , and it did an excellent business among the " summer people , " who declared the products " quaint . " There was also a very popular restaurant called the Amish House , where one could dine on shoofly pie , " country " ham , scrapple , and " distinct delicacies " invented by " our Amish neighbors . " The fact that the nearest Amish settlement was some forty miles away was not known by the summer people , who relished " the lavish food of the region . " They also loved Patrick Mulligan 's " old-country " Inn-Tavern , and the gentlemen loved the young relatives of Mrs. Lindon , and Mrs. Lindon loved the generous patrons of her establishment . The inspired mayor did not agree to having all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be kept bricked and cobblestoned , so the lady summer visitors could gush over the " unspoiled " charm . Almost no houses now had backyard privies , except a few on the outskirts , and these , at the mayor 's urging , were wreathed in vines during the summer , and kept whitewashed and comparatively odor-free . Belleville began to respect itself . Bernard once said , " They should have put up an iron statue to old Johnny Myers instead of Bill Penn . " He was referring to the mayor , of course , who would have agreed with him , though the mayor had just been elected a state senator by a grateful people , whom he promptly forgot . Guests came to Ipswich House as early as mid-April from as far away as Philadelphia , Scranton , Wilkes-Barre , and , to the awe of the inhabitants of the town , even from New York and New Jersey . On a clear day , it was boasted , one could stand in the gardens of the hotel and see three states , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spur that reached almost to the foot of the mountain , to provide easy access to the hotel for the summer people , and the hotel met the guests at the pretty little depot with a string of glittering carriages and two large automobiles . A bicycle trail had been added to the road , meandering down through an avenue of tidy trees and pruned flowering bushes . A brook had been discovered , smothered in earth and wild growth , and it had been enlarged and cleared and now tumbled down in a very pleasing fashion to the river , over artful little dams . " Weirs , " Bernard called them . In short , in just slightly over five years , Belleville had been  | quite " transformed , " to quote the more ecstatic inhabitants . It was all due , of course , to Patrick Mulligan , on whom affection was bestowed on all occasions . There was talk about electing him mayor , but the more restrained inhabitants of Belleville objected . " An Irish mayor ? Heaven forbid ! " That silenced the enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying this unusually mild April sunlight , " warming our old bones , " as Saul said . " Who 's old ? " grunted Bernard . " Speak for yourself , Saul , and you six years younger . " " You 'll never grow old , " said Saul with admiration , his voice carrying the thick accents of his native Germany . " Quite right , " said Bernard . " The Irish do n't believe in it . " Saul chuckled , shifting his fat buttocks on the slats of the bench . The blue smoke from his treasured meerschaum pipe rose contentedly in the shining air . Bernard smoked a cigar , a very large one . It had cost ten cents , which he considered outrageous . " The Jews do n't believe in it , either , " said Saul . " Too busy running all the time from pogroms . Got to have young legs . " New , tentative leaves , a soft yellow-green , threw dancing shadows on the two old men below . The winding paths through the park were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; flowerbeds , showing rows of buoyant tulips , mostly red , bordered the walks . Later there would be other flowers in season , lovingly cared for and very neat . No child dared to stamp on those beds or pick any blossoms . Activity among children was severely kept in check by parents proud of the park if not of their offspring . No picnics were allowed , and a shower of chewing-gum wrappers brought swift punishment to the offender . " Keep Off the Grass " signs were meticulously obeyed . Dogs were outlawed in the park . Even the birds looked disciplined as they flashed through the sun and to the refuge of their new nests . Bernard was eighty-four now , a vigorous and lively eighty-four . Always spare , his body was still hard muscle , quick and springy when he walked or trotted , a quick marching step he had learned in the British army . It was nearly as fast as it had been in his youth . But his flesh now resembled the driftwood washed up on the stony shores of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His gray eyes were still vital , even if nested in deep wrinkles , and his large nose was as arrogant and defiant as ever . The plow of years might have cleft his sunken cheeks , but the mouth between them  | was stem and forbidding and the teeth within were strong and clean as always . His totally white hair had diminished , but the crestlike way it rose over his forehead was still like the crest on a Roman helmet . His chin had retained its pugnacity . He had not lost his formidable look . The years had not gentled him . Rather , they had increased his native ferocity . He was one who would never mellow into tolerance for sloth , lies , cruelty , weakness , or general ineptitude . The world was " a bastard of a place , " he would say , " and I do n't know why the good Lord has n't smashed it by now . " His mind was like a knife , sharp and brilliantly honed . He did not need glasses to read . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar . He raised his eyes to the distant view . " Age , " he remarked , " is a matter of opinion . I 've seen buckos in their fifties and sixties whining about the long years they have lived . They are tired , ' they say . Tired of what ? Living , perhaps . But then , I 'm thinking , they never really lived . " " Work , " said Saul , " keeps a man young . " " Depends , " said Bernard , who hated platitudes . " I 've seen work kill , that I have . It 's how a man looks at things . Does he want to endure , or does he not ? Simple as that , then . " He studied the far scene with little visible pleasure . But few things had ever pleased Bernard , and Saul suspected that this was the source of Bernard 's vitality . He would never be complacent or sentimental . Saul considered him fondly , as one would a brother . In contrast with the tall gaunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely trim and turned and comfortable , rosy as a peony in full bloom . His three round chins were excellently barbered , as was his thick white hair , and he had a rigorously trimmed white mustache which did not hide his kind smiling mouth . He might be poor , but his blue serge suit was pressed  --  by himself  --  at least twice a week , and his striped shirt daily knew an iron , and his stiff white collar and cuffs  --  celluloid  --  never had a stain upon them . Though it was only April , he wore a shining white straw hat with a gay red band around the crown , and it looked jaunty and pleasingly defiant . He had sweet round brown eyes that seemed to be perpetually smiling . He was a childless widower of many years and hardly remembered his Anna , who had had a stringent tongue and had stood at least a foot taller than himself . She had also kept kosher . Saul had long forgiven her that ,  | but he had never forgotten . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Passover . However , in her memory , he ate matzohs and prepared gefilte fish for himself , both of which he deplored but which Bernard found tasty and enjoyable . " When in Rome , " he would say to Bernard , " do as the Romans do ; that 's what I read . I 'm American now . " " And Americans cook as bad as the English , I 'm thinking , " said Bernard as he would spear another piece of fish . He shook his fork admonishingly at Saul . " Niver forget the ould ways . D' you want the world all one color , one culture ? The good Lord never intended that , then . He wanted variety , and that he did . Think of flowers of only one color , say , purple , which I hate . Who would want a garden , if so ? " Saul 's cheery face would grow momentarily sad . " It would be safer , " he said . Bernard had snorted . " And what 's a world without danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why I niver could stomach the talk of heaven and pearly gates and streets of gold . Who would want it ? Give me battle , every time . " And he thought of his youth and his fists and his sturdy kicking boot , and he smiled nostalgically . He would then talk of Ireland and the " cursed Sassenagh " and would embellish his bloody stories , relishing the many confrontations , which he usually had won . His slategray eyes would become like glittering stones on which lightning had suddenly struck . The two old gentlemen , on this warm April day , sat in peaceful silence together , Saul listening to the birds , Bernard looking up at the mountain , where , on its plateau , stood the completed hotel , Ipswich House . It was a sight , Bernard admitted to himself dourly , to please the most contentious eye , though he would never confess that to anyone . The architect had agreed to pale yellow brick and stucco and a red-tiled roof and bronze doors , and there the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres , half-hidden by clusters of timber oaks and firs and maples and linden trees , with here and there a royal elm . The immense lawns were greening , as they sloped and stretched with the curve of the mountain meadow . Flowerbeds , even this early , gleamed with the satiny heads of narcissus and tulips of many colors . The hotel was open all win-  | ter , too , for the new fad of skiing , and sledding and skating , and was particularly gay at the Christmas holidays , " with guests from a dozen states , " the brochure stated proudly , exaggerating only slightly . With fires blazing in almost every room  --  though there were adequate coal furnaces  --  and holiday greens at every window and enormous Christmas trees in the public rooms dancing with tinsel and glass balls and toy reindeer and Santa Clauses , and ballroom music every night and liquors and wines donated by the management , it was a joyous and resplendent time at the resort . Only during the holidays were children permitted in any number , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children sabotaged any attempts at adult enjoyment . In short , Ipswich House was a haven for those males who were in flight from exigent wives and untidy offspring , and who were usually accompanied by lovely young ladies who answered to the name of " Mrs. , " though everyone knew they were not married to their escorts . Younger males , however , still filled with illusions , arrived with their legal spouses , to return every year for several years , until they , too , discreetly brought with them more amiable ladies with dash and spirit and much happy laughter . There had not been an empty room in summer after the first year , and guests made reservations long in advance , and returned season after season . Though it was only five years old , guests referred to it as " an institution . " The rooms were furnished as shown in the English model , all very expensive and all over the objections of the prudent Patrick Mulligan . But Jason had stubbornly insisted , and when Patrick was congratulated on the splendor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand wave of his hand , " No money spared . Elegance for elegant people . " He finally included that phrase in the brochure Lionel had prepared , which was illustrated by photographs . The rates were staggering , but few complained . Sometimes , though not very often , Patrick forgot that this was all the doing of Jason Garrity , whom he loved more than he did his daughter and grandchildren . When his nephew Daniel reminded him of this fact , Patrick would say with irritation , " Do n't I know it , then ? Am I a fool ? Ah , that 's a grand bucko , my Jason . " He would pat his growing belly , now of a formidable size , and look loving and thoughtful . They had come a long way , all of them , he would think when  | alone in his enormous black-walnut bedroom in his own house , which was also occupied by his daughter and Jason and their three children , Sebastian , the eldest , and the twins , Nicholas and Nicole . Patricia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names for her children , much against Jason 's will . But Jason invariably pampered and indulged her , much to Bernard 's disgust and disbelief . They were all in debt , of course , to the two local banks and a large one in Philadelphia , but Patrick had been able to pay off the mortgage he had taken on the Inn-Tavern during the early days of financing . Mrs. Lindon had been of tremendous advantage here , and was , in her way , a partner in the profits . She had persuaded the two bankers in Belleville , her devoted friends , to sell her the extra acres needed  --  for cash  --  and had almost completely managed the financing of Ipswich House with the assistance of Daniel Dugan , who was now business administrator of the " corporation . " Bernard was not certain of all the " finagling , " as he mistrustfully called it , for he hated debt of all kinds , and " obligations , " especially to bankers , and lawyers , whom he loathed above all other men . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment , the Federal Reserve System , which would become active in 1913 ? Had n't they stolen the right of Congress to coin money , as asserted in the Constitution ? Bernard never failed , at any opportunity , to denounce " those international robbers . " He was also aware that the " damned stupid people " had voted for the Sixteenth Amendment , a federal income tax , many times declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court . They had voted for this because of the lying promises of politicians . " They 'll know , every man jack of them , " Bernard would say , " when they , as Thomas Jefferson predicted , would eventually be taxed in their comings and their goings , with their food and their drink , their property and their shelters , and the fruits of their labor taken from them . " Mr. Elmer Schultz , of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia , had been induced by the knowledgeable Mrs. Lindor and her banker friends to become part of the corporation and invest money , and had brought in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason 's wishes and his grandfather 's picture book detailing the English establishment . They had deplored the expense , but Jason , quoting Bernard , said , " In for a penny , in for a  | pound , " which Mr. Schultz had considered , and then had reluctantly agreed to . Jason was now manager of Ipswich House at a large salary , and in view of the fact that he had contributed his vital fourteen acres , was given fifteen percent of the net proceeds , which were growing year after year . Lionel , in charge of the dining rooms and the purchasing of foods and wine and liquors , and the supervision of the kitchens , and all those employed in the work of purveyance , also received a large salary  --  not as large as Jason 's , for Jason was the final authority in all things at Ipswich House , except for Patrick Mulligan , who rarely interfered . He had his own hands full with the management of the Inn-Tavern , which also was flourishing . Lionel was given , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an annual bonus because of his priceless genius in stimulating business . He wrote the flamboyant brochures . He also kept the workers under his rule honest , to a great extent , and that was no light struggle . All concerned were ebullient and optimistic , sometimes even Jason , who had become unnaturally cautious and morose . Bernard knew nothing of the intricacies of mortgages and financing and bonuses and profits and expansion , and so was less than enthusiastic when Jason would attempt to enlighten him . He would wave his hand dismissingly and say , " When a man 's in partnership with bankers , he 's mortgaged himself to the Devil , and that he has . Niver was a banker a friend of man , except if that man had a lot of money and did n't need a bank . " His mistrust had become greater the last year or so , when Jason had announced that the corporaton had bought one thousand acres of land forty miles away , also in the Poconos , for " a family hotel , for all seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ipswich House . The foundation had already been dug and contractors engaged . " Mark my words , " Bernard had said with gloomy alarm , " you 'll all end up in debtors ' prison . And do n't tell me there are no debtors ' prisons in America ! You 'll have them soon , with this new federal-income-tax business . " " Oh , Da , " Jason would reply . " You 're too pessimistic . Were n't we all promised that the new federal-income-tax amendment would apply only to the very rich , and then only two or three percent ? The government does n't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg . "  | " They always do ! " shouted Bernard . " And why , tell me that , boyo ! Because to tax is to ruin . Lord Acton said that himself , and even if he is a Sassenagh , he spoke truly . The power to tax is the power to destroy . ' Read your history , damn you . What are you doing with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless he knows what he 's voting for and knows what is good for his country . " " A new Jeremiah is heard in the land , " Jason said , but not without some uneasiness . " About time , " grunted Bernard . " But too late , I 'm thinking . " " The Irish never trusted governments , " said Jason . " With damned good reason ! " Beside Bernard , Saul was half-dozing in the unseasonably warm April sun . Saul had comforting silences , and Bernard reflected that he himself needed comforting . Once , a man of his years had peace . Now there was no peace anywhere . Like an Irish farmer who could smell snow long before it arrived , Bernard smelled trouble in the world , putrid trouble . Were n't the newspapers now denouncing the German kaiser because he was building up his armed forces ? " That German feller , " Bernard would confide to Saul , " knows something we do n't . But you can wager he probably has reason for his suspicions . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rest of us are always in and out of Panics . " Bernard had taken to reading Das Kapital , by Karl Marx , but no one would listen to his views on Communism but Saul Weitzman , who would nod soberly . " It 's an old tyranny , " Bernard would say . " It crops up , eventually , in every country , and that 's the end of the poor sods . Goes back to Egypt and Babylonia . I 'll give you another book . Eugene Debs , American socialist . In prison for conspiracy to kill . They do love their killings , these humanitarians . Killing 's their ultimate way of proving they love mankind . " And Bernard would laugh bitterly . " I 'm glad I 'm not a day younger . It 's Jason and his children I think about , and what they 're going to face . I 'll be thankfully dead . " Three youths wandered by , giggling among themselves as they told each other salacious stories . They kicked up the gravel and guffawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe and Mike and Matthew  --  the oldest sixteen and a worker in one of the mills , Mike , fifteen , on his first job in a new small factory , and  | Matt , the youngest , a hellion of about twelve . Their dada , thought Bernard , was a good and prosperous man , with a hardware store and a blacksmith shop which also catered to those who owned automobiles , and a sound little body of a wife who beamed happily at everyone . How did two such get sons like these , always in mischief . Dennis , their father , had wanted the two oldest to finish high school , but they were too dull of wit to continue , and the youngest , who was the most intelligent , was always playing truant . They had all been firmly disciplined by their father , who had been born in Ireland , and though they feared and obeyed him most of the time , they also hated him for his sternness . They despised their mother , who adored them , and exploited her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dead daughter-inlaw , Katie . Bad blood somewheres , Bernard would think , when he encountered them . They were afraid of Bernard , to some extent , and the cane he carried with him . They wandered off , but a moment or two later young Matt crept up behind Saul and smashed down his gay straw hat over his ears . " Kosher kike ! " the boy yelled , and at a distance , his brothers laughed like jackasses . Bernard sprang to his feet , clutching his cane , but the boys ran off like hares . " Never mind , " said Saul , ruefully examining his ruined hat . " Only boys . They mean no harm . " Bernard shouted , " They do n't , eh ? And it 's wrong you are . They mean only harm . They 're always in trouble , in spite of their dada 's leather belt , and it 's sorry I am for Dennis and his lady . " He sat down , breathing heavily , his grayish face mottled with dangerous color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , myself . Could do a better job than their dada , whose arm is always being held back by Kathleen . Wimin ! They should river have the rearing of men-children , niver . My mum niver dared raise her voice to my faether , or interfere . And many 's the time he laid us boys out , though he left the colleens to Mum . " He took Saul 's hat from him , and cursed . Saul was a poor man ; he paid Bernard eight dollars a week for six days in his shop , and could not understand why Bernard remained in the old shanty when his son , Jason , was only too anxious  --  as was Patrick Mulligan  --  to have the old man live in the ugly luxurious house where Patrick still lived with his daughter and Jason and their children ? despite Patricia 's endless tears and nagging for a new home .  | " In the old country , the generations live together , and everybody is happy , " Saul would urge . " I doubt it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , and I like living alone . Niver was one for stumbling over a family . " He said , now , " It 's your birthday coming , Saul . I 'll buy you another hat . With a green ribbon , " and he chuckled sourly , and weighed his heavy cane in his hand with some wistfulness . There was a coolness these years between him and Jason . Bernard never explained why . But he would think : And it 's a grandson of mine who got his wife in the family way for two months before he married her ! I thought better of Jason . Not a sneaking rascal  --  I thought . Not one to take advantage of a poor trusting girl ? I thought . Then suddenly running off with her to a justice of the peace in Riverton one fine day , unbeknownst to poor Pat , and not a priest until two weeks later to sanctify the marriage , and not the lovely wedding for his girl that Pat had dreamed of since she was born . Thought better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Sebastian was a seventh-month baby , and everyone believing it but me . You do n't have a fine boy like Sebastian being born weighing over seven pounds , if he 's a seventh-month baby . But fools believe what they want to believe , and Pat 's a power in Belleville and brought prosperity here . Wonder if he 's fooled himself . Probably . But only too glad to have Jason as his son-in-law , no matter how it came about . Father Sweeney had remarried the two renegades  --  as Bernard called them  --  and Father Sweeney had baptized the children , and never said a word . Discreet , thought Bernard , and did not know whether to be grateful or not . But the priest had been vehement enough when he had persuaded his lordship the bishop not to inflict John Garrity on him as an assistant , after John had been ordained . There was a meek little German lad now as Father Sweeney 's assistant . The parish had grown over these years . John was assistant pastor to an old arthritic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the old priest " had taken to the bottle , poor soul , for his pains , " and John was very vigilant and active and seemed everywhere at once , no one complained . Jason could not understand the coolness between him and his grandfather . As he was reticent by nature , he had not asked . Jason believed his older son to be his own , and that Sebastian was in-  | deed a seventh-month child . He had been told so by two physicians , very prudent men who knew the truth but who were afraid of Patrick Mulligan . They too surmised that Jason had got Patricia into " a delicate condition " at least two months prior to the marriage . Patrick , the innocent , also believed in the fable of the premature baby . He would never have believed that his sheltered darling had been immoral and had bared herself , before marriage , to any man . Only three knew the truth : Daniel Dugan , now married to Molly Nolan , and Lionel and Joan Garrity . Lionel had married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adored her almost abjectly ; he trusted her absolutely , and she trusted him . A cynic by nature , Joan had accepted with celestial equanimity Lionel 's confession that he most probably was Sebastian 's father . " Well , it 's over and done with , " she had said , " and the girl is a fool and always was , and because Sebastian is your own , my darling , I love him also . " This was no lie . Unable to bear children herself , she did indeed love the child , as his mother did not . He was Lionel 's . Joan did not pity her deceived brother . She had never considered him of much consequence , anyway , and had even despised him . She was totally convinced that without Lionel he would be nothing , and she resented her brother as a result , and her hatred grew with the years . Daniel had not told Molly of his knowledge . Molly had a sharp tongue , and under all that adorable independence and intrepid demeanor was a soul easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the truth , and would never have understood that some things are better hidden . Once Molly had said , innocently , " He 's very big , the baby , for being premature , is n't he , Dan ? " And Daniel , looking gravely thoughtful , had replied , " But Jason is a big man , my love , and Patty is no midget . And Jason 's grandfather is a giant , too . " Molly was glad that her brother , Lionel , and his wife , Joan , had no children . " There 's enough wickedness in this world , Dan , and those two are genuinely wicked , without adding to their number . " Daniel agreed . Molly was still childless after three years , and this saddened them both . Bernard , sitting with Saul on the sun-warmed bench in the park , was thinking of his great-grandchildren , Sebastian , four , whom he loved devotedly , and the twins , Nicholas and Nicole . Idiotic  | names ! Bernard knew that Patricia did not even try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slighted him , and complained of him always . There were times when one saw real hate in her eyes as she looked at the little boy . Yet , he was gravely handsome , tall for his age , and always courteous and obedient and unfailingly kind . To Bernard he had " a lovely face , " for it was square and serious , with good bones , large agate-colored eyes like his mother 's , a short sharply defined nose , a faintly smiling mouth which did not detract from his usual gravity , and thick curling brown hair with a hint of deep red in the clustering waves . A true Garrity , Bernard would think . The boy was already being tutored at home , and he had intellect as well as intelligence . He kept his childish thoughts to himself , but Bernard suspected that they were not childish at all , and in this he was right . The three-year-old twins were another matter . Nicholas was , as Bernard described it , " disjointed . " He was small even for three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crudely carved marionette held by uncertain but vibrating strings . He ran and moved very fast and was always falling , for despite his smallness and his compact frame , he was clumsy . He also wailed , even though not hurt by these mishaps , and then would spring feverishly to his feet and scamper off , his arms and legs not quite coordinated , and thrown out as if he was in flight . He had a rectangular face , sallow and bony , with the large Garrity nose , a tremulous excited mouth , and dark slate-colored eyes protruding as if he were out of breath , which he usually was . He had Patricia 's thin fine hair , perpetually in disarray and always drooping over his forehead and into his eyes . He had large ears which were strangely a bright pink . He gave the impression of incurable dishevelment . He was " harmless , I 'm thinking , " to quote Bernard , " but no brains at all . " When Patricia mentioned that he had a delicate nature and was exquisitely sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Patricia would declare with passionate love , " and always trying to draw pictures . " It was his twin sister , Nicole , who had " the brains . " But to many people she was a most ugly little girl , for she was even shorter than her brother , and at three a veritable fat dumpling of a child , shapeless and all belly , with thick arms and legs and a round fat face . Her skin was coarse , though she was hardly more  | than an infant , with no rosiness of cheek or mouth . But her face was perpetually resolute , her lips extremely firm and controlled , her chin heavy and dimpled . She had the look of a matron , which amused Bernard , for she resembled his grandmother amazingly . Her brown hair was harsh if abundant , and without light . No nonsense about the little colleen , Bernard would say fondly . She had one excellent feature  --  truly beautiful and radiant gray eyes with long dark lashes like stars . Despite her fatness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastian , and always with purpose . No pretty frocks could conceal that stalwart little body with its square shoulders and large belly and broad chest . Frills and bows , on which Patricia insisted , mocked the strength that was so evident , and made her look like a parody of a frivolously bedecked doll . When she walked , one could hear her steady footsteps even on the heaviest carpets . Bernard watched Nicole with affectionate amusement . " A tartar , " he said once , without disapproval . " She 'll make her way , but God help the man she 'll marry . He 'll know who 's in charge , from the start . " Patricia thought her daughter " adorable " and a beauty , and never noticed the ridiculous disparity between the dainty name and Nicole herself . From babyhood Nicole had understood her twin brother . Even at three , she was sorry for him , and protected him and brushed him off when he fell and wiped away his endless tears . All her actions , with him , were maternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother Nick and he called her Nickie . It infuriated Patricia that between Sebastian and Nicole there was a profound sympathy , and that both children had made themselves the guardians of the disorganized Nicholas . When Jason , exhausted from long hours of dealing with mutinous workers , from maids to gardeners and cleaners , to window washers and laundresses , arrived home , he would inevitably be greeted by Patricia 's tinny but emphatic complaints about Sebastian , and how he was inciting the twins to many numerous crimes , especially against her . Jason loved his children , but between him and Sebastian there was an unspoken compatibility , a mature tenderness . He would take Sebastian with him to the library and shut the door , not to administer punishment , as Patricia hoped and believed , but to sit  | in gentle silence with the child on his knee , their hands clasped together warmly , their eyes communicating in wordless comprehension and consolation . Then they would emerge , Sebastian too often to a lonely dinner in the kitchen with an indignant cook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special nursemaid , or even with their parents occasionally . Jason could not understand  --  nor did Bernard  --  the hatred Patricia had for her older son . But always , to Bernard 's exasperation , Jason endured her whims , complaints , and evident dislike of him and was infinitely tender and patient with her . Jason firmly believed that Patricia was of ineffable substance , above other women as a flowering tree is above ordinary grass . Ca n't he see how stupid she is ? Bernard would ask himself . How vulgar , how cunning , how selfish and self-centered , how incapable of tolerance and consideration of others ? But Jason did not see all this , just as he could not know the source of Patricia 's aversion to Sebastian . He had persuaded himself that it was all due to " birth difficulties " and incompatible differences of temperament . He was certain time would solve these things nicely , an attitude astonishingly different from his usual realistic outlook . Besides , he was always so tired now . He would fall into bed overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , with doubts , with conflicts and worries . He and Patricia had separate bedrooms , at her insistence  --  she needed her rest since she was very high-strung . They had not slept together since the birth of the twins . Jason understood that she feared more pregnancies . She was too fragile for this world , he would think . It was odd that he had not as yet recognized how similar he and Sebastian were in nature , just as he was never doubtful of the child 's paternity . Patricia 's pettiness toward Jason , her not hidden resentment , her frequent ridicule of his person , her implied contempt for his intelligence , her cruel accusations that he had no social graces , never truly entered his consciousness . He was always trying to win her admiration . This , too , enraged Bernard , who thought of her as a silly and pretentious fool and a woman of no delicacy . Always thin , she was now emaciated , though she had retained her style and taste . She loathed her father 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently to Jason . That she was desperately unhappy was not apparent to  | Jason , nor did he ever know of her tears and yearnings when alone in her bed . Bernard , in moments of rare empathy , suspected that something " ailed " her , but he could not guess what . It was unnatural for a woman who had so much to be so miserable . Bernard was thinking of all this now , and he sighed . Saul said , " We go back to the shop and have a little lunch , eh ? Made some gefilte fish , for Passover , next week . You like it , eh ? And some matzohs , and chicken soup . Not kosher . " He chuckled . " Good , " said Bernard . It was then that the Farrell youths returned , crunching on the gravel as they ran toward the two old men . They stopped at a distance , nudged each other , grinned , then began to chant : " Ido sheeney , Ido sheeney ! " One picked up a stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trembling . " Off with you , damn you ! " Bernard shouted , and half-rose , seizing his cane . " And you at Mass this morning , with your dada and mum ! " " Aw shut up , you old man ! " the elder boy shouted with an obscene curse . " Want a stone down your gullet ? " Bernard stood up . His cheeks turned crimson and the veins in his temples swelled . Saul caught his arm . " They are only children , " he pleaded . Bernard shook off his hand and glared down at him . " They 're devils , " he said . " The kind who murdered old Joe Maggiotti . God damn their souls . " " Bernie . . . " said Saul . The eldest boy turned a face of gleeful malice on him . " Wait till you see what we did to your kosher shop ! " he screamed in delight . " Peed on all your groceries and sausages ! " Saul became white . He said in a choked voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two older youths , grasped them by the necks , and pounded their heads together . They howled and struggled . He held them with hands like iron . He looked at the youngest , Matt , who was suddenly alarmed . " Matt , " said Bernard , " I want to see your dada now , in the shop . With these spalpeens I 'm taking with me . You go for your dada or I 'll . . . I 'll kill your brothers . " He longed for the sight of blood . Saul got heavily to his feet , his kind face twisted . Matt ran off , whimpering . Bernard banged the youths ' heads together again , over and over , until they cried like infants . " Curse you , " he muttered .  | " Damn the law . I 'd like to kill you , but you 're not worth hanging for . " His lips were engorged with purpling blood . He could hardly breathe ; there was a terrible pain in his head . He wanted to press his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youths he now had again by their throats . " March , " he gasped in a hoarse voice . " Down the street . To the shop . Saul , come . " Saul picked up the discarded cane , and weeping , followed the old man and his capfives back to the shop . The door was open . A barrel of pickles had been overturned on the immaculate floor .
