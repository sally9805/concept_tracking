There is room for judicial discretion with the other offender , however . He has just turned 19 , and it ' s his first conviction . But the court-appointed lawyer fails to show up . The judge will have to reschedule , especially since she recognizes the fourth man , standing next to him , Danny Colon . She knows Mr. Colon wants her to risk an alternative sentence for this felon , a risk Colon will share with the court and the people of New York. // With alternative sentencing , the offender must report daily to a counselor at Court Employment Project ( CEP ) . These counselors have a caseload of not more than 15 individuals , and can help their clients complete school , find a job , get off drugs , learn to like themselves , whatever it takes to keep them from another crime. // // Colon ' s presence in court could pluck this young tough out of the corrections line and place him in a program that has a better than 70 percent chance of keeping him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time behind bars , there is a better than 80 percent chance he will break the law again , and another judge will put this same young man away for a longer time. // ' ' We are a program of last resort , we go for the hard cases , ' ' says Jo Ann Page , director of court programs for CEP . ' ' If there is any other way to keep an individual from being locked up , we ' ll let someone else take care of it , ' ' she says. // What is Ms. Page ' s profile of a hard case ? A youthful offender whose crime was serious enough so that the court does not even set bail . Without CEP , such high-risk offenders would probably simply go to prison. // A nonprofit organization , CEP has a contract with the New York City criminal-justice system to provide a sentencing alternative for jailbound defendants as well as alternative bail for defendants who would otherwise remain in long-term detention. // At a time when prison overcrowding and soaring corrections costs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CEP has been in existence for more than a decade . It deals with large numbers of felons , mainly young offenders who have committed robbery , burglary , or similar crimes . Originally an offshoot of the Vera Institute in New York City , its money comes from public and private sources. // ' ' We reach people just after they have made a serious wrong turn in their lives , ' ' says Page , a cum laude graduate of Yale Law School . ' ' We tell them they have gone the wrong way and that they have a chance to turn around , come back , and stand at that crossroads again and make a choice to change directions. ' ' // Changing directions is certainly what one mother wants her son to do . She is here for the first time at CEP ' s main office in lower Manhattan with court papers remanding the youth to CEP ' s custody . Her 17-year-old son sits beside her - hope , fear , and confusion are written on both faces. // This mother knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-year prison sentence for her son , just convicted of armed robbery and assault of a senior citizen while roaming with a gang of youths . ( This reporter was allowed to sit in on the counseling session as long as privacy was respected. ) // The process by which CEP came to know of the youth ' s arrest is part of what makes its program unique , says Bart Lubow , deputy director in the New York state division of probation and correctional alternatives. // Over the last three months , CEP ' s efforts have included a sequence of steps that began with computer screening of some 5 , 600 detainees in the New York City criminal-justice system . Then there was a closer look at some 850 of these . Personal interviews were conducted with 34 more , and 29 were selected for the program. // But judges don ' t release everyone CEP asks for . Only 16 of the 29 were assigned to CEP supervision . This boy was one of them. // Yet total intake for the past fiscal year was 169 - 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city to deflect from prison or prolonged pretrial detention . Fewer than one-third of the felons sentenced to CEP did not complete the program and had to incarcerated , an exceptionally good record say corrections officials . Without CEP , 90 percent were sure to go to prison. // The average cost of a CEP case is $7 , 000 per year . Compare this with an annual prison cost per inmate approaching $24 , 000 . And though the reduced cost matches other alternative-sentencing programs around the country , there is one key difference - the offenders in CEP are from an urban offender population that is both violent and youthful . CEP has offices in or next to courthouses in four of New York ' s five boroughs : Brooklyn , Queens , Manhattan , and the Bronx. // A recent study requested by New York Mayor Edward Koch shows that a year after entering the alternatives to incarceration program at CEP , 72 percent of those who completed it did not commit a crime . The recidivism rate for those who go to prison is 60 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burden and Kunstadter Family Foundations. // The city is getting a good deal , say criminal-justice experts familiar with CEP . ' ' They have a very , very good program , ' ' says Ken Schoen , a court-appointed master for the city ' s jail system and director of criminal-justice programs at the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation. // ' ' They take a population of young offenders charged with serious crimes , probably the most serious offenses that New York state allows for alternative sentencing , and have a high success rate , ' ' says Mr. Lubow , whose office gives CEP money . ' ' It ' s one of the most effective of the more than 150 programs we fund , ' ' he says. // CEP has an ' ' uncanny way of knowing when to cut off working with someone as well , ' ' says Ms. Berkman . The fact that CEP counselors go directly to her and say , ' ' We can ' t work with this person any more , ' ' strengthens their position with her when they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . ' ' It ' s extremely important to me to know that I don ' t have someone floating around out there without supervision , ' ' she says. // Lester ( not his real name ) says he ' ' got locked up doing a robbery . ' ' He sits across from CEP counselor Eileen Doyle in the Manhattan office , where peeling paint , flickering bulbs , and furniture the Salvation Army wouldn ' t accept are standard . The phones are rotary dial and work provided no rat has chewed through the wiring on a late-night binge. // ' ' I feel better about myself , I can talk over problems , ' ' says Lester . He is living with his grandfather , ' ' helping him as much as I can , because he old , ' ' says the 19-year-old . ' ' I was smoking reefers all the time , not talking with anyone . But here , I learned how to read , ' ' he says . More important , he says , with a grateful look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help yourself.

Right now , he and Doyle have no doubt the risk was worth taking last April when he entered the program. // Time - outside , rather than inside - will tell. // //
