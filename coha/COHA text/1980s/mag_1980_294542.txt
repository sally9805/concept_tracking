Backyard conservation <P> Surrounded by model manicured lawns in the Washington suburb of Columbia , Md. , one lot has gone back to nature . As a result it has become a home for bluebirds , cardinals , butterflies , deer , foxes , raccoons , chipmunks and turtles . Between Fire Station 8 and a bank in a San Francisco warehouse area , a green grove of trees and shrubs attracts finches , hawks , hummingbirds and others seldom seen in the city 's industrial neighborhood . Ten trees and a variety of bushes growing on a 30-ft. by 40-ft. backyard in Brooklyn have attracted 105 varieties of birds , including crow , red-bellied woodpecker and green heron . <P> The three oases , and some 1,700 others across the country , are certified participants in the Backyard Wildlife Program . Sponsored by the Washington-based National Wildlife Federation , the program aims at providing urban and suburban refuges for wildlife . Backyard habitats also benefit their human owners . Families become versed in natural lore , often increase the value of their property and save energy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those with three acres or less . <P> The program is not intended for armchair Audubons . To earn the coveted N.W.F. habitat certificate , an applicant must fill out a detailed questionnaire describing the facilities the yard provides : " seasonal menus for wildlife , " natural and artificial cover , water for drinking and dunking , and other measures taken to attract furred and feathered friends . In addition , the owner is asked to list all the animals observed in the habitat during the previous year . In a letter to program applicants , N.W.F. Executive Vice President Thomas Kimball writes : " A nationwide network of these mini-refuges could demonstrate that people really can help wildlife win their battle with the bulldozer and continue to add beauty , excitement and health to the land . " <P> The backyard conservationists often produce remarkable results in a tiny space . In Elgin , Ill. , Derr and Peggi Andrlik 's 140-ft. by 140-ft. lot is shared by 100 ducks , red foxes , squirrels , wood-chucks and a doe , as well as Pedro and Caspar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their natural home in Mexico . A habitat in Thomasville , Ga. , owned by the Robert Boissieres , abounds with shrubs , trees , vines , wild flowers and grasses ; it has become a refuge for a wide variety of birds , including an occasional giant pileated woodpecker . Now that she has retired the lawnmower , says Habitat Hostess Ellen Mitchell of Reston , Va. , " we 're not afraid of anything now . We used to worry about crabgrass and dandelions , bugs and gnats . Now I know they 're just part of the system . " <P> Some habitat owners with older properties , like Jim Franks of Santa Cruz , Calif. , leave all their fruit and berries for their wild guests-which may include such nonfriends as skunks and snakes . " What the hell , " says one wildlife friend , paraphrasing Robert Frost : " The land was theirs before it was ours . "
