Abortion &; the Law <P> A healthy and happily married Arizona woman , mother of four children , last week went to court to ask approval for an illegal act : getting an abortion . Her fifth child , she fears , might be hideously deformed as a result of her taking the sleeping pill thalidomide . <P> The drug , marketed in many countries under a variety of trade names , has already caused an estimated 5,000 babies to be born malformed in Germany and almost 1,000 in Britain : infants without limbs or with stubby , seal-like flippers or with internal defects such as displaced or missing organs . At least four cases of thalidomide malformation have appeared in the U.S. and more may yet be confirmed , because American women got the sleeping pills overseas or from travelers . ( It has not been licensed for sale in the U.S. ) <P> Robert Finkbine , a high school history teacher in Scottsdale , near Phoenix , bought thalidomide pills for himself in London last year and took some home . <P> <P> For months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife Sherri became pregnant early in May . With four children ranging in age from 20 months to eight years , she is a busy housewife , and as Sherri Chessen , she is also the star of a daily 55-minute Romper Room program on Phoenix 's KTAR-TV . To quiet her nerves and ensure sleep , Sherri Finkbine took some of the British pills-in the second month of her pregnancy , when the danger that the drug will damage the fetus is greatest . Only then did she learn that what she had been taking was thalidomide . <P> But Arizona law , like that in virtually all the states , prohibits abortion for any other reason than to save the mother 's life . Both state and county law officers said that if the operation were performed on Mrs. Finkbine , they would have to prosecute all parties involved-including the physicians . Possible punishment : two to five years in prison . <P> Sherri Finkbine took a bold decision . <P> She gave up trying to remain anonymous . The Finkbines joined Hospital Administrator Stephen Morris in asking Superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sherri Finkbine 's health , said her attorneys , " is such that the termination of her pregnancy is necessary for the preservation and saving of her life . " <P> Says Sherri Finkbine : " It would be the crudest thing in the world to let my baby be born with only a 50-50 chance of being normal . "
