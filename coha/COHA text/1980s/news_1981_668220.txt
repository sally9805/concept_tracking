Superior Court Judge Thomas R. Morse Jr . yesterday appointed a Harvard Law School professor as a special master to examine Boston ' s finances to determine whether the city may be able to provide funds to keep Boston ' s public schools open . Prof. Charles M. Haar of Cambridge , an authority on land use and municipal finance , was directed by Morse to examine the availability of funds in the city treasury that could be used to avert a threatened shutdown of the school system after teachers are paid next Thursday . He will also look into other options for finding the necessary funds . Haar was told to submit a preliminary report on or before next Wednesday , the day Morse has scheduled for the next court hearing in the state Board of Education ' s suit to force Boston to comply with the board ' s requirement for a 180-day school year . Judge Morse , saying he would prefer a political solution , has twice delayed acting on the state ' s request that he order compliance by the city . Efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council completed work on a legislative package designed to raise the $38 million school officials say is needed . But School Committee members and others worried about the closing threat were not persuaded that the council ' s plan would succeed . Concern focused on whether Mayor Kevin H. White and the Legislature would approve the proposal , which was substantially altered from the plan White submitted five weeks ago . A number of observers felt the White would veto the new proposal , which sets unprecedented limits on the mayor ' s fiscal powers . " He ' s going to veto the whole thing , " predicted School Committee member Elvira Pixie Palladino as the City Council broke for lunch and agreed to resume at 2 p.m. , ruling out a trip to Fenway Park for opening day . Kathleen Kelley , president of the Boston Teachers Union , spent her third day in a row watching the council work over its far- reaching proposal , and fretted that time was growing short . Noting that at least three other participants - the mayor , Legislature and Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said her " initial sense that things would work out " was diminishing . " This is not going anywhere . This is dead . This is a joke , " City Councilman Raymond L. Flynn told Palladino and Kelley as they sat in the visitors gallery . Michael Betcher , the School Department ' s legal counsel , thought the petition still had a chance , however . " I ' m not giving up hope yet because I think there will be intense pressure on the mayor , " he said . Officials of the privately financed Boston Municipal Research Bureau , disappointed with most of the proposal ' s financial provisions , brightened after the City Council approved a measure drafted by the bureau for strengthening the Boston superintendent of schools . The measure would give the superintendent control over the hiring and firing of school employees and would provide that the superintendent ' s four- year term could be terminated only for cause . The superintendent now serves at the pleasure of the School Committee . After reading the proposal outside the City Council ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he doubted he would want to serve on the committee if the change goes through . " There wouldn ' t be any purpose in going there , " he said . " The office would be just an honorary one . " The appointment of a special master to examine the availability of cityfunds was proposed by lawyers for the School Committee . City officials have said no funds are available in this year ' s budget . Haar , who was an assistant secretary in the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Lyndon Johnson and has been an adviser to King , said in a brief interview that he planned to work through this weekend . " The time is so short , " he noted . Meanwhile , 14 Massachusetts church leaders offered their assistance to Boston ' s political leaders in keeping the schools open . " Whether as mediators , listeners , advocates or participants , we stand ready to do whatever we can to avoid another tragedy for Boston , " the interdenominational group said in a letter to White , the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
