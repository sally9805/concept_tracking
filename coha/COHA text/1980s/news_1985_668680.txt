John Annerino , the city clerk administrator shot to death last week , may have written a will last spring leaving several thousands of dollars to the Prospect Heights man he allegedly wanted to have killed , an attorney said Thursday . Authorities said a copy of that will , but not an original , was found when police searched Annerino ' s home in a predawn raid Oct. 21 . Authorities said they did not examine the document closely enough to determine who the beneficiary was . Meanwhile , attorneys for Annerino ' s two brothers and a sister have filed documents with Circuit Judge Henry Budzinski that claim that Annerino , 55 , died without leaving a will . Unless an original is found , the bulk of Annerino ' s estate , which may be worth as much as $500 , 000 , could be divided among his relatives , according to legal experts . In most cases , courts require an original document before settling probate claims . Budzinski issued an injunction Friday freezing the accounts that Annerino had in at least seven banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annerino ' s brother August , of Bolingbrook , as administrator of his brother ' s estate . The dispute over a will is the latest twist in the case that started Oct. 17 when a Cook County sheriff ' s police officer was killed after intercepting three men near the Prospect Heights home of Robert Fischer , Annerino ' s former roommate . Authorities charged last week that the three men were on their way to Fischer ' s home to kill him  --  at Annerino ' s behest . Annerino ; Dwayne Coulter , 27 ; Allen Falls , 22 ; and Ira Jackson , 23 , were indicted Nov. 6 on murder charges in the death of the sheriff ' s police officer . Hours after the indictment , Annerino was fatally wounded outside an apartment building at 1010 S. Menard St. On Wednesday , Chicago police charged a Bridgeport handyman , William Rubio , with murder in connection with the Annerino shooting . Police contend that Annerino had hired Rubio , 30 , only to wound him in hopes of blaming the shooting on his former roommate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be almost as twisted as the events leading to the city official ' s death . Abbey Mark Botkin , the Chicago attorney representing Fischer , said Thursday that Annerino had told Fischer last spring that Fischer was named the main heir of Annerino ' s estate . Thursday was the first time since Annerino ' s death that Fischer , who is in protective custody , talked with his attorney . " We ' re pretty sure that in the last will we know of , Mr. Fischer was the chief beneficiary , " Botkin said . Botkin said Fischer authorized him to begin a search for a will and , if one is found , file the appropriate court documents . Botkin said Annerino could have " lied about preparing the will " or revoked the document that named Fischer as an heir . According to Botkin , Fischer said most of Annerino ' s assets were in the name of the Guardian Angel Spirit Church , which he ran from his basement . " He understands the assets were substantial and he had been contributing his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said part of the dispute may center on whether the church ' s assets would be included in his estate . Law enforcement authorities said the church may have as much as $500 , 000 in various bank accounts . According to an investigator , $63 , 000 remained in one bank account after Annerino withdrew $10 , 000 on Nov. 6 , the day he was shot . Also , Annerino ' s church owned a 1985 Cadillac coupe and a 1985 Lincoln Continental , according to a spokesman for the Illinois secretary of state ' s office . According to court records , Annerino ' s relatives estimated the value of his estate at only $5 , 000.
