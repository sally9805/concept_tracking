" Sam Kingsley is one of the most eligible bachelors in Washington . I did n't realize you knew him so well . " Pat tried to make her answer light . 66I really do n't " But she could n't help thinking that Sam was finding it hard to stay away from her . She glanced out the window , hoping to hide her expression . Outsideit was almost dark . The Senator 's windows overlooked the Capitol . As the daylight faded , the gleaming domed building framed by the blue silk draperies resembled a painting . " How lovely ! " she exclaimed . Abigail turned her head toward the window . 66Yes , it is , " she agreed . " That view at this time of day always reminds me of what I 'm doing here . You ca n't imagine the satisfaction of knowing that because of what I did today an old woman will be cared for in a decent nursing home , and extra money may be made available for people who are trying to eke out an existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she spoke about her work , Pat thought . She means every word . But it also occurred to her that the Senator had already dismissed from her memory the girl she had fired a few hours earlier . Pat shivered as she hurried down the few steps from the Senate office building to the car . Sam leaned over to kiss her cheek . " How 's the hotshot filmmaker ? " " Tired , " she said . " Keeping up with Senator Jennings is not the recipe for a restful day . " Sam smiled . " I know what you mean . I 've worked with Abigail on a fair amount of legislation . She never wears down . " Weaving through the traffic , he turned onto Pennsylvania Avenue . " I thought we 'd go to Chez Grandmere in Georgetown , " he said . " It 's quiet , the food is excellent and it 's near your place . " Chez Grandmere was nearly empty . " Washington does n't dine at quarter to six . " Sam smiled as the maitre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cocktail Pat told him about the day , including the scene in the hearing room . Sam whistled . " That was a rotten break for Abigail . You do n't need someone on your payroll to make you look bad . " " Could something like that actually influence the President 's decision ? " Pat asked 66Pat , everything can influence the President 's decision . One mis/take can ruin you . Well , figure it out for yourself . If it were n't for Chappaquiddick , Teddy Kennedy might be President today . Then , of course , you have Watergate and Abscam , and way back , vicuna coats and home freezers . It never ends . Everything reflects on the man or woman who holds the office . It 's a miracle Abigail survived that scandal about the missing campaign funds , and if she had tried to cover up for her aide , it would have been the end of her credibility . What was the girl 's name ? " " Eleanor Brown . " Pat thought of what Margaret Langley had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timid . " " Eleanor always claimed she was innocent , " she told Sam now . He shrugged . " Pat , I was a county prosecutor for four years . You want to know something ? Nine out of ten criminals swear they did n't do it . And at least eight out of nine of them are liars . " " But there is always that one who is innocent , " Pat persisted . " Very occasionally , " Sam said . " What do you feel like eating ? " It seemed to her that she could watch him visibly unwind in the hour and a half they were together . I 'm good for you , Sam , she thought . I can make you happy . You 're equating having a child with the way it was when you were doing everything for Karen , because Janice was sick . It would n't be that way with me ...

" But as you say , it 's probably just some joker , " she concluded . Sam did n't return her attempt at a smile . " I said that one random call to the Boston station might not be important . But you 're saying that in the last three days you 've had a second phone call , and a note pushed under the door . How do you think this nut got your ad-dress ? " " How did you get it ? " Pat asked . " I phoned Potomac Cable and said I was a friend . A secretary gave me your phone number and street address here and told me when you were arriving . Frankly , I was a little surprised they were that casual about giving out so much information . " " I approved it . I 'll be using the house as an office for this program , and you 'd be surprised how many people volunteer anecdotes or memorabilia when they read about a documentary being prepared . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly did n't think I had anything to worry about . "  | " Then that creep could have gotten it the same way . By any chance do you have the note with you ? " " It 's in my bag . " She fished it out , glad to be rid of it . Sam studied it , frowning in concentration . " I doubt whether anybodycould trace this , but let me show it to Jack Carlson . He 's an FBI agent and something of a handwriting expert . And you be sure to hang up if you get another call . " He dropped her off at eight-thirty . " You 've got to get timers for the lamps , " he commented as they stood at the door . " Anybody could come up here and put a note under the door without being noticed . " She looked up at him . The relaxed expression was gone , and the newly acquired creases around his mouth had deepened again . You 've always had to worry about Janice , she thought . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recapture the easy companionship of the evening . " Thanks for being the Welcome Wagon again , " she said . " They 're going to make you chairman of the Hospitality Committee on the Hill . " He smiled briefly and for that moment the tension disappeared from his eyes . " Mother taught me to be courtly to the prettiest girls in town . " He closed his hands around hers . For a moment they stood silently ; then he bent down and kissed her cheek . " I 'm glad you 're not playing favorites , " she murmured . " What ? " " The other night you kissed me below my right eye  --  tonight the left . " " Good night , Pat . Lock the door . " Pat had barely reached the library when the telephone began to ring insistently . For a moment she was afraid to answer . " Pat Traymore . " To her own ears her voice sounded tense and husky . " Miss Traymore , " a woman 's voice said , " I 'm Lila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just got home , but would it be possible for you to come over now ? There 's something quite importantyou should know . " Lila Thatcher , Pat thought . Lila Thatcher . Of course . She was the clairvoyant who had written several widely read books on ESP and other psychic phenomena . Only a few months ago she 'd been celebratedfor her assistance in finding a missing child.  | " I 'll be right there , " Pat agreed reluctantly , " but I 'm afraid I ca n't stay more than a minute . " As she threaded her way across the street , taking pains to avoid the worst of the melting slush and mud , she tried to ignore the sense of uneasiness . She was sure she would not want to hear what Lila Thatcher was about to tell her.  |p74A  maid answered Pat 's ring and escorted her to the living room . Pat did n't know what kind of person to expect  --  she 'd visualized a turbanedGypsy ; but the woman who rose to greet her could be describedsimply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent , twinkling eyes and a warm smile . " Patricia Traymore , " she said , " I 'm so glad to meet you . Welcome to Georgetown . " Taking Pat 's hand , she studied her carefully . " I know how busy you must be with the program you 're preparing . I 'm sure it 's quite a project . How are you getting on with Luther Pelham ? " " Fine so far . " " I hope that continues . " Lila Thatcher wore her glasses on a long silver chain around her neck . Absently she picked them up in her right hand and began to tap them against her left palm . " I have only a few minutes myself . I have a meeting in half an hour , and in the morning I have to catch an early flight to California . That 's why I decided to phone . This is not the sort of thing I usually do . However , in conscience I ca n't go away without warning you . Are you aware that twenty-three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now renting ? " " I 've been told that . " It was the answer nearest the truth . " It does n't upset you ? " " Mrs. Thatcher , many of the houses in Georgetown must be about two hundred years old . Surely people have died in every one of them . " " It 's not the same . " The older woman 's voice became quicker , a thread of nervousness running through it . " My husband and I moved into this house a year or so before the tragedy . I remember the first time I told him that I was beginning to sense a darkness inp75the atmosphere around the Adams home . Over the next months it would come and go , but each time it returned it was more pronounced . Dean and Renee Adams were a most attractive couple . He was quite splendid-looking , one of those magnetic men who instantly attract attention . Renee was different  --  quiet , reserved , a very private young woman . My feeling was that being a politician 's wife was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she was very much in love with her husband and they were both devoted to their child . " Pat listened motionless. 66A few days before she died , Renee told me she was going to go back to New England with Kerry . We were standing in front of your house , and I ca n't describe to you the sense of trouble and danger I experienced . I tried to warn Renee . I told her that if her decision was irrevocable , she should not wait any longer . And then it was too late . I never again felt even a suggestion of trouble concerning your house until this week . But now it 's coming back . I do n't know why but it 's like last time . I sense the darkness involves you . Can you leave that house ? You should n't be there . " Pat chose her question carefully . " Do you have any reason , other than sensing this aura around the house , for warning me not to stay there ? " " Yes . Three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she saw footprints in the snow along the side of this house . We thought there might be a prowler and notified the police . We saw footprints again yesterday morning after the fresh snowfall . Whoever is prowling about only goes as far as that tall rhododendron . Standing behind it anyone can watch your house without being observed from our windows or from the street . " Mrs. Thatcher was hugging herself now as if she were suddenly chilled . The flesh on her face had hardened into deep , grave lines . She stared intently at Pat and then , as Pat watched , her eyes widened ; an expression of secret knowledge crept into them . When Pat left a few minutes later , the older woman was clearly upset and again urged Pat to leave the house . Lila Thatcher knows who I am , Pat thought . I 'm sure of it . She went directly to the library and poured a fairly generous brandy . " That 's better , " she murmured as warmth returned to her body . She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least the police were on the lookout for a prowler . She tried to force herself to bep76calm . Lila had begged Renee to leave . If her mother had listened , had heeded the warning , could the tragedy have been averted ? Should she take Lila 's advice now and go to a hotel or rent an apartment ? " I ca n't , " she said aloud . " I simply ca n't . " She had so little time to prepare the documentary . It would be unthinkable to waste any of that time relocating . The fact that , as a psychic , Lila Thatcher sensed trouble did not mean she could prevent it . Pat thought , If Mother had gone to Boston , Daddy would probably have followed her . If someone is determined to find me , he 'll manage it . I 'd have to be just as careful in an apartment as here . And I will be careful . Somehow the thought that Lila might have guessed her identity was comforting . She cared about my mother and father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program is finished I can talk to her , probe her memory . Maybe she can help me piece it all together . But now it was absolutely essential to begin reviewing the Senator'spersonal files and select some for the program . The spools of film were jumbled together in one of the cartons Toby had brought in . Fortunately , they were all labeled . She began to sort them . Some were of political activities , campaign events , speeches . Finally she found the personal ones she was most interested in seeing . She started with the film labeled WILLARD AND ABIGAIL-HILLCREST WEDDING RECEPTION . She knew they had eloped before his graduation from Harvard Law School . Abby had just finished her junior year at Radcliffe . Willard had run for Congress a few months after their wedding . She 'd helped him campaign , then completed college at the Universityof Richmond . Apparently there had been a reception when he brought her to Virginia . The film opened on the panorama of a festive garden party . Colorful umbrella-covered tables were arranged against the treeshadedbackground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer gowns and picture hats , men in dark jackets and white flannel trousers . In the reception line on the terrace , a breathtaking young Abigail wearing a white silk tunic-style gown stood next to a scholarlylookingyoung man . An older woman , obviously Willard Jennings ' mother , was to Abigail 's right . Her aristocratic face was set in taut , angry lines . As the guests moved slowly past her , she introduced them to Abigail . Never once did she look directly at Abigail.  |p77What  was it the Senator had said ? " My mother-in-law always considered me the Yankee who stole her son , " Clearly , Abigail had not exaggerated . Pat studied Willard Jennings . He was only slightly taller than Abigail , with sandy hair and a thin , gentle face . There was somethingrather endearingly shy about him , a diffidence in his manner as he shook hands or kissed cheeks . Of the three , only Abigail seemed totally at ease , She smiled constantly , bent her head forward as if carefully committing names to memory , reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a sound track , Pat thought . The last person had been greeted . Pat watched as Abigail and Willard turned to each other . Willard 's mother stared straight ahead . Now her face seemed less angry than thoughtful . And then she smiled warmly . A tall auburn-haired man approached . He hugged Mrs. Jennings , released her , hugged her again , then turned to greet the newlyweds . Pat leaned forward . As the man 's face came into full view , she stopped the projector . The late arrival was her father , Dean Adams . He looks so young ! she thought . He ca n't be more than thirty ! She tried to swallow over the lump in her throat . Did she have a vague memory of him looking like this ? His broad shoulders filled the screen . He was like a handsome young god , she thought , towering over Willard , exuding magnetic energy . Feature by feature she studied the face , frozen on the screen , unwavering , open to minute examination . She wondered where her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , her mother had still been a student at the Boston Conservatory , still planning a career in music . Dean Adams was then a freshman Congressman from Wisconsin . He still had the healthy , open look of the Midwest in him , a largerthan-lifeoutdoorsy aura . She pushed the button and the figures sprang to life  --  Dean Adamsjoking with Willard Jennings , Abigail extending her hand to him . He ignored it and kissed her cheek . Whatever he said to Willard , they all began to laugh . The camera followed them as they walked down the flagstone steps of the terrace and began to circulate among the guests . Dean Adams had , his hand under the arm of the older Mrs. Jennings . She was talking to him animatedly . Clearly they were very fond of each other.  |p78When  the film ended , Pat reran it , marking off segments that might be used in the program . Willard and Abigail cutting the cake , toasting each other , dancing the first dance . She could n't use any of the footage from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior Mrs. Jennings was too obvious . And of course there was no question of using the film that involved Dean Adams . What had Abigail felt that afternoon ? she wondered . That beautifulwhitewashed brick mansion , that gathering of Virginia gentry and she only a few years removed from the service apartment of the Saunders house in Apple Junction . The Saunders house . Abigail 's mother , Franey Foster . Where was she that day ? Had she declined to be at her daughter 's wedding reception , feeling she would seem out of place among these people ? Or had Abigail made that decision for her ? One by one Pat began to view the other reels , steeling herself against the shock of watching her father regularly appear in those which had been taken on the estate . Even without the dates , it would have been possible to arrange the films in a time sequence . The first campaign : professional newsreels of Abigail and Willard hand in hand walking down the street , greeting passersby .. . Abigail and Willard inspecting a new housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willard Jennings campaigned this afternoon for the seat to be made vacant by the retirement of his uncle , Congressman Porter Jennings , he pledged to continue the family tradition of service to the constituency . " There was an interview with Abigail . " How does it feel to spend your honeymoon campaigning ? " Abigail 's reply : " I ca n't think of a better way than being at my husband 's side helping him begin his career in public life . " There was a soft lilt in Abigail 's voice , the unmistakable trace of a Southern accent . Pat did a rapid calculation . At that point Abigail had been in Virginia less than three months . She marked that segmentfor the program . There were clips of five campaigns in all . As they progressed , Abigail increasingly played a major role in reelection efforts . Often her speech would begin " My husband is in Washington doing a job for you . Unlike many others , he is not taking time from the importantwork of the Congress to campaign for himself , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his accomplishments . " The films of social events at the estate were hardest to watch.  |p79WILLARD  'S 35TH BIRTHDAY . Two young couples posing with Abigailand Willard Jack and Jackie Kennedy and Dean and Renee Adams . . both recent newlyweds .. It was the first time Pat had seen a film of her mother . Renee was wearing a pale green gown ; her dark hair fell loosely on her shoulders . There was a hesitancy about her , but when she smiled up at her husband , her expression was adoring . Pat found she could not bear to dwell on it . She was glad to let the film unwind . A few frames later , just the Kennedys and Jenningses were posing together . She made a note on her pad . That will be a wonderful clip for the program , she thought bitterly . The pre-Camelot days minus the embarrassment of Congressman Dean Adams and the wife he murdered . The last film she viewed was of Willard Jennings ' funeral . In it was a newsreel clip that opened outside the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The funeral cortege of CongressmanWillard Jennings has just arrived . The great and the near-great are gathered inside to bid a final farewell to the Virginia legislator who died when his chartered plane crashed en route to a speaking engagement . Congressman Jennings and the pilot , George Graney , were killed instantly . " The young widow is being escorted by Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy of Massachusetts . Congressman Jennings ' mother , Mrs. Stuart Jennings , is escorted by Congressman Dean Adams of Wisconsin . Senator Kennedy and Congressman Adams were Willard Jennings ' closest friends . " Pat watched as Abigail emerged from the first car , her face composed , a black veil covering her blond hair . She wore a simply cut black silk suit and a string of pearls . The handsome young Senator from Massachusetts gravely offered her his arm . The Congressman 's mother was obviously grief-stricken . When she was assisted from the limousine , her eyes fell on the flag-draped casket . She clasped her hands together and shook her head slightly in a gesture of agonized rejection . As Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' elbow and clasped her hand in his . Slowly the procession moved into the cathedral . She had seen as much as she could absorb in one evening . Clearly the human interest material she had been seeking was amply presentin the old film clips . She turned out the lights in the library and went into the hall . The hall was drafty . There had been no windows open in thep80library . She checked the dining room , kitchen and foyer . Everythingwas closed and locked . But there was a draft . A sense of apprehension made Pat 's breath come faster . The door to the living room was closed . She put her hand on it . The space between the door and the frame was icy cold . Slowly she opened the door . A blast of cold air assaulted her . She reached for the chandelier switch . The French doors to the patio were open . A pane of glass that had been cut from its frame was lying on the carpet . And then she saw it . Lolling against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white apron soaked with blood , was a Raggedy Ann doll . Sinking to her knees , Pat stared at it . A clever hand had painted downward curves on the stitched mouth , added tears to the cheeks and drawn lines on the forehead so that the typical Raggedy Ann smiling face had been transformed to a pain-filled weeping image . She held her hand to her mouth to force back a shriek . Who had been here ? Why ? Half-hidden by the soiled apron was a sheet of paper pinned to the doll 's dress . She reached for it ; her fingers recoiling at the touch of the crusted blood . The same kind of cheap typing paper as the other note ; the same small , slanted printing . This is your last warning . There must not be a program glorifying Abigail Jennings . A creaking sound . One of the patio doors was moving . Was someonethere ? Pat jumped up . But it was the wind that was pushing the door back and forth . She ran across the room , yanked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless . The hand that had cut out the pane could reach through the empty frame , unlock the doors again . Maybe the intruder was still there , still hiding in the garden behind the evergreens . Her hands shook as she dialed the police emergency number . The officer 's voice was reassuring . " We 'll send a squad car right away . " As she waited , Pat reread the note . This was the fourth time she 'd been warned away from the program . Suddenly suspicious , she wondered if the threats were valid . Was it possible this was some kind of " dirty tricks " campaign to make the Senator 's documentary a subject of gossip , to smear it with outlandish , distracting publicity ? What about the doll ? Shocking to her because of the memory it evoked , but basically a Raggedy Ann with a garishly painted face . On closer examination , it seemed bizarre rather than frightening.  |p81Even  the bloodied apron might be a crude attempt to horrify . If I were a reporter covering this story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front page of tomorrow 's newspaper , she thought . The wail of the police siren decided her . Quickly she unpinned the note and left it on the mantelpiece . Rushing into the library , she dragged the carton from under the table and dropped the doll into it . The grisly apron sickened her . The doorbell was ringing  --  a steady , persistent peal . Impulsively she untied the apron , pulled it off and buried it deep in the carton . Without it the doll resembled a hurt child . She shoved the carton back under the table and hurried to admit the policemen.  |p82Two  police cars , their dome lights blazing , were in the driveway . A third car had followed them . Do n't let it be the press , she prayed . But it was . Photographs were taken of the broken pane ; the grounds were searched , the living room dusted for fingerprints . It was hard to explain the note . " It was pinned to something , " a detective pointed out . " Where did you find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was true enough . The reporter was from the Tribune . He asked to see the note . " I 'd prefer not to have it made public , " Pat urged . But he wasallowed to read it . " What does last warning ' mean ? " the detective asked . " Have you had other threats ? " Omitting the reference to " that house , " she told them about the two phone calls , about the letter she 'd found the first night . " This one is n't signed , " the detective pointed out . " Where 's the other one ? " " I did n't keep it . It was n't signed either . " " But on the phone he called himself an avenging angel ? " " He said something like I am an angel of mercy , of deliverance , an avenging angel . ' " " Sounds like a real screwball , " the detective commented . He studied her keenly . " Funny he bothered to break in this time . Why not just slip an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the reporter scribbling in his notebook . Finally the police were ready to go . The surfaces of all the livingroomtables were smudged with fingerprint powder . The patio doors had been wired together so they could n't be opened until the pane was replaced.  |p83It  was impossible to go to bed . Vacuuming the soot and grit from the living room , she decided , might help her unwind . As she worked , she could n't forget the mutilated Raggedy Ann doll . The child had run into the room . . . and tripped . . . the child fell over something soft , and its hands became wet and sticky ... and the child looked up and saw .. What did I see ? Pat asked herself fiercely . What did I see ? Her hands worked unconsciously , vacuuming the worst of the greasy powder , then polishing the lovely old wooden tables with an oil-dampened chamois cloth , moving bric-a-brac , lifting and pushingfurniture . The carpet had small clumps of slush and dirt from the policemen 's shoes . What did I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , not here ; that table belongs on the short wall , that lamp on the piano , the slipper chair near the French doors . It was only when she had finished that she understood what she had been doing . The slipper chair . The movers had placed it too near the piano . She 'd run down the hall into the room . She 'd screamed " Daddy , Daddy ... " Shed tripped over her mother 's body . Her mother was bleeding . She looked up , and then .. . And then , only darkness .. . It was nearly three o'clock . She could n't think about it any more tonight . She was exhausted , and her leg ached . Her limp would have been obvious to anyone as she dragged the vacuum cleaner back to the storage closet and made her way upstairs . At eight o'clock the telephone rang . The caller was Luther Pelham . Even coming out of the stupor of heavy sleep , Pat realized he was furious . " Pat , I understand you had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She blinked , trying to force the sleep from her eyes and brain . " Yes . " " You made the front page of the Tribune . It 's quite a caption . ' Anchorwoman 's life threatened . ' Let me read you the first para-graph : " A break-in at her Georgetown home was the most recent in a series of bizarre threats received by television personality Patricia Traymore . The threats are tied to the documentary program " Ap84Profile of Senator Abigail Jennings , " which Miss Traymore will produceand narrate , to be aired next Wednesday night on Potomac Cable Television . ' " That 's just the kind of publicity Abigail needs ! " " I 'm sorry , " Pat stammered . " I tried to keep the reporter away from the note . " " Did it ever occur to you to call me , instead of the police ? Frankly , I gave you credit for more brains than you displayed last night . We could have had private detectives watch your place . This is probablysome harmless nut , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much ? " He was right . " I 'm sorry , " Pat repeated . Then she added , " However , when you realize your home has been broken into , and you 're wondering if some nut may be six feet away on the patio , I think it 's a fairly normal reaction to call the police . " " There 's no use discussing it further until we can assess the damage . Have you reviewed Abigail 's films ? " " Yes . I have some excellent material to edit . " " You did n't tell Abigail about being in Apple Junction ? " " No , I did n't . " " Well , if you 're smart , you wo n't ! That 's all she needs to hear now ! " Without saying goodbye , Luther hung up . It was Arthur 's habit to go to the bakery promptly at eight for hot rolls and then pick up the morning paper . Today he reversed the procedure . He was so eager to see if the paper had anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There it was , right on the front page . He read the story through , relishing every word , then frowned . Nothing had been said about the Raggedy Ann doll . The doll had been his means of making them understand that violence had been committed in that house and might be again . He purchased two seeded rolls and walked the three blocks back to the leaning frame house and up to the dreary apartment on the second floor . Only half a mile away King Street had expensive restaurants and shops , but the neighborhood here was run-down and shabby . The door of Glory 's bedroom was open , and he could see she was already dressed in a bright red sweater and jeans . Lately she 'd gotten friendly with a girl in her office , a brazen type who wasp85teaching Glory about makeup and had persuaded her to cut her hair . She did not look up , even though she must have heard him coming in . He sighed . Glory 's attitude toward him was becoming distant , even impatient . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard time old Mrs. Rodriguez had had swallowing her medicineand how he 'd had to break up the pill and give her a little bread with it to hide the taste . Glory had interrupted him , " Father , ca n't we ever talk about anything except the nursing home ? " And then she 'd gone to a movie with some of the girls from work . He put the rolls on plates and poured the coffee . " Soup 's on , " he called . Glory hurried into the kitchen . She was wearing her coat and herpurse was under her arm , as though she could n't wait to leave . " Hello , " he said softly . " My little girl looks very pretty today . " Gloria did n't smile . " How was the movie ? " he asked . " It was okay . Look , do n't bother getting a roll or bun for me anymore . I 'll have mine in the office with the others . " He felt crushed . He liked sharing breakfast with Glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his disappointment , because she looked right at him and the expression in her eyes softened . " You 're so good to me , " she said , and her voice sounded a little sad . For long minutes after she left , he sat staring into space . Last night had been exhausting . After all these years , to have been back in that house , in that room  --  to have placed Glory 's doll on the exact spot where the child had lain . . . When he 'd finished arranging it against the fireplace , the right leg crumpled under it , he had almost expected to turn around and see the bodies of the man and woman lying there again.  |p86After  Luther 's call , Pat got up , made coffee and began editing the storyboards for the program . She had decided to plan two versions of the documentary , one including an opening segment about Abigail'searly life in Apple Junction , the other starting at the wedding reception . The more she thought about it , the more she felt Luther 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program without this upsetting publicity . At least I had the sense to hide the doll , she thought . By nine o'clock she was in the library running off the rest of the films . Luther had already sent over edited segments of the Eleanor Brown case , showing Abigail leaving the courthouse after the Guilty verdict . Her regretful statement : " This is a very sad day for me . I only hope that now Eleanor will have the decency to tell where she has hidden that money . It may have been for my campaignfund , but far more important , it was the donations of people who believed in the goals I embrace . " A reporter asked : " Then , Senator , there is absolutely no truth to Eleanor 's insistence that your chauffeur phoned her asking her to look for your diamond ring in the campaign-office safe ? " " My chauffeur was driving me that morning to a meeting in Richmond . The ring was on my finger . " And then the clip showed a picture of Eleanor Brown , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorless face , her timid mouth and shy eyes . The reel ended with a scene of Abigail addressing college students . Her subject was Public Trust . Her theme was the absolute responsibility of a legislator to keep his or her own office and staff above reproach . There was another segment Luther had already edited , a compi/lation of the Senator in airline-safety hearings , with excerpts from ber speeches demanding more stringent regulations . Several times the referred to the fact that she had been widowed because her husband had entrusted his life to an inexperienced pilot in an illequippedplane . At the end of each of those segments Luther had marked " 2-minute discussion between Senator , and Pat T. on subject " Pat bit her lip . Both those segments were out of sync with what she was trying to do . What happened to my creative control of this project ? she wondered . The whole thing is getting too rushed . No , the word is botched . The phone rang as she began to go through Abigail 's letters from constituents . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've checked with the rental office for my place .

" My real problem is what to wear to the White House dinner . " " You always look lovely . Abigail is going to be there as well . I bumped into her this morning . " A short time later , the Senator phoned to express her shock at the break-in . Then she got to the point . " Unfortunately , the suggestion that you are being threatened because of this program is bound to lead to all sorts of speculation . I really want to get this thing wrapped up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the threats will end even if they are simply from some sort of crank . Have you reviewed the films I gave you ? " " Yes , I have , " Pat replied . " There 's wonderful material and I 've got it marked off . But I 'd like to borrow Toby . There are some places where I need names and more specific background . " They agreed that Toby would come over within the hour . When Pat hung up she had the feeling that in Abigail Jennings ' estimation she had become an embarrassment . Toby arrived forty-five minutes later , his leathery face creased in a smile . " I wish I 'd been here when that joker tried to get in , Pat , " he told her . " I 'd 've made mincemeat of him . " " I 'll bet you would . "  |p88He  sat at the library table while she ran the projector . " That 's old Congressman Porter Jennings , " Toby answered at one point . " He was the one who said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . You know that Virginia aristocracy . Think they own the world . But I have to say that he bucked his sister-in-law when he supported Abigail to succeed Willard . Willard 's mother , that old she-devil , pulled out all the stops to keep Abigail out of Congress . And between us , she was a lot better Congressman than Willard . He was n't aggressive enough . You know what I mean ? " While waiting for Toby , Pat had reviewed the newspaper clippingsabout the Eleanor Brown case . The case seemed almost too simple . Eleanor said that Toby had phoned and sent her to the campaign office . Five thousand dollars of the money had been recoveredin her storage area in the basement of her apartment building . " How do you think Eleanor Brown expected to get away with such a flimsy story ? " Pat now asked Toby . Toby leaned back in the leather chair , crossing one thick leg over the other , and shrugged . Pat noticed the cigar in his breast pocket . Wincing inwardly , she invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face into a mass of creases . " Thanks a lot . The Senator ca n't stand the smell of cigar smoke . I do n't dare have even a puff in the car no matter how long I 'm waiting for her . " He lit the cigar and puffed appreciatively . " About Eleanor Brown , " Pat suggested . She rested her elbows on her knees , cupping her chin in her hands . " The way I figure it , " Toby confided , " Eleanor did n't think the money would be missed for a while . They 've kind of tightened up the law since then , but it really used to be that you could have big money sit in the campaign-office safe for a couple of weeks  --  even longer . " " But seventy-five thousand dollars in cash ? " " Miss Traymore . . . Pat , you got ta understand how many companiescontribute to both sides in a campaign . They want to be sure to be with the winner . Now , of course you ca n't hand cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . So what the big shot does is visit the Senator , let him or her know he 's planning to make a big donation , and then takes a walk with the Senator 's aide on the Capitol grounds and turns over the money there . The Senator never touches it , but knows about it . It 's put right in the campaignp89funds . But because it 's in cash , if the competition gets elected it is n't so obvious . You know what I mean ? " " I see . " " Do n't get me wrong . It 's legal . But Phil had taken some big donations for Abigail , and of course Eleanor knew about them . Maybe she had some boyfriend who wanted to make a killing and only borrowed the money . Then when they looked for it so fast , she had to come up with an excuse . " " She just does n't seem that sophisticated to me , " Pat observed , thinking of the high school yearbook picture . " Well , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rush you , Pat , but the Senator will be needing me . " " There are just one or two more questions . " The phone rang . " I 'll make this fast . " Pat picked it up . 66Pat Traymore . " " How are you , my dear ? " She instantly recognized the precise , overly cultivated voice . " Hello , Mr. Saunders . " Too late she remembered that Toby knew Jeremy Saunders . Toby 's head jerked up . Would he associate the name Saunders with the Jeremy Saunders he 'd known in Apple Junction ? " I tried to get you several times early last evening , " Saunders purred . He was not drunk this time . She was sure of it . " You did n't leave your name . " " Recorded messages can be heard by the wrong ears . Do n't you agree ? " " Just a moment , please . " Pat looked at Toby . He was smoking his cigar thoughtfully and seemed indifferent to the call . Maybe he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen in thirty-five years . " Toby , this is a private call . I wonder if . . . " He stood up quickly before she could finish . " Want me to wait outside ? " " No , Toby . Just hang up when I get to the kitchen extension ? " Deliberately she spoke his name again so that Jeremy would hear and not begin talking until he was sure only Pat was on the line . Toby accepted the receiver casually , but he was certain it was Jeremy Saunders . Why was he calling Pat Traymore ? Had she been in touch with him ? Abigail would hit the ceiling . From the other end of the phone he heard the faint sound of breathing . That stinkingphony , he thought . If h e tries to smear Abby ... 1p90Pat 's voice came on . " Toby , would you mind hanging up ? " " Sure , Pat " He made his voice hearty . He hung up the receiver with a definite click and did n't dare to try to ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy Saunders said , his voice incredulous . " Do n't tell me you 're hobnobbing with Toby Gorgone . " " He 's helping me with some of the background material on the program , " Pat replied . She kept her voice low . " Of course . He 's been there every step of the way with our stateswoman , has n't he ? Pat , I wanted to call because I realize that the combination of vodka and your sympathy made me rather indiscreet . I do insist that our conversation remain totally confidential . My wife and daughter would not enjoy having the shabby little tale of my involvement with Abigail aired on national television . " " I have no intention of quoting anything you told me , " Pat replied . " The Mirror might be interested in gossipy personal material , but I assure you , I 'm not . " " Very good . I 'm greatly relieved . " Saunders ' voice became friendlier . " I saw Edwin Shepherd at the club . He tells me he gave you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd forgotten about that . I do hope you plan to use the picture of Miss Apple Junction with her adoring mother . That one 's worth a thousandwords ! " " I really do n't think so , " Pat said coldly . His presumption had turned her off . 66I 'm afraid I 'll have to get back to work , Mr. Saun-ders . " She hung up and went back into the library . Toby was sitting in the chair where she 'd left him , but there was something different about him . The genial manner was gone . He seemed distracted and left almost immediately . After he had gone , she flung open the window to get rid of the cigar smell . But the odor hung in the room . She realized that once again she felt acutely uneasy and jumped at every sound . Back at the office , Toby went directly to Philip . " How 's it going ? " Philip raised his eyes heavenward. 66The Senator is in a state about the story . She just gave Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd kill it in a minute if the publicity were n't already out . How did it go with Pat Traymore ? " Toby was n't ready to talk about Apple Junction , but he did askp91Philip to look into the question of the rental of the Adams house , which was also on his mind . He knocked on the door of Abigail 's office . She was quiet now  --  too quiet . That meant she was worried . She had the afternoon edition of the paper . " Look at this , " she told him . A famous Washington gossip column 's lead item began : Wags on Capitol Hill are placing bets on the identity of the person who threatened Patricia Traymore 's life if she goes ahead with the documentaryon Senator Jennings . Seems everyone has a candidate . The beautiful senior Senator from Virginia has a reputation among her colleagues as an abrasive perfectionist . As Toby watched , Abigail Jennings , her face savage with fury , crumpled the paper in her hand and tossed it into a wastepaper basket - 44p92Sam Kingsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tie into a bow . He glanced at the clock on the mantel over his bedroom fireplace and decided he had more than enough time for a Scotch and soda . His Watergate apartment commanded a sweeping view of the Potomac . From the side window of the living room he looked down at the Kennedy Center . Some evenings when he arrived late from the office , he 'd go in and catch the second and third acts of a favorite opera . After Janice died , there 'd been no reason to keep the big house in Chevy Chase . Karen was living in San Francisco , and she and her husband spent their holidays with her in-laws in Palm Springs . Sam had given Karen her choice of dishes , silver , bric-a-brac and furniture and sold most of the rest . He had wanted to start with a clean slate in the hope that his pervading sense of weariness might subside . Sam carried his glass to the window . The Potomac was shimmeringfrom the lights of the apartment building and the floodlights of Kennedy Center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people who came here . Would Pat catch it as well ? he wondered . He was damn worried about her . His FBI friend Jack Carlson had flatly told him : " First she gets a phone call , then a note under the door , then another phone call and finally a break-in with a warning note left in her home . You figure out what might happen next time . " You 've got a full-blown psycho who 's about to explode . That slanted printing is a dead giveaway  --  and compare these notes . They 're written only a few days apart . Some of the letters on the second one are practically illegible . His stress is building to a break/ing point . And one way or another , that stress seems to be directed at your Pat Traymore . " His Pat Traymore . In those last months before Janice died , he 'd managed to keep Pat from his thoughts . He 'd always be grateful for that . He and Janice had managed to recapture something of their early closeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had felt drained , exhausted , lifeless , old . Too old for a twenty-seven-year-old girl and all that a life with her would involve . He simply wanted peace . Then he 'd read that Pat was coming to work in Washington and he 'd decided to phone and invite her to dinner . There was no way he could avoid her , or want to avoid her , and he did not intend their first meeting to be constrained by the presence of others . So he 'd asked her out . He had soon realized that whatever was between them had n't gone away , but was still simmering , waiting to blaze up  --  and that was what she wanted . But what did he want ? " I do n't know , " Sam said aloud . Jack 's warning rang in his ears : Suppose something happened to Pat ? The house phone rang . " Your car is here , Congressman , " the doorman announced . " Thank you . I 'll be right down . " Sam put his half-empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jacket and coat . His movements were brisk . In a few minutes he 'd be with Pat . Pat decided to wear an emerald satin gown with a beaded top to the White House dinner . It was an Oscar de la Renta that Veronica had insisted she purchase for the Boston Symphony Ball . Now she was glad she 'd been talked into it . With it she wore her grandmother'semeralds . " You do n't look the part of the girl reporter , " Sam commented when he picked her up . " I do n't know whether to take that as a compliment . " Sam was wearing a navy blue cashmere coat and white silk scarf over his dinner jacket . What was it Abigail had called him ? One of the most eligible bachelors in Washington ? " It was intended as one , No more phone calls or notes ? " he asked . " No . " She had not yet told him about the doll and did n't want to bring it up now.  | " Good . I 'll feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll feel better . " In the limousine on the way to the White House , he asked her about her activities . " Work , " she said promptly . " Luther agreed with the film clips I selected and we 've completed the storyboard . He 's adamant about not crossing the Senator by including her early life . He 's turning what 's supposed to be a documentary into a paean of praise that 's going to be journalistically unsound . " " And you ca n't do anything about it ? " " I could quit . But I did n't come down here to quit after the first week  --  not if I can help it . " They were at Eighteenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue . " Sam , was there ever a hotel on that corner ? " " Yes , the old Roger Smith . They tore it down about ten years ago . " When I was little I went to a Christmas party there . I wore a red velvet dress and white tights and black patent leather slippers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy said , " It 's not your fault , Kerry . " The limousine was drawing up to the northwest gate of the White House . They waited in line as each car stopped for the security check . When it was their turn , a respectful guard confirmed their names on the guest list . Inside , the mansion was festive with holiday decorations . The Marine Band was playing in the marble foyer . Waiters were offering champagne . Pat recognized familiar faces among the assembled guests : film stars , Senators , Cabinet members , socialites , a grande dame of the theater . " Have you ever been here before ? " Sam asked . " On a school trip when I was sixteen . We took the tour and they told us that Abigail Adams used to hang her wash in what is now the Fast Room . " " You wo n't find any laundry there now . Come on . If you 're going to have a career in Washington , you 'd better get to know some people . " A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary . Brian Salem was an amiable , rotund man . " Are you trying to pushus off the front page , Miss Traymore ? " he asked , smiling . So even in the Oval Office the break-in had been discussed . " Have the police any leads ? "  | " I 'm not sure , but we all think it was just some sort of crank . " Penny Salem was a sharp-eyed , wiry woman in her early forties . " God knows Brian sees enough crank letters addressed to the Presi-dent . " " I sure do , " her husband agreed easily , " Anyone in public office is bound to step on toes . The more powerful you are , the madder somebody or some group gets at you . And Abigail Jennings takes positive stands on some mighty volatile issues . Oh , say , there 's the lady now . " He suddenly grinned . " Does n't she look great ? " Abigail had just entered the East Room . This was one night she had not chosen to underplay her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodice covered in pearls . A belled skirt complimentedher small waist and slender frame . Her hair was loosely drawn back into a chignon . Soft waves framed her flawless features . Pale blue shadow accentuated the extraordinary eyes , and rose blush highlighted her cheekbones . A deeper apricot shade outlined her perfectly shaped lips . This was a different Abigail , laughing softly , laying a hand for just an extra moment on the arm of an octogenarian ambassador , accepting the tributes to her appearance as her due . Pat wondered if every other woman in the room felt as she did  --  suddenly colorless and insignificant . Abigail had timed her arrival well . An instant later , the music from the Marine Band shifted to a stirring " Hail to the Chief . " The President and First Lady were descending from their private quarters . With them were the new Prime Minister of Canada and his wife . As the last notes of " Hail to the Chief " died out , the opening chords of the Canadian national anthem began . A receiving line was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Lady , Pat realized that her heart was pounding . The First Lady was far more attractive in person than in her pictures . She had a long , tranquil face with a generous mouth and pale hazel eyes . Her hair was sandy with traces of gray . There was an air of total self-confidence about her . Her eyes crinkled when she smiled , and her lips parted to reveal strong , perfect teeth . She told Pat that when she was a girl her ambition had been to get a job in television . " And instead "  --  she laughed , looking up at her husband  --  " I had no sooner let go of the daisy chain at Vassar than I found myself married . " " I was smart enough to grab her before anyone else did , " the President said . " Pat , I 'm glad to meet you . "  |p96It  was a palpable emotion to feel the solid handshake of the most powerful man in the world . " They 're good people , " Sam commented as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . It 's hard to believe he 's completing his second term . He 's young , not sixty yet . It 'll be interesting to see what he does with the rest of his life . " Pat was studying the First Lady . " I 'd love to do a program on her . She seems comfortable in her own skin . " " Her father was Ambassador to England ; her grandfather was Vice President . Generations of breeding and money coupled with a diplomatic background do have a way of instilling self-confidence , Pat . " In the State Dining Room , the tables were set with Limoges china , an intricate green pattern , rimmed with gold . Pale green damask cloths and napkins with centerpieces of red roses and ferns in low crystal containers completed the effect . " Sorry we 're not sitting together , " Sam commented , " but you seem to have a good table . And please notice where Abigail has been placed . " She was at the President 's table between the President and the guest of honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had this on camera , " Pat murmured . She glanced at the first few items on the menu : salmon in aspic , supreme of capon in flamed brandy sauce , wild rice . Her dinner partner was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The others at the table included a college president , a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright , an Episcopal bishop , the director of LincolnCenter . She glanced around to see where Sam had gone . He was at the President 's table directly across from Senator Jennings . They were smiling at each other . With a twinge of pain , Pat looked away . Near the end of the dinner the President invited everyone to remember in prayer the Vice President , who was so seriously ill . He added , " More than any of us realized , he had been pursuing arduousfourteen-hour days without ever considering the toll they were taking on his health . " When the tribute was completed , there was no doubt in anyone 's mind that the Vice President would never resume his duties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was something of a public benediction in that glance.  | " Well , did you enjoy yourself ? " Sam asked on the way home . " That playwright at your table seemed quite taken with you . You danced with him three or four times , did n't you ? " " When you were dancing with the Senator . Sam , was n't it quite an honor for you to be at the President 's table ? " " It 's always an honor to be placed there . " An odd constraint came over them . It seemed to Pat that suddenlythe evening had gone flat . Was that the true reason Sam had gotten the invitation for her  --  so that she 'd meet Washington people ? Did he simply feel he had a certain obligation to help launch her before he withdrew from her life again ? He waited while she unlocked the door , but declined a nightcap . " I 've got to get in a long day tomorrow . I 'm leaving for Palm Springs on the six-o'clock flight to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Are you going to Concord for the holiday , Pat ? " She did n't want to tell him that Veronica and Charles had left for a Caribbean cruise . " This will be a working Christmas , " she said . " Let 's have a belated celebration after the program is finished . And I 'll give you your Christmas present then . " " That 'll be fine . " She hoped her voice sounded as casually friendly as his . She refused to reveal the emptiness she felt . " You looked lovely , Pat . You 'd be surprised at the number of people I heard commenting about you . " " I hope they were all my own age . Good night , Sam . " She pushed the door open and went inside . " Damn it , Pat ! " Sam stepped into the foyer and spun her around . Her jacket fell from her shoulders as he pulled her to him . Her hands slipped around his neck ; her fingertips touched the collar of his coat , found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . It was as she remembered  --  the faint good scent of his breath , the feel of his arms enveloping her , the absolute certainty that they belonged together . " Oh , my love , " she whispered . " I 've missed you so . " It was as if she had slapped him . In an involuntary movement , he straightened up and stepped back . Dumbfounded , Pat dropped her arms . " Sam . " Pat , I 'm , sorry . . . " He tried to smile . " You 're just too damn attractive for your own good . " For a long minute they stared at each other . Then Sam graspedp98her shoulders . " Do n't you think I 'd like nothing better than to pick up where we left off that day ? I 'm not going to do it to you , Pat . You 're a beautiful young woman . Within six months you 'll have your pick of half a dozen men who can give you the kind of life you should have . Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my seat in the last election . And you know what my opponent said ? He said it 's time for new blood . Sam Kingsley 's been around too long . He 's in a rut . Let 's give him the rest he needs . " " And you believed it ? " " I believe it because it 's true . That last year and a half with Janice left me empty  --  empty and drained . Pat , it 's hard for me to decide where I stand on any issue these days . Choosing what tie to wear is a big effort , for God 's sake , but there is one decision I can stick to . I 'm not going to foul up your life again . " " Have you ever stopped to think how much you 'll foul it up by not coming back into it ? " Unhappily they stared at each other . " I 'm simply not going to let myself believe that , Pat . " Then he was gone.  |p99Glory  was different now . She had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , more colorful . The blouses had high ruffled necks instead of button-down collars . And recently she had bought some earrings , a couple of pairs . He 'd never seen her wear earrings before . Every day now she told him not to make her a sandwich for lunch , that she would eat out . " All by yourself ? " he 'd asked . " No , Father . " " With Opal ? " " I 'm just eating out "  --  and there was that unfamiliar note of impatiencein her voice . She did n't want to hear about his work at all anymore . He 'd tried a couple of times to tell her how even with the respirator , old Mrs. Gillespie was rasping and coughing and in pain . Glory used to listen so sympathetically when he told her about his patients and agree when he said it would be a mercy if the angels came for the very sick ones . Her agreement helped him carry out his mission . He 'd been so distracted with Glory that when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had thought she was asleep , but as he pulled out the respirator plug and prayed over her , she opened her eyes . She had understood what he was doing . Her chin had quivered , and she had whispered , " Please , please oh , .. . sweet Virgin , help me . . . " He 'd watched the expression in her eyes change from terrified to glassy to vacant . And Mrs. Harnick had seen him leaving Mrs. Gillespie 's room . Nurse Sheehan was the one who 'd found Mrs. Gillespie . She had n't accepted the old woman 's death as the will of God . Instead she 'd insisted that the respirator be checked to make sure it hadp100been functioning properly . Later on he 'd seen her with Mrs. Harnick . Mrs. Harnick was very much excited and pointing toward Mrs. Gillespie 's room . Everyone in the Home liked him except Nurse Sheehan . She was always reprimanding him , telling him that he was overstepping . " We have staff chaplains , " she would say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd thought about Nurse Sheehan 's being on duty today , he would never have gone near Mrs. Gillespie . It was his worry over the Senator Jennings documentary that was consuming him , making it impossible for him to think straight . He had warned Patricia Traymore four times that she must not continue to prepare that program . There would be no fifth warning . Pat simply was n't sleepy . After an hour of restless tossing , she gave up and reached for a book . But her mind refused to become involved with the Churchill biography she had been looking forward to reading . At one o'clock she shut her eyes . At three o'clock she went downstairs to heat a cup of milk . She had left the downstairs foyer light on , but even so , the staircase was dark and she had to reach for the railing where the steps curved . She used to sit on this step just out of sight of the people in the foyer and watch company come . I had a blue nightgown with flowers on it . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting here and then I was frightened and I went back up to bed ... . And then . . . " I do n't know , " she said aloud . " I do n't know . " Even the hot milk did not induce sleep . At four o'clock she went downstairs again and brought up the nearly completed storyboard . The program would open with the Senator and Pat in the studio seated in front of an enlarged picture of Abigail and Willard Jenningsin their wedding reception line . Mrs. Jennings senior had been edited out of the reel . While the film of the reception ran , the Senator would talk about meeting Willard while she was attending Radcliffe . At least , that way I get something in about the Northeast , Pat thought . Then they 'd show a montage of Willard 's Congressional campaignswith Pat asking about Abigail 's growing commitment top101politics . Willard 's thirty-fifth-birthday party would highlight the pre-Camelot years with the Kennedys . Then would come the funeral , with Abigail escorted by Jack Kennedy . They 'd eliminated the segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sworn into Congress in black mourning attire , her face pale and grave . Next came the footage about the embezzlement of the campaign funds and Abigail 's commitment to airline safety . She sounds so strident and sanctimonious , Pat thought , and then you see the picture of that scared kid , Eleanor Brown . And it 's one thing to be concerned about airline safety  --  another to keep pointing the finger at a pilot who also lost his life . . . But she knew she would n't be able to persuade Luther to change either segment . The day after Christmas they would shoot Abigail in her office , with her staff and some carefully selected visitors . Congress had at last adjourned , and the shooting should go quickly . At least Luther had agreed to a scene of Abigail in her own home with friends . Pat had suggested a Christmas supper party with shots of Abigail arranging the buffet table . The guests would be some distinguished Washington personalities as well as a few of her office staff who could not be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the Senator returning home at dusk , a briefcase under her arm . And then the wrap-up : " Like many of the millions of single adults in the United States , Senator Abigail Jenningshas found her family , her vocation , her avocation in the work she loves . " Luther had written that line for Pat to deliver . At eight o'clock Pat phoned Luther and asked him again to persuadethe Senator to allow her early life to be included in the program . " What we have is dull , " she said . " Except for those personalfilms , it 's a thirty-minute campaign commercial . " Luther cut her off . " You 've examined all the film ? " " Yes . " " How about photographs ? " " There were very few . " Call and see if there are any more . No . I 'll call . You 're not very high on the Senator 's list right now . " Forty-five minutes later she heard from Philip . Toby would be over around noon with photograph albums . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p102Restlessly  Pat wandered into the library . She had jammed the carton with the doll under the library table . She would use this time to go through more of her father 's effects . When she lifted the doll from the carton , she carried it to the window and examined it closely . A skillful pen had shaded the black button eyes , filled in the brows , given the mouth that mournful twist . In the daylight , it seemed even more pathetic . Was it supposedto represent her ? She put it aside and began to unpack the carton : the pictures of her mother and father ; the packets of letters and papers ; the photo albums . Her hands became soiled and dusty as she sorted the materialinto piles . Then she sat cross-legged on the carpet and began to go through it . Loving hands had kept the mementos of Dean Adams ' boyhood . Report cards were neatly pasted in sequence . A-pluses , A 's . The lowest mark a B-plus . He had lived on a farm fifty miles from Milwaukee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small porch . There were pictures of him with his mother and father . My grandparents , Pat thought . She realized she did n't know their names . The back of one of the pictures was marked Irene and Wilson with Dean , age 6 months . She picked up a packet of letters . The rubber band snapped and they scattered on the carpet . Quickly she gathered and glanced through them . One especially caught her eye . Dear Mom , Thank you . I guess those are the only words for all the years of sacrifice to put me through college and law school . I know all about the dresses you did n't buy , the outings you never attended with the other ladies in town . Long ago I promised I 'd try to be just like Dad . I 'll keep that promise . I love you . And remember to go to the doctor please . That cough sounded awfully deep . Your loving son , DeanAn obituary notice for Irene Wagner Adams was beneath the letter .

She was riding her tricycle down the driveway . . . her knee scraping along gravel ... his voice staying , " This wo n't hurt much , Kerry . We have to make sure in clean ... What kind of ice cream should we get ? The doorbell rang . Pat swept the pictures and letters together and stood up . Half of them spilled from her arms as she tried to jam them into the carton . The doorbell rang again , this time more Insistently . She scrambled to pick up the scattered photos and notes and hide them with the others . She started from the room and realized she 'd forgotten to put away the pictures of her parents and the Raggedy Ann doll . Suppose Toby had come in here and seen them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Toby was about to ring the bell again when she yanked open the door . Involuntarily , she stepped back as his bulky frame filled the doorway . " I was just giving up on you ! " His attempt to sound genial did n't come off . " Do n't give up on me , Toby , " she said coldly . Who was he to be annoyed at having to wait a few seconds ? He seemed to be studying her . She glanced down and realized how grimy her hands were and that she had been rubbing her eyes , Her face was probably smeared with dirt . " You look like you were making mud pies . " There was a puzzled , suspicious expression on his face . She did n't answer him . He shifted the package under his arm , and the oversized onyx ring moved back and forth on his finger . " Where do you want this stuff , Pat ? In the library ? " " Yes . " He followed her so closely that she had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . Sitting cross-legged for so long had made her right leg numb , and she was favoring it . " You limping , Pat ? You did n't fall on the ice or anything , did you ?

The Senator was n't happy abouthaving to figure out where these albums were . I can see myself out . " She waited until she heard the front door close before she went tosecure the bolt . As she reached the foyer , the door opened again.  |p104Toby  seemed startled to see her standing there ; then his face creased in an unpleasant smile . " That lock would n't keep out anyone who knew his way around , Pat , " he said . " Be sure to use the dead bolt . " The Senator 's additional material was a hodgepodge of newspaperclippings and fan letters . Most of the pictures were shots of her at political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Pat turned the pages , several of them fluttered down to the floor . The back pages of the album were more promising . She came upon an enlarged photo of a young Abigail and Willard seated on a blanket near a lake . He was reading to her . It was an idyllic setting : they looked like lovers on a Victorian cameo . There were a few more snapshots that might fit into a montage . At last she had gone through everything and bent down to retrieve the pictures that had fallen . Underneath one of them was a folded sheet of expensive notepaper . She opened it . It read : Billy darling . You were splendid in the hearings this afternoon . I am so proud of you . I love you so and look forward to a lifetime of being with you , of working with you . Oh , my dearest we really are going to make a difference in this world . A.The letter was dated May 13 . Willard Jennings had been on his way to deliver the commencement address when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific wrap-up that would make ! Pat exulted . It would quiet anyone who thinks of the Senator as cold and uncaring . If she could only persuade Luther to let her read the note on the program . How would it sound ? " Billy darling , " she read aloud . " I 'm so sorry9fHer voice broke . What is the matter with me ? she thought impatiently . Firmly , she began again . " Billy darling . You were splendid.  |p105On  the twenty-third of December at 2 P.M. Senator Abigail Jenningssat in the library of her home with Toby and Philip and watched the telecast as the Vice President of the United States formally tendered his resignation to the Chief Executive . Her lips dry , her fingernails digging into her palms , Abigail listened as the Vice President , propped on pillows in his hospital bed , ashen-faced and obviously dying , said in a surprisingly strong voice , " I had expected to withhold my decision until after the first of the year . However , I feel that it is my clear duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Executive of this great country uncompromised . I am grateful for the confidence the President and my party expressed when I was twice chosen to be the Vice Presidentialcandidate . I am grateful to the people of the United States for having given me the opportunity to serve them . " With profound regret , the President accepted the resignation of his old friend and colleague . When asked if he had decided on a replacement , he said , " I have a few ideas . " But he declined to respond to the names suggested by the press . Toby whistled . " Well , it 's happened , Abby . " " Senator , mark my words . . . " Philip began . " Be quiet and listen ! " she snapped . As the scene in the hospital room ended , the camera focused on Luther Pelham in the newsroomof Potomac Cable . " A historic moment , " Luther began . With dignified reticence he recounted a brief history of the Vice Presidency and then came to the point . " The time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . . a woman with the necessary experience and proved expertise . Mr. President , choose her now . " Abigail laughed sharply . " Meaning me. "  |p106The  phone began to ring . " That will be reporters . I 'm not in , " she said . An hour later the press was still camped outside Abigail 's home . Finally she agreed to an interview . Outwardly she was calm . She said that she was busy with preparations for a Christmas supper for friends . When asked if she expected to be appointed Vice President , she said in an amused tone , " Now , you really ca n't expect me to comment on that . " Once the door closed behind her , her expression and manner changed . Even Toby did not dare to cross the line . Luther phoned to confirm the taping schedule . Abigail 's raised voice could be heard throughout the house . " Yes , I saw it . You want to know something ? I probably have this in the bag right now , without that damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rotten idea . Do n't tell me you only wanted to help me . You wanted to have me obligated to you , and we both know it . " Abigail 's voice lowered , and Philip exchanged glances with Toby . " What did you find out ? " he asked . " Pat Traymore was up in Apple Junction last week . She stopped at the newspaper office and got some back issues . She visited Saunders , the guy who was sweet on Abby when she was a kid . He talked his head off to her . Then she saw the retired school principal who knew Abby . I was at Pat 's house in Georgetown when Saunders phoned her . " " How much damage could any of those people do to the Senator ? " Philip asked . Toby shrugged . " It depends . Did you find out anything about the house ? " " Some , " Philip told him . " We got to the realty company that has been renting it for years . They had a new tenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the heirs said that someone in the family was planning to use it and it would n't be for rent again . " " Someone in the family ? " Toby repeated . " Who in the family ? " " I would guess Pat Traymore , " Philip said sarcastically . " Do n't get smart with me , " Toby snapped . " I want to know who owns that place now , and which relative is using it . " With mixed emotions Pat watched Potomac Cable cover the Vice President 's resignation . At the end of Luther 's segment , the anchorman said that it was considered unlikely the President would name a successor before the New Year.  |p107And  we air the program on the twenty-seventh , Pat thought , As Sam had predicted the first night she was in Washington , she might have a hand in the selection of the first woman Vice President . Once again her sleep had been interrupted by troubled dreams . Did she really remember her mother and father so clearly , or was she confusing the films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The memory of his bandaging her knee and taking her for ice cream was authentic . She was sure of that . But had n't there also been times when she had pulled the pillow over her ears because of angry voices and hysterical weeping ? She was determined to finish reviewing her father 's effects . Doggedly she had examined the material and found herself increasinglyconcerned about the references to her mother . There were letters from her grandmother to Renee . One of them , dated six months before the tragedy , said : " Renee , dear , the tone of your note troubles me . If you feel you are having onslaughts of depressionagain , please go into counseling immediately . " It had been her grandmother , according to the newspaper articles , who had claimed that Dean Adams was an unstable personality . She found a letter from her father to her mother written the year before their deaths : Dear Renee , I am pretty upset that you want to spend the entire summer in New Hampshire with Kerry . You must know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to go to Wisconsin . Why not give it a try ? We can rent a Steinway for you while you 're there . I certainly understand that Mothers old spinet is hardly appropriate . Please , deal . For my sake . Pat felt as though she were trying to remove bandages from a festering wound . The nearer she got to the wound itself , the harder it was to pull the adhesive from it . The sense of pain , emotional and even physical , was increasingly acute . One of the cartons was filled with Christmas ornaments and strings of lights . They gave her an idea . She would get a small Christmas tree . Why not ? Where were Veronica and Charles now ? She consulted their itinerary . Their ship would be putting in at St.p108John tomorrow . She wondered if she could phone them on ChristmasDay . The mail was a welcome respite . She had an abundance of cards and invitations from her friends in Boston . " Come up just for the day if you possibly can . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmy for this one , Pat  --  not just the nomination . " One letter had been forwarded from Boston Cable . The returnaddresssticker on the envelope read : CATHERINE GRANEY , 22 BALSAM PLACE , RICHMOND , VA . Graney , Pat thought . That was the name of the pilot who died with Willard Jennings . The letter was brief : Dear Miss Traymore : I have read that you are planning to prepare and narrate a program about Senator Abigail Jennings . As one who has had the opportunity to appreciate several of your fine documentaries , I feel it imperative to notify you that the program about Senator Abigail Jennings may become the subject of a lawsuit . I warn you , do not give the Senator the opportunity to discuss Willard Jennings ' death . For your own sake , do n't let her assert that pilot error cost her husband his life . That pilot , my husband , died too . And believe me , it is a bitter joke that she dares to affect the pose of a bereaved widow . If you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this number : 804-555-6841 . Pat went to the phone and dialed the number . It rang many times . She was about to hang up when she heard a hurried hello . It was Catherine Graney . The background was noisy , as though a crowd of people were there . Pat tried to make an appointment . " It will have to be tomorrow , " the woman told her . " I run an antiques shop , and I 'm having a sale today . " They agreed on a time , and she hurriedly gave Pat directions . That afternoon Pat went shopping . Her first stop was an art shop . She left for refraining one of the old sailing prints that had come from her father 's office . It would be her Christmas present to Sam . " Have it for you in a week , Miss . That 's a fine print . Worth some money if you ever want to sell it . " " I do n't want to sell it . " She stopped in the specialty market near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the florist 's she bought two poinsettias and a garland of evergreen for the mantel . She found ap109Christmas tree that stood as high as her shoulders . The pick of the trees was gone , but this one was well enough shaped and the pine needles had a luxurious sheen . By early evening she had finished decorating . The tree was set near the patio doors . The mantel was draped with evergreen . One poinsettia was on the low round table next to the couch , the other on the cocktail table in front of the love seat . She had hung all the paintings . She had had to guess at placing them , but even so , the living room was now complete . A fire , she thought . There was always a fire . She laid one , ignited the papers and kindling , and positioned the screen . Then she fixed an omelette and salad and brought the tray to the living room . Tonight she would simply watch television and relax . She felt she had been pushing too hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had expected this room to be repugnant to her , but despite the terror of that last night , she found it warm and peaceful . Did it harbor happy memories as well ? She turned on the set . The President and First Lady flashed on the screen . They were boarding Air Force One en route to their family home for Christmas . Once again the President was being badgered about his choice . " I 'll tell you who she or he is by the New Year , " he called . " Merry Christmas . " She . Had that been a deliberate slip ? Of course not . Sam phoned a few minutes later . " Pat , how is it going ? " She wished her mouth would not go dry at the sound of his voice . " Fine . Did you see the President on TV just now ? " " Yes , I did . Well , we 're surely down to two people . Hq 's committedhimself to selecting a woman . I 'm going to give Abigail a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat raised her eyebrows . 66I would be , in her place .

I was trooping around buying a Christmas tree and it was cold enough . " " What are your plans for Christmas Day ? Will you be at Abigail 's for the supper party ? " 66Yes . I 'm surprised you were n't invited . " 66I was . Pat , it 's good to be with Karen and Tom , but  --  well , this is Karen 's family now , not mine . I had to bite my tongue at lunch not to tell off some pompous ass who had a laundry list of all the mistakesthis Administration has made . "  |p110Pat  could n't resist . " Is n't Tom 's mother fixing you up with her available friends or cousins or whatever ? " Sam laughed . " I 'm afraid so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be back a few days after Christmas . You have n't had any more threats . have you ? " " Not even one breathless phone call . I miss you , Sam , " she added deliberately . There was a pause . She could imagine his expression  --  worried . trying to find the right phrase . You care every bit as much about me as you did two years ago , she thought . " Sam ? " His voice was constrained . " I miss you , too , Pat . You 're very important to me . " What a fantastic way to put it . " And you 're one of my very dearest friends . " Without waiting for his response , she hung up.  | " Father , have you seen my Raggedy Ann doll ? " He smiled at Glory , hoping he did n't look nervous . " No , of course I have n't seen it . Did n't you have it in the closet in your bedroom ? " " Yes . I ca n't imagine . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away ? " " Why would I throw it away ? " " I do n't know . " She got up from the table . " I 'm going to do a little Christmas shopping . I wo n't be late . " She looked worried , then asked , " Father , are you starting to feel sick again ? You 've been talking in your sleep the last few nights . I could hear you from my room . Is anything worrying you ? You 're not hearing those voices again , are you ? " He saw the fear in her eyes . He never should have told Glory about the voices . She had n't understood . Worse , she had started to be nervous around him . " Oh , no . I was joking when I told you about them . " He was sure she did n't believe him . She put her hand on his arm . " You kept saying Mrs. Gillespie 's name in your sleep . Is n't she the woman who just died in the nursing home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen table , his thin legs wound around the rungs of the chair , thinking . Nurse Sheehan and the doctors had questioned him about Mrs. Gillespie : had he looked in on her ? " Yes , " he 'd admitted . " I just wanted to see if she was comfort-able . " " How many times did you look in on her ? " " Once . She was asleep . She was fine . " " Mrs. Harnick and Mrs. Drury both thought they saw you . Butp112Mrs . Drury said it was at five after three , and Mrs. Harnick was sure it was later . " " Mrs. Harnick is wrong . I only stopped in once . " They had to believe him . Half the time Mrs. Harnick was almost senile . But the rest of the time she was very sharp . He suddenly picked up the newspaper again . He 'd taken the Metro home . An old woman carrying a shopping bag and leaning on a cane had been on the platform . He 'd been about to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the express roared into the station . The crowd had surged forward and a young fellow , his arms filled with schoolbooks , had nearly knocked the old lady over as he rushed to get a seat . He recalled how he had helped her into the train just before the doors closed . " Are you all right ? " he had asked . " Oh , yes . My , I was afraid I 'd fall . Young people are so careless . Not like in my day . " " They are cruel , " he said softly . The young man got off at Dupont Circle and crossed the plat form . He had followed him , managed to get next to him as he stood at the front of the crowd , right at the edge of the platform . As the train approached he had stepped behind him and jostled his arm so that one of the books began to slip . The young man grabbed for it . Off-balance as he was , it was easy to push him forward . The book and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper . Yes , here it was on page three : NINETEEN-YEAR OLD STUDENT KILLED BY METRO . The account called the death an accident . A bystander had seen a book slip from the student 's arm . He had bent forward to retrieve it and lost his balance . The coffee cup in Arthur 's hands had grown cold . He would make a fresh cup , then get to work . There were so many helpless old people in the nursing home waiting for his attention . His mind had been on Patricia Traymore . That was why he had n't been more careful about Mrs. Gillespie . Tomorrow he 'd tell Glory he had to work late and he 'd go back to Patricia Traymore 's house . He had to get in again . Glory wanted her doll back . At ten o'clock on the twenty-fourth Pat set off for Richmond . The sun had come out strong and golden , but the air was still very cold . It would be a frosty Christmas.  |p113After  leaving the highway she took three wrong turns and becamethoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a street of comfortable medium-sized Tudor-style houses . Number 22 was larger than its neighbors and had a carved sign ANTIQUES on the lawn . Catherine Grapey was waiting in the doorway . She was about fifty , with a square face , deep-set blue eyes and a sturdy , slim body . Her graying hair was straight and blunt-cut . She shook Pat 's hand warmly . " I feel as though I know you . I go on buying trips to New England fairly often , and whenever I got the chance I watched your program . " The downstairs was used as a showroom . Chairs , couches , vases , lamps , paintings , Oriental carpets , china and fine glassware were all marked with tags . A Queen Anne breakfront held delicate figurines . A sleepy Irish setter , his dark red hair generously sprinkled with gray , was asleep in front of it . " I live upstairs , " Mrs. Graney explained . " Technically the shop is closed , but someone phoned and asked if she could stop in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Pat took off her coat . She looked around , studying the contents of the room . " You have beautiful things . " " I like to think so . " Mrs. Graney looked pleased . " I love searching out antiques and restoring them . My workshop is in the garage . " She poured coffee from a Sheffield pot and handed a cup to Pat . " And I have the pleasure of being surrounded by beautiful things . With that auburn hair and gold blouse , you look as though you belong on that Chippendale couch . " " Thank you . " Pat realized she liked this outspoken woman . There was something direct and honest about her . It made it possible to get right to the point of the visit . " Mrs. Graney , you can understand that your letter was quite startling . But will you tell me why you did n't contact the network directly , instead of writing to me ? " Catherine Graney took a sip of coffee . " As I told you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity in your work , and I did n't think you would willingly help to perpetuate a lie . That 's why I 'm appealing to you to make sure that George Graney 's name is not mentioned on the Jennings program , and that Abigail Jennings does not refer to pilot error ' in connection with Willard 's death , My husband could fly anything that had wings . " Pat thought of the already-edited segments for the program . The Senator had denounced the pilot  --  but had she actually mentionedp114his name ? Pat was n't sure . But she did remember some of the details of the accident . " Did n't the investigation findings indicate that your husband was flying too low ? " she asked . " The plane was flying too low and went into the mountain . When Abigail Jennings started using that crash as a means for getting her name in the paper as a spokesperson for airline safety regulations , I should have objected immediately . " Pat watched as the Irish setter , seeming to sense the tension in his mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and settledat her feet . Catherine leaned over and patted him . " Why did n't you speak up immediately ? " " Many reasons . I had a baby a few weeks after the accident . And I suppose I wanted to be considerate of Willard 's mother , " " Willard 's mother ? " " Yes . You see , George used to fly Willard Jennings quite often . They became good friends . Old Mrs. Jennings knew that , and she came to me after the crash had been sighted  --  to me , not to her daughter-in-law  --  and we sat together and waited for the final word . She put a very generous sum of money in trust for my son 's education . I did n't want to make her unhappy by using the weapon I could have used against Abigail Jennings . We both had our suspicions , but to her , scandal was anathema . " Three grandfather clocks simultaneously chimed the hour . It was one o'clock . The sun streamed into the room . Pat noticed that Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently , she had never remarried . " What weapon could you have used ? " she asked 66I could have destroyed Abigail 's credibility . Willard was miserablyunhappy with her and with politics . The day he died he was planning to announce that he was not seeking reelection and that he was accepting the presidency of a college . He wanted the academiclife . The last morning he and Abigail had a terrible fight at the airport . She pleaded with him not to announce his resignation . And he told her , right in front of George and me . Abigail , it wo n't make a damn bit of difference to you . We 're finished . " " Abigail and Willard Jennings were on the verge of divorce ? " " This noble widow ' business has always been a posture . My son , George Graney , Junior , is an Air Force pilot now . He never knew his dad . But I 'm not going to have him embarrassed by any more of her lies . And whether I win the suit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phony she 's always been . "  |p115Pat  tried to choose her words carefully . " Mrs. Graney , I will certainly do what I can to see that your husband is n't referred to in a derogatory way . But I must tell you , I 've been going through the Senator 's private files and everything I see suggests that Abigail and Willard Jennings were very much in love . " Catherine Graney looked scornful . " I 'd like to see the expression on old Mrs. Jennings ' face if she ever heard that ! Tell you what : on your way back , drive an extra mile and pass Hillcrest . That 's the Jennings estate . And imagine how strongly a woman must have felt not to leave it  --  or one red cent  --  to her own daughter-in-law . " Fifteen minutes later , Pat was looking through high iron gates at the lovely mansion set on the crest of the snow-covered grounds . As Willard 's widow , Abigail had had every right to think she might inherit this estate as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , she would have been the outcast once again . If Catherine Graney was to be believed , the tragedy Abigail spoke so movingly about had , in fact , been the stroke of fortune that twenty-five years ago saved her from oblivion.  | " It looks good , Abby , " Toby said genially . " It should photograph well , " she agreed . They were admiring the Christmas tree in Abigail 's living room . The dining-room table was already set for the Christmas buffet . " There are bound to be reporters hanging around tomorrow morning , " she said . " Find out what time the early services are at the Cathedral . I should be seen there . " She did n't plan to leave a stone unturned . Ever since the Presidenthad said , " I 'll announce her , " Abigail had been sick with nervousness . " I 'm the better candidate , " she 'd said a dozen times . " Claire is from his own region . That 's not good . If only we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might help you , " he said soothingly , though secretly he was as worried as she . " Toby , it might help if I were running for elective office in a big field of candidates . But I do n't think the President is going to see the damn thing and jump up and say She 's for me . ' But he just might wait to see if there 's negative reaction to it before he announces his decision . " He knew she was right . " Do n't worry . Anyway , you ca n't pull out . The program 's already in the listings . " She 'd carefully selected the guests for the Christmas buffet supper . Among them she had two Senators , three Congressmen , a Supreme Court Justice and Luther Pelham . " I only wish Sam Kingsleywere n't in California , " she said . By six o'clock , everything had been arranged . Abby had a goose cooking in the oven . She would serve it cold at the supper the next day . The warm , rich smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen of the Saunders house when they were high school kids . That kitchen always smelled of good food roasting or baking . Francey Foster had been some cook . You had to give her dual " Well , I guess I 'll be on my way , Abby . " " Got a heavy date , Toby ? " " Not too heavy . " The Steakburger waitress was beginning to bore him . Eventually they all did . " I 'll see you in the morning . Pick me up early . " " Right , Senator . Sleep well . You want to look your best tomorrow " Toby left Abby fussing with some strands of tinsel that were n't banging straight . He went back to his apartment , showered and put on slacks , a textured shirt and a sports jacket . The Steakburger kid bad pretty definitely told him she did n't plan to cook tonight . He would take her out for a change and then they 'd go back to her apartment for a nightcap . Toby did n't enjoy spending his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pulled on his dark green knitted tie and was looking at himself in the mirror when the phone rang . It was Abby . " Go out and get me a copy of The National Mirror , " she demanded . " The Mirror ? " " You heard me  --  go out and get it . Philip just phoned . Miss Apple junction and her elegant mother are on the front page . Who dug out that picture ? Who ? " Toby gripped the phone . Pat Traymore had been in the newspaperoffice at Apple Junction . Jeremy Saunders had phoned Pat Traymore . " Senator , if someone is trying to put the screws on you , IT make mincemeat of them . " Pat was home by three-thirty and looked forward to an hour 's nap . As usual , the extra exertion of standing and climbing to hang the pictures the night before had taken its toll on her leg . The dull , steady ache had been persistent during the drive from Richmond . But she 'd scarcely entered the house when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so glad I 've caught you , Pat . I 've been watching for you . Are you free this evening ? "  | " As a matter of fact . . . " Caught off guard , Pat could not think of a reasonable excuse . You ca n't lie easily to a psychic , she though tLila interrupted . " Do n't be busy . The Ambassador is having peo ple in for his usual Christmas Eve supper and I phoned and told I 'd like to bring you . After all , you are one of his neighbors no  --  He 'd be delighted . " The octogenarian retired Ambassador was perhaps the most dis tinguished elder statesmen of the District . Few world leaders visit ing Washington failed to stop at the Ambassador 's home . " I 'd love to go , " Pat said warmly . " Thank you for thinking of me . " When she hung up , Pat went up to the bedroom . The guests at the Ambassador 's home would be a dressy crowd . She decided to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to soak in a hot tub for fifteen minutes and then to take a nap . As she lay back in the tub , Pat noticed that a corner of the bland beige wallpaper was peeling . A swatch of Wedgwood blue could be seen underneath . Reaching up , she peeled back a large piece of the top layer of paper . That was what she remembered  --  that lovely violet and Wedg wood blue . And the bed had an ivory satin quilted spread , sh ' thought , and we had a blue carpet on the floor . Mechanically she dried herself and pulled on a terry-cloth caftan . The bedroom was cool and already filled with late-afternoon shad ows . As a precaution , she set the alarm for four-thirty before drifting off to sleep . The angry voices . . . the blankets pulled over her head . . the loud noise . . . another loud noise . . . her bare feet silent on the stairs .. . The insistent pealing of the alarm woke her . She rubbed her forehead trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in her head ? Oh , God , if only she had n't set the alarm . But it 's coming closer , she thought . The truth comes closer each time ... Slowly she got up and went to the vanity in the dressing room Her face was strained and pale . A creaking sound down the hallway made her whirl around , her hand at her throat . But of course , it was just the house settling . Promptly at five , Lila Thatcher rang the bell . She stood framed inp119the doorway , almost elfin with her rosy cheeks and white hair . She looked festive in an Autumn Haze mink coat with a Christmas corsage pinned on the wide collar . " Have we time for a glass of sherry ? " Pat asked . " I think so . " Lila glanced at the slender Carrara marble table and matching marble-framed mirror in the foyer . " I always loved those pieces . I 'm glad to see them back . " " You know . " It was a statement . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a decanter of sherry and a plate of sweet biscuits on the cocktail table . Lila paused at the doorway of the living room . ' Yes , " she said , " you 've done a very good job . Of course , it 's been so long , but it is as I remember it . That wonderful carpet ; that couch . V.ven the paintings , " she murmured . " No wonder I 've been trouWed . Pat , are you sure this is wise ? " They sat down and Pat poured the sherry . " I do n't know if it 's wise . I do know it 's necessary . " " How much do you remember ? " " Bits . Pieces . Nothing that hangs together . " " I used to call the hospital to inquire about you . You were unconsciousfor months . When you were moved , we were given to understand that if you did pull through , you 'd be permanently damaged . And then the death notice appeared . " " Veronica . . . my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother did n't want the scandal following me . . . or them . " " And that 's why they changed your first name as well ? " " My name is Patricia Kerry . I gather the Kerry was my father 's idea . Patricia was my grandmother 's name . They decided that as long as they were changing my last name they might as well start using my real first name too . " " So Kerry Adams became Patricia Traymore . What are you hopingto find here ? " Lila took a sip of sherry and set down the glass . Restlessly Pat got up and walked over to the piano . In a reflex action she reached toward the keyboard , then pulled her hands back . Lila was watching her . " You play ? " " Only for pleasure . " " Your mother played constantly . You know that . " " Yes . Veronica has told me about her . You see , at first I only wanted to understand what happened here . Then I realized that ever since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forp120hurting me so , for robbing me of my mother . I think I hoped to fins some indication that he was sick , falling apart  --  I do n't know what But now , as I begin to remember little things , I realize it 's more than that . I 'm not the same person I would have become ifShe gestured at the area where the bodies had been found . " . if all this had n't happened . I need to link the child I was with tli person I am . I 've lost some part of myself back there . I have so man preconceived ideas-my mother was an angel , my father a devil Veronica hinted that my father destroyed my mother 's musica career and then her life . But what about him ? She married a political cian and then refused to share his life . Was that fair ? How much wan I a catalyst of the trouble between them ? Veronica told me once that this house was too small . When my mother tried to practice , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lila said . " That 's exactly what I 'm afraid you are , Pat You 're setting things in motion that are best left alone . " She studied her . " You seem to have recovered very well from your injuries . " " It took a long time . When I finally regained consciousness , I hack to be taught everything all over again . I did n't understand words . did n't know how to use a fork . I wore the brace on my leg till I wa seven . ' Lila realized she was very warm . Only a moment before she 'd fell cool . She did n't want to examine the reason for the change . Slag knew only that this room had not yet completed its scenario of tragedy . She stood up . " We 'd better not keep the Ambassador wait ing , " she said briskly . She could see in Pat 's face the cheekbones and sensitive mouth al Renee , the wide-spaced eyes and auburn hair of Dean . " All right , Lila , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which one of them do I resemble ? " " Both , " Lila said honestly , " but I think you are more like youu father . " " Not in every way , please , God . " Pat 's attempt at a smile was forlorn failure.  |p121Well-hidden  in the shadows of the trees and shrubs , Arthur observedPat and Lila through the patio doors . He had been bitterly disappointed to see the lighted house , the car in the driveway . Maybe he would n't be able to search for the doll tonight . And he desperately wanted Glory to have it in time for Christmas . He tried to hear what the women were saying but could not catch more than an occasional word . They were both dressed up . Could they be going out ? He decided to wait . Avidly he studied Patricia Traymore 's face . She was so serious , her expression so troubled . Had she begun to heed his warnings ? For her sake he hoped so . He had been watching only a few minutes when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept along the side of the house and in a moment heard the sound of the front door opening . They did not take the car . They could not be going too far , maybe to a neighbor 's house or a nearby restaurant . He would have to hurry . Quickly he made his way back to the patio . Patricia Traymore had left the living-room lights on and he could see the strong new locks on the French doors . Even if he cut a pane he would not be able to get in . He had anticipated that and had planned what he would do . There was an elm tree next to the patio , one that would be easy to climb . A thick branch ran just under an upstairs window . The night he left the doll he 'd noticed that window was not completely closed at the top . It sagged as though it did n't hang properly . It would be easy to force it open . A few minutes later he was stepping over the sill onto the floor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cautiously he turned on his flashlight . The room was empty and he opened the door to the hallway . He was sure he was alone in the house . Where should he begin searching ?  |p122He  'd gone to so much trouble because of the doll . He 'd almost been caught taking the vial of blood from the lab in the nursing home . He 'd forgotten how much Glory loved her doll , how when he 'd tiptoe into her room just to see if she was sleeping peacefully , she 'd always had the doll clutched in her arms . It was incredible to him that for the second time in a week he was inside this house again . The memory of that long ago morning was still so vivid : the ambulance , lights flashing , sirens blazing , tires screeching in the driveway . The sidewalk crowded with people , neighbors with coats thrown over expensive bathrobes ; police cars barricading N Street ; cops everywhere . A woman screaming . She was the housekeeper who 'd found the bodies . He and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A young cop was on guard at the door . " Do n't hurry . They do n't need you . " The man lying on his back , the bullet in his temple , must have died instantly . The gun was between him and the woman . She had pitched forward and the blood from the chest wound stained the rug around her . Her eyes were still open , staring , unfocused , as though she 'd wondered what had happened , how it had happened . She could n't have been more than thirty . Her dark hair was scatteredover her shoulders . Her thin face had delicate nostrils and high cheekbones . A yellow silk robe billowed around her like an evening gown . He 'd been the first to bend over the little girl . Her red hair was so matted with dried blood it had turned auburn ; her right leg was jutting from the flowered nightdress , the bone sticking up in a pyramid . He 'd bent closer . " Alive , " he 'd whispered . Bedlam . I.V . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative ; clamped an oxygen mask on the small , still face ; splinted the shattered leg . He cl helped swathe the head , his fingers soothing her forehead , her hair curling around his fingers . Someone said her name was Kerry . " If it is God 's will , I 'll save you , Kerry , " he 'd whispered . " She ca n't make it , " the intern told him roughly , and pushed him out of the way . The police photographers snapped pictures of the little girl ; of the corpses . Chalk marks on the carpet outlined the positions of the bodies . Even then he 'd felt the house was a place of sin and evil , a place where two innocent flowers , a young woman and her little girl , hadp123been willfully violated . He 'd pointed out the house to Glory once and told her all about that morning . Little Kerry had remained in an intensive-care unit at GeorgetownHospital for two months . He 'd looked in on her as often as he could . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll . He had come to understand that she was not supposed to live and had tried to find a way to deliver her to the Lord . But before he could act , she was moved to a long-term-care facility near Boston , and after a while he read that she 'd died . His sister had had a doll . " Let me help take care of it , " he 'd pleaded . " We 'll pretend it 's sick and I 'll make it well . " His father 's heavy , callused hand had slammed his face . Blood had gushed from his nose . " Make that well , you sissy . " He began to search for Glory 's doll in Patricia Traymore 's bedroom . Opening the closet , he examined the shelves and the floor , but it was n't there . With sullen anger he observed the many expensiveclothes . Silk blouses , and negligees , and gowns , and the kind of suits you see in magazine ads . Glory wore jeans and sweaters most of the time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing home were usually in flannel nightgowns and oversized robes that swaddled their shapeless bodies . One of Patricia Traymore 's robes startled him . It was a brown wool tunic with a corded belt . It reminded him of a monk 's habit . He took it out of the closet and held it against him . Next he investigated the deep bottom drawers of the dresser . The doll was n't there either . If the doll was still in the house it was not in her bedroom . He could n't waste so much time . He glanced into the closets of the empty bedrooms and went downstairs . Patricia Traymore had left the vestibule light on , as well as a lamp in the library and others in the living room  --  she had even left on the lights on tit Christmas tree . She was sinfully wasteful , he thought angrily . It was unfair to use so much energy , when old people could n't even afford to heat their own homes . And the tree was already dry . If a flame touched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ornaments melt . One of the ornaments had fallen from the tree . He picked it up and replaced it . There was really no hiding place in the living room . The library was the last room he searched . The files were locked  --  that 's where she had probably put it . Then he noticed the carton jammed far back under the library table . And somehow he knew.  |p124He  had to tug hard to get the carton out but when he opened it his heart beat joyfully . There was Glory 's precious doll . The apron was gone , but he could n't waste time looking for it . He walked through all the rooms , carefully examining them for signs of his presence . He had n't turned a light on or off or touched a door . He had plenty of experience from his work in the nursing home . Of course if Patricia Traymore looked for the doll , she 'd know that someone had come in . But that carton was pushed far under the table . Maybe she would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the same way he 'd come in  --  from the second story bedroom window . Patricia Traymore did n't use that bedroom ; she probably did n't even glance in it for days at a time . He had entered the house at five-fifteen . The chimes of the church near the college tolled six as he slid down the tree , made his furtive way through the yard and disappeared into the night . The Ambassador 's house was immense . Stark white walls provided a vivid backdrop for his magnificent art collection . Comfortable , richly upholstered couches and antique Georgian tables caught Pat 's eye . A huge Christmas tree decorated with silver ornamentsstood in front of the patio doors . The dining room table was set with an elaborate buffet : caviar and sturgeon , a Virginia ham , turkey en gelee , hot biscuits and salads . Two waiters discreetly refilled the guests ' champagne glasses . Ambassador Cardell , small , trim and whitehaired , welcomed Pat with courtly grace and introduced her to his sister Rowena Van Cleef , who now lived with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Pat , her eyes twinkling . " I 'm only seventy-four ; Edward is eighty-two . " There were some forty other people present . Sotto voce , Lila pointed out the most celebrated to Pat . " The British Ambassador and his wife , Sir John and Lady Clemens ... the French Ambassador . . . Donald Arlen  --  he 's about to be appointed head of the World Bank . . . General Wilkins is the tall man by the mantel  --  he 's taking over the NATO command . . . Senator Whitlock .  --  that 's not his wife with him . .. " She introduced Pat to the neighborhood people . Pat was surprised to discover she was the center of attention . Was there any indication of who might have been responsible for the break-in ? Did n't it seem as though the President was going to appoint Senatorp125Jennings Vice President ? Was the Senator easy to work with ? Did they tape the entire program in advance ? Gina Butterfield , the columnist from The Washington Tribune , had drifted over and was listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so extraordinary that someone broke into your house and left a threatening note , " the columnist observed . " Obviously you did n't take it seriously . " Pat tried to sound offhand . " We all feel it was the work of a crank . I 'm sorry so much was made of it . It really is unfair to the Senator . " The columnist smiled . " My dear , this is Washington . Surely you do n't believe that anything this newsy can be ignored . You seem very sanguine , but if I were in your shoes I 'd be quite upset to find my home broken into and my life threatened . " " Especially in that house , " another volunteered . " Were you told about the Adams murder-suicide there ? " Pat stared at the bubbles in her champagne glass . " Yes , I 'd heard the story . But it was so long ago , was n't it ? " " Must we discuss that subject ? " Lila broke in . " It is Christmas Eve . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Adams . CongressmanAdams . Do you mean that Pat is living in the house where he killed himself ? How did the press miss that ? " " What possible connection does it have to the break-in ? " Lila snapped . Pat felt the older woman touch her arm in a warning gesture . Was her expression revealing too much ? The Ambassador stopped at their group . " Please , help yourselves to some supper , " he urged . Pat turned to follow him , but the columnist 's question to another guest stopped her . " You were living here in Georgetown at the time of the deaths ? " " Yes , indeed , " the woman answered . " Just two houses down from them . My mother was alive then . We knew the Adams couple quite well . " " That was before I came to Washington , " Gina Butterfield explained , " but of course I heard all the rumors . Is it true there was a lot more to the case than came out ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted in a crafty smile . " Renee 's mother , Mrs. Schuyler , played the grande dame in Boston . She told the press that Renee had realized her marriage was a mistake and planned to divorce Dean Adams . "  | " Pat , shall we get something to eat ? " Lila 's arm urged her away . " Was n't she getting the divorce ? " Gina asked . " I doubt it , " the other snapped . " She was insane about Dean , crazy jealous of him , resentful of his work . A real dud at parties . Never opened her mouth . And the way she 'd practice that damn piano eight hours a day . In warm weather we all went wild listening to it . And believe me , she was no Myra Hess . Her playing was altogether pedestrian . " I wo n't believe this , Pat thought . I do n't want to believe it . What was the columnist asking now ? Something about Dean Adams ha ing a reputation as a womanizer ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " The neighbor shrugged her shoulders . " I was only twenty-three then , and I had a huge crush on him . He used to walk with little Kerry in the evening . I made it my business to bump into them regularly , but it did n't do me any good . I think we 'd better get on that buffet line . I 'm starved . " " Was Congressman Adams visibly unstable ? " Gina asked . " Of course not . Renee 's mother started that talk . She knew what she was doing . Remember , both their fingerprints were on the gun . My mother and I always thought that Renee was probably the one who flipped and shot up the place . And as far as what happened to Kerry . . . Listen , those bony pianist 's hands were mighty power full I would n't have put it past her to have hit that poor child that night . "  |p127km  sipped a light beer as he stared aimlessly across the crowd at the Palm Springs Racquet Club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . Karen had inherited her mother 's coloring ; ber deep tan only made her blond hair seem that much lighter . Her band rested on her husband 's arm . Thomas Walton Snow , Jr. , was a very nice fellow , Sam thought . A good husband ; a successful businessman . His family was too boringly social for Sam 's taste , but he was happy that his daughter had married well . Since his arrival , Sam had been introduced to several extremely attractive women in their early forties  --  widows , grass widows , careertypes , each ready to select a man for the rest of her life . All of this only caused Sam to feel a cumulative restlessness , an inability to settle down , an aching , pervasive sense of not belonging . Where in the merry hell did he belong ? In Washington . That was where . It was good to be with Karen , but he simply did n't give a damn about the rest of the people she found so intensely satisfying . My child is twenty-four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's expecting a baby . I do n't want to be introduced to all the eligible forty-plus women in Palm Springs . " Daddy , will you please stop scowling ? " Karen leaned across the table , kissed him and then settled back with Tom 's arm around her . He surveyed the bright , expectant faces of Tom 's family . In another day or so they 'd start to get fed up . He 'd become a difficult guest . " Sweetheart , " he said to Karen , making his voice confidential . " You asked me if you thought the President would appoint Senator Jennings Vice President , and I said I did n't know . I should be more honest . I think she 'll get it . "  |p128All  eyes were suddenly focused on him . " Tomorrow night the Senator is having a Christmas supper party at her home ; you 'll see some of it on the television program . She 'd like me to be there . If you do n't mind , I think I should attend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timetable . If Sam left L.A. the next morning on the 8 A.M. flight , he 'd be at National Airport by four-thirty East Coast time . How interesting to be a guest at the televised dinner party . Everyone was looking forward to the program . Only Karen was quiet . Then , laughing , she said , " Daddy , cut the baloney . I 've heard the rumors that Senator Jennings has her eye on you ! "  |p129At  nine-fifteen , Pat and Lila walked silently together from the Ambassador'sparty . It was only when they were within reach of their own houses that Lila said quietly , " Pat , I ca n't tell you how sorry I am . " How much of what that woman said was true and how much was exaggeration ? I must know . " Phrases kept running through her mind : neurotic . . . long , bony fingers ... womanizer ... We think she hit that poor kid ... " I really need to know how much is true , " she repeated . " Pat , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing when she started to talk about the background of the house with that woman from The Washington Tribune . " " She was mistaken , of course , " Pat said tonelessly . " Mistaken ? " They were at Lila 's gate . Pat looked across the street at her own house . Even though she 'd left several lights burning downstairs , it still seemed remote and shadowy . " You see , there 's one thing that I 'm quite sure I remember . When I ran through the foyer into the living room that night I tripped over my mother 's body . " She turned to Lila . " So you see what that gets me : a neurotic mother who apparently found me a nuisance and a father who went berserk and tried to kill me . Quite a heritage , is n't it ? " Lila did n't answer . The sense of foreboding that had been naggingat her was becoming acute . " Oh , Kerry , I want to help you . " Pat pressed her hand . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good night . " In the library , the red button on the answering machine was flashing . Pat rewound the tape . There was a single call on the unit.  | " This is Luther Pelham . It is now seven-twenty . We have a crisis . No matter what time you get in , call me at Senator Jennings ' home , 703 / 555-0143 . It is imperative that we meet there tonight . " Her mouth suddenly dry , Pat phoned the number . It was busy . It took three more attempts before she got through . Toby answered . " This is Pat Traymore , Toby . What 's wrong ? " " Plenty . Where are you ? " " At home . " " All right . Mr. Pelham has a car standing by to pick you up . It should be there in ten minutes . " " Toby , what 's wrong ? " " Miss Traymore , maybe that 's something you 're going to have to explain to the Senator . " He hung up . A half-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in front of Senator Jennings ' home in McLean . On the drive over , Pat had worried herself with endless suppositions , but all her thoughts led to the same chilling conclusion : something had happened to further upset or embarrass the Senator , and whatever it was , she was being blamed . A grim-faced Toby opened the door and led her into the library . Silent shapes were seated around the table in a council of war , the atmosphere oddly at variance with the poinsettia plants flanking the fireplace . Senator Jennings , icy calm , her sphinxlike expression cast in marble , stared through Pat . Philip was to the Senator 's right , his long , thin strands of colorless hair no longer combed carefully over his oval skull . Luther Pelham 's cheekbones were mottled purple . He appeared to be on the verge of a stroke . This is n't a trial , Pat thought . It 's an inquisition . My guilt has already been decided . But for what ? Without offering her a seat , Toby dropped his heavy bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pat said , " something is terribly wrong and it 's quite evident it has to do with me . Will someone please tell me what 's going on ? " There was a newspaper in the middle of the table . With one gesture , Philip flipped it over and pushed it at Pat . " Where did they get that picture ? " he asked coldly . Pat stared down at the cover of The National Mirror . The headlineread : " WILL Miss APPLE JUNCTION BE THE FIRST WOMANp131VEEP ? " The picture , which took up the entire cover , was of Abigail in her Miss Apple Junction crown standing with her mother . Enlarged , the picture revealed even more cruelly the massive dimensions of Francey Foster . Bulging flesh strained against the splotchy print of her badly cut dress . The arm around Abigail was dimpled with fat ; the proud smile only emphasized the doublechinnedface . " You 've seen this picture before , " Philip snapped . " Yes . " How horrible for the Senator , she thought . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years trying to put Apple Junction behind her . Ignoring the others , Pat addressed the Senator directly . " Surely you ca n't believe I had anything to do with the Mirror getting this picture ? " " Listen , Miss Traymore , " Toby answered , " do n't bother lying . I found out that you were snooping around Apple Junction , including digging up back issues of the newspaper . I was at your place the day Saunders called . " There was nothing deferential about Toby now . " I have told the Senator you went to Apple Junction against my explicit orders , " Luther thundered . Pat understood the warning . She was not to let Abigail Jennings know that Luther had acceded to her trip to Abigail 's birthplace . But that did n't matter now . What mattered was Abigail . " Senator , " she began , " I understand how you must feel ... " The effect of her words was explosive . Abigail jumped to her feet . " Do you indeed ? I thought I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated every minute of my life in that stinking town . Luther and Toby have finally gotten around to letting me in on your activitiesup there , so I know you saw Jeremy Saunders . What did that useless leech tell you ? That I had to use the back door and that my mother was the cook ? I 'll bet he did . " I believe you released that picture , Pat Traymore . And I know why . You 're bound and determined you 're going to profile me your way . You like Cinderella stories . In your letters to me you insinuated as much . And when I was bloody fool enough to let myself get talked into this program , you decided that it had to be done your way so everyone could talk about that poignant , moving Patricia Traymore touch . Never mind that it could cost me everything I 've been working for all my life . " " You believe I would send out that picture to somehow further my own career ? " Pat looked from one to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? "  | " Yes , she has . " " How about the alternative storyboard ? " " Forget that one . " " What alternative storyboard ? " Philip demanded . " The one I 've been begging Luther to use  --  and I assure you it has no mention of the first beauty contest or picture from it . Senator , in a way you 're right . I do want to see this production done my way . But for the best possible reason . I have admired you tremendously . When I wrote to you , I did n't know there was any chance that you might soon be appointed Vice President . I was looking ahead and hoping you would be a serious contender for the Presidential nominationnext year . " Pat paused for breath , then rushed on . " I wish you 'd dig out that first letter I sent you . I meant what I said . The one problem you have is that the American public considers you cold and remote . That picture is a good example . Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression on your mother 's face . She 's so proud of you ! She 's fat  --  is that what bothers you ? Millions of people are overweight , and in your mother 's generation a lot more older people were . So if I were you , when you get inquiries , I 'd tell whoever asked me that that was the first beauty contest and you entered because you knew how happy it would make your mother if you won . There is n't a mother in the world who wo n't like you for that . Luther can show you the rest of my suggestions for the show . But I can tell you this . If you 're not appointed Vice President , it wo n't be because of this picture ; it will be because of your reaction to it and your being ashamed of your background . " I 'll ask the driver to take me home , " she said . Then , eyes blazing , she turned to Luther . " You can call me in the morning and let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Senator . " She turned to go . Luther 's voice stopped her . " Toby , get your ass out of that chair and make some coffee . Pat , sit down and let 's start fixing this mess . " It was one-thirty when Pat got home . She changed into a nightgownand robe , made tea , brought it into the living room and curled up on the couch . Staring at the Christmas tree , she reflected on the day . If she accepted what Catherine Graney said , all the talk about the great love between Abigail and Willard Jennings was a lie . If she believed what she had heard at the Ambassador 's party , her mother hadp133been a neurotic . If she believed Senator Jennings , everything JeremySaunders had told her was a twisted complaint . It was he who must have sent the picture of Abigail to the Mirror . It was just the sort of mean-spirited thing he would do . She swallowed the last sip of tea and got up . There was no use trying to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she reached for the switch to turn off the lights , then paused . When she and Lila were having sherry , she thought she 'd noticed that one of the ornaments had slipped from its branch and was lying on the floor . My mistake , she thought . She shrugged and went to bed . Jp134At nine-fifteen on Christmas morning , Toby was standing at the stove in Abigail Jennings ' kitchen waiting for the coffee to perk . He hoped that he 'd be able to have a cup himself before Abby ap peared . True , he 'd known her since they were kids , but this was one day he could n't predict what her mood was likely to be . Last night had been some mess . There 'd been only two other times he 'd seen her so upset , and he never let himself think of either of them . After Pat Traymore left , Abby and Pelham and Phil had sat around for another hour still trying to decide what to do . Or , rather Abby had shouted at Pelham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Traymore was working for Claire Lawrence , that maybe Pelham was too . Even for her , Abigail had gone pretty far , and Toby was amazed that Pelham had taken it . Later Phil supplied the answer : " Listen , he 's the biggest TV news personality in the country . He 's made millions . But he 's sixty years old , and he 's bored stiff . Now he wants to be another Edward R. Murrow . Murrow capped his career as head of the U.S. Information Agency . Pelham wants that job so bad he can taste it . Tremendous prestige and no more competing for ratings . The Senator will deliver for him if he delivers for her . He knows she 's got a right to scream about the way this program is going . " Toby had to agree with what Pelham said . Like it or not , the damage was done . Either the program was produced from the angle of including Apple Junction and the beauty contests or it would seem like a farce . " You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Mirror , " Pelham kept telling Abby . 66It 's read by four million people and handed away to God knows how many more . That picture isp135going to be reprinted by every sensational newspaper in this country . You 've got to decide what you 're going to tell them about it . " " Tell them ? " Abby had stormed . " I 'll tell them the truth : my father was a lush and the only decent thing he ever did was die when I was six . Then I can say that my fat mother had the viewpoint of a scullery maid and her highest ambition for me was that I 'd be Miss Apple Junction and a good cook . Do n't you think that 's exactly the background a Vice President is supposed to have ? " She had cried tears of rage . Abigail was no crybaby . Toby could remember only those few occasions ... . He had said his piece . " Abby , listen to me . You 're stuck with Francey 's picture , so get your act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That had calmed her down . She trusted him . He heard Abby 's steps in the hall . He was anxious to see what she 'd be wearing . Pelham had agreed that she should show up at Christmas services at the Cathedral and wear something photogenicbut not too luxurious . " Leave your mink home , " he 'd said . " Good morning , Toby . Merry Christmas . " The tone was sarcastic but under control . Even before he turned around he knew Abby had recovered her cool . " Merry Christmas , Senator . " He swung around . " Hey , you look great . " She was wearing a double-breasted bright red walking suit . The coat came to her fingertips . The skirt was pleated . " Like one of Santa 's helpers , " she snapped . But even though she sounded crabby , there was a sort of joke in her voice . She picked up her cup and held it out in a toast . " We 're going to bring this one off too , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " They were waiting for her at the Cathedral . As soon as Abigail got out of the car , a television correspondent held up a microphone to her . " Merry Christmas , Senator . " " Merry Christmas , Bob . " Abby was smart , Toby reflected . She made it her business to know all the press and TV people , no matter how unimportant they were . " Senator , you 're about to go into Christmas services at the NationalCathedral . Is there a special prayer you 'll be offering ? " Abby hesitated just long enough . Then she said , " Bob , I guessp136we 're all praying for world peace , are n't we ? And after that nr ' prayer is for the hungry . Would n't it be wonderful if we knew tha every man , woman and child on this earth would be eating a goo , I dinner tonight ? " She smiled and joined the people streaming ' through the portal of the Cathedral . Toby got back into the car . Terrific , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out the racing charts . The ponies had n't been too good to him lately . It was about time his luck changed . The service lasted an hour and fifteen minutes . When the Senator came out another reporter was waiting for her . This one had some hard questions to ask . " Senator , have you seen The National MirroI cover this week ? " Toby had just gotten around the car to open the door . He held his breath , waiting to see how she 'd handle herself . Abby smiled  --  a warm , happy smile . " Yes , indeed . " " What do you think of it , Senator ? " Abby laughed . " I was astonished . I must say I 'm more used to being mentioned in the Congressional Record than in The National Mirror . " " Did the appearance of that picture upset or anger you , Sena tor ? " " Of course not . Why should it ? I suppose that , like most of us , oil holidays I think about the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That picture made me remember how happy my mother was when I won that contest . I entered it to please her . She was wid owed , you know , and brought me up alone . We were very , very close . " Now her eyes became moist , her lips trembled . Quickly she bent her head and got into the car . With a decisive snap , Toby closed the door behind her . The recorder light was blinking when Pat returned from the morning service . Automatically she pressed the rewind button until the tape screeched to a halt , then switched to playback . The first three calls were disconnects . Then Sam came on , his voice edgy . " Pat , I 've been trying to reach you . I 'm just boarding a plane for D.C. See you at Abigail 's this evening . " How loving can you get ? Sam had planned to spend the week with Karen and her husband . And now he 's rushing home . Abigailp137had obviously summoned him to be one of her close and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them ! Abigail was eight years older , but did n't look it . Plenty of men married older women . Luther Pelham had also phoned . " Continue to work on the secondversion of the storyboard . Be at the Senator 's home at four P.m . If you are called by newspapers about the Mirror picture , claim you have n't seen it . " The next message began in a soft , troubled voice : " Miss Traymore  --  er , Pat  --  you may not remember me . A pause . Of course you will ; it 's just you meet so many people , do n't you ? Pause . I must hurry . This is Margaret Langley . I am the principal ... retired , of course ... of Apple Junction High School . " The message time had run out . Exasperated , Pat bit her lip . Miss Langley had called back . This time she said hurriedly , " To continue , please call me at 518/ 555-2460 . " There were sounds of tremulous breathing . Then Miss Langley burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " The phone rang only once before Miss Langley answered . Pat identified herself and was interrupted immediately . " Miss Traymore , after all these years I 've heard from Eleanor . Just as I came in from church the phone was ringing and she said hello in that sweet , shy voice and we both started to cry . " " Miss Langley , where is Eleanor ? What is she doing ? " There was a pause ; then Margaret Langley spoke carefully , as though trying to choose exactly the right words . " She did n't tell me where she is . She said she is much better and does n't want to be hiding forever . She said she is thinking of turning herself in . She knows she 'll go back to jail  --  she did violate her parole . She said that this time she 'd like me to visit her . " " Turning herself in ! " Pat thought of the stunned , helpless face of Eleanor Brown after her conviction . " What did you tell her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you might be able to get her parole reinstated . " Now Margaret Langley 's voice broke . " Miss Traymore , please do n't let that girl go back to prison . " " I 'll try , " Pat promised . " I have a friend , a Congressman , who will help . Miss Langley , please , for Eleanor 's sake , do you know where I can reach her ? " " No , honestly , I do n't . " " If she calls back , beg her to contact me before she surrenders . Her bargaining position will be so much stronger . "  | " I knew you 'd want to help : I knew you were a good person . " Now Margaret Langley 's tone changed . " I want you to know how happy I am that that nice Mr. Pelham phoned and invited me to be on your program . Someone is coming to interview and tape me tomorrow morning . " So Luther had taken that suggestion too . " I 'm so glad . " Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Eleanor to call me . " She lowered the receiver slowly . If Eleanor Brown was the timid girl Miss Langley believed her to be , turning herself in would be a tremendous act of courage . But for Abigail Jennings , it could be mortally embarrassing if , in the next few days , a vulnerable young woman was marched back to prison still protesting her innocence of the theft from Abigail 's office.  |p139As  he walked down the corridor of the nursing home , Arthur sensed the tension and was immediately on guard . The place seemed peaceful enough . Christmas trees and Hanukkah candles stood on card tables covered with felt and make-believe snow . All the doors of the patients ' rooms had greeting cards taped to them . Christmas music was playing on the stereo in the recreation room . But something was wrong . " Good morning , Mrs. Harnick . How are you feeling ? " She was advancing slowly down the hall on her walker , her birdlike frame bent over , her hair scraggly around her ashen face . She looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , sunken , watery , afraid . " Stay away from me , Arthur , " she said , her voice aquiver . " I told them you came out of Anita 's room , and I know I 'm right . " He touched Mrs. Harnick 's arm , but she shrank away . " Of course I was in Mrs. Gillespie 's room , " he said . " She and I were friends . " " She was n't your friend . She was afraid of you . " He tried not to show his anger . " Now , Mrs. Harnick ... " " I mean what I say . Anita wanted to stay alive . Her daughter , Anna Marie , was coming to see her . She had n't been East for two years . Anita said she did n't care when she died as long as she saw her Anna Marie again . She did n't just stop breathing . I told them that . " The head nurse , Elizabeth Sheehan , sat at a desk halfway down the corridor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-gray eyes that could turn steel gray when she was angry . " Arthur , before you make your rounds please come to the office . " He followed her into the business office of the nursing home , the place where families would come to make arrangements to jettison their old people . But today there were n't any relatives , only a baby/faced young man in a raincoat with shoes that needed a shine . He had a pleasant smile and a very warm manner , but Arthur was n't fooled . " I 'm Detective Barrott , " he said . The superintendent of the home , Dr. Cole , was also there . " Arthur , sit down , " he said , trying to make his voice friendly . " Thank you , Nurse Sheehan ; you need n't wait . " Arthur chose a straight chair and remembered to fold his hands in his lap and look just a little puzzled , as though he had no idea what was going on . He 'd practiced that look in front of the mirror . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrott said . Arthur nodded and made his expression regretful . He was suddenlyglad he 'd met Mrs. Harnick in the hall . " I know . I was so hoping she 'd live just a little longer . Her daughter was coming to visit her and she had n't seen her for two years . " " You knew that ? " Dr. Cole asked . " Of course . Mrs. Gillespie told me . " " I see . We did n't realize she 'd discussed her daughter 's visit . " " Doctor , you know how long it took to feed Mrs. Gillespie . Sometimesshe 'd need to rest and we 'd just talk . " " Arthur , were you glad to see Mrs. Gillespie die ? " Detective Barrott asked . " I 'm glad she died before that cancer got much worse . She would have been in terrible pain . Is n't that right , Doctor ? " He looked at Dr. Cole now , making his eyes wide . " It 's possible , yes , " Dr. Cole said unwillingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish Mrs. Gillespie had lived to see Anna Marie . She and I used to pray over that . She used to ask me to read prayers from her Saint Anthony Missal for a special favor . That was her prayer . " Detective Barrott was studying him carefully . " Arthur , did you visit Mrs. Gillespie 's room last Monday ? " " Oh , yes , I went in just before Nurse Krause made her rounds . But Mrs. Gillespie did n't want anything . " " Mrs. Harnick said she saw you coming out of Mrs. Gillespie 's room at about five of four . Is that true ? " Arthur had figured out his answer . " No , I did n't go in her room . I looked in her room , but she was asleep . She 'd had a bad night and I was worried about her . Mrs. Harnick saw me look in . " Dr. Cole leaned back in his chair . He seemed relieved.  |p141Detective  Barrott 's voice got softer . " But the other day you said Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if I 'd gone into Mrs. Gillespie 's room twice . I had n't . But then , when I thought about it , I remembered I 'd looked in . So Mrs. Harnick and I were both right , you see . " Dr. Cole was smiling now . " Arthur is one of our most caring helpers , " he said . " I told you that , Mr. Barrott . " But Detective Barrott was n't smiling . " Arthur , do many of the orderlies pray with the patients or is it just you ? " " Oh , I think it 's just me . You see , I was in a seminary once . I was planning to become a priest but got sick and had to leave . In a way I think of myself as a clergyman . " Detective Barrott 's eyes , soft and limpid , encouraged confidences . " How old were you when you went into that seminary , Arthur ? " he asked kindly . " I was twenty . And I stayed until I was twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detective Barrott said . " Tell me , Arthur , what seminary were you in ? " " I was at Collegeville , Minnesota , with the Benedictine commu-nity . " Detective Barrott pulled out a notebook and wrote that down . Too late Arthur realized he had told too much . Suppose Detective Barrott got in touch with the community and they told that after Father Damian 's death , Arthur had been requested to leave . Arthur worried about that all day . Even though Dr. Cole told him to go back to work , he could feel the suspicious glances from Nurse Sheehan . All the patients were looking at him in a peculiar way . When he went to look in on old Mr. Thoman , his daughter was there and she said , " Arthur , you do n't have to worry about my dad anymore . I 've asked Nurse Sheehan to appoint another orderly to help him . " It was a slap in the face . Only last week Mr. Thoman had said , " I ca n't put up with feeling so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe God wo n't ask you to , Mr. Thoman . " Arthur tried to keep his smile bright as he crossed the recreation room to help Mr. Whelan , who was struggling to his feet . As he walked Mr. Whelan down the hall to the lavatory and back , he realized that he was getting a headache , one of those blinding ones that made lights dance in front of his eyes . He knew what would happen next . As he eased Mr. Whelan back into his chair , he glanced at thep142television set . The screen was all cloudy and then a face began to form , the face of Gabriel as he would look on Judgment Day . Gabriel spoke only to him . " Arthur , you are not safe here anymore . " " I understand . " He did n't know he 'd said the words out loud until Mr. Whelan said , " Shhh . " When he went down to his locker , Arthur carefully packed Ins personal effects but left his extra uniform and old shoes . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize he would n't return on Thursday morning unless for some reason they searched his locker and found it empty . He put on his sports jacket , the brown-and-yellow one he 'd bought at J. C. Penney 's last year . He kept it here so that if he was meeting Glory for a movie or something , he could look nice . In the pocket of his raincoat he put the pair of socks that has l three hundred dollars stuffed in the toes . He always kept emer gency money available , both here and at home , just in case he had to leave suddenly . The locker room was cold and dingy . There was no one around . They 'd given the day off to as many of the staff as possible . He had volunteered to work . His hands were restless and dry ; his nerves were screaming with resentment . They had no right to treat him like this . Restlessly his eyes roamed around the barren room . Most of the supplies were locked up in the big storage room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . It was filled with opened bottles and cans ( ; f cleaning agents and unwashed dust rags . He thought of those pee ple upstairs  --  Mrs. Harnick accusing him , Mr. Thoman 's daughter telling him to stay away from her father , Nurse Sheehan . How dared they whisper about him , question him , reject him ! In the closet he found a half-empty can of turpentine . He loos ened the cap , then turned the can on its side . Drops of turpentine began to drip onto the floor . He left the closet door open . Right next to it , a dozen bags of trash were piled together waiting to be carried out to the dump site . Arthur did n't smoke , but when visitors left packs of cigarettes around the nursing home , he always picked them up for Glory . Now he took a Salem from his pocket , lit it , puffed until he was sure it would n't go out , unfastened the tie on one of the trash bags an() dropped it in . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole bag would catch fire ; then the other bags would go , and thep143dripping turpentine would cause the fire to burn out of control . The tags in the closet would cause dense smoke , and by the time the staff tried to get the old people out , the whole building would be gone . It would seem to be a careless accident  --  an ignited cigarette in the trash ; a fire caused by an overturned can of turpentine that had dripped from the shelf if the investigators could even piece that much together . He retied the bag as the faint , good burning smell made his tostrils quiver and his loins tighten , then hurried from the building and down the lonely street toward the Metro . Glory was on the couch in the living room reading a book when Arthur got home . She was wearing a very pretty blue wool houseCoat , with a zipper that came up to her neck and long , full sleeves . The book she was reading was a novel on the best-seller list that had cost $15.95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar for a book . He and Glory would go to secondhand stores and browse and come home with six or seven titles . And it was their pleasure to sit companionably reading . But somehow the dog-eared volumes with the stained covers that they had delighted in purchasing deemed poor and shabby next to this book with the shiny jacket and crisp new pages . The girls in the office had given it to her . Glory had fixed a roast chicken for him , and cranberry sauce and hot muffins . But it was no pleasure eating Christmas dinner alone . She 'd said she was n't hungry . She seemed to be thinking so deeply . Several times he caught her staring at him , her eyes questioning and troubled . They reminded him of the way Mrs. Harnick had looked at him , He did n't want Glory to be afraid of him . " I have a present for you , " he told her . 66I know you 'll like it . " Yesterday , at the big discount store in the mall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann doll , and except for a few spots on the dress , the doll looked just the same . And he 'd bought Christmas paper and wrappings and made it look like a real present . " And I have a present for you , Father . " They exchanged the gifts solemnly . " You open first , " he said . He wanted to see her expression . She 'd be so happy . " All right . " She smiled , and he noticed that her hair seemed lighter . Was she coloring it ? She untied the ribbon carefully , pushed back the paper , and the frilly apron showed first . " What . . . oh , Father . " She was startled . " You found her . What a pretty new apron , " She looked pleased , butp144not as exquisitely happy as he 'd expected . Then her face became very thoughtful . " Look at that poor , sad face . And that 's the way I thought of myself I remember the day I painted it . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her to bed with you again ? " he asked . " That 's why you wanted her , is n't it ? " " Oh , no . I just wanted to look at her . Open your present . It will make you happy , I think . " It was a handsome blue-and-white wool sweater with a V-neck and long sleeves . " I knitted it for you , Father , " Glory told him happily . " Would you believe I finally was able to stick with somethingand finish it ? I guess I 'm getting my act together . It 's about time , do n't you think ? " " I like you just as you are , " he said . " I like taking care of you . " " But pretty soon it may be impossible , " she said . They both knew what she meant . It was time to tell her . " Glory , " he said carefully . " Today I was asked to do something very special . There are a number of nursing homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of help I can give to very sick patients . They want me to go there right away and select one of them to work in . " " Move ? Again ? " She looked dismayed . " Yes , Glory . I do God 's work , and now it 's my turn to ask for your help . You 're a great comfort to me . We will leave Thursday mornig " He was sure he 'd be safe until then . At the very least , the fire would have caused great confusion . At best , his personnel records might be destroyed . But even if the fire was put out before it burned the place down , it would probably be at least a few days before the police could check his references and find the long gaps between employment , or learn the reason he 'd been asked to leave the seminary . By the time that detective wanted to question him again , he and Glory would be gone . For a long time Glory was silent . Then she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , I 'm going to turn myself in . People all over the country will see it , and I ca n't go on any longer wondering if someone is staring at me because he or she knows who I am . Otherwise I will go with you to Tennessee . " Her lip quivered , and he knew she was near tears . He went to her and patted her cheek . He could not tell Glory thatVp145only reason he was waiting until Thursday to go away was cause of that program . Father , " Glory burst out , " I 've started to be happy here . I do n't nk it 's fair the way they expect you to just pick up and go all thep146At 1:30 P.M. Lila rang Pat 's doorbell . She was carrying a small package . " Merry Christmas ! " " Merry Christmas . Come in . " Pat was genuinely pleased by the visit . She had been trying to decide whether or not to confide in Luther that Eleanor might turn herself in to the police . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? The prospect of a lawsuit would send him into orbit. 66I wo n't stay but a minute , " Lila said . " I just wanted to give you some fruitcake . It 's a specialty of mine . " Pat hugged her impulsively . L6I 'm glad you did come . It 's terribly odd to be so quiet on Christmas afternoon . How about a glass of sherry ? " Lila looked at her watch . " 1 ' 11 be out of here by quarter of two , " she announced . Pat led her back to the living room ; got a plate , a knife and glasses ; poured the sherry and cut thin slices of the cake . " Marvelous , " she pronounced after sampling it . " It is good , is n't it ? " Lila agreed . Her eyes darted around the living room . " You 've changed something in here . " " I switched a couple of paintings . I realized they were in the wrong place . " " How much is coming back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was in the library working . Then somethingjust made me come in here . As soon as I did , I knew that the still life and the landscape should be reversed . " " What else , Pat ? There 's more . " 66I 'm so darn edgy , " Pat said simply . " And I do n't know why . " 66Pat , please do n't stay here . Move to an apartment , a hotel . " Lila clasped her hands imploringly.  | " I ca n't , " Pat said . " But help me now . Were you ever in here on Christmas Day ? What was it like ? " " That last year , you were three and a half and able to really understand Christmas . They were both so delighted with you . It was a day of genuine happiness . " " I sometimes think I remember a little of that day . I had a walking doll and was trying to make it walk with me . Could that have been t rue ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My mother played the piano that afternoon , did n't she ? " " Yes . " Pat walked over to the piano , opened it . " Do you remember what she played that Christmas ? " " I 'm sure it was her favorite Christmas carol . It 's called Bells of Christmas . ' " " I know it . Veronica wanted me to learn it . She said my grandmotherloved it . " Slowly her fingers began to run over the keys . Lila watched and listened . When the last notes faded away , she said , " That was very much like your mother playing . I told you you resemble your father , but I never realized until this minute how startling the resemblance is . Somebody who knew him well is bound to make the connection . " At three o'clock the television crew from Potomac Cable Networkarrived at Senator Jennings ' house to tape her Christmas supper . Toby watched them with a hawk 's eye as they set up in the living and dining rooms , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew how much everything in the place meant to Abby . Pat Traymore and Luther Pelham came within a minute or two of each other . Pat was wearing a white wool dress that showed off her figure . Her hair was twisted in a kind of bun . Toby had never seen her wear it like that . It made her look different and yet familiar . Who the hell did she remind him of ? Toby wondered . She seemed relaxed , but you could tell Pelham was n't . As soon as he walked in , he started snapping at one of the cameramen . Abigail was uptight , and that did n't help either . Right away she tangled with Traymore . Pat wanted to set the food out on the buffet table and tape the Senator inspecting it and making little changes in the way it was placed . Abigail did n't want to put the food out so early.  | " Senator , it takes time to get exactly the feeling we want , " Pat told her . " It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are standing around watching . " " I wo n't have my guests standing around like extras in a B movie , " Abigail snapped . " Then I suggest we photograph the table now . " Toby noticed that Pat did n't back down when she wanted some thing done . Luther remarked that Abigail had prepared all the food herself , and that was another hassle . Pat wanted a shot of her in the kitchen working . " Senator , everybody thinks you just phone a caterer when you have a party . That you actually do everything yourself will endear you to all the women who are stuck preparing three meals a day , to say nothing of the men and women whose hobby is cooking . " Abigail flatly rejected the idea , but Pat kept insisting . " Senator , the whole purpose of our being here is to make people see you as a human being . " In the end it was Toby who persuaded Abigail to go along . " Come on , show them you 're a regular Julia Child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apron over her designer shirt and slacks , but when she began to put hors d'oeuvre together , she made it clear she was a gourmet cook . Toby watched as she rolled batter for pastry shells , chopped ham for quiche , seasoned crabmeat , those long , slender fingers working miraculously . No messy kitchen for Abby . Well , you had to give a tip of the hat to Francey Foster for that . Once the crew started taping , Abigail began to relax . They had done only a couple of takes when Pat said , " Senator , thank you . I 'm sure we have what we want . That came over very well . Now , if you do n't mind changing to whatever you 're planning to wear at the party , we can get the footage at the table . " Toby was anxious to see what Abigail would wear . She 's been hemming and hawing between a couple of outfits . He was pleased when she came back , wearing a yellow satin blouse that matched the yellow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face and neck . Her eye makeup was heavier than usual . She looked stunning . Besides , she had a glow about her . Toby knew why . Sam Kingsley had phoned to say he 'd be at the party . There was no question Abby had set her cap for Sam Kingsley . Toby had n't missed the way she 'd suggested to her friends that they put Sam next to her at dinner parties . There was something aboutp149Mm that reminded Toby of Billy , and of course that was the big attraction for Abby . She 'd put on a good show in public , but she 'd been a basket case when Billy died . Toby knew Sam did n't like him , But that was n't a problem Sam would n't last any longer than the others had , Abby was too domineeringfor most men . Either they got sick of adjusting to her schedule and moods , or if they knuckled under , she got sick of thorn . He , Toby , would be part of Abby 's life until one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without him , and she knew it . As he watched her posing at the buffet table , a tinge of regret made him swallow hard . Every once in a while he daydreamed about how it would have been if he 'd been smart in school instead of Just having the smarts ; if he 'd gone on to become an engineer instead of a jack-of-all-trades . And if he 'd been good-looking like that wimp Jeremy Saunders , instead of rough-faced and burly  --  well , who knew ? Somewhere along the line , Abby might have fallen for him . He dismissed the thought and got back to work . Promptly at five the first car drove up . The retired Supreme Court Justice and his wife entered a minute or two later . " Merry Christmas , Madam Vice President , " the justice said . Abigail returned his kiss warmly . " From your lips to God 's ear , " she laughed . Other guests began to flow in . Hired waiters poured champagne and punch . " Keep the hard stuff for later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to be reminded that its public officials serve booze . " Sam was the last to arrive . Abigail opened the door for him . Her kiss on his cheek was affectionate . Luther was directing the other camera toward them . Pat felt her heart sink . Sam and Abigail made a stunning couple -- both tall , her ash blond hair contrasting with his dark head , the streaks of gray in his hair a subtle balance to the fine lines around her eyes . Pat could see everyone clustering around Sam . I only think about him as Sam , she thought . I 've never seen him in his professional clement . Was that the way it had been with her mother and father ? They 'd met when they were both vacationing on Martha 's Vineyard . They 'd married within a month , never really knowing or understanding each other 's worlds  --  and then the clash had begun . Except I would n't clash with you , Sam . I like your world.  |p150Abigail  must have said something amusing ; everyone laughed . Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pat , " the cameraman said . " A little sexy  --  you know what I mean ? You never see Senator Jennings with a gull People like that . " The cameraman was beaming . " All the world loves a lover , " Pat replied . " We 've got enough , " Luther suddenly announced . " Let the Sena tor and her guests have some peace . Pat , you be at the Senator 's office for the taping in the morning . I 'll be in Apple Junction . You know what we need . " He turned his back , dismissing her . Did his attitude result from the picture in the Mirror or from her refusal to sleep with him ? Only time would tell . She slipped past the guests , down the hallway and into the den , where she 'd left her coat . " Pat . " She turned around . " Sam ! " He was standing in the doorway , looking at her . " Ah , Congressman . Season 's greetings . " She reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No one invited me to stay . " He came over , took the coat from her . " What 's this about tlu . Mirror cover ? " She told him . " And it seems the senior Senator from Virginia believes I slipped that picture to that rag just to get my way about this program . " He put his hand on her shoulder . " You did n't ? " " That sounds like a question ! " Could he really believe she 'd had anything to do with the Mirror cover ? If so , he did n't know her at all . Or maybe it was time she realized that the man she thought slue knew did n't exist . " Pat , I ca n't leave yet , but I should be able to get away in an hour . Are you going home ? " " Yes , I am . Why ? " " I 'll be there as soon as I can . I 'll take you to dinner . " " All the decent restaurants will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull away from him . " Miss Traymore , if you give me your keys , I 'll bring your carp151guests in to supper , Congressman , and told me to round them up . the particularly told me to look for you . " Sam was still holding Pat 's coat . She reached for it . " I can get my own car , Toby , " she said . She looked at him directly . He was standing in the doorway , a large , dark mass . She tried to pass him , but he did n't move . " May I ? " Ile was staring at her , his expression distracted . " Oh , sure . Sorry . " He stepped aside , and unconsciously she shrank against the wall to avoid brushing against him . Pat drove at breakneck speed trying to escape the memory of bow warmly Abigail and Sam had greeted each other , of the subtle pray in which the others seemed to treat them as a couple . It was ater to eight when she got home . Grateful that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made a sandwich and poured ataes of wine . The house felt dark and empty . She turned on the hts in the foyer , library , dining room and living room , then plugged in the tree . The other day the living room had somehow seemed warmer , more livable . Now , for some reason , it was uncomfortable , shadowy . Why ? Her eye caught a strand of tinsel almost hidden on a brilliantcot-hued section of the carpet . Yesterday when she and Lilae here , she thought she 'd seen an ornament with a piece of1 lying on this area of the carpet . Perhaps it had been just the . The television set was in the library . She carried the sandwich bpd the wine there . Potomac Cable had hourly news highlights . She wondered if they 'd show Abigail at church . They did . Pat watched dispassionately as Abigail stepped from car , the bright red suit dramatic against her flawless skin and , her eyes soft as she voiced her prayer for the hungry . This was woman Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennings was questioned about her picture as a young ty queen , which is on the cover of this week 's National Mir- . " A postage-stamp-size picture of the Mirror cover was shown . h tears in her eyes the Senator recalled her mother ' . dears to " Good Lord , " Pat cried . Jumping up , she pushed the button t turned off the set . " And Luther has the gall to call that news ! wonder the media are criticized for bias . " Restlessly she began to jot down the conflicting statements had been hearing all week : Catherine Graney said that Abigail and Willard were about divorce . Senator Jennings claims she loved her husband very much . Eleanor Brown stole $75,000 from Senator Jennings . Eleanor Brown swears she did not steal that money . George Graney was a master pilot ; his plane was carefully spected before takeoff . Senator Jennings said George Graney was a careless pilot wi second-rate equipment . Nothing adds up , Pat thought , absolutely nothing ! It was nearly eleven o'clock before the door chimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up on him , Pat had gone to her room , then told herself that if Sam were not coming , he would have called . She changed to silk pajamas that were comfortable f r lounging but technically still suitable for receiving guests . She washed her face , then touched her eyelids lightly with shadow andher lips with gloss . No point looking like a mouse , she thought  --  , ( ( , l when he 'd just left the beauty queen . Swiftly she hung up the clothes she had left scattered over t ho room . Was Sam neat ? I do n't even know that , she thought . The one night they had stayed together certainly had n't been any barome ter of either of their personal habits . When they 'd checked into the r motel she 'd brushed her teeth with the folding toothbrush she always carried in her cosmetic case . " I wish I had one of those , " he 'd said . She 'd smiled up at his reflection in the mirror . " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks  --  Smithy and Paula if they 're so in love they use the same tooth brush . " She ran hers under hot water , spread toothpaste across the bristles and handed it to him . " Be my guest . " That toothbrush was now in a velvet jeweler 's box in the to ri drawer of the vanity . Some women press roses or tie ribbons aroun letters , Pat thought . I kept a toothbrush.  |p153She  had just come down the stairs when the chimes rang again . " Come in , come in , whoever you are , " she said . Sam 's expression was contrite . " Pat , I 'm sorry . I could n't get away as fast as I 'd hoped . And then I cabbed to my place , dropped my bags and picked up my car . Were you on your way to bed ? " " Not at all . If you mean this outfit , its technically called lounging pajamas and , according to the Saks brochure , is perfect for that evening at home when entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends you entertain , " Sam suggested . " That 's a pretty sexy-looking getup . " She took his coat ; the fine wool was still cold from the icy wind . He bent down to kiss her . " Would you like a drink ? " Without waiting for his answer , she led him into the library and silently pointed to the bar . He poured brandy into snifters and handed one to her . " I assume this is still your after-dinner choice ? " She nodded and deliberately chose the fan-back chair across from the couch . Sam had changed when he stopped at his apartment . He was wearing an Argyle sweater with a predominantly blue-and-gray pattern that complemented the blueness of his eyes , the touches of gray in his dark brown hair . He settled on the couch , and it seemed to her there was a weariness in the way he moved and in the lines around his eyes . " How did it go after I left ? " " About as you saw it . We did have one high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merry Christmas . " " The President phoned ! Sam , does that mean ... ? " " My bet is he 's milking this for all it 's worth . He probably phoned Claire Lawrence as well . " " You mean he has n't made his decision ? " " I think he 's still sending up trial balloons . You saw the way he featured Abigail at the White House dinner last week . But he and the First Lady also went to a private supper in Claire 's honor the next night . " " Sam , how badly did that Mirror cover hurt Senator Jennings ? " He shrugged . " Hard to say . Abigail has done the **25;12934;TOOLONG a little too heavily for a lot of people around here . On the other hand , it just may make her sympathetic . Another problem : that publicity about the threats to you has made for a lot of lockerroomjokes on Capitol Hill  --  and they 're all on Abigail. "  |p154Pat  stared at her untouched brandy . Her mouth suddenly felt dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the break-in . Now he was sharing Abigail 's reaction to the public ity . Well , in a way it made things easier . " If this program causes any more unfavorable publicity to Senator Jennings , could it cost her the Vice Presidency ? " " Perhaps . No President , particularly one who 's had a spotless administration , is going to risk having it tarnished . " " That 's exactly what I was afraid you 'd say . " She told him about Eleanor Brown and Catherine Graney . " I do n't know what to do , " she concluded . " Should I warn Luther to keep away from those subjects on the program ? If I do , he 'll have to tell the Senator the reason . " " There 's no way Abigail can take any more aggravation , " Sam said flatly . " After the others left she was really wired . " " After the others left ! " Pat raised an eyebrow . " You mean you stayed ? " " She asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart sink . It confirmed everything she had been thinking . " Then I should n't tell Luther . " " Try it this way . If that girl ... " " Eleanor Brown . " " Yes  --  if she calls you , persuade her to wait until I see if we can plea-bargain on her parole . In that case there 'd be no publicity , at least until the President announces his selection . " " And Catherine Graney . " " Let me look into the records of that crash . She probably does n't have a leg to stand on . Do you think either one of these women might have made those threats to you ? " " I 've never met Eleanor . I 'm sure it was n't Catherine Graney , And do n't forget it was a man 's voice . " " Of course . He has n't called again ? " Her eyes fell on the carton under the table . She considered , then rejected , the idea of showing the Raggedy Ann doll to Sam . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he has n't . " " That 's good news . " He finished the brandy and set the glass on the table . " I 'd better be on my way . It 's been a long day and.you must be bushed . " It was the opening she was waiting for . " Sam , on the way homep155from the Senator 's tonight , I did some hard thinking . Want to hear about it ? " " Certainly . " " I came to Washington with three specific and rather idealistic goals in mind . I was going to do an Emmy-winning documentary on a wonderful , noble woman . I was going to find an explanation for what my father did to my mother and me . And I was going to see you and it would be the reunion of the century . Well , none of these turned out as I expected . Abigail Jennings is a good politician and a strong leader , but she is n't a nice person . I was suckered into this program because my preconceived notions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved in the industrygives credibility to what is essentially P.R . fluff . There 's so much about that lady that does n't hang together that it frightens me . " I 've also been here long enough to know that my mother was n't a saint , as I 'd been led to believe , and very possibly goaded my father into some form of temporary insanity that night . That 's not the full story  --  not yet ; but it 's close . " And as for us , Sam , I do owe you an apology . I certainly was terribly naive to think that I was anything more to you than a casual affair . The fact that you never called me after Janice died should have been the tip-off , but I guess I 'm not a quick study . You can stop worrying now . I do n't intend to embarrass you with any more declarations of love . It 's very clear you 've got something going with Abigail Jennings . " " I do n't have anything going with Abigail ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know it yet , but you do . That lady wants you , Sam . Anyone with half an eye can see that . And you did n't cut short your vacation and come rushing across the country at her summons without good reason . Just forget about having to let me down easy . Really , Sam , all that talk about being worn out and not able to make decisions is n't very becoming . You can drop it now. , , " I told you that because it 's true . " " Then snap out of it . It does n't become you . You 're a handsome , virile man with twenty or thirty good years ahead of you . " She managed a smile . " Maybe the prospect of becoming a grandfather is a little shocking to your ego . " " Are you finished ? " " Quite . "  | " Then if you do n't mind , I 've overstayed my welcome . " He got up , his face flushed . She reached out her hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small town . That is the reason you called me in the first place , is n't it ? " He did n't answer . With a certain degree of satisfaction , Pat heard him slam the front door as he left.  | " Senator , they 'll probably want you to be anchorwoman on the 7bday show , " Toby volunteered genially . He glanced into the rearview mirror to see Abby 's reaction . They were on their way to the office . At 6:30 A.M. on December 26 it was still dark and boneChilling . " I have no desire to be anchorwoman on the Today show or any Other show , " Abigail snapped . " Toby , what the hell do I look like ? I Dever closed an eye last night . Toby , the President phoned me .. be phoned me personally . He said to have a good rest over the Christmas recess because it was going to be a busy year ahead . What could he have meant by that ? ... Toby , I can taste it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my instincts ? Why did I let Luther Pelham talk me into this program ? Where was my head ? " " Senator , listen . That picture may be the best thing that ever happened to you . It 's for sure that wallflower Claire Lawrence Dever won any contests . Maybe Pat Traymore is right . That kind of makes you more accessible ... is that the word ? " They were going over the Roosevelt Bridge , and traffic was picklogup . Toby concentrated on the driving . When he looked again Into the rearview mirror , Abby 's hands were still in her lap . " Toby , I 've worked for this . " " I know you have , Abby . " " It is n't fair to lose it just because I 've had to claw my way up . " " You 're not going to lose it , Senator . " " I do n't know . There 's something about Pat Traymore that disturbsme . She 's managed to give me two bouts of embarrassing publicity in one week . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator , Phil checked her out . She 's been touting you since shep158was in college . She wrote an essay on you her senior year at Welles ley . She 's on the level . She may be bad luck , but she 's on the level , ' " She 's trouble . I warn you , there 's something else about her . " The car swung past the Capitol and pulled up at the Russell Senate Office Building . " I 'll be right up , Senator , and I promise you , I 'll keep an eye on Pat Traymore . She wo n't get in your way . " He hopped out of the car to open the door for Abby . She accepted his hand , got out , then impulsively squeezed his fingers . " Toby , look at that girl 's eyes . There 's something about them . . . something secretive . . . as though ... " She did n't finish the sentence . But for Toby , it was n't necessary . At six o'clock Philip was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew . Sleepy-eyed guards and cleaning women with weary , patient faces were the only other people in evidence in the Russell building . In Abigail 's office , Pat and the cameramen bent over the storyboard . " We 'll only give three minutes to this segment , " Pat said . " I want the feeling of the Senator arriving at an empty office and starting work before anyone shows up . Then Philip coming in to brief her . . . a shot of her daily calendar , but do n't show the date . . . then office help arriving ; the phones starting ; a shot of the daily mail ; the Senator greeting visitors from her state ; the Senator talking to a constituent ; Phil in and out with the messages . You know what we want  --  a sense of behind-the-scenes in a Senator'sworkday office . " When Abigail arrived , they were ready for her . Pat explained the first shot she wanted , and the Senator nodded and returned to the vestibule . Cameras rolled , and her key turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She slipped off the gray cashmere cape that covered a well-cut but restrained pinstripedgray suit . Even the way she ran her fingers through her hair as she tossed off her hat was natural , the gesture of someone who cares about her appearance but is preoccupied with more importantmatters . " Cut , " Pat said . " Senator , that 's fine , just the feeling I wanted . " Her spontaneous praise sounded patronizing even to her own ears . Senator Jennings ' smile was enigmatic . " Thank you . Now what ? ' Pat explained the scene with the mail , Phil and the constituent , Maggie Sayles . The taping went smoothly . Pat quickly realized that Senator Jen/nings had a natural instinct for presenting herself at the best camera angle . The pin-striped suit gave her an executive , businesslike appearancethat would be a nice contrast to the taffeta skirt at the Christmas supper party . Her earrings were silver ; she wore a silver tie pin , stark and slim against the ascot of a soft gray silk blouse . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot show- ' ing the flags of both the United States and Virginia and then to have only the flag of the United States behind her in close-ups . Pat watched the camera angle in as Abigail carefully selected a letter from the mound of mail on her desk  --  a letter in a childish handwriting . Another touch of theater , Pat thought . How smart of her . Then the constituent , Maggie , came in  --  the one whom Abigail had helped to find a nursing home for her mother . Abigail sprang up to meet her , kissed her affectionately , led her to a chair ... all animation , warmth , concern . She does mean the concern , Pat thought . I was here when she got that woman 's mother into a home ; but there 's so much showmanshipgoing on now . Are all politicians like this ? Am I simply too damn naive ? By ten o'clock they had finished . Having reassured Abigail that they had everything they needed , Pat and the camera crew got ready to leave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pat told the director . " Then go over it with Luther tonight . " " I think it 's going to turn out great , " the cameraman volunteered . " It 's turning into a good show . That much I 'll grant , " Pat said.  |p160Arthur  's night had been filled with dreams of Mrs. Gillespie 's eyes as they 'd started to glaze over . In the morning he was heavy-eyed and tired . He got up and made coffee and would have gone out for rolls , but Glory asked him not to . " I wo n't have any , and after I go to work , you should get some rest . You did n't sleep well , did you ? " " How did you know ? " He sat across from her at the table , watch ing as she perched at the edge of her chair . " You kept calling out . Did Mrs. Gillespie 's death worry you so much , Father ? I know how often you used to talk about her . " A chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him ? What would she say ? Nothing ever to hurt him , but how would she know ? He tried to choose his words carefully . " It 's just I 'm so sad she did n't get to see her daughter before she died . We both wanted that . " Glory gulped her coffee and got up from the table . " Father , I wish you would take some time off and rest . I think you 're working too hard . " " I 'm fine , Glory . What was I saying in my sleep ? " " You kept telling Mrs. Gillespie to close her eyes . What were you dreaming about her ? " Glory was looking at him as if she were almost frightened of him , he thought . What did she know , or guess ? After she had gone , he stared into his cup , worried and suddenly tired . He was restless and decided to go out for a walk . It did n't help . After a few blocks he turned back . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement . A police car was stopped in front of his home . Instinctivelyhe ducked into the doorway of a vacant house and watched from the foyer . Whom did they want ? Glory ? Himself ?  |p161He  would have to warn her . He 'd tell her to meet him somewhere and they 'd go away again . He had the $300 in cash , and he had $622 in Baltimore in a savings account under a different name . They could make that last until he had a new job . It was easy to get work in a nursing home . They were all desperate for orderlies . He slipped along the side of the house , cut through the adjacent yard , hurried to the corner and phoned Glory 's office . She was on another line . " Get her , " he told the girl angrily . " It 's important . Tell her Father says it 's important . " When Glory got on the phone , she sounded impatient . " Father , what is it ? " He told her . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing from her just silence . " Glory ... ? " " Yes , Father . " Her voice was quiet , lifeless . " Leave right now , do n't say anything , act like you 're going to the ladies ' room . Meet me at Metro Central , the Twelfth and G exit . We 'll be gone before they have a chance to put out an alert . We 'll pick up the money at the bank in Baltimore and then go South . " " No , Father . " Now Glory 's voice sounded strong , sure . " I 'm not running anymore . Thank you , Father . You do n't have to run anymorefor me . I 'm going to the police . " " Glory . No . Wait . Maybe it will be all right . Promise me . Not yet . " A police car was cruising slowly down the block . He could not lose another minute . As she whispered , " I promise , " he hung up the phone and ducked into a doorway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands into his pockets and with his stiff , amyielding gait made his way to the Metro station . It was a subdued Abigail who returned to the car at ten-thirty . Toby started to speak , but something told him to keep his mouth shut . Let Abby be the one to decide if she wanted to get things off her chest . " Toby , I do n't feel like going home yet , " Abigail said suddenly , " Take me over to Watergate . I can get a late breakfast there . " " Sure , Senator . " He made his voice hearty , as though the request were not unusual . He knew why Abby had selected that place . Sam Kingsley lived in the same building as the restaurant . The next thing , she 'd probably phone upstairs and if Sam was in , ask him to join her for coffee . Fine , but that had n't been a casual chat in the den between Kingsley and Pat Traymore last night . There was something be/tween those two . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he should tip her off . Glancing over his shoulder , he noticed that Abigail was checking her makeup in her hand mirror . " You look fantastic , Senator , " he said . At the Watergate complex the doorman opened the car door , and Toby noticed the extra-large smile and respectful bow . Hell , there were one hundred Senators in Washington but only one Vice President . I want it for you , Abby , he thought . Nothing will stand in your way if I have anything to say about it . He steered the car to where the other drivers were parked and got out to say hello . Today the talk was all about Abigail . He overhearda Cabinet member 's driver say , " It 's practically all sewed up for Senator Jennings . " Abby , you 're almost there , girl , he thought exultantly . Abby was gone more than an hour , so he had plenty of time to read the newspaper . Finally he opened the Style section to glance at the columns . Sometimes he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was usually too busy to read gossip . Gina Butterfield was the columnist everyone in Washington read . Today her column had a headline that ran across the two center pages of the section . Toby read it , then read it again , trying to deny what he was seeing . The headline was ADAMS DEATH HOUSE SCENE OF THREATS . SENATOR ABIGAIL JENNINGS INVOLVED . The first couple of paragraphs of the story were in extra-large type : Pat Traymore , the fast-rising young television newswoman hired by Potomac Cable to produce a documentary about Senator Jennings , has been harassed by letters , phone calls and a break-in threatening her life if she continues to work on the program . A guest at the exclusive Christmas Eve supper of Ambassador Cardell , winsome Pat revealed that the house she is renting was the scene of the Adams murder-suicide twenty-four years ago . Pat claims not to be disturbed by the sinister history of the house , but other guests , long-time residents of the area , were not so complacent .. The rest of the column was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages were blown-up file photos of Dean and Renee Adams , the garish picture of the sacks in which their bodies were bundled , a close-up of their small daughter being carried out swathed inp163bloody bandages . " SIx MONTHS LATER KERRY ADAMS LOST HER VALIANT FIGHT FOR LIFE " was the caption under that picture . The article hinted at a whitewash in the murder-suicide verdict : Aristocratic Patricia Remington Schuyler , mother of the dead woman , insisted that Congressman Adams was unstable and about to be divorcedby his socialite wife . But many old-timers in Washington think Dean Adams may have been given a bum rap , that it was Renee Adams who held the gun that night . " She was clearly besotted by him , " one friend told me , " and he had a roving eye . " Did her jealousy reach the breaking point that night ? Who may have triggered that tragic outburst ? Twenty-four years later , Washington still speculates . Abigail 's picture in her Miss Apple Junction crown was prominent . The copy under it read : Most specials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Murrow format . But the upcoming program on Senator Abigail Jennings will probably win the Nielsen ratings for the week . After all , the Senator may become our first woman Vice President . The smart money is on her . Now everyone 's hoping that the footage will include more pictures of the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia in the rhinestone crown she picked up as a beauty queen along the way . And on the serious side , no one can agree on who hates Abigail Jennings enough to threaten the life of the newswoman who conceived the idea of the program . Half of the right-hand page was subcaptioned THE PRE-CAMELOTYEARS . It was filled with photographs , most of them informal snapshots . The accompanying text read : In a bizarre coincidence , Senator Abigail Jennings was at one time a frequent guest at the Adams house . She and her late husband , CongressmanWillard Jennings , were close friends of Dean and Renee Adams and the John Kennedys . The three stunning young couples could not have guessed that the dark shadow of fate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pictures of the six together and in mixed groups in the garden of the Georgetown house , on the Jennings estate in Virginia and at the Hyannis Port compound . And there were a half dozen photos of Abigail alone in the group after Willard 's death.  |p164Toby  uttered a savage , angry growl . He started to crumple the paper between his hands , willing the sickening pages to disintegrateunder his sheer physical strength , but it was no use . It would n't go away . He would have to show this to Abby as soon as he got her home , God only knew what her reaction would be . She had to keep her cool . Everything depended on that . When Toby pulled the car up to the curb , Abigail was there , Sam Kingsley at her side . He started to get out , but Kingsley quickly opened the door for Abigail and helped her into the car . " Thanks for holding my hand , Sam , " she said . " I feel a lot better . I 'm sorry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rain check . " Toby drove quickly , frantic to get Abigail home , as though he needed to insulate her from public view until he could nurse her through the first reaction to the article . " Sam is special , " Abby said suddenly , ending the heavy silence . " You know how it 's been with me all these years  --  but Toby , in a crazy way he reminds me of Billy . I have this feeling just a feeling , mind you  --  that there could be something developing between Sam and me . It would be like having a second chance . " It was the first time she 'd ever talked like this . Toby looked into the rearview mirror . Abigail was leaning against the seat , her body relaxed , her face soft and with a half-smile . And he was the son-of-a-bitch who was going to have to destroy that hope and confidence . " Toby , did you buy the paper ? " There was no use lying . " Yes , I did , Senator . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed back the first section . " No , I do n't feel like the news . Where 's the section with the columns ? " " Not now , Senator . " The traffic was light ; they were over Chain Bridge . In a few minutes , they 'd be home . " What do you mean , not now ? " He did n't answer , and there was a long pause . Then Abigail said , her tone cold and brittle , " Something bad in one of the columns .. something that could hurt me ? " " Something you wo n't like , Senator . " They drove the rest of the way in silence.  |p165Over  the Christmas holiday official Washington was a ghost town . The President was in his private vacation residence in the Southwest ; Congress was in recess ; the universities were closed for vacation . Washington became a sleepy city , a city waiting for the burst of activity that signaled the return of its Chief Executive , lawmakers and students . Pat drove home through the light traffic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cup of tea were as much as she wanted . She wondered how Luther was making out in Apple Junction . Had he turned on the courtly charm he had once used to woo her ? All of that seemed long ago . Apropos of Apple Junction , she wondered if Eleanor Brown had ever called Miss Langley back . Eleanor Brown . The girl was a pivotalfigure in Pat 's growing doubt about the integrity of the televisionprogram . What were the facts ? It was Eleanor 's word against Toby 's . Had he phoned and requested her to go to the campaign office to look for the Senator 's ring ? The Senator supported Toby 's claim that he had been driving her at the time of the supposed call . And part of the money had been found in Eleanor 's storage area . How had she expected to get away with such a flimsy alibi ? I wish I had a transcript of the trial , she thought . She opened her pad and studied the sentences she had written down the night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next page she wrote Eleanor Brown . What had Margaret Langley said about the girl ? Tapping her pen on the desk and frowning in concentration , she began to jot her impressions of their conversation : Eleanor was timid . . . she never chewed gum in class or talked when the teacher was out of the room ... she loved her job in the Senator'sp166office ... she had just been promoted . . . she was taking art classes . she was going to Baltimore that day to sketch ... Pat read and reread her notes . A girl doing well at a responsible job who had just been given a promotion , but so stupid she had hidden stolen money in her own storage room . Some stolen money . The bulk of it  --  $70,000  --  was never found . A girl as timid as that would be a poor witness in her own defense . Eleanor had had a nervous breakdown in prison . She would have had to be a consummate actress to fake that . But she had violated her parole . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story . He had sworn he never phoned her that morning . Senator Jennings had confirmed that Toby was driving her at the time of the alleged call . Would Senator Jennings deliberately lie for Toby , deliberately allow an innocent girl to go to prison ? But suppose someone who sounded like Toby had phoned Eleanor ? In that case all three  --  Eleanor , Toby and the Senator  --  had been telling the truth . Who else would have known about Eleanor 's storage space in her apartment building ? What about the person who had made the threats , broken in here , left the doll ? Could he be the x factor in the disappearance of the campaign funds ? The doll . Pat pushed back her chair and reached for the carton jammed under the library table , then changed her mind . There was nothing to be gained by looking at the doll now . The sight of that weeping face was too unsettling . After the program was aired , if there were no more threats , she 'd throw it away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted break-ins , she 'd have to show the doll to the police . On the next page in her pad she wrote Toby , then fished through the desk drawer for the cassettes of her interviews . She had recorded Toby in the car that first afternoon . He had n't realized she was taping him , and his voice was somewhat muffled . She turned the sound as high as possible , pushed the " play " button and began to take notes . Maybe Abby stuck her neck out for me . . . I was working for a bookie in New York and almost got in trouble . . . I used to drive Abby and Willard Jennings to that house for parties . . . cute little kid , Kerry.  |p167She  was glad to switch to the interview with the waitress , Ethel Stubbins , and her husband , Ernie . They had said something about Toby . She found the segment , Ernie saying , " Say hello to him for me . Ask him if he 's still losing money on the horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his derisive remarks about the joyriding incident , his story about his father 's buying off Abigail : " I always thought Toby had a hand in it . " After hearing the last of the cassettes , Pat read and reread her transcriptions . She knew what she had to do . If Eleanor turned herself in and was sent back to prison , Pat vowed she would stay with the case until she had satisfied herself as to Eleanor 's guilt or innocence . And if it turns out I believe her story , Pat thought , I 'll do everything I can to help her . Let the chips fall where they may -- including Abigail Jennings ' chips . Pat wandered from the library into the foyer , and then to the staircase . She glanced up , then hesitated . The step above the turn . That 's where I used to sit . Impulsively she hurried up the stairs , sat on that step , leaned her head against the baluster and closed her eyes . Her father was in the foyer . She had shrunk deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this time he would not joke about finding her here . She had run back to bed . She hurried up the rest of the staircase . Her old room was past the guest room , across the back of the house , overlooking the garden . It was empty now . She 'd walked in here that first morning as the moving men were scurrying through the house , but it had evoked absolutely no memories . Now it seemed she could remember the bed with the frilly white canopy , the small rocking chair near the window with the music box , the shelves of toys . I came back to bed that night . I was frightened because Daddy was so angry . The living room is right underneath this room . I could hear voices ; they were shouting at each other . Then the loud noise and Mother screaming , " No . No ! " Mother screaming . After the loud noise . Had she been able to scream after she was shot or had she screamed when she realized she had shot her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She grasped the door for support , felt the dampness in her palms and forehead . Her breath was coming in short , hard gasps . She thought , I am afraid . But it 's over . It was so long ago.  |p168She  turned and realized she was running down the hall , she was rushing down the staircase . I am back there , she thought . I am going to remember . " Daddy , Daddy , " she called softly . At the foot of the stairs , she turned and began to stumble through the foyer , her arms outstretched . Daddy . . . Daddy ! At the living-room door she crumpled to her knees . Vague shadowswere around her but would not take form . Burying her face in her hands , she began to sob ... " Mother , Daddy , come home . " She had awakened and there had been a strange baby-sitter . Mother . Daddy . I want my mother . I want my daddy . And they had come . Mother rocking her Kerry , Kerry it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around both of them . Shhh , Kerry , we 're here . After a while Pat slid into a sitting position and leaned against the wall , staring into the room . Another memory had broken through . She was sure it was accurate . No matter which one was guilty that last night , she thought fiercely , I know that both of them loved me ..  |p169There  was a movie theater on Wisconsin Avenue that opened at ten . Arthur went into a cafeteria near it and dawdled over coffee , then walked around the neighborhood until the box office opened . Whenever he was upset , he liked to go to the movies . He would choose a seat near the back and against the wall . And he 'd buy the tallest bag of popcorn and sit and eat and watch unseeingly as the figures moved on the screen . He liked the feeling of people near him but not conscious of him , the voices and music on the soundtrack , the anonymity of the darkenedauditorium . It gave him a place to think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been a mistake to set the fire . There had been no mention of it in the newspaper . When he got off the Metro , he 'd phoned the nursing home and the operator had answered at once . He 'd muffled his voice : " I 'm Mrs. Harnick 's son . How serious was the fire ? " " Oh , sir , it was discovered almost at once . A smoldering cigarette in the trash bag . We did n't know any of the guests were even aware of it . " That meant they must have seen the overturned can of turpentine . No one would believe it had tipped accidentally . If only he had n't mentioned the monastery . Of course , the office there might simply say : 66Yes , our records indicate Arthur Stevens was with us for a short time . " Suppose they were pressed for details ? " He left at the suggestion of his spiritual director . " " May we speak to the spiritual director ? " " He died some years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave ? Would they study the records of the nursing home and see which patients hadp170died in these few years and how many of them he had helped to nurse ? He was sure they would n't understand that he was only being kind , only alleviating suffering . Twice before he 'd been questioned when patients he had cared for had slipped away to the Lord . " Were you glad to see them die , Arthur ? " " I was glad to see them at peace . I did everything possible to help them get well or at least be comfortable . " When there was no hope , no relief from pain , when old people became too weak to even whisper or moan , when the doctors and relatives agreed it would be a blessing if God took them , then , and only then , did he help them slip away . If he had known that Anita Gillespie was looking forward to seeing her daughter , he would have waited . It would have given him so much joy to know Mrs. Gillespie died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting death , not reconciled to it . That was why she had been too frightened to understand he was only trying to help her . It was his concern for Glory that had made him so careless . He could remember the night the worry had begun . They were having dinner at home together , each reading a section of the newspaper , and Glory had cried , " Oh , dear God ! " She was looking at the televisionpage of the Tribune and had seen the announcement of the Senator Jennings program . It would include the highlights of her career . He had begged Glory not to be upset ; he was sure it would be all right . But she had n't listened . She 'd started to sob . " Maybe it 's better to face it , " she 'd said . " I do n't want to live my life like this any longer . " Right then her attitude began to change . He stared ahead , heedlesslychewing on the popcorn . He had not been given the privilege of formally taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poverty , chastity , and obedience . Never once had he broken them  --  but he used to get so lonely ... Then nine years ago he 'd met Glory . She 'd been sitting in the dreary waiting room of the clinic , clutching the Raggedy Ann doll and waiting her turn to see the psychiatrist . The doll was what had caught his attention . Something made him wait around outside for her . They 'd started walking toward the bus stop together . He 'd explainedhe was a priest but had left parish work to work directly with the sick . She 'd told him all about herself , how she 'd been inp171prison for a crime she did n't commit and she was on parole and lived in a furnished room . " I 'm not allowed to smoke in my room , " she told him , " or even have a hot plate so I can fix coffee or soup when I do n't want to go out to the drugstore to eat . " They went for ice cream and it began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman where she lived would be angry . Then she started to cry and said she 'd rather be dead than go back there . And he had taken her home with him . " You will be a child in my care , " he 'd told her . And she was like a helpless child . He gave her his bedroom and slept on the couch , and in the beginning she would just lie in bed and cry . For a few weeks the cops came around the clinic to see if she 'd shown up again , but then they lost interest . They 'd gone to Baltimore . That was when he told her he was going to tell everyone that she was his daughter . " You call me Father anyhow , " he said . And he had named her Gloria . Slowly she had started to get better . But for nearly seven years she had left the apartment only at night ; she was so sure that a policeman would recognize her . He 'd worked in different nursing homes around Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave and they 'd come to Alexandria . Glory loved being near Washington , but she was afraid she might run into people who knew her . He convinced her that was foolish . " None of the people from the Senator 's office would ever come near this neighborhood . " Even so , whenever Glory went out , she wore dark glasses . Gradually her spells of depression began to ease . She needed less and less of the medicine he brought from the nursing home , and she 'd gotten the typing job . Arthur finished the popcorn . He would not leave Washington until tomorrow night , after he 'd seen the program about Senator Jennings . He never helped people slip away until there was absolutely nothing the doctors could do for them , until his voices directedhim that their time had come . Neither would he condemn Patricia Traymore without evidence . If she did not talk about Glory on the program or show her picture , Glory would be safe . He would arrange to meet her and they 'd go away together . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would give herself up . This time she would die in prison . He was sure of it . He had seen enough people who had lost the will to live . But if it happened , Patricia Traymore would be punished for that terrible sin ! He would go to the house where she lived and mete out justice to her.  |p172Three  Thousand N Street . Even the house where Patricia Traymorelived was a symbol of suffering and death . The movie was ending . Where could he go now ? You must hide , Arthur . " But where ? " He realized he had spoken aloud . The woman in the seat ahead of him turned and glanced back . Three Thousand N Street , the voices whispered . Go there , Arthur . Go in the window again . Think about the closet . The image of the closet in the unused bedroom filled his mind . He would be warm and safe concealed behind the rows of shelves in that closet . The lights were on in the theater and he stood up quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go to another movie now and another after that . By then it would be dark . Where better to spend the hours until the broadcast tomorrowevening than in Patricia Traymore 's own home ? No one would dream of looking for him there . She must have her chance to be exonerated , Arthur . You must not be too hasty . The words swirled in the air above his head . " I understand , " he said . If there was no reference to Glory on the program , Patricia Traymore would never know that he had been staying with her . But if Glory was shown and identified , Patricia would be punishedby the angels . He would light the avenging torch.  |p173At  one o'clock Lila Thatcher 's maid returned from grocery shopping . Lila was in her study working on a lecture she was planning to give the following week at the University of Maryland . The subject was " Harness Your Psychic Gift . " Lila bent over the typewriter , her hands clasped . The maid knocked on the door . " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The maid spoke with the comfortable familiarity of an employee who had become a trusted friend . " I 'm not , Ouida . For someone who 's trying to teach people to usetheir psychic skills , my own are pretty scrambled today . " " I brought in the Tribune . Do you want to see it now ? " " Yes , I think so . " Five minutes later , in angry disbelief , Lila was reading the Gina Butterfield spread . Fifteen minutes later , she was ringing Pat 's doorbell . With dismay she realized Pat had been weeping . " There 's something I have to show you , " she explained . They went into the library . Lila laid the paper on the table and opened it . She watched as Pat saw the headline and the color drained from her face . Helplessly Pat skimmed the copy , glanced at the pictures . " My God , it makes me sound as though I was blabbing about the breakin , the Senator , this house , everything . Lila , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther Pelham had every single picture of my mother and father edited out of the old films . He did n't want any connection between the Senator and , I quote him , the Adams mess . ' It 's as though there 's a force in action I ca n't stop . I do n't know whether to try to explain , to resign or what . " She tried to hold back angry tears . Lila began to fold the newspaper . " I ca n't advise you about thep174job , but I can tell you that you must not look at this again , Kerry . I had to show it to you , but I 'm taking it home with me . It 's not wise for you to see yourself as you were that day , like a broken doll . " Pat grabbed the older woman 's arm . " Why did you say that ? " " Say what ? You mean why did I call you Kerry ? That just slipped out . " " No , I mean why did you compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and then looked down at the newspaper . " It 's in here , " she said . " I just read it . Look . " In the lead column Gina Butterfield had reprinted some of the original Tribune story about the murder-suicide . Police Chief Collins , commenting on the grisly scene , said , " It 's the worst I 've ever come across . When I saw that poor little kid like a broken doll , I wondered why he had n't shot her too . It would have been easier for her . " " A broken doll , " Pat whispered . " Whoever left it knew me then . " " Left what ? Pat , sit down . You look as though you 're going to faint . I 'll get you a glass of water . " Lila hurried from the room . Pat leaned her head against the back of the couch and closed her eyes . When she had looked up the newspaper accounts of the tragedy , she had seen the pictures of the bodies being carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But seeing them juxtaposed against those of the smiling , apparently carefree young couples was worse . She did n't remember reading that quote from the police chief . Maybe she had n't seen the issue in which it appeared . But it proved that whoever had threatened her knew who she was , had known her then . Lila came back . She had filled a glass with cold water . " I 'm all right , " Pat said . " Lila , the night someone broke in here , he did n't just leave a note . " She tugged at the carton to try to get it out from under the library table . It was wedged in so tightly that it would n't budge . I ca n't believe I jammed it in like this , Pat thought . As she struggled , she told Lila about finding the doll . Shocked , Lila absorbed what she was hearing . The intruder had left a bloodied doll against the fireplace ? Pat was in danger here . She had sensed it all along . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She opened it , going through it rapidly . Lila watched as her expression changed from surprise to alarm . " Pat , what is it ? "  | " The doll . It 's gone . " " Are you sure ... " " I put it here myself . I looked at it again just the other day . Lila , I took its apron off . It was sickening to look at . I shoved it way down . Maybe it 's still here . " Pat fished through the box . " Look , here it is . " Lila stared at the crumpled piece of white cotton , soiled with reddish-brown stains , the strings of the sash hanging limply from the sides . " When was the last time you saw the doll ? " " Saturday afternoon . I had it out on the table . The Senator 's chauffeur came with more of her photograph albums . I hid it in the carton again . I did n't want him to see it . " Pat paused . " Wait . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brusque and kept eyeing everything in this room . I had n't answered the bell right away and I think he wondered what I 'd been up to . And then he said he 'd let himself out . When I heard the door close , I decided to slide the bolt , and Lila , the door was openingagain . Toby had something that looked like a credit card in his hand . He tried to pass it off by insinuating that he was just testing the lock for me , and that I should be sure to keep the bolt on . " He knew me when I was little . Maybe he 's the one who 's been threatening me . But why ? " It was not yet midafternoon , but the day had turned gray and cloudy . The dark wood paneling and the fading light made Pat seem small and vulnerable . " We must call the police immediately , " Lila said . " They 'll question the chauffeur . " " I ca n't do that . Can you imagine what the Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do know someone who can have Toby investigated quietly . " Pat saw the distress on Lila 's face . " It 's going to be all right , " she assured her . " I 'll keep the bolt on the door  --  and Lila , if everything that 's happened is an attempt to stop the program , it 's really too late . We 're taping the Senator arriving home this evening . Tomorrow we do some in-studio scenes and tomorrow night it will be aired . After that there wo n't be any point in trying to scare me . And I 'm beginning to think that 's what this is about just an attempt to scare me off . " Lila left a few minutes later . Pat had to be at the studio at four o'clock . She promised she would phone her Congressman friend  --  Sam Kingsley  --  and ask him to have the chauffeur investigated . To Lila 's consternation , Pat insisted on keeping the newspaper . " I'llp176have to read it carefully and know exactly what it says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out and buy another one . " Lila 's maid had the door open when she came up the steps . " I'v ( been watching for you , Miss Lila , " she explained . " You never fin ished your lunch and you looked real upset when you left . " " You 've been watching for me , Ouida ? " Lila went into the dininc room and walked over to the windows facing the street . From there she could see the entire frontage and the right side of Pat 's house and property . " It wo n't work , " she murmured . " He broke ix ' through the patio doors and I ca n't see them from here . " " What did you say , Miss Lila ? " " It 's nothing . I 'm going to keep a stillwatch and I had thought of setting my typewriter on a table just back from the windows . " " A stillwatch ? " " Yes , it 's an expression that means if you believe something it wrong , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong at Miss Traymore 's ? You think that prowler may come back again ? " Lila stared at the unnatural darkness surrounding Pat 's house . With an acute sense of foreboding she answered somberly , " That 's just what I think . "  |p177From  the moment Father phoned her , Glory had been waiting for the police to come . At ten o'clock it happened . The door of the real estate office opened and a man in his mid-thirties came in . She looked up and saw a squad car parked out front . Her fingers dropped from the typewriter . " Detective Barrott , " the visitor said , and held up a badge . " I 'd like to speak with Gloria Stevens . Is she here ? " Glory stood up . Already she could hear his questions : Is n't your real name Eleanor Brown ? Why did you violate parole ? How long did you think you could get away with it ? Detective Barrott came over to her . He had a frank , chubby face with sandy hair that curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She realized he was about her own age , and somehow he seemed a little less frightening than the scornful detectivewho had questioned her after the money was found in her storage room . " Miss Stevens ? Do n't be nervous . I wonder if I could speak to you privately ? " " We could go in here . " She led the way into Mr. Schuller 's small private office . There were two leather chairs in front of Mr. Schuller'sdesk . She sat in one of them and the detective settled in the other . " You looked scared , " he said kindly . ' " You have nothing to worry about . We just want to talk to your dad . Do you know where we can reach him ? " Talk to her dad . Father ! She swallowed . " When I left for work he was home . He probably went to the bakery . " " He did n't come back . Maybe when he saw the police car in frontp178of your house , he decided not to . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I . . . I do n't know . Why do you want to talk to him ? " " Just to ask a few questions . By any chance has he called you this morning ? " This man thought Arthur was her father . He was n't interested in her . " He . . . he did call . But I was on the phone with my boss . " " What did he want ? " " He . . . wanted me to meet him and I said I could n't . " " Where did he want you to meet him ? " Father 's words rang in her ears . Metro Central . . . Twelfth and G exit . . . Was he there now ? Was he in trouble ? Father had taken care of her all these years . She could not hurt him now . She chose her words carefully . " I could n't stay on the phone . I ... I just said I could n't leave the office and practically hung up on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's wrong ? " " Well , maybe nothing . " The detective 's voice was kind . " Does your dad talk to you about his patients ? " " Yes . " It was easy to answer that question . " He cares so much about them . " " Has he ever mentioned Mrs. Gillespie to you ? " " Yes . She died last week , did n't she ? He felt so bad . Something about her daughter coming to visit her . " She thought about the way he had cried out in his sleep , " Close your eyes , Mrs. Gillespie . Close your eyes . " Maybe he had made a mistake when he was helping Mrs. Gillespie and they were blaming him for it . " Has he seemed different lately  --  nervous or anything like that ? " " He is the kindest man I know . His whole life is devoted to helping people . In fact , they just asked him at the nursing home to go to Tennessee and help out there . " The detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Thirty-four . " He looked surprised . " You do n't look it . According to the employmentrecords , Arthur Stevens is forty-nine . " He paused , then in a friendly voice added , " He 's not your real father , is he ? " Soon he would be pinning her down with questions . " He used to be a parish priest but decided to spend his whole life caring for the sick . When I was very ill and had no one , he took me in . " Now he would ask her real name . But he did n't . " I see . Miss . . Miss Stevens , we do want to talk to , er .  |p179Father  Stevens . If he calls you , will you contact me ? " He gave her his card . DETECTIVE WILLIAM BARROTT . She could sense him studying her . Why was n't he asking her more questions about herself , about her background ? He was gone . She sat alone in the private office until Opal came in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friend , the best friend she 'd ever had . Opal had helped her think of herself as a woman again . Opal was always after her to go to parties , saying her boyfriend would fix her up with a blind date . She 'd always refused . " Gloria , what 's wrong ? " Opal repeated . " You look terrible . " " No , nothing 's wrong . I have a headache . Do you think I could go home ? " " Sure ; I 'll finish your typing . Gloria , if there 's anything I can doGlory looked into her friend 's troubled face . " Not anymore , but thank you for everything . " She walked home . The temperature was in the forties , but even so , the day was raw with a chill that penetrated her coat and gloves . The apartment , with its shabby , rented furniture , seemed strangely empty , as though it sensed they would not be returning . She went to the hall closet and found the battered black suitcase that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her meager supply of clothing , her cosmetics and the new book Opal had given her for Christmas . The suitcase was n't large , and it was hard to force the locks to snap . There was something else  --  her Raggedy Ann doll . At the mentalhealthclinic the psychiatrist had asked her to draw a picture of how she felt about herself , but somehow she could n't do that . The doll was with some others on a shelf , and he had given it to her . " Do you think you could show me how this doll would look if it were you ? " It had n't been hard to paint the tears and to sketch in the frightenedlook about the eyes and to change the thrust of the mouth so that instead of smiling it seemed about to scream . " That bad ? " the doctor had said when she was finished . " Worse . " Oh , Father , she thought , I wish I could stay here and wait until you call me . But they 're going to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked right now . I ca n't run away any/more . While I have the courage , I have to turn myself in . Maybe it will help me get a lighter sentence for breaking parole . There was one promise she could keep . Miss Langley had begged her to call that television celebrity Patricia Traymore before she did anything . Now she made the call , told what she planned and listenedimpassively to Pat 's emotional pleading . Finally at three o'clock she left . A car was parked down the street .. Two men were sitting in it . " That 's the girl , " one of them said . " She was lying about not planning to meet Stevens . " He sounded regretful . The other man pressed his foot on the pedal . " I told you she was holding back on you . Ten bucks she 'll lead us to Stevens now . "  |p181Pat  sped across town to the Lotus Inn Restaurant on Wisconsin Avenue . Desperately she tried to think of some way she could persuade Eleanor Brown not to surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reason . She had tried to reach Sam , but after five rings had slammed down the phone and run out . Now as she rushed into the restaurant she wondered if she would recognize the girl from her high school picture . Was she using her own name ? Probably not . The hostess greeted her . " Are you Miss Traymore ? " " Yes , I am . " " Miss Brown is waiting for you . " She was sitting at a rear table sipping chablis . Pat slipped into the chair opposite her , trying to collect herself to know what to say . Eleanor Brown had not changed very much from her high school picture . She was obviously older , no longer painfully thin and prettierthan Pat had expected , but there was no mistaking her . She spoke softly . " Miss Traymore ? Thank you for coming . " " Eleanor , please listen to me . We can get you a lawyer . You can be out on bail while we work something out . You were in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many angles a good lawyer can work . " The waiter came with an appetizer of butterfly shrimp . " I used to dream of these , " Eleanor said . " Do you want to order something ? " " No . Nothing . Eleanor , did you understand what I said ? " " Yes , I did . " Eleanor dipped one of the shrimp in the sweet sauce . " Oh , that 's good . " Her face was pale but determined . " Miss Traymore , I hope I can get my parole reinstated , but if I ca n't , I know I 'm strong enough now to serve the time they gave me . I can sleep in a cell , and wear a prison uniform , and eat that slop they call food ,  |p182and  put up with the strip searches and the boredom . When I get out I wo n't have to hide anymore , and I 'm going to spend the rest of rm life trying to prove my innocence . " " Eleanor , was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half the people in the office knew about that storeroom . When I moved from one apartment to the other , six ol eight of them helped . We made a party of it . The furniture t could n't use was carried down to the storage room . Some of the money was found there , but seventy thousand dollars went into someone else 's pocket . " " Eleanor , you claim Toby phoned you and he said he did n't . Did n't you think it unusual to be asked to go to the campaign office on Sunday ? " Eleanor pushed aside the shells on her plate . " No . You see the Senator was up for reelection . A lot of mailings were sent from the campaign office . She used to drop by and help just to make the volunteers feel important . When she did that she would take off her big diamond ring . It was a little loose and she really was careless with it . A couple of times she left without it . " " And Toby or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again . " " Yes . I knew she 'd been in the campaign office on Saturday helpingwith the mailings , so it sounded perfectly natural that she might have forgotten it again and one of the senior aides might have put it in the safe for her . " I believe Toby was driving the Senator at the time the call was made . The voice was muffled and whoever spoke to me did n't say much . It was something like , See if the Senator 's ring is in the campaign safe and let her know . ' I was annoyed because I wanted to go to Richmond to sketch and I even said something like she 'll probably find it under her nose . ' Whoever it was who phoned sort of laughed and hung up . If Abigail Jennings had n't talked so much about the second chance she had given me , called me a convicted thief , I would have had a better chance of reasonable doubt . I 've lost eleven years of my life for something I did n't do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and laid money on the table . " That should cover everything . " Bending down , she picked up her suit case , then paused . " You know what 's hardest for me now ? I'ru i breaking my promise to the man I 've been living with , and he 's been so good to me . He begged me not to go to the police yet . I wish I could explain to him , but I do n't know where he is. "  | " Can I call him for you later ? What 's his name ? Where does he work ? " " His name is Arthur Stevens . I think there 's some problem at his b . He wo n't be there . There 's nothing you can do . I hope your program is very successful , Miss Traymore . I was terribly upset when I read the announcement about it . I knew that if even one picture of me was shown I 'd be in jail within twenty-four hours . But ou know , that made me realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it gave me the courage to face going back to prison so at someday I really will be free . Father , I mean Arthur Stevens , t could n't accept that . And now I 'd better go before I run out of Courage . " Helplessly Pat watched her retreating back . As Eleanor left the restaurant two men at a corner table got up ! Ind followed her out.  | " Abby , it 's not as bad as it could be . " In the forty years he had known her , it was only the third time he had had his arms around her . She was sobbing helplessly . " Why did n't you tell me she was staying in that house ? " " There was no reason to . " They were in Abigail 's living room . He 'd shown her the article when they arrived , then tried to calm the inevitable explosion . " Abby , tomorrow this newspaper will be lining garbage cans . " I do n't want to line garbage cans ! " she 'd screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Come on , Senator , pull yourself together . Maybe there 's a photographer hid ing in the bushes . " " Shut up , you bloody fool . " But the suggestion had been enough to shock her . And after the drink , she 'd started to cry . " Toby , it looks like the old penny-dreadful scandal sheets . And that picture . Tob.Ib that picture . " She did n't mean the one of her and Francey . He put his arms around her , clumsily patted her back and real I ized with the dullness of a long-accepted pain that he was nothing more to her than a railing to grab when your feet gave way under 1 neath you . " If anyone really studies the pictures ! Toby , look at that one . " " Nobody 's going to bother . " " Toby , that girl  --  that Pat Traymore . How did she happen to lean that house ? It ca n't be a coincidence . " " The house has been rented to twelve different tenants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them . " Toby triad to make his voice hearty . He did n't believe that ; but on the other hand , Phil still had n't been able to uncover the details of the rental " Senator , you got ta hang in there . Whoever made those threats to Pat Traymore ... " " Toby , how do we know there were threats ? How do we know this is n't a calculated attempt to embarrass me ? " He was so startled he stepped back . In a reflex action she pulled away from him , and they stared at each other . " God Almighty , Abby , do you think she engineered this ? " The ring of the telephone made them both jump . He looked at her . " You want me ... " " Yes . " She held her hands up to her face . " I do n't give a goddamn who 's calling . I 'm not here . " " Senator Jennings ' residence . " Toby put on his butler 's voice . " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available at the moment . " He winked at Abby and was rewarded by the trace of a smile . " The President . . . . Oh , just a minute , sir . " He held his hand over the mouthpiece . " Abby , the President is calling you . " Toby , do n't you dare . . . " " Abby , for chrissake , it 's the President ! " She clasped her hands to her lips , then came over and took the phone from him . " If this is your idea of a joke . . . " She got on . " Abigail Jennings . " Toby watched as her expression changed . " Mr. President . I 'm so sorry .... I 'm sorry . . Some reading . . . That 's why I left word .... I 'm sorry .... Yes , sir , of course . Yes , I can be at the White House tomorrow evening . . . eight-thirty , of course . Yes , we 've been quite busy with this program . Frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing . . . . Why , how kind of you . . . . Sir , you mean . . . I simply do n't know what to say .. . Of course , I understand . . . . Thank you , sir . " She hung up . Dazed , she looked at Toby . " I 'm not to tell a soul . He 's announcing his appointment of me tomorrow night after the program . He said it is n't a bad idea the whole country gets to know me a little better . He laughed about the Mirror cover . He said his mother was a big gal too , but that I 'm much prettier now than when I was seventeen . Toby , I 'm going to be Vice President of the United States ! " She laughed hysterically and flung herself at him . " Abby , you did it ! " He lifted her off her feet . An instant later her face twisted with tension . " Toby , nothing can happen . . Nothing must stop this .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his . " Abby , I swear nothing will keep this from you . " She started to laugh and then began to cry . " Toby , I 'm on a roller coaster . You and that damn Scotch . You know I ca n't drink . Toby  --  Vice President ! " He had to ease her down . His voice soothing , he said , " Later on we 'll take a ride over and just kind of cruise past your new house , Abby . You 're finally getting a mansion . Next stop Massachusetts Avenue . " " Toby , shut up . Just make me a cup of tea . I 'm going to take a shower and try to collect myself . Vice President ! My God , my God ! " He put the kettle on and then , not bothering with a coat , walked to the roadside mailbox and flipped it open . The usual collection of junk  --  coupons , contests , " You may have won two million dollars " . ... Ninety-nine percent of Abby 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blue envelope with the handwritten address . A personal note to Abby . He looked at the upper left-hand corner and felt the blood drain from his face . The note was from Catherine Graney.  |p187Sam  drove across town on 7th Street , already a little late for his noon appointment with Larry Saggiotes of the National TransportationSafety Board . After he left Pat , he 'd gone home and lain awake most of the night , his emotions shifting from anger to a sober examination of Pat 's charges . " Can I help you , sir ? " " What ? Oh , sorry . " Sheepishly Sam realized he 'd been so deep in thought , he had arrived in the lobby of the FAA building without realizing he had come through the revolving door . The security guard was looking at him curiously . He went up to the eighth floor and gave his name to the receptionist . " It will be just a few minutes , " she said . Sam settled into a chair . Had Abigail and Willard Jennings been having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that did n't have to mean anything . He remembered there were times when he 'd threatened to quit Congress , to get a job that would provide some of the luxuries that Janice deserved . She 'd argued with him and stormed at him , and anyone who heard them would have thought they could n't stand each other . Maybe the pilot 's widow did hear Abigail arguing with Willard Jennings that day . Maybe Willard was disgusted about something and ready to give up politics and she did n't want him burning his bridges . Sam had called his FBI friend Jack Carlson to trace the report of the crash . " Twenty-seven years ago ? That could be a tough one , " Jack had said . " The National Transportation Safety Board handles investigationsinto crashes now , but that many years ago the Civil **25;12961;TOOLONG was in charge . Let me call you back . "  |p188At  nine-thirty Jack had phoned back . " You 're in luck , " he 'd said laconically . " Most records are shredded after ten years , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored in the Safety Board warehouse . They 've got the data on accidents involving everyone from Amelia Earhart and Carole Lombard to Dag Hammarskjold and Hale Boggs . My contact at the board is Larry Saggiotes . He 'll get the report sent to his office , look it over He suggests you come by about noon . He 'll review it with you . " " Excuse me , sir . Mr. Saggiotes will see you now . " Sam looked up . He had a feeling the receptionist had been trying to get his attention . I 'd better get with it , he thought . He followed her down the corridor . Larry Saggiotes was a big man whose features and coloring reflectedhis Greek heritage . They exchanged greetings . Sam gave a carefully edited explanation of why he 'd wanted to investigate the crash . Larry settled back in his chair , frowning . " Nice day here , is n't it ? " he commented . " But it 's foggy in New York , icy in Minneapolis , pouring in Dallas . Yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military and private planes will take off and land in this country . And the odds against any of them crashing are astronomical . That 's why when a plane that 's been checked out by an expert mechanic and flown by a master pilot on a day with good visibility suddenly crashes into a mountain and is scattered over two square miles of rocky landscape , we 're not happy . " " The Jennings plane ! " " The Jennings plane , " Larry confirmed . " I 've just read the report . What happened ? We do n't know . The last contact with George Graney was when he left traffic control in Richmond . There was no suggestion of trouble . It was a routine two-hour flight . And then he was overdue . " " And the verdict was pilot error ? " Sam asked . " Probable cause , pilot error . It always ends up like that when we ca n't come up with other answers . It was a fairly new Cessna twinengine , so their engineers were around to prove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried her eyes out about how she 'd had a horror of small charter planes , that her husband had complained about rough landings with Graney . " " Did the possibility of foul play ever come up ? " " Congressman , the possibility of foul play is always investigatedp189in a case like this . First we look for how it might have been done . Well , there are plenty of ways that are pretty hard to trace . For example , with all the magnetic tape being used today , a strong magnet hidden in the cockpit could screw up all the instruments . Twenty-seven years ago that would n't have happened . But if anybodyhad fooled with the generator of Graney 's plane , maybe , frayed or cut a wire , Graney would have had a complete loss of power right as he 's flying over a mountain . The chances of recoveringusable evidence would have been negligible . " The fuel switch would be another possibility . That plane had two tanks . The pilot switched to the second tank when the first tank 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't working ? He would n't have had a chance to use the second tank . Then , of course , we have corrosive acid . Somebody who does n't want a plane to make it safely could have put a leaky container of the stuff on board . It could be in the luggage area , under a seat  --  would n't matter . That would eat through the cables within half an hour and there 'd be no controlling the plane . But that would be easier to discover . " " Did any of this come up at the hearing ? " Sam asked . " There were n't enough pieces of that plane recovered to play Pick Up Sticks . So the next thing we do is look for motive . And found absolutely none . Graney 's charter line was doing well ; he had n't taken out any recent insurance . The Congressman was so poorly insured it was amazing , but when you have family dough , you do n't need insurance , I guess . Incidentally , this is the second request I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Graney came in for one last week . " " Larry , if it 's at all possible , I 'm trying to keep Senator Jennings from being embarrassed by having this rehashed  --  and of course I 'll study the report myself , but let me get this straight : was there any suggestion that George Graney was an inexperienced or careless pilot ? " " Absolutely none . He had an impeccable record , Congressman . He had been in air combat through the Korean War , then worked for United for a couple of years . This kind of flying was child 's play to him . " " How about his equipment ? " " Always in top shape . His mechanics were good . "  | " So the pilot 's widow has a valid reason to be upset that the blame for the crash got laid at George Graney 's doorstep . " Larry blew a smoke ring the size of a cruller . " You bet she does -- more than valid . "  |p191At  ten minutes past four , Pat managed to reach Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without mentioning their quarrel , she told him about Eleanor Brown . " I could n't stop her . She was determined to turn herself in . " " Calm down , Pat . I 'll send a lawyer to see her . How long will you1 be at the network ? " " I do n't know . Have you seen the Tribune today ? " " Just the headlines . " " Read the second section . A columnist I met the other night heard where I lived and rehashed everything . " " Pat , I 'll be here . Come over when you finish at the network . " Luther was waiting for her in his office . She had expected to be treated as a pariah . Instead , he was fairly restrained . " The Apple Junction shooting went well , " he told her . " It snowed there yesterdayand that whole cruddy backwoods looked like the American dream . We caught the Saunders house , the high school with the creche in front and Main Street with its Christmas tree . We put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junction , Birthplace of Senator Abigail Foster Jennings . ' " Luther puffed on a cigarette . " That old lady , Margaret Langley , was a good interview . Kind of classy-looking and quaint . Nice touch having her talk about what a dedicated student the Senator was and showing the yearbook . " Pat realized that somehow it had become Luther 's idea to do background shots in Apple Junction . " Have you seen the footage from last night and this morning ? " she asked . " Yes . It 's okay . You might have gotten a little more of Abigailp192actually working at her desk . The sequence at Christmas dinner was fine . " " Surely you 've seen today 's Tribune ? " " Yes . " Luther ground his cigarette into the ashtray and reached for another one . His voice changed . Telltale red spots appeared in his cheeks . " Pat , would you mind laying your cards on the table and explaining why you gave out that story ? " " Why I what ? " Now the restraint in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would consider it coincidence that so much has happened this week to give the Senator sensational publicity . I happen not to believe in coincidence . I agree with what Abigail said after that first picture came out in the Mirror . You 've been out from day one to force us to produce this program your way . And I think you 've used every trick in the books to get personal publicity for yourself . There is n't anyone in Washington who is n't talking about Pat Traymore . " " If you believe that , you ought to fire me . " " And give you more headlines ? No way . But just as a matter of curiosity , will you answer a few questions for me ? " " Go ahead . " " The first day in this office , I told you to edit out any reference to Congressman Adams and his wife . Did you know you were renting their house ? " " Yes , I did . " " Would n't it have been natural to mention it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out every single picture of them from the Senator 's material  --  and incidentally , I did a damn good job of it . Have you run through all those films ? " " Yes . You did do a good job . Then suppose you tell me your reasoning for the threats . Anyone who knows the business would realize that whether or not you worked on the program it was going to be completed . " Pat chose her words carefully . " I think the threats were just that  --  threats . I do n't think anyone ever meant to harm me , just scare me off . I think that someone is afraid to have the program made and thought that if I did n't do it the project would be dropped . " She paused , then added deliberately , " That person could n't know I 'm just a figurehead in a campaign to make Abigail Jennings Vice President . " " Are you trying to insinuate ... ? " " No , not insinuate : state . Look , I fell for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here to do three months ' work in a week , for having the material for the program spoon-fed to me by you and the Senator . The little claim this program will have to being an honest documentary is because of the segments I had to force down your throats . It 's only because of the rotten publicity I 've inadvertently caused Abigail Jennings that I 'm going to do my best to make this program work for her . But I warn you , when it 's over , there are some things I intend to investigate . " " Such as ... ? " " Such as Eleanor Brown , the girl who was convicted of embezzlingthe campaign funds . I saw her today . She was about to turn herself in to the police . And she swears she never touched that money . " Eleanor Brown turned herself in ? " Luther interrupted . " We can make a plus out of that . As a parole violater , she wo n't get bail . " " Congressman Kingsley is trying to have bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see that she stays put until the President makes his appointment . After that , who cares ? She had a fair trial . We 'll talk about the case on the program just as we 've written it , only we 'll add the fact that because of the program she turned herself in . That 'll spike her guns if she wants to make trouble . " Pat felt that somehow she had betrayed her trust . " I happen to think that girl is innocent , and if she is , I 'll fight to get her a new trial . " " She 's guilty , " Luther snapped . " Otherwise why did she break parole ? She 's probably gone through that seventy thousand bucks now and wants to be able to stop running . Do n't forget : a panel of jurors convicted her unanimously . You still believe in the jury system , I hope ? Now , is there anything else ? Any single thing that you know that could reflect badly on the Senator ? " She told him about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network ? " Luther looked immenselypleased . " And you 're worried about that ? " " If she starts gossiping about the Jennings marriage . . . the very fact that the Senator was n't left a penny by her mother-in-law . " Abigail will have the wholehearted support of every woman in America who 's put up with a miserable mother-in-law . As far as the Jennings marriage goes , it 's this Graney woman 's word against the Senator and Toby ... do n't forget he was a witness to their last time together . And what about the letter you gave me that thep194Senator wrote to her husband ? That 's dated only a few days before he died . " " We assume that . Someone else could point out that she never filled in the year . " " She can fill it in now if necessary . Anything else ? " " To the best of my knowledge those are the only two places where the Senator might have unfavorable publicity . I 'm prepared to give my word of honor on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm taking a crew to tape the Senator going into her home this evening  --  that end-of-the-day working scene . " " Do n't you want me at that taping ? " " I want you as far away from Abigail Jennings as you can get until she has time to calm down . Pat , have you read your contract with this network carefully ? " " I think so . " " Then you do realize we have the right to cancel your employmenthere for a specified cash settlement ? Frankly , I do n't buy the cock-and-bull story that someone is trying to keep this program from being made . But I almost admire you for having made yourself a household word in Washington , and you 've done it by piggybackingonto a woman who 's dedicated her whole life to public service . " " Have you read my contract ? " Pat asked . " I wrote it . " " Then you do know you gave me creative control of the projects to which I 'm assigned . Do you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of Luther 's office , sure that everyone in the newsroom was listening to them . Luther 's last words echoed through the room : " By this time next week the terms of your contract will be moot . " It was one of the few times in her life that Pat slammed a door . Fifteen minutes later she was giving her name to the desk clerk in Sam 's apartment building . Sam was waiting in the hallway when the elevator stopped at his floor . " Pat , you look bushed , " he told her . " I am . " Wearily she looked up at him . He was wearing the same Argyle sweater he 'd had on the night before . With a stab of pain she noted again how it brought out the blueness of his eyes . He took her arm and they walked down the long corridor . Inside the apartment , her immediate impression was surprise atp195the decor . Charcoal gray sectional furniture was grouped in the center of the room . The walls had a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wall-to-wall in a tweedy **30;12988;TOOLONG . Somehow in Sam 's home she 'd expected a more traditional look  --  a couch with arms , easy chairs , family pieces . An Oriental , however worn , would have been a distinct improvement over the carpet . He asked her what she thought of the place and she told him . Sam 's eyes crinkled . " You sure know how to get invited back , do n't you ? You 're right , of course . I wanted to make a clean sweep , start over , and naturally outdid myself . I agree . This place does look like a motel lobby . " " Then why stay here ? I gather you have other options . " " Oh , the apartment is fine , " Sam said easily . " It 's just the furniturethat bugs me . I rang out the old but did n't know exactly what the new was supposed to be . " It was a half joking statement that suddenly assumed too much weight . " By any chance , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Sure do . " He went over to the bar . " Lots of soda , one ice cube , twist of lemon if possible , but do n't worry if you 're out of lemon . " He smiled . " I 'm sure I do n't sound that wimpy . " " Not wimpy , just considerate . " He mixed the drinks and placed them on the cocktail table . " Sit down and do n't be so fidgety . How did the studio go ? " " By this time next week I probably wo n't have a job . You see , Luther really thinks I 'm pulling all this as a publicity stunt and he rather admires my moxie for trying it . " " I think Abigail has somewhat the same view . " Pat raised an eyebrow . " I 'm sure you 'd be the first to know . Sam , I hardly expected to call you so quickly after last night . In fact , my guess would have been a nice three-month cooling-off period before we met as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I certainly ca n't look to Luther Pelham for it . So I 'm afraid you 're elected . " " Not exactly the reason I 'd choose to hear from you , but I 'm glad to be of service . " Sam was different today . She could feel it . It was as though that vacillating aimlessness were missing . " Sam , there was somethingp196else about the break-in . " As calmly as possible , she told him about the Raggedy Ann doll . " And now the doll is gone . " " Pat , are you telling me that someone has been back in your house without you knowing it ? " " Yes . " " Then you 're not going to spend another minute there . " Restlessly she got up and walked over to the window . " That is n't the answer . Sam , in a crazy way the fact that the doll is gone is almost reassuring . I do n't think whoever has been threatening me really intends to hurt me . Otherwise he certainly would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the program might do to him . And I 've got some ideas . " Quickly she explained her analysis of the Eleanor Brown case . " If Eleanor Brown was n't lying , Toby was . If Toby was lying , the Senator was covering up for him , and that seems incredible . But suppose another person was involved who could imitate Toby 's voice , who knew about Eleanor 's storeroom and planted just enough of the money to make her look guilty ? " 66How do you explain the doll and the threats ? " " I think someone who knew me when I was little , and may have recognized me , is trying to scare me and stop this program . Sam , what do you make of this ? Toby knew me when I was little . Toby has become truly hostile toward me . I thought at first it was because of the Senator and all the bad publicity , but the other day he kept eyeing the library as though he was casing it . And after he left , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to follow him to slide the safety bolt . He tried to say he was just testing the lock and that anyone could get in and I should be careful . I fell for that  --  but Sam , I really am nervous about him . Could you have him checked out and see if he 's ever been in trouble ? I mean real trouble ? " " Yes , I can . I never liked that bird myself . " He came up behind her , put his arms around her waist . In an instinctive reaction she leaned back against him . " I 've missed you , Pat . " " Since last night ? " " No , since two years ago . " " You could have fooled me . " For a moment she gave herself up to the sheer joy of being close to him ; then she turned and faced him . " Sam , a little residual affection does n't add up to what I want . So why do n't you just ... " His arms were tight around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm fresh out of residual affection . "  |p197For  long moments they stood there , silhouetted against the window . Finally Pat stepped back . Sam let her go . They looked at each other . " Pat , " he said , " everything you said last night was true except one thing . There is absolutely nothing between Abigail and me . Can you give me a little time to find myself again ? I did n't know until I saw you this week that I 've been functioning like a zombie . " She tried to smile . " You seem to forget , I need some time too . Memory Lane is n't as simple as I expected it to be . " " Do you think you 're getting honest impressions of that night ? " " Honest , perhaps , but not particularly desirable . I 'm beginning to believe my mother may have been the one who went crazy that night , and somehow that 's harder . " " Why do you think that ? " " It 's not why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests me now . Well , one more day and The Life and Times of Abigail Jennings ' will be presented to the world . And at that point I start doing some real investigating . I just wish to God this whole thing was n't so rushed . Sam , there 's too much that does n't hang together . And I do n't care what Luther Pelham thinks . That segmentabout the plane crash is going to blow up in Abigail 's face . Catherine Graney means business . " She declined his invitation to dinner . " This has been a grueling day . I was up at four o'clock to get ready for the Senator 's office , and tomorrow we finish taping . I 'm going to fix a sandwich and be in bed by nine o'clock . " At the door , he held her once more . " When I 'm seventy , you 'll be forty-nine . " " And when you 're one hundred and three , I 'll be eighty-two . You 'll get a trace on Toby and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Of course . " When Pat left , Sam phoned Jack Carlson and quickly told him what Pat had confided . Jack whistled . " You mean that guy 's been back ? Sam , you really have a loony . Sure we can check this Toby character , but do me a favor . Get me a sample of his handwriting , can you ? "  |p198Detective  Barrott was kind . He believed she was telling the truth . But the older detective was hostile . Over and over Eleanor an- , swered the same questions from him . How could she tell them where she was keeping seventy thou sand dollars that she 'd never even seen ? Was she angry at Patricia Traymore for preparing the program that might force her out of hiding ? No , of course not . At first she was afraid and then she knew she could n't hide anymore , that she 'd be glad if it were over . Did she know where Patricia Traymore lived ? Yes , Father had told her that Patricia Traymore lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that house once . He 'd been on the ambulancesquad of Georgetown Hospital when that awful tragedy had happened . Break into that house ? Of course not . How could she ? In the cell she sat on the edge of the bunk wondering how she could have thought she was strong enough to go back into this world . The steel bars and the insulting intimacy of the open toilet , the sense of entrapment , the haunting depression that like a black fog was beginning to envelop her . She lay on the bunk and wondered where Father had gone . It was impossible that they seemed to be suggesting he would deliberately hurt anyone . He was the kindest man she had ever known . But he had been terribly nervous after Mrs. Gillespie died . She hoped he would n't be angry that she had given herself up . They would have arrested her anyway . She was sure Detective Barrott was planning to investigate her . Had Father gone away ? Probably . With growing concern Eleanor thought of the many times he had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early dinner in a cafeteria on 14th Street . He chose beef stew , lemon meringue pie and coffee . He ate slowly and carefully . It was important that he eat well now . It might be days before he had a hot meal again . His plans were made . After dark he would go back to Patricia Traymore 's house . He 'd slip in through the upstairs window . He 'd settle himself in the closet in the guest room . He 'd bring cans of j soda ; he still had one of the Danish pastries and two of the rolls from this morning in his pocket . He 'd better pick up some cans of juice too . And maybe he should get some peanut butter and rye bread . That would be enough to hold him over until he saw the program the next night . He had to spend ninety of his precious dollars on a miniature black-and-white TV with a headset . That way he could watch the program right in Patricia Traymore 's house . On the way to her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't take the chance of crying out in his sleep . Oh , she 'd probably never hear him from her room , but he could n't risk it . Forty minutes later he was in Georgetown , two streets from PatriciaTraymore 's home . The whole area was quiet , more quiet than he would have liked . Now that the Christmas shopping was over , a stranger was more likely to be noticed . The police might even be keeping a watch on Miss Traymore 's house . But the fact that she had the corner property helped . The house behind hers was dark . Arthur slipped into the yard of the unlighted house . The wooden fence that separated the backyards was n't high . He dropped his shopping bag over the fence , making sure that it slid down onto a snowbank , and then easily climbed over . He waited . There was n't a sound . Miss Traymore 's car was n't in the driveway . Her house was totally dark . It was awkward getting up the tree with the shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he could feel its rough coldness through his gloves . Without the tiers of branches , he could not have made it . The window was stiff and hard to raise . When he stepped over the sill into the room , the floorboards creaked heavily . For agonizing minutes he waited by the window , ready to bolt out again , to clamber down the tree and run across the yard . But there was only silence in the house . That and the occasional rumble of the furnace . He began to organize his hiding place in the closet . To his satisfac/tion he realized that the shelves were not attached to the walls . If he spread them out just a little , they would look as though they were touching the walls and no one would realize how much space he had in the triangular area behind him . Carefully he began to set up his secret place . He selected a thick quilt and laid it on the floor . It was large enough to use as a sleeping bag . He set up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four king-size pillows on the lowest shelf . In a few minutes he was settled . Now he needed to explore . Unfortunately , she had n't left any lights on . It meant he could move around only by holding his flashlight very low to the floor so no gleam could show out the window . Several times he practiced going back and forth between the guest bedroom and the master suite . He tested the floorboards and found the one that creaked . It took him twelve seconds to make his way down the hall from his closet to Pat 's room . He crept into her room and over to the vanity table . He had never seen such pretty objects . Her comb and mirror and brushes were all decorated with ornate silver . He took the stopper from the perfume bottle and inhaled the subtle fragrance . Then he went into the bathroom , noticed her negligee on the back of the door and tentatively touched it . Angrily he thought that this was the kind of clothing Glory would enjoy . Had the police gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be home now . He wanted to talk to her . He made his way over to the bed , found the phone on the night table and dialed . After the fourth ring he began to frown . She had talked about turning herself in to the police , but she would never do that after having promised she 'd wait . No , she was probably lying in bed , trembling , waiting to see if her picture was shown on the program tomorrow night . He replaced the phone on the night table but sat crouched by Pat 's bed . Already he missed Glory . He was keenly aware of the solitary quiet of the house . But he knew that soon his voices would come to join him.  | " That was fine , Senator , " Luther said . " Sorry I had to ask you to change . But we did want the look of a single working day , so you had to be wearing the same outfit coming home as going out . " " It 's all right . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in her living room . The camera crew were packing their equipment . Toby could see that Abigail had no intention of offering Pelham a drink . She just wanted to be rid of him . Luther was obviously getting the message . " Hurry up , " he snapped at the crew . Then he smiled ingratiatingly . " I know it 's been a long day for you , Abigail . Just one more session in the studio tomorrow morning and we 'll wrap it up . " " That will be the happiest moment in my life . " Toby wished Abigail could relax . They 'd gone for a drive and passed the Vice President 's mansion a couple of times . Abby had even joked about it : " Can you imagine what the columnists would say if they saw me casing the place ? " But as soon as the camera crew arrived , she 'd tensed up again . Pelham was putting on his coat . " The President has called a news conference for nine P.M. in the East Room tomorrow night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I believe I 've been invited , " she said . " That makes our timing excellent . The program will run between six-thirty and seven , so there wo n't be a schedule conflict for the viewers . " I 'm sure all of Washington is fainting with anticipation , " Abigail said . " Luther , I really am terribly tired . " " Of course . Forgive me . I 'll see you in the morning . Nine o'clock , if that 's all right . " " One minute more and I 'd have gone mad , " Abigail said whenp202she and Toby were finally alone . " And when I think all this is absolutely unnecessary ... " " No , , it 's not unnecessary , Senator , " Toby said soothingly . " You still have to be confirmed by Congress . Sure , you 'll get a majority , but it would be nice if a lot of people sent telegrams cheering your nomination along . The program can do that for you . " ) Iii that case it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more you want me for tonight ? " " No , I 'm going to bed early and read until I fall asleep . It 's been a long day . " She smiled , and he could see she was starting to unwind . " Which waitresses are you chasing now ? Or is it a poker game ? " Pat got home at six-thirty . She switched on the foyer light , but the stairs past the turn remained in shadow . Her father 's angry words suddenly echoed in her ears : " You should n't have come . " That last night the bell had run insistently ; her father had opened the door ; someone had brushed past him ; that person had been looking up  --  that is why she was so scared ; Daddy was angry and she was afraid she 'd been seen . Her hand shook as she placed it on the banister . There 's no use getting upset , she thought . It 's just that I 'm overtired and it 's been a rough day . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she undressed quickly and reached for the robe on the back of the door , then decided she would wear the brown velour caftan instead . It was warm and comfortable . At her dressing table she tied back her hair and began to cream her face . Mechanically her fingertips moved over her skin , rotating in the pattern the beautician had taught her , pressing for an instant against her temples , touching the faint scar near her hairline . The furniture behind her was reflected in the mirror ; the posts of the bed seemed like tall sentinels . She looked intently into the mirror . She had heard that if you picture an imaginary dot on your forehead and stare into it you can hypnotize yourself and retreat back into the past . For a full minute she concentrated on the imaginarydot , and had the odd sensation of watching herself walking backward into a tunnel ... and it seemed she was not alone . She had a sense of another presence . Ridiculous . She was getting lightheaded and fanciful . Going downstairs to the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced herself to eat.  |p203The  kitchen had a cozy , calming warmth . She and her mother and father must sometimes have eaten together here . Did she have a vague recollection of sitting on her father 's lap at this table ? Veronica had shown her their last Christmas card . It was signed Dean , Renee and Kerry . She said the names aloud , " Dean , Renee and Kerry " and wondered why the cadence seemed wrong . Rinsing the dishes and putting them in the dishwasher was a reason for delaying what she knew must be done . She had to study that newspaper article and see if it divulged any new facts about Dean and Renee Adams . The paper was still on the library table . Opening it to the center spread , she forced herself to read every line of the text . Much of it she already knew but that did not help to deaden the pain .. . " The gun smeared with both their fingerprints . . . Dean Adams had died instantly f r o m the bullet wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .... " One column emphasizedthe rumors her neighbors had gleefully picked up at the party : the marriage was clearly unhappy , Renee had urged her husband to leave Washington , she despised the constant round of receptions , she was jealous of the attention her husband attracted from other women ... . That quote from a neighbor : 66She was clearly besotted with him  --  and he had a roving eye . " There were persistent rumors that Renee , not Dean , had fired the gun . At the inquest , Renee 's mother had attempted to squelch that speculation . " It is not a mystery , " she said , " it is a tragedy . Only a few days before she was murdered , my daughter told me she was coming home with Kerry and would file for divorce and custody . I believe that her decision triggered his violence . " She could have been right , Pat thought . I remember tripping over a body . Why am I sure it was Mother 's , not his ? She was n't sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondpage . Willard Jennings was so scholarly-looking . Catherine Graneyhad said that he wanted to give up Congress and accept a college presidency . And Abigail had been an absolutely beautiful young woman . There was one rather blurred snapshot sandwiched in among the others . Pat glanced at it several times , then moved the paper so that the light shone directly on it . It was a candid shot that had been taken on the beach . Her father , her mother and Abigail were in a group with two other people . Her mother was absorbed in a book . The two strangers were lying onp204blankets , their eyes closed . The camera had caught her father and Abigail looking at each other . There was no mistaking the air of intimacy . There was a magnifying glass in the desk . Pat found it and held it over the picture . Magnified , Abigail 's expression became rapturous . Her father 's eyes were tender as they looked down at her . Their hands were touching . Pat folded the newspaper . What did the pictures mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women , probably encouragedtheir attention . Abigail had been a beautiful young widow . Maybe that was all it amounted to . As always when she was troubled , Pat turned to music . In the living room she plugged in the Christmas-tree lights and impulsivelyswitched off the chandelier . At the piano she let her fingers rove over the keys until she found the soft notes of Beethoven 's Pathetique . Sam had been himself again today , the way she 'd remembered him , strong and confident . He needed time . Of course he did . So did she . Two years ago they 'd felt so torn and guilty about their relationship . Now it could be different . Her father and Abigail Jennings . Had they been involved ? Had she just been one in a string of casual affairs ? Her father might have been a ladies ' man . Why not ? He was certainly attractive , and it was the style among rising young politicians then  --  look at the Kennedys .... Eleanor Brown . Had the lawyer been able to arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is innocent , Pat told herself  --  I am sure of it . Liszt 's Liebestraum . That was what she was playing now . And the Beethoven . She had unconsciously chosen both those pieces the other night as well . Had her mother played them here ? The mood of both of them was the same , plaintive and lonely . " Renee , listen to me . Stop playing and listen to me . " " I ca n't . Let me alone . " The voices  --  his troubled and urgent , hers despairing . They quarreled so much , Pat thought . After the quarrels she would play for hours . But sometimes , when she was happy , she 'd put me on the bench next to her . 6'No , Kerry , this way . Put your fingers here .... She can pick out the notes when I hum them . She 's a natural . " Pat felt her hands beginning the opening notes of Mendelsohn'sp205Opus 30 , Number 3 , another piece that suggested pain . She stood up . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was starting up the stairs again . " They wo n't release Eleanor Brown . They 're afraid she 'll jump bail . It seems the man she 's living with is a suspect in some nursing-home deaths . " " Sam , I ca n't stand thinking of that girl in a cell . " " Frank Crowley , the lawyer I sent , thinks she 's telling the truth . He 's getting a transcript of her trial in the morning . We 'll do what we can for her , Pat . It may not be much , I 'm afraid .... How are you ? " " Just about to turn in . " " The place locked up ? " " Bolted tight . " " Good . Pat , it may be all over but the shouting . Quite a few of us have been invited to the White House tomorrow night . The President'smaking an important announcement . Your name is on the media list . I checked . " " Sam , do you think ... ? " " I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the President is really playing it close . None of the possible appointees has been given Secret Service protection yet . That 's always a tip-off . I guess the President wants to keep everyone guessing until the last minute . But no matter who gets it , you and I will go out and.celebrate . " " Suppose you do n't agree with his choice ? " " At this point I do n't give a damn whom he chooses . I 've got other things in mind . I want to celebrate just being with you . I want to catch up on the last two years . After we stopped seeing each other , the only way I could get over missing you was to tell myself why it would n't have worked even if I was free . After a while , I guess I started to believe my own lies . " Pat 's laugh was shaky . She blinked back the sudden moisture in her eyes . " Apology accepted . " " Then I want to talk about not wasting any more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .... " " Neither of us does . " Even his voice was different  --  confident , strong , the way she had remembered it all those nights she had lain awake thinking about him . " Pat , I fell hopelessly in love with you that day on Cape Cod . Nothing will ever change that . I 'm so damn grateful you waited for me. "  | " I had no choice . Oh , God , Sam , it 's going to be marvelous . I love you so . " For minutes after they said goodbye , Pat stood with her hand resting on the telephone as though by touching it , she could hear again every single word Sam had uttered . Finally , still smiling softly , she started up the stairs . A sudden creaking sound overhead startled her . She knew what it was . That one board on the upstairs landing which always moved when she stepped on it . Do n't be ridiculous , she told herself . The hallway was poorly lit by flame-shaped bulbs in wall sconces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and walked toward the back of the house . Deliberately she stepped on the loose board and listened as it responded with a distinct creak ing . I 'd swear that 's the sound I heard . She went into her old bedroom . Her footsteps echoed on the uncarpeted floor . The room was stuffy and hot . The door of the guest bedroom was not quite closed . It was much cooler in there . She felt a draft and walked over to the window . The window was open from the top . She tried to close it , then realized the sash cord was broken . That 's what it is , she thought ; there 's probably enough draft to make the door sway . Even so , she opened the closet and glanced at the shelves of bedding and linen . In her room she undressed quickly and got into bed . It was ridiculousto still feel so jittery . Think about Sam ; think about the life that they would have together . Her last impression before she began to doze was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make sense , but she was too tired to think about it . With a sigh of relief , Catherine Graney reversed the sign on the shop door from " OPEN " to " CLOSED . " For the day after Christmas , business had been unexpectedly brisk . A buyer from Texas had bought the pair of Rudolstadt figura candelabra , the marquetry game tables and the Stouk carpet . It had been a most impressive sale . Catherine turned off the lights in her shop and went upstairs to her apartment , Sligo at her heels . She had laid a fire that morning . Now she touched a match to the paper under the kindling . Sligo settled in his favorite spot . Going into the kitchen , she began to fix dinner . Next week whenp207young George was here she 'd enjoy cooking big meals . But a chop and a salad were all she wanted now . George had called her the day before to wish her a merry Christmasand to tell her the news . He 'd been promoted to major . " Twenty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd exclaimed . " By God , would your Dad be proud . " Catherine put her chop under the broiler . One more good reason not to let Abigail Jennings smear George senior 's name any longer . She wondered what Abigail had thought of the letter . She had worked and reworked it before mailing it Christmas Eve . At eleven o'clock she watched the news . At eleven-thirty Sligo nuzzled her hand . " I know , " she groaned . " Okay , get your leash . " The evening was dark . Earlier there 'd been some stars , but now the sky was clouded over . The breeze was raw , and Catherine pulled up the collar of her coat . " This is going to be one quick walk , " she told Sligo . There was a path through the woods near her house . Usually she and Sligo cut through there and then walked back around the block . Now he strained at the leash , rushing her through the path to his favorite bushes and trees . Then he stopped abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , " Catherine said impatiently . All that she 'd need would be for him to go after a skunk . Sligo leaped forward . Bewildered , Catherine watched as a hand shot out and grabbed the old animal in a lock around the neck . There was a sickening cracking sound , and Sligo 's limp body dropped onto the hardened snow . Catherine tried to scream , but no sound came . The hand that had snapped Sligo 's neck was raised over her head , and in the instant before she died , Catherine Graney finally understood what had happened that long-ago day . I must insist you take the opportunity on the upcoming program to publicly acknowledge that there has never been a shred of proof to indicate that pilot error caused your husband 's fatal accident . It is not enough to no longer smear George Graney 's reputation : you must set the record straight . If you do not , I will sue you for libel and reveal your true relationship with Willard Jennings.  |p208On  the morning of December 27 , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAA investigation into the crash that had killed Congressman Willard Jennings , underlined a particular sentence and phoned Jack Carlson . " How are you coming with that report on Toby Gorgone ? " " I 'll have it by eleven . " " Are you free for lunch ? I have something to show you . " It was the sentence from the transcript : " Congressman Jennings ' chauf feur , Toby Gorgone , placed his luggage on the plane . " Sam wanted to read the report on Toby before discussing it . They agreed to meet at the Gangplank Restaurant at noon . Next Sam phoned Frank Crowley , the attorney he 'd hired to represent Eleanor Brown , and invited him to the same lunch . " Can you have the transcript of Eleanor Brown 's trial with you ? " " I 'll make sure I have it , Sam . " The coffee was perking . Sam poured a cup and turned on the kitchen radio . Most of the nine-o'clock news was over . The weathermanwas now promising a partly sunny day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the headlines were recapped , including the fact that the body of a prominent antiques dealer , Mrs. Catherine Graney of Richmond , had been found in a wooded area near her home . Her dog 's neck had been broken . Police be lieved the animal had died trying to defend her . Catherine Graney dead ! Just as she 'd been about to blow open a potential scandal involving Abigail . " I do n't believe in coincidence , " Sam said aloud . " I just do n't believe in it . " For the rest of the morning he agonized over his suspicions Several times he reached for the phone to call the White House Each time he withdrew his hand.  |p209He  had absolutely no proof that Toby Gorgone was anything but what he appeared to be , a devoted bodyguard-chauffeur for Abigail . Even if Toby was guilty of the crime , he had absolutely no proof that Abigail was aware of his activities . The President would announce the appointment of Abigail that night . Sam was sure of it . But the confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch a thorough investigation . And this time I 'll make sure there 's no whitewash , he thought grimly . Somehow Sam was sure that Toby was responsible for the threats to Pat . If he had anything to hide , he would n't want her digging into the past . If he turned out to be the one who had threatened her .. . Sam clenched his hands into fists . He was no longer thinking of himself as a grandfather-to-be . Abigail twisted her hands nervously . " We should have left earlier , " she said , " we 're in all the traffic . Step on it . " " Do n't worry , Senator , " Toby said soothingly . " They ca n't start taping without you . How did you sleep ? " " I kept waking up . All I could think of was ' I am going to be Vice President of the United States . ' Turn on the radio . Let 's see what they 're saying about me ... . The eight-thirty CBS news was just beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a news conference for this evening is to announce his choice of either Senator Abigail Jennings or Senator Claire Lawrence as Vice President of the United States , the first woman to be so honored . " And then : " In a tragic coincidence , it has been learned that Mrs. Catherine Graney , the Richmondantiques dealer found murdered while walking her dog , is the widow of the pilot who died twenty-seven years ago in a plane crash with Congressman Willard Jennings . Abigail Jennings began her political career when she was appointed to complete her husband'sterm ... . " Toby ! " He glanced into the rearview mirror . Abigail looked shocked . " Toby , how awful . " " Yeah , it 's lousy . " He watched as Abigail 's expression hardened . " I 'll never forget how Willard 's mother went to that woman and sat with her when the plane was overdue . She never even called to see how I was . "  | " Well , they 're together now , Abby . Look how fast the traffic is moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As they pulled into the private parking area , Abigail asked quietly , " What did you do last night , Toby  --  play poker or have a date ? " " I saw the little lady from Steakburger and spent the evening with her . Why ? You checking on me ? You want to talk to her , Senator ? " Now his tone had an indignant edge . " No , of course not . You 're welcome to your cocktail waitresses , on your own time . I hope you enjoyed yourself . " " I did . I have n't been taking much personal time lately . " " I know . I 've kept you awfully busy . " Her voice was conciliatory . " It 's just . . . " Just what , Senator ? " " Nothing . . , nothing at all . " At eight o'clock Eleanor was taken for a lie-detector test . She had slept surprisingly well . She remembered that first night in a cell eleven years ago when she had suddenly started to scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychiatrist had told her after the breakdown . But now there was a curious peacefulness about not running anymore . Could Father have hurt those old people ? Eleanor racked her brain , trying to remember a single example of his being anything but kind and gentle . There was none , " This door . " The matron led her into a small room near the cellblock . Detective Barrott was reading the newspaper . She was glad he was there . He did n't treat her as though she were a liar . He looked up at her and smiled . Even when another man came in and hooked her to the liedetectormachine , she did n't start to cry the way she had after her arrest for stealing from the Senator . Instead , she sat in the chair , held up her doll and a little embarrassed , asked if they 'd mind if she kept it with her . They did n't act as though it were a crazy request . Frank Crowley , that nice fatherly-looking man who was her lawyer , came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't pay him more than the nearly five hundred dollars she 'd saved , but he told her not to worry about it . " Eleanor , you can still refuse to take this test , " he told her now , and she said that she understood . At first the man who was giving her the test asked simple , evenp211silly , questions about her age and education and her favorite food . Then he started asking the ones she 'd been gearing herself to hear . " Have you ever stolen anything ? " " No . " " Not even anything small , like a crayon or a piece of chalk when you were little ? " The last time she 'd been asked that , she 'd started sobbing , " I 'm not a thief . I 'm not a thief . " But now it was n't that hard . She pretendedshe was talking to Detective Barrott , not this brusque , impersonalstranger . " I 've never , ever stolen anything in my life , " she said earnestly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't take anything that belonged to anyone else . " " What about the bottle of perfume when you were in high school ? " " I did not steal it . I swear to you . I forgot to give it to the clerk ! " " How often do you drink ? Every day ? " " Oh , no . I just have wine sometimes , and not very much . It makes me sleepy . " She noticed that Detective Barrott smiled . " Did you take the seventy-five thousand dollars from Senator Jennings ' campaign office ? " Last time during the test , she 'd gotten hysterical at that question . Now she simply said , " No , I did not . " " But you put five thousand dollars of that money in your storage room , did n't you ? " " No , I did not . " " Then how do you think it got there ? " The questions went on and on . " Did you lie when you claimed Toby Gorgone phoned ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it was Toby Gorgone ? " " I thought it was . If it was n't , it sounded just like him . " Then the incredible questions began : " Did you know Arthur Stevens was a suspect in the death of one of his patients , a Mrs. Anita Gillespie ? " She almost lost control . " No , I did not . I ca n't believe that . " Then she remembered the way he 'd yelled in his sleep : " Close your eyes , Mrs. Gillespie . Close your eyes ! " " You do believe it 's possible . It shows up right in this test . " " No , " she whispered . " Father could never have hurt anyone , only help them . He takes it so to heart when one of his patients is in pain " Do you think he might try to stop the pain ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " I think you do . Eleanor , Arthur Stevens tried to set fire to the nursing home on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shock of what she was hearing made Eleanor blanch . Horrified , she stared at the interrogator as he asked his last question ; " Did you ever have any reason to suspect that Arthur Stevens was a homicidal maniac ? " During the night Arthur swallowed caffeine pills every two hours . He could not risk falling asleep and calling out . Instead he sat crouched in the closet , too tense to lie down , staring into the dark . He 'd been so careless . When Patricia Traymore came home , he 'd listened at the door of the closet to the sounds of her moving around the house . He 'd heard the roar of the pipes when she showered ; she 'd gone back downstairs and he 'd smelled coffee perking . Then she had begun playing the piano . Knowing it was safe to go out , he 'd sat on the landing listening to the music . That was when the voices started talking to him again , telling him that when this was over he must find a new nursing home where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in meditation that he had n't realized that the music had stopped , had n't thought about where he was until he heard Patricia Traymore 's footsteps on the stairs . In his rush to get to his hiding place he 'd stepped on the loose board , and she had known something was wrong . He had n't dared to breathe when she opened the door of the closet . But of course it never occurred to her to look behind the shelves . And so he had kept watch all night , straining for the sounds of her awakening , glad when she finally left the house , but afraid to leave the closet for more than a few minutes at a time . A housekeeper might come in and hear him . The long hours passed . Then the voices directed him to take the brown robe from Patricia Traymore 's closet and put it on . If she had betrayed Glory , he would be suitably clothed to mete out her punishment.  |p213Pat  arrived at the network building at nine thirty-five and decided to have coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ready for the charged atmosphere , underlying irritability and explosivenerves that she knew would be waiting on this final day of taping and editing . Her head was vaguely throbbing , her whole body sore . She knew that she had slept restlessly and that her dreams had been troubled . At one point she had cried out , but she could n't remember what she had said . In the car she had turned on the news and learned about CatherineGraney 's death . She could n't put the image of the woman out of her mind . The way her face had brightened when she talked about her son ; the affectionate pat she had given her aging Irish setter . Catherine Graney would have followed through on her threat to sue Senator Jennings and the network after the program was aired . Her death had ended that threat . Had she been the random victim of a mugger ? The report had said she was walking her dog . What was his name ? Sligo ? It seemed unlikely that a criminal would choose to attack a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English muffin . She was n't hungry . Only three days ago she had shared coffee with Catherine Graney . Now that attractive , vibrant woman was dead . When she reached the studio , Luther was already on the set , his face mottled , his lips bloodless , his eyes constantly roving , hunting for flaws . " I said to get rid of those flowers ! " he was shouting . " I do n't give a damn whether they were just delivered or not . They look dead . Ca n't anybody do anything right around here ? And that chair is n't high enough for the Senator . It looks like a goddamn milking stool . " He spotted Pat . " I see you 're finally here . You heardp214about that Graney woman ? We 'll have to redo the segment of Abi gall talking about traffic safety . She comes across a little too heav on the pilot . There 's bound to be backlash when people find out his widow is a crime victim . We start taping in ten minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and decent person and all this man cared about was that her death had caused a setback in the taping . Wordlessly she turned and went into the dressing room . Senator Jennings was seated in front of a mirror , a towel wrapped around her shoulders . The makeup artist was anxiously hovering over her , dabbing a touch of powder on her nose . The Senator 's fingers were tightly locked together . Her greeting was cordial enough . " This is it , Pat . Will you be as glad to be finished as I ? " " Yes , I think so , Senator . " The makeup girl picked up the can of hair spray and tested it . " Do n't use that stuff on me , " the Senator snapped . " I do n't want to look like a Barbie doll . " " I 'm sorry . " The girl 's tone faltered . " Most people ... " Her voice trailed off . Aware that Abigail was watching her in the mirror , Pat deliberatelyavoided eye contact . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abigail 's tone was brisk and businesslike . " I 'm just as glad we 're redoing the airsafetysegment , even though of course it 's terrible about Mrs. Graney . But I want to come off more emphatically on the necessity for better facilities at small airports . And I 've decided we should tally more about my mother . There 's no use not meeting that Mirror picture and that spread in yesterday 's Tribune head on . And we should certainly emphasize my role in foreign affairs . I 've prepared some questions for you to ask me . " Pat put down the brush she was holding and turned to face the Senator . " Have you ? " Four hours later , over sandwiches and coffee , a small group sat in the projection room viewing the completed tape . Abigail was in the first row , Luther and Philip on either side of her . Pat sat several rows behind them with the assistant director . In the last row , Toby kept his solitary vigil . The program opened with Pat , Luther and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and welcome to the first program in our seriesp215Women in Government .... " Pat studied herself critically . Her voice was huskier than usual ; there was something in the rigid way she was sitting that suggested tension . Luther was totally at ease , and on the whole , the opening sounded all right . She and Abigail complemented each other well . Abigail 's blue silk dress had been a ood choice ; it expressed femininity without frills . Her smile waswarm , her eyes crinkled . Her acknowledgment of the flattering h production had no hint of coyness. ey discussed her position as senior Senator from Virginia . Abiail : " It 's a tremendously demanding and satisfying job .... " The , montage of shots of Apple Junction . The shot of Abigail with herother . Pat watched the screen as Abigail 's voice became tender . My mother faced the same problem as so many working mothersday . She was widowed when I was six . She did n't want to leave megone and so she took a job as a housekeeper . She sacrificed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home frompool . We were very close . She was always embarrassed about her eight . She had a glandular problem . I guess a lot of people canderstand . When I tried to get her to live with Willard and me , e 'd laugh and say , No way is the mountain coming to Washingkn . ' She was a funny , dear lady . " At that point Abigail 's voice trembled . And then Abigail explained the beauty contest : " Talk $bout win it for the Gipper . . . I won that for Mommy .... " Pat found herself caught in the spell of Abigail 's warmth . Even the scene in Abigail 's den when the Senator had caller her mother a fat tyrant seemed unreal now . But it was real , she thought . Abigail Jennings is a consummate actress . The clips of the reception and theIrst campaign . Pat 's questions to Abigail : " Senator , you were a oung bride ; you were completing your last year in college and you were helping your husband campaign for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . " Abigail 's answer : " It was wonderLIwas very much in love . I 'd always pictured myself getting a job an assistant to someone in public office . To be there right at the beginning was thrilling . You see , even though a Jennings had always held that seat , Willard 's competition was stiff . The night we heard Willard had been elected  --  I ca n't describe it . Every election victoryis exciting , but the first one is unforgettable . " The clip with the Kennedys at Willard Jennings ' birthday party ... Abigail said , " We were all so young . . . . There were three or four couples who used to get together regularly and we 'd sit around for hours talking . We were all so sure we could help to change
