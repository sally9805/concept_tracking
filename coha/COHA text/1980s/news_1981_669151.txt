Before , only half of your estate could be left to your spouse free of gift or estate tax . Now , you can leave it all. // But if you already have a will , don ' t think you can just keep it in the safe-deposit box and let changes like this take effect on their own . To get the benefit of the new estate tax provisions , millions of people will have to revise their wills. // Many wills  --  particularly for people in upper income brackets  --  state that a surviving spouse is to receive the maximum possible estate that can be passed on free of tax. // Since the new provisions take effect in the new year , these wills should be amended immediately to give the spouse the entire estate tax-free . Otherwise , the old rule will apply . So if a will was executed before Sept. 12 , 1981 ( a date set by Congress ) , or not amended after that date to refer to the unlimited marital deduction , your spouse won ' t get to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified , the part providing for maximum marital deduction will be interpreted to mean the maximum in effect when the will was written. // Part of the reason Congress changed the tax rules was to redress the effects of inflation . It accepted the view that many family farms and businesses had to be sold simply to pay estate taxes. // But a large estate could still be a problem for some families , when the surviving spouse dies , because while the first transfer can be made tax-free the ' ' second transfer ' ' cannot. // However , taxes on this transfer can be legally avoided with some foresight , says Fred Van Liew , executive vice-president in the trust and investments department at Hospital Trust Company in Providence , R.I. If there are children , this means setting up a trust to provide for the needs of the spouse and leaving the rest of the estate to the kids and anyone else you want to remember in your will. // Some of the other changes in the estate tax laws will be phased in gradually and won ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to push up the value of an estate - particularly real estate - tax breaks and exclusions that appear attractive in 1982 may be out of date in 1987. // If there are beneficiaries other than the spouse , the amount that can be transferred to them tax-free goes up gradually until it reaches $600 , 000 in 1987 . Also , the ' ' unified credit ' ' that can be applied to these transfers of wealth increases during the same period to $192 , 800 . **22;8370; <> **42;8394; **44;8438; **44;8484; <> **76;8530; <> Year <> **26;8608; Unified credit <> **26;8636; Tax-free transfers <> <> **76;8664; <> 1982 <> **26;8742; $62 , 800 <> **26;8770; $225 , 000 <> <> **76;8798; <> 1983 <> **26;8876; $79 , 300 <> **26;8904; $275 , 000 <> <> **76;8932; <> 1984 <> **26;9010; $96 , 300 <> **26;9038; $325 , 000 <> <> **76;9066; <> 1985 <> **26;9144; $121 , 800 <> **26;9172; $400 , 000 <> <> **76;9200; <> 1986 <> **26;9278; $155 , 800 <> **26;9306; $500 , 000 <> <> **76;9334; <> 1987 <> **26;9412; $192 , 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Before 1977 , a gift tax was imposed on transfers made during a person ' s life ; an estate tax was levied on transfers at death . Both had separate rate schedules and exemptions . After 1977 , the estate and gift tax rates were unified , as was the credit for both. ) // Another major change in the tax law makes a sharp increase in the amount of money that can be given as a tax-free gift . Before , the limit was $3 , 000 a year . Now , gifts can be made up to $10 , 000 a year to each of your relatives or others . A married couple can give $20 , 000 . Not only does this permit people to be more generous , it also provides a significant opportunity to transfer assets to a variety of people and organizations free of any gift or estate taxes. // For example , if Grandma and Grandpa want to leave a substantial sum to their four grandchildren , they could conceivably give them a total of up to $80 , 000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Mr. Van Liew points out . Most states have not yet raised the state $3 , 000 limit . And considering the revenue that could be lost by doing so , many are expected to keep the lower limits . Different state laws also apply to inheritance taxes and should be taken into account when you revise the will. // Many adults , of course , don ' t have a will at all . The fact that they should have one is not just an idea cooked up by lawyers trying to make a quick buck by writing them . If you are married and have a family , you need a will . If you are single , you would probably prefer to make your own decisions about who gets your posessions and money when you pass on , instead of having some judge make the choice for you. // Even a young , unmarried working person might like to leave some of his savings or property to a brother or sister , friend , or favorite charity , assuming his parents didn ' t need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent Monitor article about an investor who built a portfolio of art prints through his Keogh fund . Would it be feasible to invest after-tax dollars in something like art prints ? Or would taxes on profits or lack of knowledge of artworks make this impractical ?

Whether tax-sheltered cash or after-tax dollars are used makes little difference in the end . What does matter is how you might participate . The only way you can benefit from investing in collectibles is to buy something for a low price and sell it for a higher price . You get no financial income from holding collectibles . However , many collectors of art prints , cut crystal , jewelry , or many other fine things gain personal enjoyment from having such items around . Most successful collectors are usually experts .

One facet of collectibles is the big difference between bid and asked prices - often as much as 50 percent. // Readers are invited to send questions to Moneywise , The Christian Science Monitor , One Norway Street , Boston , Mass. , 02115 .
