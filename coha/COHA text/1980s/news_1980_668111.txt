We come to the halfway point of the 1980 season this weekend , the season that has made Ray Grebey a household name , sent kids to the breakfast table complaining about their rotator cuffs and put Al Cowens on the police blotter that once held the name of Frank Nitti . This has been the year that writers from the Arlington Heights ( Ill . ) Daily Herald have been assaulted by former journalist Dave Kingman and former coach Jim Piersall . Billy Martin has had marshmallows hurled at him in Minnesota , Reggie bars in Cleveland . Rich Murray was called up by the Giants and within 10 days we saw Willie McCovey and Mike Ivie retire and manager Dave Bristol punch out John Montefusco . Races ? Unless things change radically , the Yankees fall and the AL West invents a second team to challenge Kansas City , there may not be any . The races belong to the National League , with each of the three contenders in each division being able to claim that the best is yet to come . Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pitchers - Dave Goltz , Terry Forster , Don Stanhouse - but has ridden on the arms of Bob Welch and Jerry Reuss and the division ' s best lineup . Houston ' s J.R . Richard has more strikeouts than baserunners allowed , but Nolan Ryan ' s 5-6 mediocrity and the Astros ' inability to win on the road makes one wonder how they will stay in . The evolution of the Big Red Machine to the VW Rabbit diesel continues as Johnny Bench has 32 RBIs and has thrown out only one of five potential base stealers , George Foster has 31 RBIs and won ' t cross warning tracks , David Concepcion is hitting .241 and Tom Seaver is disabled at3-5 . And they ' re in it . The Pirates have been battered , bruised , slumping ( they lost 9 of 10 in one stretch ) and have seen Kent Tekulve turn human but are still close . Watch out for their August get-together . The Expos , too , have had a number of injuries but just keep coming up with pitchers out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scott Sanderson , Charlie Lea etc. , and in one stretch , Woody Fryman retired 57 of 62 batters . The Phillies ' pitching has shown signs of coming together for the first time , while Pete Rose plays on . With a broken toe , he stole second , third and home against the Reds . It has been the year of the Reggies . If the MVP ballots were collected this morning , Messrs . Jackson and Smith would probably win over such names as George Hendrick , Steve Garvey , Gary Carter , Robin Yount , Willie Randolph and Willie Wilson . Cy Young award ? Steve Carlton should be unanimous in the NL , with Tommy John beating out Steve Stone , Ed Farmer , Tom Burgmeier and Larry Gura in the AL . Rookies ? Cleveland OF Joe Charbonneau and Chicago LHP Britt Burns in the American , Dodger OF Rudy Law in the National . The most surprising team has been the Mets , although the fact that Steve Henderson was grabbed at an airport for passing a counterfeit $20 bill he got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely in effect yet . Kansas City is the next most surprising . The most disappointing team is California - 29-48 . Don Baylor , Danny Ford and Brian Downing are hurt . Next is St. Louis , which lost two of its best starting pitchers , its manager , and is stuck with Bobby Bonds and his .189 . Injuries have been a big issue ( as when Fred Lynn couldn ' t play in Baltimore but could in Los Angeles ) . Darrell Porter and Downing C ; George Brett 1B ; Paul Molitor 2B ; Buddy Bell and Larry Parrish 3B ; Tim Foli SS ; Jim Rice , Larry Hisle , Amos Otis , Baylor , Ford OF ; Seaver , Vida Blue , Dave Frost , Bill Campbell , Randy Jones , John Fulgham , Stanhouse P. That ' s the Disabled List Team , which might have won the All-Star Game . Bill Lee was injured while jogging when he tried to avoid a cat ; Mike Parrott was hit in the groin by a line drive ; Milwaukee ' s Dick Davis pulled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt his shoulder when he was forced to pitch in 25-degree weather . Meanwhile , the Porter and Welch admissions open what may be the first look at baseball ' s traditional approval of alcohol and amphetamines . Cowens jumped Farmer over a broken jaw Cowens suffered a year ago , and the fight was so wild that Tiger first baseman Richie Hebner and White Sox manager Tony LaRussa almost came to blows . Hernandez and Fulgham went at it in front of a hotel . Bristol took on Montefusco in his office , and Bill Madlock did it in an umpire ' s face . The San Diego Padres have three complete games - all shutouts by Jones - and two players with as many as 20 RBIs . The Texas Rangers died in the heat , which at its peak forced manager Pat Corrales to tell his players not to spend time in the air-conditioned clubhouse because it would be bad for them . The team died in the bullpen , where Jim Kern is 2-10 and Sparky Lyle one day obliged a kid asking for a ball and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then his shirt , pants , socks . . . right down to his underwear . They also died at shortstop , where in one game Bud Harrelson took a called third strike on a suicide squeeze and Pepe Frias rolled the ball to the mound thinking the inning was over as the winning run scored . Bert Blyleven went home until such time as the Pirates could trade him . No one would deal for him . He returned . He ' s 2-9 . Righthanded hitters are so rare in the American League that Rickey Henderson of Oakland was the only righthanded-hitting outfielder on the All- Star team . Oakland has stolen home nine times , has a triple steal , squeezed successfully eight times and almost drove Sparky Anderson crazy . There was the triple play two weeks ago in Detroit when umpire Steve Palermo ruled that Chicago RF Harold Baines had caught Duffy Dyer ' s fly . Everyone else thought it was a trap , and when the triple play was finished , the runner who had been on first was standing on third and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dugout . Milwaukee ' s Charlie Moore slid back into first against Boston from the dugout when he realized he had failed to sacrifice , only to be called out for abandonment ( a la Kramer vs . Kramer ) .
