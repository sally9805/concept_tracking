But not until last June , after the failing plant was suddenly abandoned , was the E.P.A. able to move in and begin to clean up the site under provisions of the 1980 law that provide billions of dollars for that purpose. // And only then did the agency discover that things were even worse than had been thought : The plant contained potentially lethal and explosive chemicals , some of them exposed to open air . Among thousands of containers was a rusty , 4-foot-long cylinder of a highly unstable , lethal chemical called hydrogen cyanide . It had lain around the plant for years , a threat to explode at the first good jostle and spew the deadly substance into the nearby center of town. // // Unacceptably Slow to Some // To some environmentalists , what happened here illustrates the unacceptably slow pace at which hazardous waste sites are being cleaned up . And they say it dramatically points up the special difficulties of cleaning up sites owned by small operators like Elmer Fike , the longtime former owner of the Nitro plant. // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadly cylinder of hydrogen cyanide was destroyed harmlessly by the E.P.A. after much of this community of 8 , 000 people in West Virginia ' s Kanawha River Valley was evacuated . It came to that , says an E.P.A. official who was on the scene , largely because under the agency ' s present policy , a working business must be interrupted as little as possible by the enforcement of the Superfund law. // By " not interrupting this man ' s business , we now have a $13 million project on our hands , " says Harold Yates , the agency ' s spokesman on the Nitro situation . " It ' s a travesty , almost . " If E.P.A. policy had allowed earlier and more forceful intervention , Mr. Yates said , the site could have been cleaned up sooner and at less cost. // For Mr. Fike ' s part , he contends that the publicity accompanying the Government ' s intervention drove away his customers and made it financially impossible to clean up the plant himself . Eventually , he says , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 people at its peak . <> <> Company Complied at First // The Federal Government first came into the life of Fike Chemicals Inc. , which specialized in the production of custom-made chemicals for other manufacturers , in 1976 , when the E.P.A. ordered the company to eliminate the pollution of surface water , ground water and the plant itself by a number of hazardous chemical wastes . Several of the contaminants , according to the E.P.A. , were known or suspected agents of cancer in human beings. // The E.P.A. says that Mr. Fike complied at first , installing a carbon filtration system to screen chemicals out of water discharges , but then failed to maintain the system. // In 1980 , the agency filed a civil complaint against Fike Chemicals in Federal Court under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act , which regulates the management of hazardous wastes . The complaint charged that the company was endangering public health by improperly disposing of such wastes . In November 1982 , Fike Chemicals and the agency entered into a consent decree under which the company would undertake a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect. // Mr. Fike says the company borrowed the money to carry out the cleanup that , under the 1982 consent decree , was designed to eliminate the problem . The cost was estimated at $250 , 000 to $300 , 000 , he said. // In the meantime , Fike Chemicals was placed on E.P.A. ' s " national priorities list " - the Superfund list - identifying it as one of the worst hazardous waste sites in the country . Of the 1 , 177 sites now on the list , Fike ranks 489th . <> <> Policy on Interference // In going on the list , Mr. Yates said , Fike was assigned to the less urgent of two categories : " remedial " sites , where there is a chronic , long-term threat to public health . Sites in the other category , called " removal , " pose an immediate and substantial threat. // As a " remedial " site , Fike received the consideration that , according to E.P.A. officials , is accorded all operating businesses . The Superfund law leaves it to the E.P.A. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Yates , " It is the policy of the Government not to interfere , if possible , with an ongoing , active business. " // The reason behind the policy is " sensitivity to the employment impacts of environmental legislation , " said Bruce Diamond , who directs the E.P.A. ' s enforcement effort on hazardous wastes. // But , says Mr. Fike , just being placed on the Superfund list was " the kiss of death . " He said it brought so much negative attention , " We lost all our business . " Not only could he not repay the loan to clean up the plant , he said , the company itself could not go on . " It ' s a wonder we survived as long as we did. " // Mr. Fike sold the company in 1986 to the West Virginia Chemical Corporation and it was renamed the Artel Chemical Corporation . According to the E.P.A. , Mr. Fike stayed on as a consultant. // Artel officials said they understood that there were violations and would take care of them , Mr. Diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new company . <> <> Plant Was Abandoned // But in June , while the court case was mired in long pretrial proceedings , the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources notified the E.P.A. that the plant had been abandoned , the workers dismissed and the utilities cut off. // The abandonment , which Mr. Yates said dramatically increases the danger , automatically moved the Fike site into the category of " immediate and substantial threat " to public health and gave the Government its opening . Until then , he said , the E.P.A. had been doing what it usually does in such cases : negotiating , issuing orders and going to court - without shutting down an operation to clean it up . Closing down a company , he said , is " rare. " // When E.P.A. workers inspected the more than 4 , 000 containers of chemicals at the plant , they found what Mr. Yates describes as an " unbelievable " scene : lethal chemicals that could explode in contact with water , open to the sky ; incompatible materials stored in deteriorating drums ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metallic sodium and a container of methyl mercaptan , both lethal , potentially explosive chemicals that may still force future evacuations of Nitro. // Officials at Artel did not respond to requests for comment. // Mr. Diamond said the drawn-out process and frustrating results are not common , but reflect a problem that plagues smaller facilities where the owner lacks the resources to undertake a clean-up. // But to environmentalists like Tom Grumbly , what has gone on here epitomizes the " excruciatingly slow " way in which the system now works in trying to control and clean up hazardous wastes . Mr. Grumbly is the president of Clean Sites Inc. , a Washington-based nonprofit alliance of businesses and governments whose aim is to accelerate the pace of hazardous waste cleanup . He sees other lessons , too. // " The plight of the small businessman has to be addressed more sensitively , " he said , adding that the Superfund is needed most of all to bear the brunt of expense in the case of small companies with thin bank accounts. // " But the bottom line , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait 10 years at a site to find out that there ' s a potentially lethal problem involved.
