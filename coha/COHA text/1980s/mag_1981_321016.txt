Another Voyager approaches the mysterious belted planet <P> There is not perhaps another object in the heavens that presents us with such a variety of extraordinary phenomena as the planet Saturn ... <P> - Sir William Herschel , 1805 <P> In an era when astronomers talk about objects as strange and remote as quasars , about cosmic enigmas like black holes and the faint radio noises that may be an echo of the creation , an ordinary planet , even the second largest in the sun 's family , hardly seems likely to awe or surprise . Yet , remarkably , Saturn still has that power , as the Voyager 1 spacecraft so dramatically showed last November . Swooping within 78,000 miles of the luminous ringed sphere , the little robot sent back a collection of full-color images as dazzling as any ever received from deep space . <P> That portfolio included close-up views of the gaseous planet 's stormy clouds , where equatorial winds rage at 1,100 m.p.h . It provided the first real look at the myriad small , icy worlds that are the planet 's moons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rings . Formed out of rocky , icy fragments ranging in size from dust particles to boulders as big as apartment buildings , they totaled more than 1,000 in all . Astonishingly , some rings were twisted into what looked like braids of hair . Others contained patterns that resembled spokes of a wheel . Some even whirled around Saturn in eccentric paths like grooves of a record that had slipped its spindle . <P> Such phenomena seemed to defy the revered laws of classical physics . But scientists are about to get a chance to unravel these mysteries-and perhaps more . At precisely 11:25 p.m . E.D.T. next Tuesday , Aug. 25 , a second spacecraft , Voyager 2 , will finally reach Saturn after a four-year , 1.4 billion-mile flight . Ducking behind the planet ( as seen from earth ) , it will skim to within 63,000 miles of the planet 's cloud tops . Then Voyager 2 will plunge through the plane of Saturn 's rings , brushing precariously close to that rocky debris . All the while , its cameras and instruments will be working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter . <P> Most of the observations will be aimed at answering questions raised by the earlier flight , with special emphasis on the rings . During one 13-hr. period , for instance , Voyager 2 's cameras will be taking pictures every 3.2 min . The movie-like sequence should not only show the formation and disintegration of the spokes during each rotation but also help explain what forces are acting on them . One theory : the spokes are in fact composed of dustlike particles lifted out of the thin ring plane by electrostatic forces perhaps created by the faint light of the distant sun . <P> Still another experiment involves Voyager 2 's photopolarimeter , a light-measuring device that failed on the first flight .. As the spacecraft approaches the planet , the instrument will be aimed through the rings at Delta Scorpii , a far-off star . By measuring disruptions ( or blinking ) of the starlight caused by the intervening ring material , the scientists should get the most precise data yet on the number of rings , their density and width and the size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
