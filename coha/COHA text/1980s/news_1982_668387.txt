The day the American League pennant was flown above the beer , the bratwurst and the Brouhard , the great-grandchildren of the Seattle ( " Ball Four " ) Pilots finished a comeback that no team had ever made before . And the flag flapped after a game that was a time-lapse microcosm of all the minute contributions , ifs , inches , and dogged persistence that they dragged from the first intrasquad game to the 167th - and finest - payday . " It seemed as if we played out the entire long ( - - - ) season in one game , " said Pete Vuckovich , who , sore shoulder or no sore shoulder , took the Brewers into the seventh inning on sheer guts . " We came back , the key plays were made by guys like Munchkie Moore and Marshall Edwards , and while the big hits came from the big guys ( Ben Oglivie and Cecil Cooper ) , when we had to go to the bullpen and everyone said we couldn ' t win without ( Rollie ) Fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine did it . " Indeed , in one game , Mark Brouhard was second on the club in runs batted in ( 3 ) and first in runs ( 4 ) , while the Yount-Cooper-Simmons- Thomas-Ogliv ie heart of the order went 8 for 68 , .118 for the playoff series . " Yeah , " echoed Stormin ' Gorman Thomas , who played seven innings on a knee that was so bad that he slept a total of 20 minutes the night before , " andRogers ' Rangers are going to the Grand Ole Opry of Baseball . " When the 167th American League game was over and the team Bud Selig rescued from Seattle was the champion with this 4-3 victory over the Angels that sent 54,968 pouring onto the County Stadium turf and drowned the city streets in Miller High Life , it was done in one of those games - and comebacks - that down the hallway epitomized the frustrations of Gene Mauch ' s career . California had led 3-1 by the fourth inning , by which time the two teams had committed their record-breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it , " one of those strange collections of bounces and mysteries that make baseball such an unpredictable game and imprecise science . " There was a bad hop in the fifth on one of record-breaking Fred Lynn ' s 12 hits that enabled Moore to cut Reggie Jackson down at third on , as Vuckovich later observed , " the biggest play in the game . " There was an infield popup that dropped followed by a two-out , seventh- inning , 3-2 pitch that Angels ' reliever Luis Sanchez made to Robin Yount that missed the inside corner by a string of dental floss , a ball that loaded the bases for the 2-for-19 Cooper ' s game- winning single . The walk was followed by a wall-banging catch by Edwards - Thomas ' defensive replacement - and , finally , Ladd ' s culmination of his 10-batter , 10- out playoff performance by getting a statistical myth named Rod Carew to bounce to Yount with the tying run on second base . Some television foofs selected Lynn - who set a playoff record with 12 hits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five games - as the series MVP . But make no mistake about it : the key to this series was the Deputy Sheriff of Cumberland County , Maine - Mr. Ladd as he is known to residents of the Portland jail - who took Fingers ' place and not only retired 10 consecutive hitters but also saved Games 3 and 5 in the touchiest of situations . " I was more pumped up than I ' ve ever been in my life , " beamed the third party in the Brewers ' Red Sox Trio . " I got in there and there was no nervousness , no worry , ( nothing ) but the feeling of blowing strikes . " Which he did . McClure , who had relieved Vuckovich in the seventh and gotten Reggie ( .111 ) Jackson to rap into a double play , had given up a single to pinch hitter Ron Jackson to start the ninth . When Rob Wilfong ran for Jackson , Harvey Kuenn went to Ladd . " I got to the mound , and all Harvey said to me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . ' " And he did it . After Bob Boone , who had earlier squeezed in a run , bunted Wilfong to second , Ladd began firing away . He got Brian Downing to tap to Paul Molitor at third so impressively that Kuenn decided , with lefty Mike Caldwell ready in the pen , to let the kid with the 15 EEEEE shoes face Carew . " He ' d proven enough , " said Kuenn . " I threw him a fastball and a slider , " Ladd said of the pitches that got him to a 1-1 count , " then came back with another fastball . I wasn ' t thinking about it being Carew , all I was thinking was getting my best over the plate . " The best Peter Ladd had was tapped by Carew to Yount , and people from Prouts Neck to Otisfield had a share of the Brewers that have made Milwaukee famous . To get the 4-3 lead , the two teams had parried through an eventful eight innings whose subtleties were reflected in the postgame lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Errors ( the 12 for the series set a record ) and off plays characterized the first four innings , with Lynn knocking in runs in the first and third around a Brewer run in the first , the latter keyed by Paul Molitor ' s making a double out of a routine single when Brian Downing was slow fielding his single . Boone ' s second squeeze of the series made it 3-1 in the fourth , and after Oglivie belted a high Bruce Kison changeup out of the park in the bottom of the inning , Jackson was on first , one out in the fifth . Lynn hit a high hopper over Cooper ' s head into right , and Reggie , naturally , took off for third . " At the last second , the ball took a freaky hop , " said Moore . " If it hadn ' t , I don ' t think I could have made the play , but the bad hop came up perfectly for me and I had the ball perfectly . " Moore , whose right-field play has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson at third . " If he hadn ' t , I ' d hate to think what would have happenedfrom there , " said Vuckovich . The Angels left runners in scoring position in four of the first five innings , and when Kison had to leave with a blister and exhaustion in the sixth , Mauch went to Sanchez , the bullpen ' s hot hand down the stretch . Sanchez got four outs in a row , and with one out in the seventh jammed Moore for an infield popup behind the mound and slightly to the right side . " It got the wind perfectly , the biggest squibbler of my career , " Moore said , smiling . Bobby Grich dived for it , but could only get it on the short hop ( ump Al Clark called it an out , but was overruled by Don Denkinger ) , and after Jim Gantner singled through the middle and Molitor fouled out , it came to Yount , 2-and-2 . The AL MVP fouled off two tough pitches , took a ball , then took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball four . Mauch then considered using lefty Andy Hassler . But Sanchez , who was throwing BBs , was left in . Problem was , he got a 1-1 pitch out over the plate and up , and Cooper rifled it into left for the winning two runs . And , in the eighth , Edwards , in for Thomas because Gorman couldn ' t run , raced to left- center , leaped against the fence and robbed Don Baylor of a double . " I can ' t explain why that ' s an out , or why Moore ' s ball drops in or why Brouhard gets a 57-bounce , three-run single Saturday , " said Mauch . " All I know is that that ' s how they came back from an 0-2 deficit and are in the Series and we ' re not . We were that close . " And I can ' t explain why 26 teams let Peter Ladd through the minor leaguedraft last September , either . That ' s how this pennant was won . And lost . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
