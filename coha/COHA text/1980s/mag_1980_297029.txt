Carter and Reagan offer the voters a difference that really matters <P> Amid the whirlwind of emotions over the late-late TV showdown debate and the American hostages , U.S. voters will go to the polls on Nov. 4 to make an irrevocable choice with which they will have to live for at least four years . Despite the confusion caused by the shifting positions of the presidential candidates and the hyperbole and innuendo of a disappointing campaign , Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan offer , in many ways , clear-cut and contrasting choices . Whatever other complaints the 1980 American voter may have ( and there are many ) , he can not complain that he has been confronted with Tweedledum and Tweedledee . <P> The conservative California Republican and the centrist Georgia Democrat are locked in a dead-even struggle that could affect the role of the Federal Government in domestic affairs , create a clean split in political philosophy between the two major parties , profoundly affect the nation 's economy and energy directions , and deeply influence the role America plays on the global stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are striking similarities between the campaign Carter ran in 1976 and the one Reagan is conducting this year .

He is deeply-and instinctively-committed to " getting the Government off the backs of the people . " When Reagan vows to reduce the regulatory role of Government , eliminate such recent bureaucratic creations as the departments of Education and Energy , and wipe out countless petty federal forms that businessmen must fill out , he can be counted on to fight hard to do just that . <P> Despite talk of a new " pragmatism " in Reagan 's thinking , he has not really abandoned any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For purely political purposes , he has made some token shifts , such as favoring federal aid for both New York City and the Chrysler Corp. , but both are questions that have already been firmly resolved . Reagan really is not a moderate on any major domestic issue , although , as his record as Governor shows , circumstances can force him to change his policies .
