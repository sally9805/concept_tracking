The beginning of a President 's second term is typically a time of musical chairs . Richard Nixon , who until last November was the only President in 28 years to be elected to a second term , requested written resignations from all his top appointees one day after trouncing George McGovern . Ronald Reagan took precisely the opposite tack , asking all his advisers to stay in place . <P> Several of Reagan 's aides , however , have felt a hankering to move on . Last week it was announced that two of the President 's closest California confidants would soon take their leave : Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver wants to bolster his bank account , and Interior Secretary William Clark plans to ride back to his 880-acre ranch near San Luis Obispo . Two others in the California contingent are also poised to shift . After a bruising inquiry into his finances , Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese was renominated last week to succeed Attorney General William French Smith , thus bringing Smith closer to his goal of returning to private law practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the past 18 years , he has enjoyed an almost familial intimacy with the First Couple , acquiring along the way an unsurpassed talent for packaging Reagan in glowing , telegenic images . His most recent brainstorm : asking ABC to include the President , by remote broadcast , in the opening ceremonies of the Super Bowl . <P> Deaver , 46 , has long made no secret of wanting to return to private life , saying he found it difficult to live in Washington on his White House salary ( currently $72,000 a year ) . His resignation came on the day that a Wall Street Journal article raised questions about the propriety of his wife allegedly earning more than $50,000 a year as a public relations consultant handling some clients who have dealt with her husband at the White House . Chief of Staff James Baker insisted that " there is absolutely no connection " between the timing of Deaver 's exit and the Journal story . Deaver reportedly has been offered more than $200,000 a year to head the Washington office of Burson-Marsteller , the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheery yet canny aide will doubtless remain a close consultant to the family ( see cover story ) . <P> Clark told Reagan of his intention to resign during the New Year 's holiday . The request was hardly new . Almost two years ago , Clark , then National Security Adviser , felt worn down by White House battles and talked of leaving Washington . But Reagan persuaded Clark to stay , and later appointed him to replace bumptious James Watt as Interior Secretary . After the election , hard-line conservatives pushed Clark as a replacement for Chief of Staff James Baker , who aspired to a Cabinet post . The President kept Baker . There has been speculation that Clark is leaving because he has no prospect of returning to the White House , but he denies that he is disillusioned with his role in the Administration . " There 's no truth to that , " he says flatly .
