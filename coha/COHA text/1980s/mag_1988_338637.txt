So long , it 's been good to know ya . Attorney General Edwin Meese will be gone before the Democratic Convention , Bush sources hope . He 'll resign just as soon as he has had a chance to mount a face-saving p.r . offensive against the impending report from Independent Counsel James McKay . <P> Gender swipe . Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards , an excellent speaker with a biting wit , will keynote the Democratic Convention as living proof that gender is a Bush , not a Dukakis , hang-up . She will also stake her claim as a real Texan , not one whose " residence " is a Houston hotel . <P> Richards ' Republican counterpart is New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean , a moderate who has already stirred up the kind of trouble usually reserved for Democratic conventions . New Hampshire Senator Gordon Humphrey has threatened a walkout during Kean 's speech ( Kean is against a constitutional ban on abortion ) unless an antiabortion speaker is given equal time . <P> Florida , or your money back . Allies of Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy is on the Democratic ticket . They have even paid for a poll that shows Dukakis-Graham taking the critical state by a comfortable 10-point margin . <P> Author , author ! Speaker Jim Wright 's nemesis Newt Gingrich has an ethical problem of his own . Democrat David Worley , hoping to win Gingrich 's Georgia congressional seat , totes a blank book to campaign stops . The title : What I Did on My Summer Vacation , by Newt Gingrich . It refers to the European trip Gingrich and his family took to do " research , " using a $13,000 advance for a book he never wrote . <P> Designated hatchet . His disdain for Dukakis is deep enough to make Ronald Reagan this campaign 's perfect hatchet man . The President " is eager to do it , " says a Bush aide . Last week he upped Bush 's anti-Duke epithet " Brookline liberal " to " true liberal . " <P> " ( ( He is ) ) the kind of guy who wants to know whether it 's time to eat .
