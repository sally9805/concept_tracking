It is a peculiarly American idea that the social injustices of the past can be mollified with cash and property payments . In 1980 the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Federal Government to pay some $122 million to eight tribes of Sioux Indians to make up for the illegal seizure of their tribal lands in 1877 . Two years ago , Japanese Americans forced into internment camps during World War II were awarded checks for $20,000 . Now some African Americans want cash compensation for the slavery their ancestors endured . " We call for reparations , " declared a resolution passed at the African-American summit in New Orleans last week . " If they are good enough for the Japanese Americans and Native Americans , they are good enough for those of us who worked for hundreds of years unpaid . " <P> The reparations idea is not a new one , but it has gathered some momentum since the Detroit city council last month asked Congress to establish a $40 billion education fund for the descendants of slaves . While the idea has a surface plausibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recent payments to Native Americans are the result of acknowledged violations of U.S. law , and the Japanese Americans who received compensation for their internment were the victims themselves , not their descendants .
