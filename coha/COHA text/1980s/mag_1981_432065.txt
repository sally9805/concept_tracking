His plan to spend a whopping 1.5 trillion dollars for defense over the next five years is sailing through Congress with scant debate . The nation 's military services are enjoying greater respect than at any time since the beginning of the Vietnam War . Higher military pay and rising civilian unemployment are factors , but Pentagon manpower chief Lawrence Korb also contends : " Patriotism is back . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of over the Vietnam blahs . " The Pentagon claims that all branches of the armed forces are at 100 percent of authorized strength today , and some volunteers who would have been accepted a year ago are being rejected .

Dannis Miller , head of the sponsoring group , explains , " We just ca n't handle any more people .

Explains Silverfine , " My father came from Eastern Europe when he was 8 years old , escaping poverty and lack of freedom . We owe something to this country and must pay our dues for what the country gives us . The flag is literally a gift of the people to the people and is meant to revive the spirit of the country . " The newest Americans . Immigrants often are the most unblushing patriots of all , and in the past year more than 800,000 legally entered the U.S. ? the highest number in history .

" Some two centuries later , American author Ambrose Bierce called it " the first refuge of a scoundrel . " Now some scholars worry that the latest flowering of national fervor may herald an era of intolerance . Benjamin Barber , a Rutgers University political scientist , warns of " a dangerous side of patriotism that breeds jingoism and can be used as a club against dissenters , that identifies critics as enemies of America . " Yet Barber , who is writing a book about American democracy , also sees healthy aspects in the nation 's newfound patriotic spirit . In his view : " People are tired ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerlessness , and are anxious to regain control of America 's destiny . And that 's good . "
