The wildlife is more familiar . Tarantulas , snakes , lizards , and coyotes do well here , of course , and in the higher elevations , bears , mountain lions , and mountain goats . In the more southern reaches of the desert , in Baja California , you get some pretty fancy birds - thick-billed parrots , for instance. // As for plants , it takes a genuine oddball to survive here . Like the saguaro cactus - the plant that lets you know you ' re in the Sonora . Or the cholla cactus , whose flabby , grayish fruit can latch on to the unwary passerby with nasty prickers. // // Over 300 different kinds of animals and 200 kinds of plants inhabit 15 landscaped acres , set in the heart of Tucson Mountain Park . Most zoos and botanical museums have to range far and wide to get specimens , but the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is strictly regional and proud of it . The curators don ' t even water their plants. // The great thing about the museum is that the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of the plants you ' ll easily see elsewhere in Arizona , but as for the wildlife - you ' d have to be a naturalist to find it. // And now the museum is doing its best to make you forget that it is a zoo at all . A new $2. 5 million habitat has just opened , designed so that you can see white-tailed deer , mountain lions , brown bears , and other mountain animals , all in enclosures of convincing-looking fake rock , with the natural mountain backdrop behind them. // This is part of a grand reorganization plan to take place as funds are available over the next few decades . The old format showed caged animals sorted by classification : snakes with snakes , cats with cats , and so on . The modern approach is putting predators and prey and the plants that go with them , close together in a natural setting. // Elevation is the critical factor here , not because of the difference in heat but the difference in water , according to Christopher Helms , development and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s highest elevation , and it features , among other plants , 200-year-old Arizona white oak trees and some magnificent ' ' evergreen oaks , ' ' as they are called here , all transplanted from a rancher ' s land. // Building a new museum like this is strictly a custom job . ' ' These exhibits are different from those that exist anywhere else , ' ' said Mr. Helms . For one thing , there is no guarantee that the animals ' needs and the designer ' s ideas will coincide . The talk of the museum the week I was there was the pranks of two five-month-old bears . First , one bear caused a furor by almost staging a getaway . Then both bears gave a keeper the shock of her life when she happened upon them in the neighboring den for the gray foxes , who hadn ' t moved in yet ; their area was designed to be mercifully bear-proof . ( Both escape hatches have since been redesigned. ) // Peter Siminski , curator of birds and mammals , took me for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zoo with an insider ; the animals all come trooping over to you . An exception was one of the jaguarundis , a recent mother ; she bared her fangs at me - a savage red and white snarl in a small chocolate-colored face. // We visited the animals ' kitchen , which included a walk-in freezer full of , among other things , great bags of Purina Dog Chow . It was the animals ' monthly ' ' goodie day , ' ' so plates of special raw meats were everywhere. // He led me over to the cage of the vampire bats - small furry balls hanging upside down . They have nasty expressions and are fed bowls of blood at mealtime , according to Mr. Siminski. // We also passed a cage containing three elf owls , sitting on their perch . Spying us , they abruptly drew themselves up to their full four inches , swiveled their heads toward us , opened their eyes wide , and froze . They looked like something ceramic you ' d buy in a gift shop. // ' ' When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the owls locked into position. // ' ' Oh , they will , eventually , ' ' said Siminski casually as we walked off , leaving them to it. // At the time of my visit the animals in the new habitat were just getting used to their quarters . ' ' We have to get animals used to their enclosures so that they know where they live , ' ' said Siminski . This procedure is complicated when there is more than one species in an enclosure , because each species has to first get used to its cage , then to the outer , public area ; then both species must be put together so they can get used to each other. // We went behind the scenes to the cage area to see the mountain lion , who was at that point in the ' ' cage stage ' ' of the adjustment process . The bears came back into their cage area to have a look at us. // Bears like to play to the gallery . One stuck his nose through the bar in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a small fat rump , giving a great impersonation of a bear who would never in his wildest dreams think of biting anybody . ' ' Bears can sucker you ; watch out , ' ' Siminski said warning me as we went by. // The mountain lion had just lost his mate and was sitting alone in his new cage . His opinion of the situation was expressed in the low set of his ears , a resigned look in his steady golden eyes , and in a certain lack of animation about the tail . He seemed glad to be visited though and began making an irregular hoarse growling noise that Siminski said was the sound of a mountain lion purring . ' ' He likes you , ' ' he said. // A later phone call revealed that the lion is now out in his enclosure , has cheered up , and a new mate has been acquired for him . He has taken to living in his viewing window and interacting with visitors. // It is a wrench to tear yourself away from a purring mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s wonderful walk-through aviary . On our way , we wandered past a coyote , looking like a friendly husky dog grinning and squinting in the hot sun ; fat prairie dogs , like overgrown hamsters , surrounded by a crowd of admirers ; and a cardinal on top of an ocotillo . We also passed several docents , one with a beautiful owl on a leash , another holding a large turtle. // It was hot , and many of the birds you can usually see in the aviary were hiding , though we did see a magpie jay , with its sweeping tail of black and white diamonds . The birds seemed very happy here : ' ' Lots of birds try to get in , ' ' said Siminski . The aviary is an example of the interaction between the museum and its environment . ' ' If you notice all the birds looking up , look up and you ' ll see a hawk. ' ' // I said goodbye to Siminski and wandered around the museum for a while by myself . There are many strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minerals like great lumpy jewels : azurite , flat plates of the brightest blue ; malachite , fuzzy jade green blobs ; tangerine colored wulfenite ; and calcite , like frozen milk . Then I went outside again. // Talking to people here , you get a different view of the less likable animals and insects . I saw one man tenderly holding a gigantic tarantula in two thick , cupped hands . From him I learned that tarantulas - at least the North American varieties - are very remarkable and much maligned . They can live to be 25-30 years old , are docile , don ' t mind being picked up , and are not particularly dangerous even if tormented into biting , and are quite fragile . ' ' If I dropped her , she ' d probably die , ' ' he said , looking down at the motionless , doorknob sized beast , with its 5-inch long brown furry legs : the stuff of nightmares , squatting trustingly in his hands. // The Sonora Desert Museum was founded 33 years ago by a self-taught naturalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard museum of natural history as a ' ' dead animal museum , ' ' according to Helms. // ' ' Most zoos are postage stamp collections. ' ' he says . But this one permits ' ' a willing suspension of disbelief. ' ' // //
