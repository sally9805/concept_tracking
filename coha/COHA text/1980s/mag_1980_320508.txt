Seaport frets over Moonies <P> Hard by the harbor 's edge in the venerable Massachusetts fishing port of Gloucester stands the bronze statue of a fisherman , dressed in slicker and sou'wester hat and clutching a schooner 's wheel . He is gazing resolutely seaward , as if on the lookout for one of the gales that have claimed thousands of local sailors since the town was settled in 1623 . But today a storm of quite a different kind is swirling through Gloucester . This one pits the townspeople against the Moonies , the disciples of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon , whose Unification Church has been accused of brainwashing recruits , using questionable business practices and maintaining links with the secret intelligence services of South Korea . Complains Leo Alper , 66 , the town 's portly mayor : " I think eventually Moon would like to take over the city . " <P> The Moonies first began worrying the townspeople in 1977 , when a church owned company bought a lobster packing plant for $330,000 , a 14-room house and a swatch of swampy waterfront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fishing business , as it had elsewhere , and , as William Sanders , 27 , one of the plant 's two Moonie managers put it , Gloucester was " our kind of town . " <P> Then last month the church really caused a furor by pulling off a slick real estate coup to obtain the Cardinal Gushing Villa , a 30-room retreat house , from the Daughters of Mary of the Immaculate Conception , a Connecticut-based order of nuns . The sisters were known to have been opposed to dealing with the Moonies . They sold the property for $1 million to New Hampshire Businessman Myron Block , who turned out to be in cahoots with the Unification Church . The next day , Block sold the retreat to the Moonies for $1,127,000 . In addition , just two weeks ago , a Moonie-run firm paid $650,000 to buy a marina and Bob 's Clam Shack , a bankrupt restaurant . <P> Mayor Alper fired off a telegram to Pope John Paul II asking his help in revoking the sale of the retreat house because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week at a Catholic church for the young people to muster the strength to ward off any Moonie advances . Pickets began stalking up and down in front of the newly acquired marina carrying signs proclaiming : ONE MOON IN GLOUCESTER IS ALL WE <P> WANT ! One night rocks were tossed through the windows of the lobster plant . Townspeople began signing an " open letter " to the Unification Church demanding a full explanation of its plans . <P> The Moonies blame the mayor for stirring up resentment against them , but there is widespread sullen suspicion in town about the church 's plans . So far , however , no Moonies have tried to lure the young of Gloucester into their ranks , and no legal charges of any kind have been filed against the church and its operations .
