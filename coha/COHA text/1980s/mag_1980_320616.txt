Other department stores may try to win back recession-scarred consumers with glamorized dcor , personalized service and accordion-like credit arrangements . But K mart Corp , knows that the way to the shopper 's heart is still through the pocketbook . Most of the 1,750 stores around the country that show off the company 's big red K are riding out the recession relatively well , and the discount chain may displace Sears , Roebuck and Co. as the U.S. 's leading retailer . <P> K mart has prospered because of a no-frills policy that places the premium on value . In stores that usually have the ambience of a supermarket , customers can wander amid clothing , lawn chairs and stereos , rarely encountering a sales assistant . But the prices , as much as 15% below those at tonier stores , make up for the inconvenience . <P> The discount chain rang up $12.7 billion in sales last year , with profits of $358 million , second only to Sears ' $17.5 billion volume . In the first six . months of 1980 , K mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid 2.2% and Penney 's rose a mere 1% . Since K mart 's sales have averaged a 19.3% annual growth since 1970 , many analysts expect that it will pass Sears by the mid- ' 80s . Says Detroit Investment Analyst Mariann Kotas : " Leaving aside Sears ' insurance business , K mart already is No. 1 in retail profits . " <P> Founded in 1962 , K mart was the brainchild of Harry Cunningham , the former chairman of S.S. Kresge Co. , a stagnant chain of central-city dime stores . Convinced that Kresge 's inner-city stores held little promise , Cunningham persuaded the company 's board to invest $80 million in some 60 suburban K mart outlets . In four years , K mart 's sales overtook those of Kresge stores , and in 1977 Kresge was renamed in honor of its successful spinoff . <P> Keeping prices low is not easy , even for a large chain . <P> K mart has succeeded primarily by careful planning and by accumulating remarkably little debt . The company leases all its buildings to avoid construction loans and mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional warehouses , located within a one-day drive of most stores , allowing K mart stores to keep inventories at a minimum , reducing a major source of debt . The distribution network also allows local managers to order merchandise independently . As a result , K mart 's Sunbelt stores never get stuck with too many Snowbelt specialties , like ice hockey sticks . <P> K mart 's new chairman , Bernard M. Fauber , 57 , has plans to keep the chain expanding . He intends to open 180 to 190 new stores a year , many of them in urban and rural areas that the chain does not reach now . New stores are likely to be only about half the size of K mart 's normal retail barns . <P> Fauber insists that by 1990 K mart will have 3,000 outlets , making it nearly as ubiquitous as McDonald 's or Burger King .
