txt While Karen debates whether to pursue Tom now that Annie has snared Jeff on CBS 's " As the World Turns , " Helen Gurley Brown , over on cable TV 's " Daytime , " might be grilling Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione on " merchandising sex " or arguing with Gloria Steinem about women 's roles . " Daytime " started out seven months ago on about 475 cable systems reaching seven million viewers . Right now , it 's still struggling to convince advertisers of its worth . It bills itself as controversial , provocative programming for " today 's women . " And it has been filling the weekday afternoon hours between one and five with chats between women like Coretta Scott King and Jihan Sadat and with segments on how women can examine themselves for breast cancer and how men can detect testicular cancer .

" Daytime " is partly produced by American Broadcasting Cos. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daytime ratings . ABC 's partner is Hearst Corp. , which publishes such magazines as Good Housekeeping and Cosmopolitan . Networks Are n't Worried " ' Daytime ' gets the woman who is n't tuning in to soap operas in the first place because she wants something of substance , or watches the soaps but wants a change of pace , " says Mary Alice Dwyer , a former director of children 's programming at ABC who heads programming for Hearst/ABC Video Enterprises . So far , CBS and NBC are n't worried . " The game on daytime TV is still ABC versus CBS versus NBC , " says Arnold Becker , head of research for CBS Inc . And Irwin Segelstein , vice chairman of RCA Corp . ' s NBC subsidiary , says his network has n't felt " any material erosion " from any afternoon cable show . " Any single one of them is getting a meaningless share of audience , and taken together , daytime cable shows are n't getting the ratings of a weak independent , " he says .

" Daytime , " which is advertiser-supported , is n't profitable yet either , and its parent companies do n't expect it to be for at least two to three years . In fact , some network executives think it will follow CBS Cable into extinction . CBS spent lavishly to program its cultural service but then was unable to woo enough advertisers . In recent weeks , several " Daytime " programming staff members have been let go , and production has been halted . But a spokesman says that Hearst/ABC has all the programs it needs until well into 1983 .

To try to expand the number of its cable-system subscribers , " Daytime " and " Arts " plans to start transmitting over a second satellite , Westvar V , in addition to RCA Corp . ' s Satcom 3-R early next year . In many ways , " Daytime " is like traditional magazine and network fare . But it also has more provocative interview shows and franker treatment of sexual practices and health . Many of its programs , such as the one showing a man examining himself for testicular cancer , would n't appear on network television . The " Daytime " programs can include as many as 13 segments in a day . Alanna Davis and Sharon Lovejoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also featured prominently . In one segment , Mrs. Brown coos over the wares of a company that organizes parties to sell its sex devices . On another afternoon , she discusses what a woman gets when she hires a male escort service . Other " Daytime " programs have dealt with such questions as what kinds of birth control are available and how to tell children about sex . The closest " Daytime " comes to drama is " Living and Loving With Dr. Karen Blotter , " which shows two actors discussing marital problems with a counselor . Network executives say " Daytime " relies too much on " talking heads " ? interview shows with no real action . Called " A Conversation With . .. " the shows have featured Lady Bird Johnson interviewing former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan , and Gloria Steinem asking Billie Jean King how revelations about her lesbian relationship have affected her career . Nonetheless , NBC 's " Today " show plans to start having some celebrities interview other celebrities , too .

Lucille Treganowan , who owns an auto body shop in Pittsburgh , hosts a weekly segment called " Lucille 's Car Care Clinic . " Diana Nyad. the swimmer , hosts a fitness show . Barbara Feldon , best known as Agent 86 on " Get Smart " in the late 1960s , has a show called " The Eighties Woman .

" But Hearst/ABC has commissioned Arbitron and other measuring agencies to begin trial audience-measurement surveys this month . If " Daytime " is a success , it might spill over into the evening . Already under consideration , says Mrs. Dwyer , are programs for " husband and wife co-viewing " and for career women returning home after a day at the office .
