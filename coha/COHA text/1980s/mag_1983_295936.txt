He was a bold man that first eat an oyster . <P> Connoisseurs of seafood may take issue with Jonathan Swift ; it takes no boldness at all to eat oysters fresh from the waters of the Chesapeake Bay . But going after these oysters requires a bold spirit and a sturdy body . Most of the Chesapeake 's watermen , heirs to three centuries of tradition , harvest the bay 's oysters by time-honored methods . Some scrape them off the bottom with dredges towed behind graceful , sail-driven skipjacks . Some haul them up with mechanical dredges . Many pluck them off the bottom with unwieldy 18-ft. - long tongs . <P> Now there is a new and increasingly controversial way of bringing up the shellfish . Tucker Brown , 45 , and Roy Sprague , 33 , along with a growing number of other watermen , harvest oysters in person-by diving for them . While Brown mans the helm of his 46-ft. work boat Frisky , Sprague plunges beneath the surface of the bay and sends the oysters topside in a wire basket . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it sure beats long-tonging . " <P> It also makes some long-tongers angry . Though the divers usually work deeper than the tongmen and thus are not vying for the same oysters , the oldtimers feel threatened by the more efficient newcomers . " They 're gon na clean the bay out , " claims one long-tonger . <P> Brown and Sprague acknowledge that their harvests are bigger than the average tongman 's . But the fact is that none of the watermen are getting huge hauls these days . Nitrogen , carried into the bay by runoff from neighboring farm lands , has lowered the Chesapeake 's oxygen level . The primary victims are the oysters , whose numbers have been declining in recent years . The secondary victims are watermen like Brown , whose family has been working the water for three generations , and Sprague , a Californian who was sent to Maryland as a serviceman and liked it so well that he stayed . " I 've seen it good and I 've seen it bad , " says Brown . " But this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's department of natural resources reports that this year 's oyster harvest is one of the worst ever . That is why Brown and Sprague work as often as the weather allows . And that is why they are down at the Dennis Point Marina in rural Drayden at 6 a.m. , when both the sky and the St. Marys River are the color of a day-old bruise . " Got to get out there early , " says Brown . " Want to get them oysters before they wake up . " <P> Getting out to where the oysters live is relatively simple : a 15-minute cruise brings Frisky to a spot over an underwater ledge that Brown and Sprague located the day before . But getting down to the oysters and getting them back to the surface are a bit more complicated . With Frisky fast to a buoy , Brown , already bundled against the chill in a sweater , a wool shirt and a quilted vest , suits up for work in rubber boots and oilskins . Sprague strips to his underwear , then wriggles into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
