When finance ministers and central bankers from as many as 151 nations converged on Washington last week for a meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , they had plenty to talk  --  and fret  --  about . The U.S. and Japan seemed perilously close to a trade war . The value of the American dollar was nose-diving to new lows against the yen . And the Latin- American debt crisis was flaring up all over again . In short , the world economy was showing distinct signs of stress . <P> On the day before the formal meeting , delegates from the Group of Seven major industrial nations  --  the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada  --  huddled behind closed doors at the U.S. Treasury to discuss the uncertain situation . At their gathering , Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker undoubtedly emphasized the same understated point he had made to a Senate committee earlier in the week , when he said , " Further sizable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its thrust was a reaffirmation of a declaration made by virtually the same group last February in Paris that the dollar 's value should remain " around current levels . " <P> The statement was intended to calm foreign-exchange markets , but it had exactly the opposite effect . After the latest Washington communique , a wild , selling spree pushed the value of the dollar down at week 's end to 142.50 yen , a 40-year low against the Japanese currency . Indeed , after the Paris declaration failed to halt the dollar 's slide , there was no reason to believe a vague reiteration of the same policy would have much impact . <P> The dollar 's continuing plunge created turmoil in U.S. financial markets . As fears mounted that the greenback 's weakness would boost inflation , bond prices dropped and interest rates climbed . The rate on 30-year Treasury bonds , for example , reached a 14-month high of 8.18% . The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed at 2338.78 , down 51.56 points for the week . <P> The gyrations in the currency markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and Japan . This week the Reagan Administration is scheduled to slap 100% tariffs on $300 million worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan 's failure to live up to a semiconductor trade agreement . At the Washington G-7 session , Japan tried to ease the conflict by unveiling a $34 billion program to stimulate its economy through public works . The spending is intended in part to boost Japanese imports of foreign goods . Although similar programs had done nothing in the past to reduce the country 's trade surplus , U.S. officials were hopeful that Tokyo was serious this time . <P> Also high on last week 's agenda was the international debt problem , which heated up last February when Brazil suspended payments on its $68 billion worth of foreign bank loans . Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro was at the meeting , trying to win support for new credit to his country . He warned that debtor nations were on a " very short lifeline " and " being pushed to the end of their payment capacity . " But Funaro received little encouragement from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its economy and curb its rampaging 600% inflation rate .
