INSIDE THE THIRD REICH , ABC , May 9 , 8p.m. ; May 10 , 9p.m . E.D.T. <P> <P> In history as in popular art , the general taste runs to horror shows rather than tragedy . How else explain the enduring fascination with Hitler 's Germany and the continuing lack of interest in Stalin 's Soviet Union ? In the atrocity sweepstakes , Hitler runs a distant second to Stalin , who sanctioned the deaths of 20 million to 50 million of his countrymen . Nor can Nazism , a brutally simple triumph of the goons , touch the tragic complexities of Stalinism-a political torch fanned by the world 's idealists while one avuncular pipe smoker in Moscow was wielding it as a genocidal bludgeon . Certainly Stalin was not typecast as a satanic maniac . Hitler was , and his regime paraded itself as a national theater of cruelty . The black leather and stainless steel , the epileptic rhetoric-these were the props and syntax of a most histrionic villainy . At stage center was a master psychotic , whose depths and demons the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What actor would resist the chance to play Hitler ? <P> Inside the Third Reich , a five-hour TV movie based on the best-selling 1970 memoirs of Albert Speer , is one more honorable exploitation of Nazism 's awful charm . At an early Nazi reception , Speer 's wife ( Blythe Danner ) surveys the panoply and calls it " a dress rehearsal for disaster . " It was no dress rehearsal ; it was a superproduction of the real thing , and the main characters acted as if they were in their own movie . Hitler ( Derek Jacobi ) does malicious impersonations of Mussolini and Chamberlain ; he sits raptly before a Busby Berkeley musical extravaganza ; he watches himself at a filmed rally and mouths the Fhrer 's words . He was both the big star and his biggest fan . And Speer ( Rutger Hauer ) - the young architect who became " the nearest thing Hitler has to a friend " and ran Germany 's war machine while Hitler lay quivering inside the bunker of his psychosis-played both a featured role and the ideal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war crimes that Speer became Nazism 's most knowledgeable critic . <P> Architecture is an art in the service of the power it houses , and Speer , the upper-middle-class son and grandson of architects , was a smooth courtier . His stern father ( John Gielgud ) despised the Nazis from the start for their socialism rather than their nationalism , but Albert felt no foreboding at all . This TV movie wonders just what he was capable of feeling . Hauer is a Dutch actor ( Soldier of Orange , Nighthawks ) with a sharp-featured face that emotion seems never to have touched . Thus he makes a perfect Speer , whom E. Jack Neuman 's teleplay depicts as a young man not so much on the make as on the irresistible rise . He is a camera that , too late , became a witness .
