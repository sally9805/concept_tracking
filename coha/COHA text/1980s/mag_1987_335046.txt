Last summer passed painfully for Margie Brauer , 60 , and her husband Ernie , 69 , one of the thousands of American farm families who have been battling hard times . Mired in debt , the Norlina , N.C. , couple declared bankruptcy in April 1986 . Then , facing foreclosure on the 228-acre farm that she and Ernie had worked for 40 years , Margie wrote an eloquent letter to a court-appointed trustee , expressing the hope that she and her husband might somehow retain their self-respect as they went through the agonizing process of giving up their home and land . TIME reprinted that letter ( NATION , Sept. 8 ) , prompting an outpouring of mail from across the U.S. and half a dozen foreign countries . / Many of those letters offered not only sympathy but also financial assistance ( A LETTER FROM THE PUBLISHER , Sept. 22 ) . The money , about $22,000 , helped ease a bit of the financial strain on the Brauers , though their total assets of $413,000 fell far short of the $678,000 they owed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken away , but they were allowed to remain in their home until the rest of their property could be sold . <P> Then , unexpectedly , came an event that Margie Brauer calls the " turning point in our lives . " A Dutch-born businessman who lived in Switzerland read about the couple 's difficulties . He had always been grateful to the U.S. for the part its Army played in helping liberate the Netherlands in World War II . Acting through an intermediary in February , the businessman ( who insists on anonymity ) gave the Brauers 100,000 Swiss francs  --  about $60,000 . Ernie , an Army veteran who fought in Holland during the war , said simply , " Thank God . " Margie was more expansive . " I had accepted the fact that things would never be the same again , " she said . " It 's just a blessing . " <P> The money made it possible for the Brauers and their lawyer to work out a deal with the bankruptcy trustee to buy back the farmhouse and 38 acres . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' name . Margie , who had taken a job as a hospital secretary to supplement Ernie 's $300 monthly Social Security check , sat securely in her kitchen last week . " I look out my window , " she said . " Our view is so lovely from the house down to the creek . It has never been so green . " But then she added quietly , " So many good things have come to us . In a way I am embarrassed . I still hurt for those who are so much worse off and have no recourse . "
