California 's embattled top court now faces a hostile Governor <P> Rose Bird no doubt relished the prospect . Had the voters obliged , Bird , the first woman to serve as her state 's chief justice , would have been swearing in the nation 's first elected black Governor , California 's Thomas Bradley , on Jan. 3 . Instead the voters chose George Deukmejian three weeks ago , and Democrat Bird may not even be asked to perform her traditional inaugural role . For Deukmejian , now the state 's Republican attorney general , is an unrelenting Bird critic determined to reverse what he sees as the excessive liberalism of the chief and her court . <P> " Rose Bird , " said Deukmejian in his campaign , " has done more damage to the California Supreme Court and the administration of justice than any of her predecessors . " That battle cry from the Governor-elect signals merely the latest assault wave on the court . Whether the damage was done by Bird , her critics or both , the sad result is that this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has lost both its luster and its leadership role . <P> The legend that is now coming apart traces back to 1940 . That year Governor Culbert Olson appointed both Chief Justice Phil Gibson and Associate Justice Roger Traynor . Gibson was a master administrator , Traynor a brilliant theorist . Together they molded an efficient statewide judiciary led by a supreme court whose decisions were often artful expansions of existing law that created new rights for California 's citizens . During its heyday in the 1960s , judges across the country frequently followed California 's lead in criminal and consumer rights . <P> Some time in the 1970s the trouble began . Gibson and Traynor had retired , and the seven-man bench was saddled with a senile justice who refused to step down . Seeking to change the court 's direction , then Governor Ronald Reagan made three appointments , including one ( William Clark , now National Security Adviser ) whose failure to finish law school prompted charges that Reagan was naming lightweights . A few years later the same charge was being tossed at Governor Jerry Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing his outlook . <P> Chief among them was Rose Bird . Only 40 , with no experience as a judge , she moved up from state agriculture secretary to head the court in 1977 . In contrast to the gentle persuasion effectively practiced by her predecessor , Donald Wright , the bright , hard-working Bird offered aloofness and abrasion . Her manner soon cost her the services of Ralph Kleps , the able administrator of the state 's judiciary . Another casualty was collegiality , the glue that enables seven independent thinkers to meld their views into cohesive decisions . Then in 1979 , the court endured the public debacle of a state investigation . The charge : that four controversial decisions had been delayed until after an election in which four justices were up for voter approval . The claim was never proved , but on TV , the justices comported themselves more like petty Solons than Solomons .
