Dale Earnhardt had a crowd with him wherever he went in Las Vegas last Saturday night . When he got bored by the Casino de Paris floor show at the Dunes hotel and headed for the casino , those in his entourage who bet only on sure things stuck with him like pigeons to a popcorn man . That afternoon at Ontario Motor Speedway in California , they had seen Earnhardt win the NASCAR championship despite doing just about everything he could to hand it to Cale Yarborough  --  from clipping the pit wall to getting disoriented on the backstretch to trying to haul a hydraulic jack around the track with him . They knew a man who was blessed when they saw one , and they wanted to get their chips down where his were . // Going into the Los Angeles Times 500 , the final race of the Grand National stock car season , Earnhardt led Yarborough by a mere 29 points out of some 4,000 . Over the last half of the 31-race season , Yarborough had steadily narrowed a gap that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two races before Ontario , was on a roll . What 's more , Yarborough had the best car ; he had been the fastest qualifier 13 times during the year , a NASCAR record . Earnhardt , by contrast , had not won a single pole position . Often his problem was horsepower . At some races his Monte Carlo just did n't have enough , which inspired Earnhardt  --  in his second full season on NASCAR 's premier circuit  --  to show folks just how hard he could drive . " I 'll tell you what makes that car run , " said David Ifft , crew chief for Benny Parsons , the driver who would win the Ontario race . " Dale Earnhardt makes that car run . // " He 's been driving like a wild man to make up for a lack of horsepower all year . Been going into the corners deeper and just throwing it the rest of the way around . Thing is , he 's good enough to get away with it . " // Earnhardt himself is entirely nonchalant about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about , is n't it ? " he says with a shrug . He smiles when he hears that Yarborough has complained about Earnhardt 's racing too close to him . " Well , what 's ol ' Cale been sayin ' about me today ? " he asks , cheerfully lacking reverence for the 40-year-old three-time NASCAR champion . // For all his aggressiveness on the track , Earnhardt is easygoing off it . At Ontario he would cruise through the garage area in his rumbling blue-and-yellow race car , slouched down like an East L.A. low-rider driver cruising Sunset Boulevard . With the 1980 championship on the line , was he nervous about having to fight off a pack of hard-charging heroes like Yarborough , Richard Petty , Bobby Allison , et al. ? " I ca n't wait till that race starts , " he said . // Well , maybe he was bred for such battles . His father was Ralph Earnhardt , one of the best-known and hardest-driving stock-car racers of the ' 50s . The elder Earnhardt died of a heart attack at 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving small tracks in the Carolinas . Ralph Earnhardt had given Dale this advice : always stay cool on the racetrack . " As a boy I remember standing on the tailgate of a pickup truck down in Columbia , watching my daddy race against David Pearson , Lee Petty , all of ' em . I come from where they been , " Dale says . // Moments before he was to qualify at Ontario last Thursday , Earnhardt was cool enough to be dozing on the floor of his garage near the Monte Carlo as his crew bustled around him in last-minute preparation . When it was time to go to work , Earnhardt cracked open one eye , grinned a little and bounced up . Yarborough had already qualified at 155.499 mph and was fastest so far . Earnhardt knew what he had to do : get around Ontario 's 2.5 miles faster than Yarborough , and with a car that was most likely slower . " Cale 's car is strong , " Earnhardt admitted as he threw one leg into the window of the Monte Carlo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run faster than that son of a gun , " he said as he got his other leg in and lowered himself into the form-fitting seat . // His crew stood at the end of pit row nervously fingering stopwatches as Earnhardt began his qualifying lap . Their eyes got bigger and their jaws slacker as he drove at full speed deeper and deeper into Turn One , well past the point where most drivers ease off the throttle . The car went blaap as Earnhardt finally backed off , a full 50 yards farther into the turn than Yarborough . The rear end of the car twitched  --  " It was just trying to make up its mind which way it wanted to go , " Earnhardt said later  --  and the exhaust bellowed as he floored it again leaving the turn . A whoop went up from the mechanics who had witnessed the charge , a cheer that clearly said there 's nobody around driving stock cars like this man . // But Earnhardt 's average was .644 mph slower than Yarborough 's ; he might even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting back up to top speed on the straight . Yarborough had won his 14th pole , his third in a row at Ontario . But Earnhardt , second fastest , would also be on the front row , door-to-door with his main rival . " Just where I want to be , " he said with a smile . // It had taken more than Earnhardt 's driving to get his team where it was . His crew 's performance during the year was as impressive as his own  --  indeed , it was amazing . It is a relatively ragtag bunch , mostly young , mostly Californian , in a pursuit in which experience has seemed inseparable from success and in which speed secrets and family secrets have often been one and the same . The outfit had been deserted in midseason by its chief , Jake Elder , who felt the rest of the crew was not only too green but also too laid-back . // When Elder departed , young Doug Richert became crew chief . Richert had worked as a mechanic on the team throughout his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of four years  --  ever since he was 16 . Hardly anyone gave Earnhardt much chance at the championship after Elder left . Richert against Junior Johnson , the legendary crew chief for Yarborough ? A mismatch made in heaven for Yarborough. // But a funny thing happened after Richert took over . A common spirit developed ; the crew became even more relaxed , yet more determined . " We had something to prove , " says Richert . " We were supposed to fall on our butts , go down the tubes . We did n't . There was a lot of adrenaline flowing . We knew we could do the job . " // Richert and his men not only proved something , but they also cracked a myth : that stock-car racing 's secrets are buried decades deep . Says Earnhardt , " There are no deep , dark secrets . That 's part of the old philosophy my daddy taught me : you prepare that race car the best you can , and you work hard and run hard and keep your damn composure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // So there they were , Earnhardt and Yarborough , side-by-side on the front row . Yarborough , not one to feather-foot under any condition  --  and certainly not with another championship just 500 miles away  --  was confident that a fourth NASCAR title was his . Only Richard Petty , with seven , had ever won more . Petty would be starting three rows behind him . " Ah b'lieve ah 'm going to win it , " Yarborough would say . // Shortly before the start , Yarborough approached Earnhardt . It was the first time they had spoken all week . " Use your head , " Yarborough said . " The both of us , " Earnhardt replied . On the back-stretch , as the cars burbled along slowly on the pace lap , Earnhardt looked over and saw Yarborough looking back at him , giving him the thumbs-up sign , wishing him a good race . // For 365 of the 500 miles it was anything but a good race for Earnhardt . He began fading shortly after the start . There were 30- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's handling , and he did n't have the horsepower to make up the difference . Yarborough stayed with the front pack , pulling five , 10 , 20 seconds away from Earnhardt. // It got worse for Earnhardt before it got better . On Lap 69 a yellow caution flag came out , and Earnhardt and his crew miscalculated their position relative to the leader . He pitted for fuel too soon and lost a lap . In sixth position and needing fifth to assure himself of the championship , Earnhardt tried desperately to get back on the same lap with the leaders through the middle of the race . Twice he had excellent opportunities , but could n't make it . Meanwhile , Yarborough kept circling the course near or in the lead . Earnhardt looked a loser . // Then , on Lap 145 the breaks started coming . Darrell Waltrip blew his engine , moving Earnhardt into fifth , his sanctuary . Six laps later there was another yellow flag after a spin , and when the green came back out , Earnhardt made a move that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship for him . As the field rounded Turn Four under the yellow , he broke out of the pack and , the moment the green flag fell , passed four cars and then blew past a surprised Yarborough , the leader , to unlap himself . // Then came another stroke of good luck for Earnhardt . The yellow flag came out again , which by NASCAR 's rules allowed him to speed around to the back of the pack and make up the lap he had lost . When the cars resumed racing speed on Lap 156 , Earnhardt again smoked past Yarborough and found himself in the lead for the first time . " I was ready , and they were n't , " he said later . // Yarborough repassed Earnhardt , and a fine duel was under way . Earnhardt put his car inches from Yarborough 's rear bumper as they flashed through lap after lap in a two-car convoy . He had Yarborough exactly where he wanted him , squarely in his sights and in a position in which the draft created by Yarborough 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horsepower deficiency . // All he had to do to clinch the championship was hang in there . But then he momentarily forgot what his daddy had taught him . When he came in for his final scheduled pit stop , he lost his damn composure . There 's no other way to put it . First he slid into his own pit wall , scattering his crew . Then , while they were trying to change the right rear tire , he tore out of the pit with the car still up on the jack . A NASCAR inspector tried to stop him , fearing that the wheel the crew had begun to change would work itself loose and come spinning off under the stress of a 170-mph sprint to the finish line . The stunned crew ran around in circles . The tire they never got the chance to change was down to the cord . A black flag came out for Earnhardt , forcing him to come into the pits once more to put on the three lug nuts that had been left behind when he rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew held their breath as they looked toward the scoreboard to see just how many positions the mental lapse had lost . There came a collective sigh of relief when they saw that Earnhardt was fifth . Now they knew their driver had the championship , if by the skin of his teeth  --  and that they would win the Sears Craftsman pit crew championship , a title earned by a crew 's car spending the least amount of time in the pits in 10 selected races during the season . The Earnhardt gang beat its closest rivals  --  which happened to be Yarborough 's crew , commanded by Johnson  --  by five points . // Meanwhile , Yarborough had been passed by Parsons , who sped away to win by 6.3 seconds . Because Parsons will be replaced on the M.C. Anderson Chevrolet team by Yarborough next season and was thus out of a job the moment he crossed the finish line , it was a particularly satisfying victory . Neil Bonnett passed Yarborough on the last lap , pushing him back to third place . // Yarborough , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that this had been his last real chance for a fourth championship . After the race he closed his garage door behind him , so he could be alone with his disappointment . // Earnhardt , meanwhile , had got the message . " Let 's go to Vegas , " he said following the race . The luck that had been with him in California was still there when he got to Nevada . After he won $290 at blackjack , Earnhardt went at the slots . A few cranks later , three oranges came flipping into the windows and 100 silver dollars came clattering into the tray . At that moment Earnhardt looked very damn composed .
