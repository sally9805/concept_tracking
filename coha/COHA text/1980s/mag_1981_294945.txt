At the President 's initial press conference and in other words and deeds , some symbolic and some concrete , he made it pla-in that he has strategies for foreign as well as domestic policy , that he has a team he thinks can carry them out and that he will not be deterred by criticism . <P> The slings and arrows of protest are bound to multiply as the Reagan Administration slashes at the budget at home and stiff-arms the Soviet Union abroad . During a meeting with his economic advisers , Reagan remarked : " I come from a warm climate . I enjoy a warm climate . I 'll take a warm climate .
