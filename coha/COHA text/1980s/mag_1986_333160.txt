Angola remains mired in a seemingly endless war between the Marxist-Leninist government , led since 1979 by Jose Eduardo dos Santos , and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( unita ) , headed by Jonas Savimbi and supported by South Africa and the U.S. After a decade the fighting drags on , with no prospect of victory on either side . TIME 's Nairobi bureau chief , James Wilde , recently spent 15 days crisscrossing Angola . His journey took him from the U.S.-operated oil installations in the northern enclave of Cabinda to the capital , Luanda , where he was admitted to the presidential palace three times . His report : <P> A man dressed in a threadbare overcoat and a small boy in rags stand in a sewage-clogged shantytown street just outside Luanda . The man has no right leg , the boy no left . As the boy hammers out a rhythm with a stick on a battered tin can , the man begins to swing his shortened limb in time to the beat . Others join in . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon nearly 100 cripples are shaking their mutilated bodies to the beat of the weird tin drum . <P> The danse macabre is a reminder of the toll exacted by the ongoing civil war . By now some 20,000 civilians have lost limbs to rebel mines planted among crops , under footpaths and along dusty village roads . Thousands more have been killed by the rebels or by government troops on the prowl for guerrilla collaborators . Economically , the nation has also been left maimed . President Dos Santos concedes that the war has already cost his government more than $12 billion ; 1 million of the country 's 8.5 million people are on the brink of starvation . <P> In theory , the 100,000 soldiers of the Angolan army , backed by as many as 40,000 Cuban troops and more than 1,500 Soviet and East German advisers , should have gained the upper hand long ago . Luanda has received $2 billion in military hardware from Moscow in recent years ; airports are crowded with Soviet assault helicopters and fighter aircraft , and ports provide havens for Soviet warships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rags and many are demoralized . Observes a church worker who has lived in the country three years : " When things get tough , they peel off their uniforms and take to the bush . " <P> Savimbi 's 40,000 UNITA fighters , backed by an estimated 20,000 South African troops stationed across the border in the South African-controlled territory of South West Africa , or Namibia , have extended their operations to within 40 miles of Luanda . In addition to their military successes , the rebels scored a diplomatic triumph earlier this year when President Reagan welcomed Savimbi to Washington and promised him $15 million for new equipment .
