Bang ! Apple announces it is laying off 1 , 200 employees and closing three of its six manufacturing plants. // Bang ! Wang says it will lay off 1 , 600 people and will suffer losses for the first time in its history. // Bang ! National Semiconductor says it is cutting its work force by 1 , 300. // Bang ! IBM forecasts an earnings decline for the first nine months , sending the stock market into a nosedive. // // And that was only June. // The alarming news from the microcomputer maker , the minicomputer company , the semiconductor manufacturer , and even invincible Big Blue , which makes mainframes as well as small computers , shows how widespread the high-tech slump is. // But the news was not unexpected . In recent months , thousands of employees have been laid off or asked to take vacations . The most profitable and stable of companies have reported losses or declines in earnings . Small companies are going out of business and new companies are hunting in vain for venture capital . The consolidation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced a possible merger last week , presumably to combine their marketing , manufacturing , and research costs. // The slump is blamed on two developments : ( 1 ) the economic slowdown , which has induced businesses to hold off on investing in equipment such as computers ; and ( 2 ) the strong dollar , which cheapens imports. // To their dismay , young computer companies are finding that they are in a very cyclical industry . This new generation of computermakers , born after the last computer industry downturn in 1975-76 , now sees it can not glide over every turbulent period as it did in 1980-81. // Such companies may not remember the computer slump in 1971-72 and then again in 1975-76 . The reason the industry was unscathed by the last recession , says Kenneth Flamm , a research associate at the Brookings Institution and co-author of ' ' The Global Factory , ' ' is that two big markets opened up to computer makers . The weak dollar boosted US exports overseas , and inexpensive computers caught the imagination and wallets of individuals and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies today. // But the long-term outlook for computers is healthy , say Dr. Flamm , because technology is still advancing by leaps and bounds . For the last 25 years , he says , the cost of computing power ( a unit of computing capacity ) has dropped by 30 percent a year in real terms . That means that $10 , 000 worth of computing power seven or eight years ago now costs $1 , 000 . And as costs continue to drop - and they will , he says , because so much money is being poured into research and development - computers expand into more and more industrial markets. // In the near term , however , there are fundamental problems American companies must solve if they are to stave off foreign competition. // The very nature of the computer is changing , and computer companies have been slow to adjust to the shift . The computer is becoming a low-cost , high-volume ' ' commodity ' ' product , less dependent on innovation and more dependent on low-cost production . This has played to Southeast Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing . It hit the semiconductor industry first , and today some 80 to 90 percent of the memory chips are built offshore . But small computers and peripherals such as disk drives and printers are cheaper to produce abroad : Singapore , for example , makes them for 25 to 30 percent less than the US , analysts estimate. // William Easterbrook at Kidder , Peabody &; Co. predicts that by the end of the decade , 90 to 95 percent of computers - not just micros , but even the more sophisticated minicomputers and mainframes - will be commodity products , easy to produce and susceptible to foreign competition . The US should prepare itself for a bigger wave of imports and look for its niche in software , marketing , and new technologies , he says. // ' ' To the extent that ( computers ) becomes a commodity industry , we ' re in trouble , ' ' says Flamm . ' ' You ' re going to die if you mass-produce low-end computers , because the US can ' t compete with the cost of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a temporary monopoly , ' ' he says. // Some analysts say that the trend toward offshore manufacturing may be ending . Ted Lyman , associate director of public policy at SRI International , says the process of manufacturing computers is becoming so advanced that US firms will not want such technology to get into foreign hands . He cites the case of the Macintosh plant in Freemont , Calif. , which can turn out a Macintosh computer every 27 seconds . Because the plant is so automated , he says , labor is 1 percent of costs , which makes the low-cost labor abroad less attractive. // However , manufacturing should not return to the US in the immediate future , Flamm says . Because computer technology is changing so fast , it is too early for companies to invest in the latest assembly technology . No matter how advanced the Macintosh facility seems today , it will be obsolete soon . Companies would be smarter , he says , to keep manufacturing labor-intensive , and hire or fire workers in Southeast Asia as sales rise and fall. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or software , but a ' ' business solution , ' ' says Nicholas Pagon , an analyst at Butcher &; Singer . Executives , realizing that the machines have not cranked up office productivity the way they thought they would , are pausing before buying new computers , he says . They want to integrate desktop machines with mainframes and are waiting to see which companies can best help them do that . ' ' Computer companies won ' t see their margins increase unless they sell a solution ( to a customer ' s particular business problems ) and not hardware , ' ' he says. // These problems are forcing changes on the once-footloose industry . If it was ideas that generated the industry ' s first profits , it is cost-cutting , marketing , and planning that will sustain them . In perhaps the most telling symbol of this , Steven Jobs , wunderkind of Silicon Valley , was kicked upstairs May 31 in a reorganization at Apple that combined the company ' s six divisions into two . Analysts have applauded the reorganization , saying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to within a company , have analysts less thrilled . If Burroughs does acquire Sperry , the new company would span the market - from Burroughs ' commercial products to Sperry ' s military ones - and would be the second-largest computer firm after IBM . But their computers are very different and run different software. // ' ' I don ' t see much near-term synergy , ' ' says Mr. Easterbrook at Kidder , Peabody . ' ' It ' s reminiscent of other big computer mergers in the past , in which it took years and years to develop compatibility of products . ' ' He says it will be at least five years before Sperry and Burroughs can smooth out their differences. // Nevertheless , experts say the industry needs to consolidate . The venture capital boom in 1983-84 created too many computer companies , says Easterbrook . There are thousands of hardware firms today , and there should be only hundreds . The software industry will still be fragmented , he says , but the 15 , 000 firms will be pared down. // Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the industry ' ' is between two waves of growth ' ' as new products start to come into the market in two years . Still , he says the industry will grow 13. 7 percent in 1985 : ' ' The industry has gone from the Rolls Royce of economic growth the the BMW. ' ' // // // //
