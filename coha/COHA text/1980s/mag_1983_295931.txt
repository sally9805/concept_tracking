In Alabama , a TV station gets a story that no one should want <P> The call was the kind that every TV news director dreads : a despondent person demanding the attention of a camera , and an audience , for one last desperate act . On scant notice and even scanter knowledge , the TV executive must decide whether the threat is news to be covered , or a cruel , senseless display that the cameras will only encourage . The voice on the telephone said , " If you want to see somebody set himself on fire , be at the square in Jacksonville in ten minutes . " <P> On duty that quiet Friday night in the newsroom of WHMA-TV , Channel 40 , the only TV station in Anniston , Ala. ( pop . 29,500 ) , were a woman office worker and Photographer Ronald Simmons , 30 , and Sound Technician Gary Harris , 18 . Both men had been up since early morning covering a high school basketball tournament . <P> Thrust into something they had never imagined would be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a hoax . But they telephoned police . That decision was right . Almost everything that followed went tragically wrong . WHMA got its story , one of the more horrifying minutes of video footage ever recorded . The nation , and especially its journalists , got a troubling case study that prompted an overdue debate about whether some stories are worth getting . <P> The caller was Cecil Andrews , 37 , an unemployed roofer and day laborer who had a history of instability . On the night he telephoned his threat or plea to WHMA , he was staggering drunk . Andrews was apparently near the Jacksonville square ( actually , a green rectangle bordered by shops and the city 's police and fire stations ) when he phoned the TV newsroom three times within half an hour . He was there when Simmons and Harris arrived and set up their lights and camera , more than an hour after Andrews ' original call . The police insist that they and volunteer firemen combed the area , but were unable to spot any sign of a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> What followed was the gruesome result of lapses in communication and judgment . The station , which had alerted the police four separate times , contends it had worked out a deal to use the camera as " bait " to draw the troubled caller out of hiding so that police could apprehend him . Police Chief Paul Locke , 35 , however , says there was no such deal . In any case , Simmons and Harris failed to notify the police of their arrival on the scene , an omission that both sides termed disastrous . Says Chief Locke : " I am very critical of their behavior . " <P> The next moments in the unnerving story are recorded on a videotape that WHMA showed in edited form on its news the following evening . By the end of last week , excerpts from it had been seen by tens of millions of Americans on the nightly news shows of CBS , NBC and ABC . Andrews came up to the camera crew . They stalled him , briefly , then set the camera rolling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had doused with lighter fluid . The match went out . He touched another match to his leg . That too went out . He stumbled a few steps toward the lighter fluid , splashed more on , returned to the camera , squatted and touched another match to his left thigh . A tiny glow appeared , then spread .
