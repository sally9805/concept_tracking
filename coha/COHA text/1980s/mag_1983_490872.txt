THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment HERE are some of the cultural events that were taking place in New York recently . On the second floor of the Metropolitan Museum , a small army of curators , designers , carpenters , painters , and electricians were working behind a temporary plywood wall to mount " The Vatican Collections : The Papacy and Art " ? a dazzling assortment of two hundred and thirty-seven sculptures , paintings , ceramics , textiles , and examples of metalwork from the vast and eclectic collections of the Vatican . We signed in with a uniformed guard and walked through dust-filled rooms that contained material from the old St. Peter 's ( marble bas-reliefs from early Christian sarcophagi ; eighth-century mosaics ; thirteenth-century fresco fragments ) , material from the new St. Peter 's ( four exquisite terra-cotta Bernini models for statues ; the glittering Late Renaissance Farnese Cross and candlesticks ) , objects from the Library Museums ( a third-century portrait of a husband and wife scratched from gold leaf mounted on glass ; a tiny fourteenth-century mosaic portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gregorian Etruscan Museum ( Attic and Corinthian vases ; Etruscan gold armbands ; a mysterious bronze disc with a lion 's head which may have ornamented an Etruscan bier ) . Then we turned right and groped through an opaque plastic curtain to enter a high-ceilinged octagonal room that contained the Apollo Belvedere , the Belvedere Torso , a Raphael tapestry ( " The Miraculous Draught of Fishes " ) , which was dimly visible beneath a protective covering of plastic , and Philippe de Montebello , the director of the Metropolitan and the man primarily responsible for bringing the show to New York . Mr. de Montebello , who has black hair and aquiline features , and a faint touch of France in his speech , told us that the first order of business had been to find a credible intellectual framework within which objects from different periods and cultures could fit . " We decided that our hinge would be the link to the papacy ? to a dynasty of popes who collected and commissioned art for more than fifteen hundred years , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michelangelo - and then , in the eighteenth century , they were among the first rulers in Europe to launch the modern public museum . The Vatican now has nine museums , with collections that range from antiquities and paintings to ethnic and contemporary art , and we are showing objects from all of them . " We asked Mr. de Montebello if he had any personal favorites in the show . " I will not rake up anything obscure , " he said . " A major exhibit such as this serves to confirm the fact that great works of art  --  the Farnese candelabras , the Caravaggio , the Apollo Belvedere , the Torso , the Raphael tapestry , the Melozzo da Foal angels  --  remain great because they have that extra something that really moves one . The Farnese Cross and candelabras embody the power of Rome and Florence during the latter half of the sixteenth century . The Apollo Belvedere is not only beautiful but enormously influential in the history of art . When it was installed in the Belvedere courtyard , in the first decade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew it , and made sculptures of it . Almost every standing figure in painting , draped or undraped , in any form of movement , from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth is derived from that contrapposto pose of the Apollo . " ? SEVEN blocks north , the Guggenheim was preparing an exhibition of paintings by Joan MirO and Yves Tanguy , two gifted artists who pursued different paths into the subterranean dream world of Surrealism . Tanguy , a legendary eccentric , who was at the center of the Surrealist movement , is the subject of a major retrospective of paintings , drawings , letters , photographs , and illustrated hooks which was assembled by the Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou , in Paris . MirO , who will turn ninety in April , is being honored by a small exhibit of nine paintings and two ceramic works , all from the museum 's permanent collection . We looked at three 1tlinis hanging in the museum storage room and soon to be hung in the exhibition  --  an early , Cubist-inspired landscape ( " Prades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with recognizable animals deployed in unreal patterns ( " The Tilled Field " ) , and a large abstract canvas ( entitled simply " Painting " ) filled with bright-colored vegetal shapes . Then we asked Thomas Messer , the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation , if he could give us a definition of Surrealism which would apply to both artists . " I can draw your attention to two aspects of Surrealism , " Mr. Messer , a slight , gray-haired man , replied cautiously . " One has to do with figurative Surrealism  --  with the depiction of a dream world which one sees in Max Ernst and , of course , Tanguy . These paintings contain readable images , and for that reason Surrealism never found a niche in our original Museum of Non-Objective Painting . MirO , on the other hand , has been bought by all three directors of the Guggenheim , because he has to do with the other aspect of Surrealism  --  the freewheeling , spontaneous formation of shapes and dream images as an expression of the subconscious . " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met him when I was a student at Harvard , " said Mr. Messer . " Ile was a very small , controlled man who radiated great and somewhat forbidding authority . Later , when I came to the Guggenheim , I had the delicate task of negotiating with 1lir6 to design a mosaic mural as a memorial for Harry Guggenheim 's wife , Alicia Patterson . Harry asked me hesitantly if I could imagine having in the mural something that could specifically recall Alicia . It was not easy to convey this to Min:5 , but he answered with great warmth and understanding and offered to do something around the letters of her name . The problem was that he insisted on spelling her name ' Alice , ' ignoring my repeated requests to the contrary . When the mural arrived here , the letters in it read ' Alice , ' and I had the unenviable task of explaining this to Harry Guggenheim . Fortunately , he felt that the design was beautiful and the letters were close enough . We 've taken down the wall that covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mir() horrimage . " ? N the Museum of Modern Art , the film curators Adrienne Mancia and Stephen Harvey were inaugurating a three-month survey of French silent films with " Le Petit Caf ? , " a marvellously funny boulevard farce made in 1919 , which stars Max Linder , one of the first big international movie stars . Linder , a compact man with slicked-down black hair , a round face , large , expressive eyes , a perpetually quivering mustache , and an agile , Chaplinesque body , plays Albert Loriflan , a simpleminded waiter who inherits a fortune upon the death of his mountain-climbing father . The plot turns on the fact that Albert can not enjoy his inheritance , because Philibert , the cafe owner , and Bigredan , a scheming former employee of Albert 's father , have tied him to a contract that gives them a big chunk of his money if he quits his job . Albert turns into a terrible waiter by day and a playboy by night , but eventually he settles down with Philibert 's daughter , Yvonne , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , we asked Stephen Harvey to tell us something about Max Linder . " He was a music-hall performer who started working in films around 1905 , " said Mr. Harvey . " Although he was essentially a physical comedian , he invented an image that was more sophisticated , more bourgeois , than Chaplin 's . " " What other unusual films will you be showing ? " we asked . " We 've scheduled some of the very short actuante films that were made by the Lurniere Brothers in 1895 , " Mr. Harvey replied . " Also , an episode from ' Les Vampires , ' which is a gangster serial that was made by Louis Feuillade in 1915-16 ; two rare silent films made by Jean Renoir in the twenties ; and L'Argent , ' a three-hour silent epic made in 1927 , which is a powerful indictment of the rapacious world of high finance . It was directed by Marcel L'Herbier , one of the most determinedly experimental filmmakers of that period , and it has Art Deco sets , highly advanced imagery , tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a famous German actor ; Yvette Guilbert , the music-hall star ; and Antonin Artaud , the actor and visionary . " ? NAvery Fisher Hall , Giuseppe Sinopoli , a young Italian maestro who is also a physician and a composer , was rehearsing Mozart 's limpid D-Minor Piano Concerto with Malcolm Frager and the New York Philharmonic . In the last five years , Mr. Sinopoli  --  who is thirty-six years old , has shaggy brown hair and a brown beard , and physically resembles a young Karl Marx  --  has become a major force in international music . He has conducted orchestras in Berlin , London , Vienna , New York , and Los Angeles . He has composed a number of avant-garde works , including an opera , " Lou Salome , " which was given its premiere in 1981 in Munich . He has signed with Deutsche Grammophon to record works by Verdi , Puccini , Schubert , Schumann , Brahms , Mahler , and Berlioz . And he is booked through 1986 in a number of leading opera houses for performances of Verdi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dressing room after the rehearsal and asked him when he had made the transition from medicine to music . " After I took my laurea in psychiatric medicine , I began to study with the composer Bruno Maderna , and it was his influence that led me to concentrate on music , " he said . " My conducting career began in 1975 , when I was asked to conduct Mahler 's Fifth and Sixth Symphonies at the Flanders Festival . I must have been crazy to begin with two such monumental works , but the performances went well and I was engaged for other concerts . My opera career began in 1977 , when I conducted an ' Aida ' at the Fenice , in Venice . Since the orchestra members knew I had n't had any experience with opera , they proposed an exam . They asked me to conduct the second-act triumphal scene from memory . I said , ' Gentlemen , I will conduct it from memory if you will play it from memory . ' Of course , they all screamed at that , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a score . After the first half hour , the orchestra relaxed . At the end of an hour , I sent everybody home for lunch . As things worked out , the orchestra asked me back for a Tosca ' the following year . " We asked Mr. Sinopoli what opera composers he is conducting right now . " At present , only Verdi and Puccini . I have reserved Strauss for 1985 and Wagner for 1986 , " he said . " And I have n't conducted the Beethoven symphonies , because I find when I analyze them that it 's hard to get to the same spiritual level inside myself that I find in the scores . With Beethoven , the problem begins after the Second Symphony  --  there is a crisis in his work when the musical expressivity tries to break the form . To create a synthesis between these opposing forces is difficult for me at the moment . " " How about Mozart ? " we asked . " I conduct only the concertos now , " Mr. Sinopoli replied . " In Verdi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fire is small , intense , and white-hot . His music must be played with elegance , and with cantabilita  --  a very light , very clear musical line . He is extremely intelligent , and everything that is extremely intelligent is also extremely violent  --  his musical ideas , for example , create complexes in other people . Ten years from now , I might feel capable of conducting a Mozart symphony or opera . " ? NEXT door , in a basement re-hearsal room at the Metropolitan Opera , the Italian actor-director Raf Vallone was blocking out a dramatic confrontation between two lovers which occurs during the second act of Francesco Cilea 's " Adriana Lecouvreur , " a melodramatic tale of love and intrigue in eighteenth-century Paris . Besides Mr. Vallone , the room contained four singers , a pianist , a conductor , two assistant stage directors , and , in the center , a set consisting of three Iow steps  --  the entrance to an imaginary suburban villa . Two chairs and a table were grouped at the left , and two freestanding doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the entrances and exits required by the complicated plot . Behind the door on the left , the Princess de Bouillon , who had come to the villa to meet Maurizio , Count of Saxony , a dashing military hero , was hiding from her husband . Behind the door on the right , the Prince de Bouillon , who had been duped into thinking that the lady in hiding was not his wife but his mistress , was preparing to have dinner . Standing in front of the door that concealed the Princess were Adriana Lecouvreur ( Renata Scotto ) ? the leading actress of the Comedic Francaise , who was there at the invitation of the Prince  --  and Maurizio ( Neil Shicoff ) , who was her lover . We settled into a chair and opened a score as Mr. Vallone explained that he was working on the scene in which Maurizio prevents Adriana from discovering the identity of the Princess . He placed Miss Scotto ? a tiny , pretty soprano with a heart-shaped face and short , curly brown hair  --  in the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left as Mr. Shicoff , a scholarly-looking young tenor with black hair and black-rimmed glasses , ? tried to halt her . To Mr. Shicoff he said , " As you follow her back , you grab her and say , ' You must trust me . ' " " But watch my dress , " said Miss Scotto , who was wearing a sweater and skirt for the rehearsal . " It is very elaborate , with a very big skirt . " The two singers ran through their lines with the pianist , but Mr. Vallone wanted a more dramatic confrontation . Seizing a libretto , he bounded into the center of the room and read Maurizio 's lines , in an actor 's deep , resonant voice . Then he lunged impetuously toward the retreating Miss ? Scotto and seized her arm in a grip that made her wince . " There is a crescendo in the music there , " lie said to Mr. Shicoff , " and it 's a marvellous moment for Maurizio . He 's a real innocent , the servant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the audience here , and you must also persuade Adriana that you love her , and not the woman that you are trying to protect . " " Do I believe him ? " asked Miss Scotto . " You love him , " Mr. Vallone told her , with an expansive wave of his arms . " Do n't take this libretto too seriously . We know the plot is a hit crazy , but the music is sublime . " Tags and Purposes PARTIES , like so many things these days , have become more complex . We were invited to a cocktail party the other evening that had not one official purpose but many purposes . Several thousand members of the National Retail Merchants ' Association were meeting in town , and the party was being given for a number of these merchants , most of them owners and executives of department stores . The party was also being given to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Glemby International , the world 's oldest operator of beauty salons in department stores . Glemhy 's beauty salons are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in department stores in the United Kingdom , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Denmark , and Mexico as well . In addition , Glemby is in partnership with Kenneth Battelle , who is the Mr. Kenneth of Kenneth 's Beauty Salons , which is in its own place , a five-story Edwardian mansion at 19 East Fifty-fourth Street  --  and that is where this multipurpose party was held . A poster at the entrance to the party read , " GLEMBY THANKS 1,250 BEAU EIFUL S roRrs FOR ' 100 BEAUTIFUL YEARS . ' " Nathan Finkelstein , the chairman of Glemby International , and Mr. Kenneth were the party 's co-hosts . The party was also celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Ken neth 's . Still another purpose of the party was to celebrate beauty beyond the confines of beauty parlors . Lola Finkelstein , an attractive , trim woman with reddish-blond curly hair , who had on an elegant lung-sleeved black velvet dress , and who is an oftenheard-from member of Community Board Five and is the wife of Glemby International 's chairman , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty inside as well as on top of the head , " she said . To further this purpose , two Glemby grants were to be presented at the party  --  one to the New York Public Library , the other to the Municipal Art Society . " I strongly believe that private business has an obligation to try to give good things of all kinds to this city , " Mr. Finkelstein , an attractive , trim gentleman with a conservative , perfect haircut , told us when we arrived at the party , where very little beauty-parlor paraphernalia was in evidence . Hair dryers had been shoved into shampoo rooms , which were closed off . There was a big , busy bar , and a lot of delicious canap  --  s were passed around by polite waitresses : fresh shrimp , miniature hamburgers , Norwegian salmon on triangles of pumpernickel , and bacon sticks . " Kenneth loves bacon sticks , " Mrs. Finkelstein told us . " My favorite , " said Mr. Kenneth , an attractive , trim gentleman with a conservative , perfect haircut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party . " Extra bacon sticks and whatever else is n't eaten immediately go to Meals on ' Wheels , " Mrs. Finkelstein said firmly . The toastmaster at the party was Alan King , the actor-comedian , who is an old friend of the Finkelsteins , and his principal purpose there , Mrs. Finkelstein told us , was to present the grants  --  to Mrs. Vincent Astor for the library ( she is the Honorary Chairman of the N.Y.P.L. 's Board of Trustees ) and to the architect Philip Johnson for the Municipal Art Society . Mr. King glided in to the party accompanied by his attractive , trim , auburn-haired wife , Jeannette , who was wearing an above-the-knee black cashmere dress with a matching sleeveless vest . It was apparently Mr. King 's additional purpose at the party to tell jokes . " Max Asnas , " Mr. King said to us . " He 's dead . Before he was dead , I once came to his Stage Delicatessen , and I said hello to Max . He did n't answer inc . I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he said to me , ' Hello and a " A large circle of merchants around Mr. King laughed . The merchants , like everybody else at the party , were wearing identification tags . We read a few : " Herb Jacobson . Bergner 's . Peoria , Ill . " " Lord Marcus Sieff . Marks &; Spencer . London . " " Marvin Traub . Bloomingdale 's . New York . " " Geraldine Stutz . Henri Bendel . New York . " Mr. King patted the lapels of his jacket . " A man came over to rue just now , " Mr. King said . " He said ' May I shake your hand My wife collects handshakes . ' " Mr. King laughed . " My wife collects handshakes , " he repeated , and he turned the palms of his hands out . Mrs. King laughed . The merchants laughed . It was becoming a noisy party . In the background , there was music  --  Bert Kent on guitar and banjo , John Weed on an electric piano , playing Gershwin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alabamy Bound . " " Why Alahamy Bound ' ? " we asked Mr. Kent . " For the Southern crowd , " he said . " We accommodate . " Mr. Finkelstein told THE NEW YORKER us that of about a dozen Glemby senior vice-presidents at the party many had started out as hairdressers . " Hairdressers make excellent vice-presidents , " he said . Mrs. Astor , who is a gracious , twinkly-eyed woman with a conservative , perfect haircut , and who was wearing a brown-and-rust print sheer-wool dress with a matching chiffon scarf , told Mr. Kenneth and Mr. Finkelstein that they had better remember to take off their identification tags after the party . " I had a tag on at one party , and from there I went along to buy some running shoes , " Mrs. Astor said . " Everybody was addressing me by name until I realized , ' Good heavens ! I forgot to take off my tag . ' " Herb Jacobson of Bergner 's in Peoria told Mrs. Astor that beauty salons in stores were a viable business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees his beauty-salon customers carrying a lot of packages out of his store . Mrs. Astor then told Mr. Jacobson that Peru , Indiana  --  which she used to think was Peoria , Illinois  --  was where Cole Porter had come from . " My second husband , Charles Marshall , went to Yale with him , " Mrs. Astor said . Mr. Kenneth told Philip Johnson arid Mr. Finkelstein that his twenty years had been wonderful years but he did n't think that he would make a hundred . 11,4r . Finkelstein told Mr. Kenneth to keep trying . Vartan Gregorian , a jolly fellow with frizzy hair puffed over his forehead , who is the president of the New York Public Library , told Mr. Kenneth he had got a haircut just for the party . Mr. Kenneth looked skeptical . Dr. Gregorian , a former history professor , dean , and provost at the University of Pennsylvania , told Mr. Finkelstein that he was the only Ph.D . candidate in 1960 at Stanford who in his oral exam knew the answer to the ultimate question : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to think was the Treaty of Finkelstein . Dr. Gregorian then told his listeners the answer to the ultimate question : " The treaty of alliance , in 1807 , between the Shah of Persia and Napoleon . " Mrs. Astor told a lot of people that it was wonderful of Glemby to give a grant to the library . Mrs. Astor told us that she loved coming in to Kenneth 's to get her hair done . " It 's my hideout , " she said . " I get all my telephoning and other work done here . " Mrs. King told everybody that her hair was colored at Kenneth 's and that she was crazy about the color . Andrew Stein , Manhattan Borough President , turned up and told everybody he was very happy to be there . Lord Marcus Sieff told us that he felt proud to be " a third-generation shopkeeper , " and that Marks &; Spencer was going to celebrate its " cen-teen-ry " next year , and was planning to follow Glemby 's example by celebrating via community service . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told us . " But they were not impressed . They asked me , ' Would you like to come to our **29;6792;TOOLONG ? ' " Philip I. Berman , chairman of the board of Hess 's stores , Allentown , Pennsylvania , handed us two different kinds of business cards  --  one of them unusually long and narrow and hearing the store 's name over and over again , and the other tiny and bearing a picture of Mr. Berman holding a telephone to his ear . " Everything we do is special , " he told us in explanation , and then he introduced us to his wife , " Our main store is decorated with tremendous , gorgeous crystal chandeliers , " Mrs. Berman told us . " And with original art by Italian masters . The armor . The spears . Everything . " Bert Kent played " It 's 0 ' Lovely " on his banjo . Then Alan King got up on a platform and made a joke about how he owed the New York Public Library seventeen hundred dollars for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. King patted his lapels and presented the Glemby grant to Mrs. Astor . Then Mr. King made a joke about how he could n't find 19 East Fifty-fourth Street , because suddenly a Philip Johnson-designed building had been put up in the way . Laughs . Mr. King presented the grant to Mr. Johnson . All the purposes of the party seemed to have been accomplished . Later on , boxes of fresh shrimp , miniature hamburgers , smoked salmon , and bacon sticks were packed for Meals on Wheels . A Glemby senior vice-president who was formerly a hairdresser said that it had been a great party , and told us , " Everybody else gives awards to Bill Blass. "
