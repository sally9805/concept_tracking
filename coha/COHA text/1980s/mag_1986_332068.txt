Musicals used to trade in innocence . Fred Astaire could get a thrill just from being caught in the rain with Ginger Rogers . Gene Kelly shouted , " Got ta dance ! " as if it were a battle cry or a mating call . But those carefree days seem as distant as Ike and Mamie ; musicals have more serious topics  --  Argentine dictators , pointillist painters  --  weighing on their souls . Musicals used to be called , oh , High Spirits . Now London 's hot song-and-dance show is Les Miserables , which locals translate as The Glums . That is precisely the disease afflicting the modern musical . Artistic ambition and a social conscience are all very fine , but please , sirs , can we have our pleasure back ? <P> On this score , Absolute Beginners is a pretty little cheat . It promises a larkish tour of London in 1958 , the year Britain discovered both rock ' n ' roll as an anarchic force and teenagers as a voracious new consumer class . Colin ( Eddie O'Connell ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapping pictures of mods and trads ; Suzette ( Patsy Kensit ) is a proto-Twiggy fashion model- designer . Sade , Ray Davies and the snakily elegant David Bowie appear in elaborate production numbers  --  upmarket rock videos , really  --  and Julien Temple , a master director of the short music form , revs up the visuals so that everything looks like a display in the biggest , fanciest boutique window . <P> It is too good to last . The film 's cynical insider tone turns apocalyptic for a third act of corrupt development schemes and race riots . The preachy message has drowned out the music . And what began as a giddy ride in the Time Machine ends up as angst for the memories . R.C.
