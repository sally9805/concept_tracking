The agreement thus blocks the hostages , their families , or anyone else from suing Iran for damages . It also states that the U.S. will not make any claim for damages to U.S. property , including the U.S. Embassy compound in Tehran . THE PROVISION . titled " nullification of sanctions and claims , " seems sure to provoke a controversy .

THE AGREEMENTS provide , in general , for a restoration of Iran 's financial position prior to Nov. 14 , 1979 , when sanctions were imposed . Once the hostages leave Iran , the U.S. has three days within which to make the first transfers . The U.S. can cancel the transfers if the Iranians renege . The U.S. will return $2.2 billion under its control . A more substantial though unspecified amount held in foreign branches of U.S. banks will be returned , with interest . The U.S. then has six months to accomplish the transfer of about $3 billion of Iranian assets from U.S. banks . The Iranians agreed that clainis against these funds will be submitted to binding arbitration , and , be decided by an International ArbItral Tribunal , made up of no fewer than nine members with ' equal numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIS ARRANGEMENT conforms to settlement of past international claims , ? such as U.S. claims against the People 's Republic of China . Outstanding claims can be settled by joint consent before the tribunal sits . The tribunal will be formed after six months , with a possible extension of three months if the full transfer of assets is not completed . The assets will first go to a mutually agreed upon central bank . That bank will act-under instructions of the Algerian Central Bank . In other words , it appears the money will not be sent to - Algeria but Algeria in effect will have authority over it . IN ADDITION , the U.S. pledged to transfer to the central bank about st billion in other  --  Iranian . assets in this country , mainly stocks and $500 million that Iran pre-paid for defense material .
