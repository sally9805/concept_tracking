Medical care for the jobless <P> President Reagan had once promised that his Administration would help laid-off workers whose health insurance had disappeared with their jobs . Said he : " We 're certainly not going to stand by and see that people , because of the misfortune of unemployment , are going to be denied necessary medical care . " <P> The details of the Administration 's solution emerged last week , and they came from Office of Management and Budget Director David Stockman . There were few surprises . The suggested program provides no new money , relies heavily on voluntarism , and is freighted with pay-as-you-go features . Stockman told a Senate Finance Committee hearing : " Any new program , no matter how meritorious , must be tax-financed in the same bill that creates the new measure . " <P> In general the proposed plan would rejigger several existing programs . One recommendation would change the tax code to deny employers deductions unless they continued to offer health-insurance coverage to laid-off workers for at least a year , or until they found other jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at group costs , which are usually lower than individual rates . The Administration also said it would back legislation requiring employers to permit the jobless to enroll in the health-care plans of their working spouses . At least 40% of the nation 's 11.4 million unemployed have working partners , said Stockman , and nearly one-third of the jobless could retain health benefits that way . <P> For the long-term unemployed and for families who have run out of unemployment benefits but are not eligible for Medicaid , the Administration recommends opening up Title XX social-service block grants . To finance these new beneficiaries , the Reagan proposal suggests changing the Administration 's health-cost-containment legislation now under consideration in Congress . That legislation would require that a family be taxed on an employer 's contribution to a worker 's health insurance if it exceeded a " tax cap " of $175 . At present , health-insurance benefits are not taxable to workers . The plan proposed by Budget Director Stockman would lower the amount to $160 . If implemented by 1984 , the change is estimated to raise an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it split as much along regional as along partisan lines . Many Congressmen from states hit hardest by unemployment felt the package did not go far enough . " We have a national problem that requires a national solution , " declared Democratic Senator Donald Riegle of Michigan , where the unemployment rate has exceeded 10% for the past 39 months . " The Administration 's economic policies helped create the problem , and the Administration is obligated to help solve it . " The proposal to lower the tax cap to $160 drew some hoots . " The Administration is making a terrible philosophical and political mistake , " Republican Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon warned Stockman . " Eventually the public will turn and snap at us . You 're going down the wrong path if you want to cut off debate on national health insurance . "
