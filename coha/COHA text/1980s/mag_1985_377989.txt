To the annoyance of a great many and the appreciation of a great many more , baseball takes some time to play . No specified amount of time , like 30 sec. in the huddle or 24 sec. to shoot , but a good deal of time , a suspension of time , almost an absence of time . Last week 's interruption , blessedly brief , was not a time-out but a time-in . The labor leaders were starting a clock in a timeless place . One baseball season is a novel that develops into a chapter that dissolves into a sentence and ends up a phrase . A career can be that way too . Even an era . But anyway , a season is the minimum span of any meaningful attention to baseball . <P> In football and basketball , say , Gale Sayers ' and Elgin Baylor 's full splendor may be inferred from a single move . But a rooftop homer might have sprung from anyone who ever hit a home run , or from Henry Aaron , who hit 755 ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommie Agee or Ron Swoboda of the Mets is the equivalent of the Giants ' Willie Mays . Baseball players plainly can not be known at a glance . " Every player , good or bad , at one time or other has played like a Hall of Famer and a Hall of Shamer . " This is an old ballplayer speaking , one who by the way contends , " Baseball is just about the best thing this country has going for it . " So consider the crackle in his voice . " But we 're all old ballplayers , that 's the point , " he says . " Who does n't play baseball ? How many girls play football ? " <P> He is 44 years old but seems both younger and older , sort of timeless too , and he is still thriving at the major league level . In an ordinary profession , the 40s may be a disquieting , though far from a disqualifying age . Mortality 's half time . But for a 44-year-old ballplayer , the end is more than just perceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the spectators know that the struggle represents no less than a Simple love of life . This beguiling summer , the most single-minded baseball player since Ty Cobb has done better than play with time . He has reached back into it to play with Cobb . It took Pete Rose two decades and more , just a blink and a nod on the eternal baseball schedule , but he has come to both a paramount moment in his game and a place of moment in any enterprise . By the numbers and beyond them , he is what he does . Rose is baseball . <P> Coiled to the left of home plate , he has scarcely stirred from the position he staked nearly 23 major league seasons , almost 4,192 hits , ago . The brush-cut hair that blew to bangs and billowed to bouffant has been tamed and dyed . The kneesprung crouch has lost barely a trace of temper . The burly body remains respectably taut , a gunnysack full of cantaloupes and cannonballs . The seamed and arid face , a slowly eroding riverbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the map of an obstinate man with 737 doubles who still flings himself flat and breaststrokes like a gopher into second base .
