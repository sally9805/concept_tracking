The informants said such a package arrangement might be a prelude to the formation of some kind of organization , sponsored by the Roman Catholic Church and led by someone other than Mr. Walesa , to replace Solidarity , which was formed in August 1980 and banned after martial law was declared in December 1981. // Mr. Walesa denied Sunday that he might quit his leadership of the Solidarity underground on the Pope ' s advice , but many officials at the Vatican were reported to believe there was such an arrangement. // In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Pope was said to have told Mr. Walesa that Solidarity protests should take the form of letters to the authorities explaining grievances and aspirations .
