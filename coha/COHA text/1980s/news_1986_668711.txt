Stung by Lee Iacocca ' s charges that the Interior Department wants to " commercialize " Ellis Island , a National Park Service professional Friday said no final decisions have been made but defended a plan to turn part of the historic site into an international conference center and hotel . Denis Galvin , deputy director of the National Park Service , held a news conference at which he refused to criticize Iacocca directly but indicated he felt the Chrysler Corp. chairman had misrepresented the park service ' s plans for Ellis Island . Iacocca , speaking Thursday at Chrysler headquarters in Highland Park , Mich. , said , " I will oppose any effort to commercialize this restoration project , and that includes any plans to build a luxury hotel and conference center on the island and , as presently constituted , finance it through the sale of tax shelters to the rich . " Iacocca was reacting to his dismissal late Wednesday as head of a commission to advise the government on restoration of the island and the Statue of Liberty . Galvin said 54 plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 20 years . Fundraising now being conducted by Iacocca would pay only for restoration of the main building and power plant on half of the 27-acre island , which is divided by a ship channel . The other half , which has tumbledown hospital and administrative facilities , would cost an additional $100 million to renovate , Galvin estimated . The controversy centers on development of this second area . Iacocca accused Interior Secretary Donald Hodel of firing him as part of a money " grab " to take away Iacocca ' s authority on what will be done to the island . But the disputed area is the second half of the island , Galvin indicated , for which Iacocca has raised no funds . Iacocca was fired from the advisory panel but remained head of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Inc. , the private organization raising money for the work . Hodel said it posed a conflict of interest to have Iacocca in both jobs . The foundation has raised $235 million and plans to raise $35 million more . That will be enough to redo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 1 , on Ellis Island . About 16 million immigrants passed through that building as they entered America in the early part of the century . Iacocca ' s foundation hired an architect to study Ellis Island and came up with a plan to " stabilize " the old medical facilities by sealing windows , repairing roofs and taking other steps . Galvin said this part of the island is not a tourist attraction because it is " unsafe " and it represents such a small part of the island ' s historical significance . Only about 2 percent of the immigrants arriving there ever went to the hospital area , he said . The foundation ' s plan also calls for building a modern " exhibition hall " on the grounds , which Galvin said violates the park service ' s normal practice on historic sites . The notion of turning the old facilities into an international conference center and hotel was approved in 1982 by the park service after a blue-ribbon citizens committee studied 14 proposals for the site . When Iacocca became chairman of the advisory commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary James Watt to delay making a final decision . Watt complied . The advisory panel , now headed by Armen Avedisian , a business and civic leader from Hinsdale , Ill. , will advise the National Park Service on what to do with Ellis Island . The park service , which is under the authority of the Interior secretary , will make the final decision . Galvin said the proposed international center would accomplish the park service ' s main goal , which is to preserve the architecture of the old buildings , as well as provide income to pay an estimated $2 million-a-year heating bill for the main building on the other side of the island . It also would result in the refurbishing of the old buildings at no cost to the park service , he said . Asked about Iacocca ' s charge that the project would be financed by giving rich people tax breaks , Galvin said investors would get the same tax break as other developers of historic sites : 20 percent of the cost could be written off.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
