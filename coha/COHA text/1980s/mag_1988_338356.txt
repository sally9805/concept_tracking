The crime to which Debra Ann Forster , 18 , of Mesa , Ariz. , pleaded guilty last week : leaving her two sons , ages six months and 18 months , alone in a sweltering apartment for nearly three days . The highly unusual sentence handed down by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Lindsay Ellis Budzyn : Forster must use birth control for the rest of her childbearing years . <P> To ensure that she complies with the order , Forster is required to periodically provide written evidence to her probation officer . Forster , who married at 15 , said she had been overwhelmed by the job of taking care of the boys after her marriage broke up . Both children , as well as a daughter born in March , have since been given up for adoption . Asserting that the " state has no right to interfere " in Forster 's freedom to become pregnant , the American Civil Liberties Union and the Catholic Church will protest the order .               @ @ @ @ @ @
