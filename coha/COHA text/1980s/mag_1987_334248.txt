The Reagan Administration came into office determined to cut back sharply on the $30 billion the Government was then spending on low-income housing . As the keystone of this effort , the Administration in 1983 introduced federal housing-subsidy vouchers that allow low-income families to rent housing wherever they can find it , at whatever price they can negotiate ; the Government then subsidizes a portion of the cost based on a " fair market " price . The traditional federal subsidy program requires tenants to pay no more than 30% of their income in rent , and only for housing that matches a " reasonable " rent set by Washington . <P> The voucher system is what enabled Angela Henderson , 26 , her husband Chris and two children to move last April from an apartment complex in Bloomington , Minn. , to a duplex in Brooklyn Park , a Minneapolis suburb of ranch-style houses . The family is thrilled with the extra space and privacy . " You 're not having all those people above and underneath you and across from you , " says Henderson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to instead of waiting . It 's more like a home . " In Bloomington the Hendersons paid $435 a month for their apartment . In Brooklyn Park the rent on the duplex is $460 a month , but they pay only $323 . Vouchers cover the remainder . Although the Hendersons pay just under 30% of their income in rent , many voucher tenants are willing  --  and permitted  --  to pay more . <P> One impetus for the voucher program was a study by the Rand Corp . that reached just the conclusion that free-market advocates wanted to hear : rental units in many cities are plentiful but too expensive for lower-income people . Though liberal critics derided the idea as just another way to cut services to the poor , the Administration is now well along on a five-year , $200 million pilot program to test vouchers in 20 communities . To date 15,000 leases have been subsidized by vouchers ; eventually the Government plans to subsidize 140,000 rental units . <P> Vouchers are supposed to help tenants pay for the best housing they can afford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system gives landlords an incentive through higher rents to improve substandard housing to livable levels , increasing the housing available to poor families . <P> , In cities with high vacancy rates , low-income tenants like the freedom that vouchers provide , even at a higher price . Says Apolonio Flores of the San Antonio Housing Authority : " Some of our people are saying that they always wanted their kids to go to a nicer school , to live closer to their parents . " But the rental markets in some cities are so tight that vouchers are meaningless . New York City , for example , has 200,000 applicants waiting for public housing . When vouchers were offered to low-income families there , 62% were returned unused : even with federal assistance , the families still could not find decent , affordable places to live . " The voucher system would make sense if there were housing , " says Democratic Congressman Thomas Downey of Long Island , an outspoken critic of the program . " But there is just not enough .
