So it ' s only natural that one expects " The Floating Light Bulb " to take him to another plateau - if not in terms of achievement , then at least in terms of daring . Hit or miss , we expect him to bring us a surprise . And that ' s why one is startled - and , yes , disappointed - by the conventional , modest and at times pedestrian family drama that Mr. Allen has written . " Light Bulb " doesn ' t pick up where " Stardust Memories " leaves off ; rather , it picks up where Mr. Allen ' s active playwriting career left off - with his last Broadway play , " Play It Again , Sam , " in 1969 . For whatever reasons , Mr. Allen has decided to keep the cinematic and theatrical sides of his talent on two distinctly separate tracks. // " Light Bulb " is nothing to be embarrassed about , especially in the skillful production directed by Ulu Grosbard at Lincoln Center , but it could easily be mistaken for a journeyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an earnest autobiographical play that recycles , to much less invigorating effect , some of the material in " Annie Hall . " There are a few laughs , a few well-wrought characters , and , in Act II , a beautifully written scene that leads to a moving final curtain . But most of the time " Light Bulb " is superficial and only mildly involving . As a serious playwright , Mr. Allen is still learning his craft and finding his voice. // Like so many young American plays , this one is overly beholden to the early Tennessee Williams . The setting is a lower-middle-class household in the Canarsie of 1945 , but the milieu is pure " Glass Menagerie . " Instead of Amanda Wingfield , the mother is Enid Pollack ( Beatrice Arthur ) , a proud , nagging woman who once dreamed of being a dancer ( for " George White ' s Scandals " ) and who now , like Amanda , is reduced to hounding neighbors with telephone business schemes to make ends meet . In place of Amanda ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen-age son - Paul ( Brian Backer ) , a bright , shy ugly duckling who retreats from life by practicing magic tricks in his grim bedroom . There ' s also a gentleman caller , a talent manager played by Jack Weston , who arrives in Act II to raise and then dash the Pollock family ' s last hopes. // Mr. Allen ' s family does vary slightly from Mr. Williams ' s . The father , a petty gambler and philanderer named Max ( Danny Aiello ) , hasn ' t fled the coop yet , though he ' s on his way out the door . The family also contains a younger brother , Steve ( Eric Gurry ) , who seems to exist only to provide Act I with wisecracks . Indeed , it ' s when Mr. Allen departs from " The Glass Menagerie " that " Light Bulb " is at its weakest : neither Max nor Steve nor Max ' s illicit girlfriend ( Ellen March ) are much more than cogs in the action. // The others fare better . As played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is a dynamic survivor - so much so that she at times recalls Ethel Merman ' s Rose in " Gypsy . " She ' s not overly vulnerable - we don ' t quite believe she ' s the alcoholic the script suggests - and yet we ultimately care about her . Left alone and bereft in her shabby living room at the end , Miss Arthur suddenly goes white with fear . For a second , she really does seem the mother of the stammering , cowering son who is both the repository and victim of her failed aspirations. // That son is somewhat self-pityingly written , but he , too , finally touches us . When his mother yanks him out of his bedroom to perform his tricks for the visiting agent , the boy shivers and hyperventilates from panic . Mr. Backer , who glancingly resembles Mr. Allen in manner , does very well by the role : with his dark , drooping eyelids , frail posture and incongruous magician ' s turban , he makes us see the almost terminal loneliness of a scared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s . This manager arrives at the Pollacks ' apartment ostensibly to audition the son , but in fact to make eyes at the mother . Mr. Allen clearly knows such small-time showbiz hustlers to their bones . Mr. Weston is full of big talk - he has met Jimmy Durante and Cesar Romero - but his own clients turn out to be fleabag acts that play " the mountains . " Still , he ' s more than a tired flim-flam artist ; he ' s also a sad , overgrown momma ' s boy who lacks the courage to seize the moment with Enid . Mr. Weston , by turns craven , pathetic and funny ( especially when imitating his prime client , a talking dog ) , brings Act II to fully rounded life. // The remaining performances , most notably Mr. Aiello ' s brusque , selfish Max , are good , too , but Mr. Weston has the luck to have the only sustained scene in the play . Act I is a series of splintered , underwritten episodes that are mainly designed to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Allen veers mechanically toward his inevitable conclusion . If the ending works better than it deserves to , that ' s because the playwright has made the most of his two best images - Paul ' s magic wand and a recurring anonymous phone call. // The play ' s other images and themes are pedantic . The son ' s floating light bulb magic trick - his own glass menagerie , as it were - is too archly set up as a metaphor for life ' s illusions . When characters talk of their various failed dreams or doomed hopes ( a winning longshot bet for the father , a big star for the agent ) , they do so point-blank and repetitively . Instead of announcing these warmed-over poetic conceits again and again , Mr. Allen might have paid more attention to writing scenes that dig deeper and actually flesh out the relationships among the Pollacks . It ' s his refusal to take that next step that makes his drama seem like mock Williams , O ' Neill and Miller rather than the real thing. // Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been better served by a workshop airing in less pretentious circumstances . Santo Loquasto ' s towering , evocative tenement set , Pat Collins ' s brooding lighting and Mr. Grosbard ' s sensitive , fluid staging all promise an evening as grandiose as " Death of a Salesman . " While this fulldress production was probably inevitable , it still doesn ' t seem right . Like any other , less famous playwright , Woody Allen deserves the chance to develop his promising but unfinished " Light Bulb " away from Lincoln Center ' s harsh glare . <> <> Canarsie , 1945 <> THE FLOATING LIGHT BULB , by Woody Allen ; di- rected by Ulu Grosbard ; settings and costumes by Santo Loquasto ; lighting by Pat Collins ; sound by Richard Fitzgerald .
