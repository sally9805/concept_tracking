The ad was a classic of the late ' 50s : a child runs across a suburban lawn , arms outspread , beaming broadly and shouting , " Look , Mom  --  no cavities ! " That sales pitch , offered when fluoridated toothpastes were introduced , hardly seemed credible . Few American children , nurtured as they were ( and still are ) on candy bars and other sweets , returned from a dental checkup in triumph . In fact , it was not unusual for a child to have five , six or seven cavities at a time , and just as many the following year . Tooth decay was a perennial national problem that meant a mouthful of silver for patients , and for dentists a pocketful of gold . <P> No more . Today studies by the National Institute of Dental Research indicate that nearly 40% of children between the ages of five and 17 have nary a cavity . While many medical specialties have promoted the idea of preventive medicine , dentistry , more than any other , has put its money where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the past two decades , the widespread use of fluoridated drinking water and toothpastes , along with improved dental care , has produced a 50% drop in the incidence of tooth decay . A further drop is imminent because of the growing use of sealants , protective resins painted on the biting surfaces of back teeth .

As they lose their bread-and-butter work , filling cavities , the nation 's 127,000 dentists are scrambling to fill the gaps in their practices . Some fear that they may be going the way of the blacksmith . Says Dr. Ted Gordon , 62 , who has been practicing in Chicago for nearly 40 years : " We 're one of the few professions in history that has done everything in its power to put itself out of business . " Dental schools , which were expanding until the mid-1970s , are now cutting enrollments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of closing twelve dental schools . American dentists , once confident of a comfortable income , are feeling the pinch . As practices dwindle , costs of equipment and office space continue to rise . The lack of business is " depressing , " says Dr. Henry Ramsey , 50 , of Manhattan . " You talk to other dentists , and they 're wringing their hands , " he says . " Much as I love this work , I would n't go into it again . I really do n't see how young people can make it in this business . It has to be hell . "
