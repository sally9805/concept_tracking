When Oliver North , Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter appeared on Capitol Hill , the prospect of indictments loomed over them . Even before Poindexter testified last week , his lawyer announced that the rear admiral was already the target of a criminal investigation . If any of the central figures are in fact indicted , what charges are they likely to face ? <P> In exchange for their testimony , North and Poindexter were promised that only evidence gathered independently of their congressional appearances could be used against them in criminal prosecutions . Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh , who has been seeking such evidence , ordered key staffers not to watch the hearings , to avoid being tainted by protected testimony . <P> Many believe Walsh will begin handing up indictments as early as next month . But some prosecutors question whether the independent counsel can win convictions , particularly after the outpouring of sympathy for North . Observes former Watergate Prosecutor James Neal : In Watergate , " serious criminal statutes were involved . Officials were obstructing an FBI investigation , there was a ' smoking-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep quiet . Here , everything is murky . " Attorney Arthur Christy , a former special prosecutor who investigated charges against Jimmy Carter 's aide Hamilton Jordan , also doubts that convictions can be achieved . Says he : " A good prosecutor might convince some jurors that North broke the law , but I doubt he could get twelve . " <P> Others sharply disagree . Says Scott Armstrong , executive director of the National Security Archive , a nonprofit research institute : " The independent counsel has taken testimony from accountants and underlings that makes the case look different and the motive more sinister . " <P> Based on testimony so far , criminal charges could be brought on more than half a dozen actions . Among them : <P> Obstruction of Justice . Destroying evidence in advance of an investigation by Justice Department attorneys could fit the definition of obstruction . Shredding sensitive Government documents ( which North said was done to protect lives and U.S. secrets ) could also result in a charge of destruction of Government property . <P> Lying to Congress . McFarlane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress in letters and statements about their activities in support of the contras . Although North was not under oath when he gave false testimony , all three men could be charged with making false statements to a Government agency . <P> Conspiracy . A broad-gauged section of the U.S. Code makes it a crime to conspire to defraud the Federal Government of money or property ; the doctrine also applies to efforts to interfere with the proper functioning of any Government agency . Though it is difficult to prove conspiracy , siphoning off arms-sales profits that may have belonged to the U.S. Treasury , selling weapons under incorrect procedures , and the jumble of other deceptions could qualify . North was named , but not indicted , as a co-conspirator in a tax fraud involving improper deductions claimed for contributions used to purchase contra arms . <P> The much discussed Boland amendment , which prohibited military aid to the contras , does not carry criminal penalties , but a conspiracy to violate it could be considered criminal .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
