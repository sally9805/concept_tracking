By Alan M. Dershowitz hen F. Lee Bailey was indicted in 1973 for conspiracy to commit mail fraud , he quoted an aphorism popular among attorneys to the effect that England and the United States treat their criminal lawyers quite differently : in England they are apt to be knighted ; in the United States they are apt to be indicted . There is some truth to the second part : A considerable number of American criminal lawyers have been charged with criminal conduct . Sometimes the public has to be reminded that the word criminal , as in criminal lawyer - like the word baby in baby doctor - is a description not of the professional , but rather of the clientele . The image of lawyer as criminal has been etched indelibly into the American consciousness by such highly publicized prosecutions as those growing out of Watergate and Abscam , where many of the defendants were lawyers themselves . Indeed , in recent years I have begun my opening criminal-law lecture ( at Harvard ) by reminding the first-year students that " statistically , more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers . " About half my clients have been lawyers , many of them criminal lawyers . The crimes they have been accused of have ranged from bribery and embezzlement to murder . For the most part , the criminal charges have grown out of their practice . Several have been cited with contempt of court or unprofessional conduct for overzealous representation of clients . Some lawyers tend to get into more trouble than others . But some who never get into trouble may be the worst possible criminal lawyers from their clients ' point of view . any of the problems encountered by lawyers are the result of a temptation to which lawyers - some good and some not so good - all too often fall prey : They fail to draw a line between representing a client and becoming his associate . Many lawyers , even the most distinguished partners in Wall Street firms , become associated in business with their clients . The association may assume a variety of forms : taking fees in the form of stocks , partnerships , or other financial interests in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serving on the board of directors of a client- corporation . F. Lee Bailey ' s problem with the law grew out of his business relationship with a flamboyant young Southern businessman named Glen Turner . On May 18 , 1973 , a federal grand jury indicted Bailey on a charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud . At the center of the alleged conspiracy was Turner , who had operated several large " pyramid " schemes , ostentatiously named " Dare to Be Great " and " Koscott Interplanetary . " A pyramid scheme is a high-priced variation of the common chain letter . For a fee of $4500 Turner and his companies would sell an investor the right to become a distributor of whatever product was being sold - cosmetics in one instance , and a Dale Carnegie-type motivational course in another . More important than the right to sell the product , however , was the right to sell new distributorships to other investors for $4500 . Part of the fee obtainedfrom the second customer was given to the first customer , and the rest wassent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoup some of his costs by selling a new distributorship to a third customer , who could then sell a new distributorship to yet a fourth , ad infinitum . The only problem was that there was indeed a " finitum . " Moreover , the government claimed that Turner and his companies did not have any genuine product to sell - that there were no salable cosmetics or motivational courses . The government claimed that Turner was really selling worthless distributorships , empty shells that could be sold and resold to naive purchasers looking to make a quick buck . Most of these quick bucks were made , however , by Turner , who profited from every sale of a distributorship regardless of whether the distributor ever sold any cosmetics or motivational courses . By the late 1960s Glen Turner had become a legend in the Southeast . The uneducated son of a sharecropper , Turner had amassed a fortune . He was like a cult leader , with thousands of believers in his gospel of success . Word of Turner ' s fame and wealth began to spread across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more distributorships and built monuments , in the form of castles , to his own success . But the saturation point was being reached in several states . Dissatisfied customers were beginning to complain that they were unable to recoup their investments by selling new distributorships and they were also not receiving cosmetics or motivational courses to sell . State and federal law enforcement officials undertook investigations and began obtaining injunctions against Turner ' s operations . " Koscott Interplanetary " and " Dare to Be Great " were threatened with bankruptcy as the cash flow from the sale of distributorshi ps began to dwindle . Now it was time for Glen Turner to seek out the best lawyer in America . He sought advice from his public relations director , who recommended F. Lee Bailey . Turner ' s first reaction was , " Who ' s he ? " But he agreed to interview Bailey . Turner told Bailey that in his legal battle , " It ' s me against the United States . " Bailey replied , " Good , I always like a fair fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s lawyer , and they worked out an unusual fee arrangement - one which reveals something about each of their personalities . Turner would pay all the legal expenses of the case plus the cost of running Bailey ' s rented Lear jet . Moreoever , if Bailey could solve Turner ' s legal problems , Turner would pay a substantial contingency fee . ( A contingency fee is paid to the lawyer only if the lawsuit is won ; it is perfectly proper in most civil cases . ) The contingency fee was to be a spanking new Lear jet for Bailey . Bailey could not resist , and the deal was struck . But here is where Bailey made the error that even good lawyers often fall prey to : He failed to draw a sharp line between representing a businessman and becoming his associate . Turner wanted Bailey not only for his considerable legal talents but also for the prestige and legitimacy he could lend to the operation . He asked him to attend recruitment meetings as an assurance to his potential customers that everything would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey did play over the next several months , but is is clear that he did more than appear before courts and other governmental agencies on behalf of his client . There is nothing legally or ethically wrong , of course , with a lawyer performing functions outside the courtroom . Wall Street lawyers do it all the time . The point is , however , that the closer a lawyer gets to the boardrooms and salesrooms of a business , the more vulnerable he becomes to indictment if the business turns out to be fraudulent or illegal . In May 1973 a federal grand jury in Florida indicted Glen Turner , three of his companies , eight of his business associates , and his lawyer , F. Lee Bailey , on charges of using the mail to engage in a conspiracy . The object of the alleged conspiracy was to defraud persons " too numerous to mention . " he inclusion of attorney Bailey and his client Turner in a single indictment - and the government ' s decisions to place them on trial together in a single proceeding - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal ethics . Bailey retained me to brief and argue this issue . The problem can only be understood against the background of the attorney-client privilege . That privilege assures a client that whatever information or advice has been exchanged between the client and his lawyer will be kept in confidence by the lawyer and not revealed to anyone else . There are , of course , certain limitations : the information must have been exchanged in the process of obtaining legal advice ; it must have been exchanged with the lawyer ( and his staff ) alone and not within the hearing of outsiders ; and it must not be information about a future crime or fraud . Subject to these limitations ( and a few more technical ones ) , all information exchanged between a lawyer and his client must be kept confidential by the lawyer . ( The client , however , is absolutely free to disclose it . ) In the Turner-Bailey situation , Bailey had served as Turner ' s lawyer for more than a year . During that time , Turner had many confidential communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those communications . Though I was Bailey ' s lawyer , he did not feel free to disclose them to me , since I had never been Turner ' s lawyer . But it did not take much imagination to surmise what the general nature of those communications may have been . I could easily imagine a typical conversation : Lawyer : " All that puffing and exaggeration that goes on at the sales meetings - it has to stop . You can ' t tell potential distributors that they ' re going to make $50,000 a year . The record just doesn ' t bear that out . And you can ' t lead them to believe there is an unlimited pool of potential purchasers for distributorships out there . There just isn ' t . You know darn well there ' s a saturation point . " Client : " I don ' t write the scripts for the sales meetings . Some of my salesmen out there may get carried away on occasion , but what can I do about it ? " Lawyer : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys are doing out there is fraud . And if it doesn ' t stop , you ' re going to be in big trouble . " I don ' t know what advice Bailey actually gave to Turner . But if there had been a conversation something like the one I imagined , it would clearly be to Turner ' s disadvantage to have it disclosed , since it would establish that his lawyer had told him that his employees were engaged in fraud . Turner ' s failure to stop such conduct after being told it was fraud would hurt Turner in the eyes of the jurors . But disclosure of the very same conversation would be to Bailey ' s advantage . It would show that Bailey had advised Turner to put an end to the fraudulent activities . Giving advice , after all , is all a lawyer can realistically do . If the client fails to follow the advice , the lawyer can not be held responsible - especially if he was not aware that the advice had been disregarded . The dilemma of the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discloses the conversation , he helps himself but hurts his client ; if he withholds the conversation , he helps his client but hurts himself . What should he do ? Bailey called me soon after the indictment was handed up and asked me to think about that perplexing question . My answer was that he should do neither . He should seek to be tried separately from his former client so that he could disclose the conversation to the jury trying him , but withhold the conversation from the jury trying his client . Bailey had , of course , thought of that , but he wanted me to write a brief in support of a severance . Severance means that the trials of two defendants - in this case Turner and Bailey - would be severed from each other and conducted separately . I wrote a lengthy brief arguing that to try Bailey and Turner together would set a precedent that would create an irreconcilable conflict between attorneys and their clients , and would encourage prosecutors to indict attorneys along with clients . ( This ) would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent unpopular clients and of clients to trust their attorneys with secrets . he judge convened a hearing for June 13 , 1973 , and as I walked into the Orlando courtroom , the assistant US attorney was pointed out to me . He was wearing a fluorescent-blue polyester suit and white shoes . But any hope that this garb , which seemed so unlawyerlike to a Northeasterner , would prejudice him in the eyes of the court was quickly dashed when the judge entered the courtroom : Underneath his robe , I could plainly see that he , too , was wearing a light-colored suit and white shoes . In addition to sharing similar tastes in clothing , the prosecutor and the judge also shared a common accent and relaxed manner . Beneath these casual exteriors were a tenacious prosecutor and a shrewd judge . As soon as I began to speak , the judge pressed me for specifics . He challenged me to give him " several " examples of conversations the disclosure of which would be helpful to Bailey and harmful to Turner . I was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Bailey had deliberately refused to brief me on the content of these privileged conversations . I did suggest , however , the general tenor of such conversations and offered to have Bailey disclose some of them to the judge privately in his chambers , outside the presence of the prosecutor . The prosecutor took the position that none of the conversations between Turner and Bailey came within the lawyer-client privilege , since they were all part of an ongoing fraud - a continuing crime . He argued that " Mr. Bailey should not be ( allowed to hide* behind the privilege of . . . the client . " I saw my opening and responded : Mr. Bailey is ( not trying to hide behind the privilege . ( But he is obliged* to claim his client ' s privilege whenever he is asked a question which might breach that sanctity . Now , the reason why this motion for severance is being brought is precisely because Mr. Bailey . . . wants to bring everything out into the open and wants to testify as to every conversation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severance " in abeyance " until later in the trial , when it might become clearer whether there was an actual - rather than a theoretical - conflict between Bailey and Turner . In reserving this crucial decision , he planted the seeds that would eventually blossom into a practical victory for Bailey - albeit a costly one . Addressing the government ' s decision to try Bailey and Turner together , the judge cautioned : Now , the Government proceeds ... at its own peril ... because of the duration of the trial , if the case goes eight to fourteen weeks . ... It might be that ( if a severance has to be granted after that period of time , this ) might preclude a retrial . The judge ' s statement was prescient in one respect , but dramatically wrong in another . The government ' s case did not take eight to fourteen weeks to present to the jury ; it took nearly thirty weeks . And after all grueling weeks of trial ( during which Bailey represented himself ) , the judge finally did what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Bailey a severance from the other defendants and declare a mistrial as to him . The case went to the jury without Bailey , and after seven days of deliberation , the jury remained deadlocked . The entire thirty-week trial had been for naught . The defendants were told to prepare for a new trial . But what about Bailey ? The court had warned the government that a long trial culminating in a severance " might preclude a retrial " of Bailey . But the court refused to intervene , and the prosecutors kept Bailey up in the air for several months , " twisting slowly , slowly in the wind , " as he put it in an affidavit . They refused to drop the charges or set the case down for a speedy trial . Bailey ' s practice began to disintegrate : his law firm fell apart ; his wife fell ill ; he suffered continuing anxiety . Finally , in July 1975 all charges against Bailey were dismissed by the district court . Several of the remaining defendants , including Turner , agreed to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dismissal of the charges against Bailey permitted him to resume the full-time practice of law , but the stigma of indictment still hung over him . Glamorous clients were no longer knocking at his office door . Bailey told journalist Shana Alexander that he had to borrow $400,000 just to stay afloat : " It was the worst thing that ever happened to me . I couldn ' t try any cases . I couldn ' t get any income . People stayed away in droves . " But all this was to change , unexpectedly , and dramatically . On September 18 , 1975 - just weeks after Bailey was cleared of all charges in the Turner case - the news came over the wires that the most famous , enigmatic , and controversial kidnapping victim in recent history had been captured by the police . Nineteen months after her abduction from a Berkeley apartment , Patricia Hearst was under arrest in San Francisco . An emergency phone call reached Bailey at the state penitentiary in Jackson , Mississippi , where he was interviewing a woman on death row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hearst family retained F. Lee Bailey to become their daughter ' s chief counsel in her upcoming federal trial for participating , ten weeks after her abduction , in the Symbionese Liberation Army ' s robbery of the Hibernia Bank . Bailey ' s handling of the Hearst case generated more controversy than any other in his conversial career and highlighted another important problem that certain kinds of defense attorneys encounter - or generate - in highly publicized cases . ailey retained me to help prepare the legal briefs in the Hearst case . As he told Shana Alexander , " In a heavy case , I ' m apt to send to over to Alan . " And this was certainly a heavy case - both for Patricia Hearst and for F. Lee Bailey . It was Bailey ' s opportunity to put the Turner debacle behind him and to reassert himself as Amrica ' s top criminal-trial lawyer . The trial was among the most widely covered legal events in history . As one journalist put it , the Hearst case promised to become " another Trial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s ) sixteen-year legal career . " The basic issue at the trial was whether Hearst had voluntarily participated in the Hibernia robbery , or whether she was still under the control and comination of her abductors at the time she entered the bank carrying a gun . The press referred to this as the " brainwashing " defense . Bailey asked me to coordinate the legal research on that defense . I hired half a dozen law students to dig up every case in Anglo- American legal history in which a defendant had been abducted and had then joined the abductors in the commission of criminal acts . We drafted several detailed legal memoranda on various aspects of the psychological defense and sent them off to San Francisco , where Bailey and his staff were in the last stages of pretrial preparation . I submitted another memorandum analyzing whether the government could cross-examine Hearst about what she had done during the year and a half between the bank robbery and her capture . The government would argue that if she had willingly participated in " revolutionary " acts during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would constitute some proof that she also voluntarily participated in the previous Hibernia holdup . The defense would argue that subsequent events would not prove anything about her state of mind on the day of the robbery , since there had been an important intervening development between the Hibernia robbery and the others : the Attorney General of the United States , William Saxbe , had told the press that as a result of the bank robbery , Hearst Was considered " nothing but a common criminal . " Her SLA captors kept telling her , " You have been defined as a criminal by your country , and now you have no choice but to join us ! " Bailey was worried about the jury hearing Hearst admit that she had willingly engaged in revolutionary crimes after the Hibernia job . He realized that even with the explanation of the Saxbe statement , they would try her not for what she did in the bank on that day in March , but for what she later became . Bailey referred to these incidents as " skunks " that should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you let a skunk skunk into the courtroom , " according to an old country lawyer ' s saying , " you can ' t ever completely remove its stink . " My memorandum recommended that the judge be requested to make a ruling before Hearst was put on the stand as to whether the government would be permitted to cross-examine her about events after the Hibernia robbery . In this way , Bailey could make the judgment about putting her on the stand with full knowledge of whether she would be exposed to dangerous cross-examination . The best-laid plans of lawyers often go awry in the unpredictable frenzy of a trial . Bailey did seek an advance ruling . The judge refused to give a formal ruling , but he did state his opinion that the defendant could not be questioned about possible crimes committed after the Hibernia robbery unless she testified about that period of time during her direct testimony . In reliance on the judge ' s opinion , Bailey put Hearst on the witness stand and carefully avoided any reference to the events following Hibernia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently changed his mind and allowed the government to cross- examine her about everything . Bailey tried to prevent any questioning about crimes committed after Hibernia by having Hearst invoke her privilege against self-incrimination outside the hearing of the jury . The judge ruled , however , that by testifying as she had done , Hearst had waived her privilege and had to answer the questions and was required to invoke the privilege against self incrimination repeatedly in front of the jury ; and the jury was told that since she had waived the privilege , it coulddraw adverse inferences from her improper invocation of it . In the end , the cross-examination of Hearst was a disaster for the defense . Many observers believe that it sealed her fate . Dozens of criminal lawyers , adept at the fine art of Monday-morning quarterbacking , publicly castigated Bailey for his decision to put his client on the witness stand and then have her plead the privilege in the presence of the jury . I am confident that if Bailey had not put her on the stand , and if the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same lawyers would still have criticized Bailey for not having her testify : " He tried half a case . " " He got lazy . " " You can ' t expect to win a case involving a psychological defense without putting the defendant on the stand . " ould you have put Patricia Hearst on the witness stand , knowing everything you know now ? " That is a question I have been asked dozens of times . I ' ll try to answer , at the risk of being labeled a Wednesday-morning quarterback . I offer my answer recognizing that no lawyer can make the crucial decision that Bailey had to make without being there - without experiencing and appreciating the subtleties and complexities that pervaded the trial at the crucial moment . When Bailey had to decide whether to put Hearst on the witness stand , the trial judge had already allowed the government to introduce evidence - through means other than Hearst herself - of Hearst ' s participation in additional crimes during the year and a half following Hibernia . This evidence included tape recordings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strongly suggesting that her conversion had preceded the Hibernia robbery . The judge had also forbidden the defense psychiatrists from playing for the jury the more recent tapes of their interviews with Hearst during which she expressed remorse about her life as an urban guerrilla . Thus , when the time came for Bailey to make the difficult decision , he was confronted with an unenviable dilemma : If he did not put her on the stand , the jury would decide her guilt after having heard extremely damaging evidence from her own mouth about her state of mind after the Hibernia robbery , but without any explanation from the defendant . If he didput her on the stand , she could be cross-examined , but the judge seemed to have ruled that she could - outside the presence of the jury - lawfully claim her privilege against self-incrimination regarding the events following the Hibernia holdup . Viewed from this perspective , the decision Bailey faced about Hearst taking the stand assumed the dimensions of a Hobson ' s choice . There was no risk-free resolution . Knowing everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their verdict , I would probably not have put her on the stand . ( Several jurors apparently voted to convict because they simply did not believe the defendant ' s testimony . ) But knowing what Bailey knew at the time he had to make his decision , I might well have done the same thing he did . That is not to say that I would have tried the Hearst case the way Bailey did . I would not have ! I would not have held press conferences before trial announcing the defenses I expected to use . Indeed , the government pointed to one such press conference in arguing that Bailey had opened the door to the introduction of evidence about the events subsequent to Hibernia . Thus , the dilemma that Bailey faced may have been partly of his own making . No two lawyers would ever try a complicated case the same way . Bailey tried it in the Bailey manner . Had the Hearst family retained Edward Bennett Williams - the lawyer they approached before they retained Bailey , but who turned them down - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been tried in the Williams style : low-keyed , methodically researched , and mapped out play-by-play like a National Football League game plan , with contingency responses for every possibility . I don ' t know whether Williams would have put Hearst on the witness stand . I do know the decision would have been a careful and studied one based on the best information available - plus a good bit of instinct . Had Williams lost the case , however , he would not have been as soundly criticized by his fellow lawyers as Bailey was . Bailey ' s flamboyance and the attention he receives from the media invite jealousy and criticism from his brothers and sisters at the bar . His showmanship also invites the suspicion - voiced by some including Hearst ' s subsequent lawyers - that Bailey ' s trial tactics may have been influenced by his desire for personal publicity . It is perfectly proper for a lawyer to use the press - if done to further his client ' s interests ( and if not in violation of any legal or ethical rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subordinate a client ' s interests to his own desire for attention . The line is not always clear cut , and the publicity-oriented defense lawyer will often believe - or rationalize - that press coverage will help both the client and the lawyer . Sometimes it will . Sometimes it won ' t . Even a good lawyer , with an eye to the media , will not always be able to tell the difference . Patricia Hearst is now a free woman . Her sentence was commuted by President Carter after she had served twenty-three months of a seven- year term . Shortly after her release she married one of her bodyguards and has had a child with him . She also wrote a book about her nineteen months with the Symbionese Liberation Army . In it she castigates Bailey for putting her on the witness stand , claiming that he had " promised " to keep her off and had misled her . She also criticizes Bailey for " overextending himself " during the trial by flying off to Las Vegas to give seminars to other lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst eventually hired a new lawyer who filed a motion for a new trial on the ground that Bailey ' s defense had been inadequate and ineffective . But on January 6 , 1982 , Hearst dropped the lawsuit , citing her " desire to put this litigation behind me . " F. Lee Bailey is back in the business of defending criminals . His involvement in the Hearst case certainly had one effect : it made everyone forget about the Turner trial . Glen who ? CENTS he question I am most often asked - by students , lecture audiences , friends , and even my parents - is how can you defend a client when you know he is guilty of a despicable crime ? It is a question criminal lawyers always ask themselves , since the vast majority of defendants they represent are plainly guilty . Some criminal lawyers claim to represent only innocent clients . Don ' t believe them ! It ' s a ploy ! No full-time criminal lawyer represents a significant number of innocent clients . Attorney William Kunstler ( whom I once helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " loves , " but even he tends to fall in love with clients who are guilty as hell . The Perry Mason image of the criminal lawyer saving his innocent client by uncovering the real culprit is television fiction ; it rarely happens in real life . Almost allcriminal defendants - including most of my clients - are factually guilty of the crimes they have been charged with . The criminal lawyer ' s job , for the most part , is to represent the guilty , and - if possible - to get them off . How can we do it and still sleep at night ? Some of the answers come easily : BULLET It isn ' t the lawyer ' s job to determine the guilt or innocence of his clients - that ' s for the jury or the judge to decide . BULLET Even the guiltiest defendant is entitled to an adequate defense . BULLET It ' s important for lawyers to challenge the government in order to keep it honest . BULLET The alternative is a legal system like that of countries such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " entitled " to a defense . BULLET The lawyer ' s function goes beyond defending the innocence of his client : It includes plea bargaining and obtaining the shortest possible sentence . None of these arguments , compelling as they may be , really tells the whole story of why defense lawyers represent guilty defendants . Defense lawyers are an egotistical lot , and the challenge of " getting off " an obviously guilty defendant is a great ego trip . It is also a great source of fu- ture clients ; and clients mean money ; and money means the good life that so many defense lawyers crave . Lawyers who don ' t have the stomach to represent guilty criminals should stick to other areas of the law . There simply aren ' t enough innocent defendants to keep more than a handful of criminal lawyers in business . Nobody should become a criminal defense lawyer without being prepared to devote the vast majority of time to representing guilty clients . he zealous defense attorney is the last bastion of liberty - the final barrier between an overreaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney is to challenge the government ; to make those in power justify their conduct in relation to the powerless ; to articulate and defend the right of those who lack the ability or resources to defend themselves . ( Even the rich are relatively powerless - less so , of course , than the poor - when confronting the resources of a government prosecutor . ) One of the truest tests of a free country is how it treats those whose job it is to defend the guilty and the despised . In most repressive countries there is no independent defense bar . Indeed , a sure sign that repression is on the way is when the government goes after the defense attorneys . Shakespeare said " the first thing we do , let ' s kill all the lawyers . " Hitler , Stalin , the Greek colonels , and the Chinese cultural revolutionaries may not have killed all the lawyers first , but they surely placed defense attorneys - especially vigorous and independent ones - high on their hit lists . One of the surest ways of undercutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their representing the guilty . Those who argue that defense attorneys should limit their representation to the innocent , or indeed to any specific group or category , open the door to a system where the government decides who is , and who is not , entitled to a defense . Granting that power to the government , to the bar , or to any establishment marks the beginning of the end of an independent defense bar - and the beginning of the end of liberty. - A.M.D .
