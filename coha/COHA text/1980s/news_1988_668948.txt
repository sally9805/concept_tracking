Now that the election is over , Washington insiders are all twittering over who will get what job in George Bush ' s White House . Actually , most Americans don ' t care who gets these jobs . Consider that about half the potential voters didn ' t even bother to make a choice for president . So why should they fret over the appointment of this or that flunky . But there is one personnel decision that is attracting attention beyond Washington ' s inner circle . It ' s the question of what duties President-elect Bush is going to entrust to Vice President-elect J. Danforth Quayle . For a while , Bush vowed that he would assign Quayle to lead the great war on drugs . But he ' s apparently changed his mind , which probably was wise . With Quayle in charge of drug enforcement , thousands of stockbrokers , commodities dealers , and other profit-motivated young people would abandon their careers and begin trading in cocaine futures . It ' s also been reported that Bush is going to assign a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be expected to do . There ' s talk of his taking a course in remedial funeral attendance . In one way , Quayle is already serving a useful function . Only this week , the Wall Street Journal had a front page story on how Quayle is providing more material for the nation ' s TV comedians than any vice president in modern times . I ' m not sure if that ' s why Bush chose him , but with Woody Allen turning serious , Quayle can fill a void , although a physicist would have to explain whether a void can be filled by a void . But four years is a long time to keep comedians in fresh material , and I doubt if even Quayle can do it . So Bush is going to have to find something for him to do . And , as my job requires , I am offering a constructive suggestion . Bush can give Quayle an assignment that will make millions of men and women happier , help relieve their stress , and make them feel more fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a weekly TV show , something like President Franklin D. Roosevelt ' s old fireside chats , or President Reagan ' s weekly radio messages . And what would Quayle talk about ? How to hit a golf ball . No , I ' m not joking . As everybody knows by now , Quayle is a fine golfer . He regularly shoots in the 70s on difficult golf courses . There are millions of Americans who play this frustrating game , and more take it up every day . It ' s become a rage among yuppies . It ' s not that the game is that much fun , but golf gives yuppies another excuse to go shopping . Of all these golfers , though , only a tiny fraction can shoot in the 70s . I ' ve read that only about 10 percent of all golfers are capable of even breaking 90 on a good course . So what do they do about it ? Most read a book or two or watch an instructional videotape . Then they go out on a course and hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more determined players go to professionals for lessons . That helps , but most people can ' t afford lessons . So here we have a vice president who , by many accounts , plays just as well as most of the club pros who give lessons ; a vice president who , by many accounts , is better at hitting golf balls than at anything else he ' s tried . So why waste this rare talent ? He could go on TV once a week and say : " Good evening . This is your vice president speaking . Tonight we are going to address one of the most serious problems facing millions of Americans , one that torments them and makes their lives miserable-the problem of chronic slicing . " Or : " My fellow Americans . Do you realize that during this past weekend , millions of decent Americans suffered needless pain , anguish , and agony ? Many others experienced blind rage and fury . This is not what the Bush-Quayle administration wants . This is not the way to become a kinder and gentler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to put an end to this pain , anguish , blind rage and fury . Yes , my fellow Americans , tonight I am going to show you a simple way to get out of a sand trap . " By finding a solution for the slice , by encouraging people to pull themselves up out of the sandtrap by their bootstraps , by giving them the courage to make a good shoulder turn and a full follow-through , Quayle will be making a great contribution to domestic tranquility and the common good . And from a politically practical point of view , Quayle would be assuring Bush and himself another term in office . Knock five strokes off a hacker ' s handicap and even a card-carrying ACLU member would be chanting : " Four more years ! " So that should be high on Bush ' s agenda . As soon as he is sworn in , he should announce : " Today I announce the appointment of Vice President Quayle to the special position of America ' s pro . Threeeeeee . " " Uh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh . Well , that ' s Democratic inflation for you. " . . .
