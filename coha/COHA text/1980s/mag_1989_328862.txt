The excruciating saga of Pete Rose and gambling seemed to be coming to a shuddering finish last week . A common-pleas judge in Cincinnati was pondering whether to issue a temporary restraining order  --  and perhaps turn the Rose investigation over to the courts  --  or leave Rose to face Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti and the music early this week . After four months of husky whispers , the worst charges imagined were spoken aloud at last . Giamatti 's special investigator , John Dowd , asserted in court that he has found nine witnesses and enough corroborating evidence to prove that Rose committed baseball 's capital crime : from 1985 through 1987 the hustling heir to Ty Cobb routinely bet on his own Cincinnati Reds . Even for history 's leading hitter , who retired after 24 seasons to manage the team in 1987 , the prescribed penalty would be expulsion from the game . <P> Dowd offered , as a smoking gun , Rose 's fingerprints on betting sheets . ( Rose has claimed never to have seen the sheets before . ) A handwriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written in Rose 's hand . Meanwhile , as the two-day hearing adjourned last Friday , the Reds ' manager was at an autograph show in Atlantic City , stoically selling his signature at $15 per scribble . " Being fair and legally correct are n't always the same thing , " Judge Norbert A. Nadel noted , though hoping to be both . He promised a decision on Sunday . Rose 's hearing before Giamatti was scheduled for Monday . Nadel did not have to say the stakes were even higher than the legacy of a legend , knowing that Rose 's lawyers were hoping to " move this lawsuit into previously uncharted waters " and challenge the very foundation of the game . <P> Rose 's lawyers want the baseball commissioner , the sport 's all-powerful umpire , to disqualify himself for having prejudged the case . At sore issue is an April letter , drafted by Dowd but signed by Giamatti , that commended the " candid , forthright and truthful " cooperation of alleged bookmaker Ron Peters , Rose 's principal accuser , who was seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The judge who received the commissioner 's letter was so appalled that he turned the sentencing over to another jurist ( Peters got two years ) and leveled the loud opinion that by vouching for a witness in a case he had yet to hear , Giamatti had biased himself outrageously . George Palmer , a former state-appeals-court judge , and Samuel Dash , famed Senate counsel during the Watergate hearings , last week took the stand on Rose 's behalf to endorse that view . They thought Dowd 's 225- page finding read less like an investigator 's report than a prosecutor 's indictment .
