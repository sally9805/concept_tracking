Symbols for 10,000 years <P> Since the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act , the Government has been planning to create gigantic , underground waste dumps where the deadly byproducts of nuclear-power and - weapons plants could be isolated . The Department of Energy is currently considering nine sites in six states for the high-level radioactive garbage . But since the material will remain toxic for thousands of years , the Department of Energy contracted a special 13-member study panel in 1980 to explore how future inhabitants of earth might be protected from hazardous waste sites . The Human Interference Task Force , a team of nuclear physicists , linguists , engineers , anthropologists and psychologists , has come up with a number of suggestions on how to commmunicate with the 120th century . <P> At the heart of the committee 's problem was the unpredictable ways in which languages evolve : the panel had to devise forms of communication that could be understood by the next 300 or so generations . One suggestion is a waste repository with a series of raised earth barriers built around it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as durable and detectable as England 's Stonehenge monoliths . These structures would bear triangular warning symbols or cartoons as simple in design as the 17,000-year-old cave drawings by Cro-Magnon man in France . One proposed sequence of drawings : three human figures stand by a dump site ; one of them drinks from a bubbling well and falls dead . <P> One of the most intriguing proposals came from Thomas Sebeok , a professor of semiotics at Indiana University . Sebeok called for the creation of an " atomic priesthood " to pass along , over the millenniums , rituals and legends that would explain the dangers of waste dumps . Such forms of communication , said Sebeok , could contain " the veiled threat that to ignore the mandate would be tantamount to inviting some sort of supernatural retribution . " The task force cautioned that " there is controversy among historians over the efficacy of oral transmission as a method for accurately conveying information over long time periods " but suggested further study of the technique . <P> While the task force won credit for tackling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as naive . " The whole report was n't that high level a job , " complains a congressional staffer . " They 're really going to have to come up with something better . "
