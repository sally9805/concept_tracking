Driving through rain east of Reykjavk to look at Thingvellir , site of the first Icelandic parliament ( established 930 ) , the oldest such assembly in the world . I 'm not feeling so young myself , the imagination blank except for memories of a book called Letters from Iceland by W.H. Auden and memories of the Icelandic sagas , populated by heroes with unpronounceable names who made elegant speeches and went at one another with axes . More recent memories : news analyses assuring the public that Reagan and Gorbachev definitely are and definitely are not going to accomplish anything substantive at this presummit summit . Most recent memory : the underground Broadway disco in Reykjavk , an Icelandic rock group called Strax , led by a woman with her black hair done up to look like a crow in flight , singing about U.S. and Soviet journalists vying for scoops . <P> What am I doing here ? What are any of us doing here  --  a flock of mad ducks flown north for the winter , descending noisily on this modest , good-mannered nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists always turn their heads where the noise is . For the nearness of power too . Merely the thought of the two big bosses sitting knee to knee , tossing the world 's well-being back and forth , is enough to thump the journalistic heart . Back in Reykjavk , in that stout symmetrical house by the water , an abstract enmity is reduced to two men talking together . A rare real moment in the bipolar war of nerves , well worth writing home about . And still : What am I doing here ? <P> No structure stands at Thingvellir anymore . The place where the ancient Icelandic chieftains met is a field by a lake fed by a stream fed by a waterfall that rolls over black rocks with the sound of enthusiastic applause . In summer , tourists pitch tents out here in hordes . This morning finds a single tourist : there was no car on the road but mine . ( Is history my scoop ? ) <P> At a distance from the field , two mountains rise into a white mist pulled across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's slip . Rain-shagged sheep , mops with four legs , pursue their ridiculous business of all-day eating . On this field over a thousand years ago , an assembly of all Iceland sat down to keep the peace . The obvious parallel pops up : many chieftains then , two chieftains now , striving for balance and order so the world does not run to ruin . It is a tradition in Iceland , this striving for equilibrium . The sagas , crazy as they got , almost always wound up with heroes mending relations after a series of bloody revenges . <P> In Njal 's Saga , known to every schoolchild , the hero is burned to death , and it falls to his son-in-law Kari to avenge the family . Coldly , he knocks off 15 of his enemies , but then suddenly the killing stops . He feels he has overdone it . He asks the pardon of his chief antagonist , and stability is restored . As it is in Hrafnkel 's Saga , where , after the obligatory killings and counterkillings , the hero refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . <P> Only in Grettir 's Saga are the themes of equilibrium and balance absent . Grettir is a law unto himself . Taking on everyone alone , he finally chooses death over the safety of the world .
