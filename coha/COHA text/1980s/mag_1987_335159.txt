Sex  --  real or imagined  --  is far more hazardous to the political health of a presidential candidate than to a sitting President . The man in the White House has a meticulous security system that regulates comings and goings and the witnesses thereof . The lips of the securers are sealed until death . After that , of course , the President is always exposed in memoirs and diaries . But that just spices history . <P> Presidential aspirants are unprotected . And sometimes suspected . It is probably fair to say that John Kennedy 's legendary White House athletics ( including a rumored romp on the Lincoln bed with a National Security Council staffer ) had a kind of wicked appeal , and a lot of young politicians took up his hairstyle , stage mannerisms , the projection of thinly veiled lust . And maybe more . <P> Kennedy has become the case study for sex in presidential politics , but , as so often happens in such emotional matters , the study is haphazard . There is every reason to believe that Kennedy 's desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate as it was when he was President . Yet there were no sightings of him arm in arm on a lonely night street , no public confessions by inamoratas , no telephone records or photos . The crowded turmoil of his campaign was his screen . Attractive women and men were almost always around , even in his bedrooms as he changed clothes , lounged , ate or napped . Gary Hart 's very loneliness was his enemy . <P> Lyndon Johnson was also a focus of sexual stories during his pre-White House years when he was Senate majority leader . There were many glimpses of him motoring to the Georgetown home of an attractive young woman , of his wanderings through his Texas ranch house to the bedrooms of guests . But , as usual , there were no eyewitnesses in the bedrooms . <P> Johnson constantly bragged about his sexual appetite and apparatus , though he was such a storyteller that nobody was sure what to believe . The vision of that gargantuan figure rampaging through the sheets may have squelched more curiosity than it aroused . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at dinner on his ranch , into staying the night . His language , even in front of his family members , was full of double meaning . The blond fled . <P> The White House press corps 's grand old man , U.P.I. 's late Merriman Smith , used to regale the young scribes with stories of his days on Franklin Roosevelt 's train from Washington to Hyde Park , N.Y. , how it would stop on a New Jersey siding for a rendezvous with Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd . Smith never wrote the story , never had any final facts . <P> The circumstantial evidence of Kennedy 's sexual adventures during his White House years was abundant , possibly innocent acts inflated by Kennedy 's lurid reputation . On Inauguration night , just after Jackie had gone home alone ( she was still recovering from the difficult birth of John Jr. ) , a reporter peered through the potted palms behind the stage and saw Actresses Kim Novak and Angie Dickinson joining the President 's small coterie . At a Palm Beach , Fla. , mansion following Kennedy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an old school chum , an acquaintance and two attractive young ladies . The acquaintance left after dinner and the chum and the ladies pointedly stayed .
