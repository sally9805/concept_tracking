THE ONLY time I was in Preston , Arkansas , was in 1976 . It was late spring , a day of intermittent sunshine and brief , steamy showers . There was no motel chain nearby ? no familiar orange roof or Holiday Inn or Best Western or the cheery sunburst of a Quality Inn . There was only one ancient two-story hotel in the center of town . I do n't know why this sleepy town had ever needed so elaborate a hotel , but there it was , with its tiled lobby and fireplace and carved woodwork and brass spittoons and shoeshine stand and elevator . The place had fallen into a sad decay . The tiles were filthy , the elevator broken ; the shoeshine stand stood unused and unsafe looking ; the bellhop was unbelievably sleepy and aged . For reasons I 'll try to explain , a depression flopped over my shoulders like a heavy , dusty bird on a too small roost . It was not that I did n't like the persons who managed the hotel . The bellhop was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a kindly gentleman in blue gabardine pants and a faded red smock . He was well-spoken and intelligent and not at all ashamed to have descended from ( as I imagined him to have been ) the owner of the hotel in its finer days to his present sleepy position in its service . The white-haired woman who took my money ? three dollars the night ? and gave me my key , and her sister , also white-haired and wearing a red waitress 's uniform , who waited tables in the adjoining cafe , were equally likable and kind . It was the specialness with which they treated me itself that caused my confusion . The moment he saw me the bellhop came to life . There were , apparently , a few steady customers of the hotel , traveling salesmen , but no one who approximated as closely as I did the image of a genuine " tourist . " The bellLewis Nordan is working on a novel called Sugar Man . hop fairly twittered around me with small talk . The sisters were no less aflutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Preston , they wanted to know ; would I be staying long , what was the weather like south of here , where would I be headed tomorrow ? Briefly the key ring could not be found , a moment of keen embarrassment for the three of them , and when it was found , there was a short , whispered discussion , a little frantic , about which room might be " made up . " When these details were settled and I was set to go to my room , I thought for a moment that all three of them together would usher me upstairs as a kind of delegation to ensure my comfort . At last the sisters honored the bellhop 's prerogative and stood aside , their hands folded nervously at their waists , and we left them and headed up the stairs . Already I knew that I could not stay the night . ERE is the reason . Good manners at a Holiday Inn are one thing . You pay for and III you receive the TV and the telephone and the air conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room is deficient in any way ? if the Magic Fingers takes your quarter and wo n't vibrate , or wo n't stop vibrating , or if the heat lamp in the bathroom is burned out ? you call the desk and tell whoever answers the phone and he gives you another room . No emotions over the complaint are exchanged . In a person 's home the situation is different . " Manners " then means a sealing of the ancient , sacred bond between guest and host . However humble the accommodations , they are a gift of the host to his guest , the best offering he has to make . Among civilized people this is always the assumption . To refuse those accommodations , or to notice their im-33 perfection , is to violate that bond . When the host insists that he is ashamed of the poverty of his gift , the guest must disagree . The state of the lodgings is irrelevant . When the lodgings are poor , but nevertheless a matter of pride to the host , the guest will praise them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are truths known to all . The problem in Preston , though , was that this was a hotel and not a home . And yet the manners that applied were those between guest and host rather than between customer and innkeeper . The fact that this is probably the good , old-fashioned way of running a family business is a matter for some other essay . I did n't care then about the triumph of the cash nexus , and do n't care now . What I cared about was that I was hopeless to disguise for long my disappointment at the feeble splendor of this hotel propped on its unsteady economic crutches . Complaining of the accommodations would have been monstrous , hiding my disappointment impossible ; so I knew I had to leave . The bellhop inserted the key and opened the door to my room . With pride he directed me into it . He showed me the bathroom , the clean towels ; he turned on the water to prove it was hot . He pushed his hand on the bed and made the springs creak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He flicked the bedside lamp on and off to show me it worked . He told me that if the room felt too warm , the window could be raised to let in a cool breeze . I tipped him lavishly and he was gone . The room was , in a manner of speaking , spotless . But such a long time had passed since it had been put in this condition that an even topsoil of dust had settled upon everything . It lay on the plastic chair and on the deal dresser and on the mirror and on the bedspread and windowsill . I ca n't explain why a host would concentrate on the perfection of certain details and overlook others such as this . I could . think only of the fictional room in which Homer Barron met his end at the hands of Miss Emily Grierson in Faulkner 's " A Rose for Emily , " and the dread of splendid decay became all the more intolerable to me . The window opened with ease , as the truthful bellhop had promised . I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . I had no notion of ever coming back . I stooped and stepped out the window onto a line of jutting bricks that formed a ledge about twice the width of my foot . With difficulty I squatted and maneuvered myself until I could hang from this ledge by my fingertips . I dropped to the ground and felt sharp pains blaze through my feet and calves . When I could stand again , it was a simple matter to slip around the edges of buildings and emerge from the shadows at some distance from the hotel . When I could return to my car without being seen , I drove to the edge of town and slept the night scrunched into the backseat . . EXT morning I woke early . Something like despair overcame me as I tried in vain to drive away from Preston and the confu- sion of mannerly behavior I had found there . I stopped at a DX station and washed my mouth out with a Coke from the machine . It was typical of the exaggeration of my emotions that I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of betrayal , both of my hosts and of my past , of what I had learned from childhood about responsibility between guest and host . I have heard it said that this is a peculiarly Southern neurosis , but that is not true . There comes a time in every good person 's life when he decides for all time whether be will know himself as one who values his comfort and convenience and good sense over a devotion to ferreting out and correcting all knowable minor infractions of the contract between guest and host . I had long since made my decision . I drove back to the hotel . This time I approached the building from the rear . I eased my car down the alleyway and parked beneath the window from which I had jumped the night before . By standing on top of the car , I found sufficient handhold and foothold in the old bricks to pull myself , with effort , back onto the ledge and through the window again . In the room I turned back the covers of the bed and rumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands , In the bathroom I stripped the wrapper off a new bar of soap , washed my face and hands , and threw the towel on the floor . I urinated and considered leaving the toilet unflushed , but could not go quite so far in leaving my mark . What kind of guest would fail to flush the toilet ? Everyone was happy to see me when I emerged . The sisters wanted to know whether I had slept well , whether the bed was all right , whether the water was hot enough , whether I might suggest improvements to make future guests more comfortable . I praised the accommodations . I commented on the excellence of the mattress , the heat of the water , the cool of the breeze that blew the night through my easily opened window . The bellhop was there as well . He said , with morning gaiety , " I 'll just run up and get your bag . " This was a problem . I did n't have a bag , of course . It was in my car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the night before , but mannerly behavior is always more intuitive than well planned . I was so taken aback by the oversight that , for a moment , I could not speak . I stood before the three of them with my mouth open . The sisters ' bright countenances darkened suddenly and horribly in the moment of my confusion . The fact that I had been found out seemed inescapable . I stammered , " I ? I ... " The elder sister , out of her darkness , said to the bellhop , " Mr. Nordan did not have a bag . " The bellhop looked at her , into that hard darkness , and their eyes locked . After a second , he said , " Oh . That 's right . I forgot about that . " Both sisters ' faces lightened again , not so bright as before but bright enough . We said our good-byes , we spoke of the weather and of roads and directions . We said another round of good-byes . I walked three blocks out of my way before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley and driving away from Preston , Arkansas , forever . How much the sisters and the bellhop knew about my night 's lodging I never learned . I knew only that each of them was as cursed and as blessed by his devotion to the proper enactment of his role in the relationship as I was by mine . Persons who value the sanctity of the guest-host relationship will understand this anecdote ; others , perhaps , will not . No lie , no absurdity of conduct , no financial inequity is too great a sacrifice to one who would honor it . The practical truth that forthrightness and honesty are more courageous and , ultimately , less demeaning policies of conduct than dangerous leaps from second-story windows is no argument against observance of the Code . Some persons are fated to pay it higher tribute than others , no doubt . forty I yc LwoiFE with bi sloan dcorpulent , strin hhandsomeair and a massive i voef beard , and his shoes are tied with baling wire . He is not a tramp exactly , but he holds no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling between several homes by his thumb and by his wits and by the anachronistic romance of the rails . ( Once he nearly starved on a freezing ride coast to coast on hopped freights , and he says that riding on top of a boxcar through a long tunnel is like living in an exhaust pipe . ) Cloff came to my house one January night when the temperature was fifteen degrees below zero . He had hitchhiked from his mother 's pig farm in northern Kansas in a blizzard , and he called me , off a list of phone numbers he had , to come get him at a caf ? several miles from my home . I drove to the caf ? and picked him up . This was the second time I had ever laid eyes on Cloff . Once I had worked as his partner teaching poetry for two days in an elementary school . Those two days had prepared me for much , but not for everything . He had brought with him from Kansas , and had stashed in the shadows outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient heavy Underwood electric typewriter suspended from a bucket bail , a barrel of wheat , a Styrofoam freezer full of steaks , and a dead pig . All this I helped him load into my car and bring to my house that cold night . He stayed for nine months . During those nine months in my home , Cloff would not flush the toilet ? the one off his room . No matter how often I reminded him , no matter how I begged , no matter that the odor was staggering and ubiquitous , he would not . For the entirety of his stay , he did not wash the pair of sheets that my wife had put on his bed his first night in our home . She suspected that he was not washing them , so she repeated her instructions on the operation of the washer and dryer . Still he did not . ( In his absences I secretly flushed his toilet but held firm on the sheets . At the end of the nine months the sheets were burned . ) He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after each meal for nine months stacked them in a greasy pile by the stove . He carried food to his room and left it there so long that it attracted a million tiny gnats , which infested the house . He brought a wire coat hanger with him to the table to scratch his athlete 's foot while he ate . He stole the Sunday newspapers from our neighbors each week . Cloff was a certain failure in the social niceties that are usually called " manners " but a champion in that more important area of conduct : the relationship between guest and host , however eccentrically he interpreted it . While Cloff strove to fulfill his responsibilities as a proper guest , the results were , for me as his host , a great wealth of good feeling and warmth . I have never spent a more harmonious nine months in the company of another person . Cloff was gentle with my children ; he was conscientious to make interesting and pleasant conversation ; he observed , without prompting , a family 's needs for privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed our dishes ( ours , not his ) ; he cooked many meals for us and allowed none to be cooked for him . The newspapers that he stole were not for himself but for my family ( no matter that we were embarrassed to death by the thefts ) , and he was scrupulous not to read them . His unwashed sheets and dishes and his unflushed toilet were a mad attempt to save me a few cents on the water bill , a debt I tried to absolve him of but without success . The food that spoiled in his room was taken there to avoid using space in our refrigerator . The wheat and the steaks and the pigwere brought for us ? for , that is , whichever host would receive him when it was time for him to stop traveling for a while . ( I was not the first person he called that night ; those higher on his list had not answered their phones . ) With the foresight of one who relies on guesthood for survival , Cloff had slaughtered the pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to the considerable trouble and danger of hitchhiking hundreds of miles in a blizzard with it under his arm to make it a gift to the household that would eventually take him in . ( I wo n't make too much of a paradox of this : the episode with the coat hanger might be admitted as an exception . ) Still , Cloff 's honoring of the guest-host relationship , no matter how eccentric his interpretation of it , no matter the inconvenience and exasperation it caused us at times , caused me and my family to love him , causes us to love him still , these several years later . I fit hEaRt Ew ialri ee nnsou rpredictable f ttyhpee sw eoifr dbe , shaacvio r edr civilizing bond between guest and host . En- ergy and imagination are required to figure out what type of gift one partner in the relationship is prepared to give , and in what way the other is obliged and prepared to reciprocate . Candor. for example , is rarely a virtue . It would have been a serious failing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ) , and often with Cloff . And yet in some occasional cases , it might be all two persons have to secure the bond between them , however precariously . I received an unexpected Christmas card from a college acquaintance , Talbot More , who , I was surprised to learn , was now an attorney in the Public Defender 's office in Las Vegas . We had been close when we were younger , but I had not seen or corresponded with Talbot more than twice in twenty years , the last time at least ten years previously . We talked for a long time on the phone and ended by making plans for me to come out to Las Vegas for a visit . No interpretation of the role of host could have been more disquieting than Talbot 's . It bordered , I thought , on madness . There was no bed ; we slept on the floor . There were no meals ; what we ate , I bought , or he coerced friends to buy for us . There is more that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations a guest might have of his host , but that is not so important as the one concession he did make in his role . This concession was candor , only that . He made it utterly , obsessively , unnecessarily , as if it were all he had and all he ever hoped to receive of anyone else . I mistook my obligation at first and offered too little in return . Talbot would , as if it were an endlessly interesting topic of conversation , describe all my best qualities ? my good marriage , my good children , my supposed generosity , my supposed successes in business , my supposed trim waistline , my self-discipline and regular work habits . I answered , " Thank you " and " Oh , not at all " and " You must n't say so . " In such mere politeness , I was failing as a guest . Later he said , " I have an increasing bald spot on the back of my head . " I could see no way to deny baldness , or any reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told me he was thinking of getting a nose job . I said he did n't need one . ( He does not ; he is very handsome . ) He said his ears were too small . I said they were not . He asked me to point out the suits in his closet that had gone out of style . I was beginning to catch on , but I was increasingly ill at ease . I told him I did n't own a suit , how would I know ? He insisted , so I chose one . He said it had been his favorite suit until I chose it . Now he wanted to drop it at Goodwill . He told me the number of women with whom he had had sexual relations ? he even showed me a written list of their names . I said that was a lot of women . He asked to see my own list . I pretended to have a list that I had left in Arkansas . I gave him a number , though , and as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pleased , I thought . I knew he would have been more pleased with an honest answer , but I was not yet capable of the candor that was being asked of me . Talbot indicated the prostitutes on the list and said he had been young at the time and wanted to know whether I thought less of him for having slept with prostitutes . I said all young men should sleep with a prostitute , and wondered what my seventeen-year-old son was doing that night . Talbot told me he was in debt . His marriage had fallen apart years earlier and his children were strangers to him . A love affair with a married woman had ended badly with a dangerous bit of gunplay . He wanted to be a writer but could not bring himself to write a word . He wanted to be a politicianbut was afraid political life would keep him from being a writer . He wanted to find the perfect woman . He suffered from migraines . He was terrified a madman would shoot him with a rifle from a highway overpass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just out of the shop and it still would n't work . His VW Rabbit did n't get good gas mileage . He borrowed a hundred dollars from me to play poker , then lost it and said he felt guilty and thought he had lost my respect . I despaired of finding enough " polite " responses , and in my despair finally understood what I had to do . When you can give a person nothing else to fill in the emptiness that he complains of in his life , you give him your secrets . I tried to do this for Talbot More . I admitted to him my fears of failure with my children , my excessive and secret drinking . I was in tears . I confessed to an area of conflict in my marriage , and told him that I had always felt unattractive because of my overbite . I told him I had felt ashamed of my father and had lived with guilt since his death . I described an act of betrayal and denial 1 had made against my son and twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mistake . It did n't work . It was not enough . Even as I was unburdening myself , in the hope that if the failure of my life were made to seem large enough his would seem Iess so , he accused me of never revealing anything of myself to him . He said I only sat back and judged him and kept aloof . I said it was not true . I said I had gone out of my way to be candid and , forthright with him , what more could I do , what more did he want to know . He wanted to know whether my wife enjoyed anal intercourse . He wanted to know whether she liked the taste of semen . He asked whether he did n't remember that in college she would rub it in her eyes . He tried to make me admit to a homosexual act with my college roommate . I said , " Talbot , you must not ask me such things , such offensive things . " He apologized , then wanted to compare penis size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host , but not an utter failure . There was nothing evil in his failure . From his bizarre viewpoint , the world suffered from a famine of candor . His duty as my host , he believed , was to feed me on his plentiful store of it , and my responsibility was to make a gift of my own candor to him , as much of it as I could bring with me from Arkansas to Nevada , just as Cloff had , against all probability , transported and presented to me the frozen pig and the wheat and the rest . Good manners ? if we mean by manners a conscientious observance of the guest-host relationship ? require extraordinary and manifold adjustments in behavior , according to the degree of unconventionality of one of the participants . The more conventional partner in the relationship ? and this is a shifting role ? must do most of the adaptation . There is nothing easy or fair about the requirements of the Code , but when we fulfill them , we glimpse our best selves .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
