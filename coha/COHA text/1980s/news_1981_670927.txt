The great Alexander Alekhine once remarked about 4 . . . B-B4 that this development was a good idea , providing the bishop could stay out of trouble . The immediate attempt to exploit it with 5 NxP gave Black a comfortable game after 5 . . . BxPch ; 6 KxB , NxN ; 7 P-K4 , P-B4 ; 8 P-Q3 , P-Q3 ; 9 P-KR3 , 0-0 ; 10 B-K2 , N-K1 ; 11 K-N2 , N-B2 ; 12 B-K3 , N-K3 ; 13 N-Q5 , N-B3 ; 14 Q-Q2 , N/ K3-Q5 , as in G. Garcia-Uhlmann , Leipzig , 1973. // Instead of a routine retreat with 9 . . . B-N3 , Sigurjonsson tried 9 . . . B-QN5 ? ! , but after 10 N-Q5 , he could not play 10 . . . NxN ? ; 11 PxN , N-K2 because 12 Q-N3 , B-R4 ; 13 PxP wins a pawn . He brought his difficulties with the king ' s bishop to an end with 10 . . . P-K5 ; 11 N-Q2 , BxN ; 12 BxB , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his frail hold on the center could not be sustained . <> <> Pawn Sacrifice Offered // Since 13 . . . PxP ; 14 NxNch , QxN ; 15 QxP , B-Q6 ; 16 QxQ , PxQ was hardly a pleasant prospect , he offered a temporary pawn sacrifice with 13 . . . B-R2 ; 14 NxNch , QxN ; 15 PxP . Of course , he was bound to recover his pawn with 15 . . . Q-K2 ; 16 Q-N3 , N-Q1 ; 17 P-K5 ! , PxP , but Alburt obtained a powerful advantage in space with 18 P-Q5. // Sigurjonsson had the option of defending by 40 . . . P-N3 ; 41 Q-B3 , P-N4 , but after 42 PxP , RPxP ; 43 R-R2 , It would be only a matter of a few moves before the white rooks would decisively penetrate on the KR file. // On the other hand , after 40 . . . Q-K2 ; 41 P-N5 ! , BPxP ; 42 PxP , PxP , Alburt scored the annihilating inroad into the Black position with 43 Q-B7ch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical problems of the ending in fine style : after 51 P-Q6 ! , it would not have helped to play 51 . . . K-K3 ; 52 P-Q7 , K-Q4 ; 53 RxP , KxP ; 54 K-B2 since the White king can not be stopped from getting to QN7. // On 54 R-Q5 ! , the capture with 54 . . . KxR ? permits White to obtain a queen after 55 P-Q7 . After 61 R-QB4 , Sigurjonsson gave up , lacking a remedy against 61 . . . K-B1 ; 62 R-B6 , R-N1 ; 63 RxP followed by 64 R-N8. // In last Tuesday ' s column , White ' s 26th move should have read Q-K2 . <> <> ENGLISH OPENING White Black Alburt Sig ' j ' son <> <> 1 P-QB4 P-K4 2 N-QB3 N-KB3 3 N-B3 N-B3 4 P-KN3 B-B4 5 B-N2 P-Q3 6 0-0 0-0 7 P-Q3 P-KR3 8 P-K3 R-K1 9 P-Q4 B-QN5 10 N-Q5 P-K5 11 N-Q2 BxN 12 BxB B-B4 13 P-B3 B-R2 14 NxNch QxN 15 PxP Q-K2 16 Q-N3 N-Q1 17 P-K5 PxP 18 P-Q5 P-KB3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q-K3 Q-R5 23 B-QB3 P-QN3 24 P-N3 Q-R6 25 P-B6 P-QR4 26 R-B2 Q-K2 27 P-QR4 R-R2 28 B-N2 N-Q3 29 B-QR3 Q-Q1 30 R-K1 B-N3 31 Q-Q3 Q-K2 32 B-R3 K-R2 33 Q-KB3 R-Q1 34 B-K6 B-B2 35 BxN RxB 36 BxB QxB 37 Q-B5ch K-N1 38 R1-KB1 Q-K1 39 P-KN4 R-R1 40 P-R4 Q-K2 41 P-N5 BPxP 42 PxP PxP 43 Q-B7ch QxQ 44 RxQ R-QB1 45 R-K7 R-B3 46 RxKP K-B2 47 RxP R-K1 48 P-K5 RxRch 49 KxR P-N3 <> <> 50 K-N2 R-Q1 51 P-Q6 PxP 52 P-B7 R-KN1 53 PxP K-K3 54 R-Q5 K-Q2 55 K-N3 P-KN4 56 K-N4 R-N3 57 R-Q1 R-N1 58 R-Q4 R-N2 59 P-N4 R-N1 60 P-N5 R-N2 61 R-QB4 Resigns <> board to come //
