Basics and the Bible are freed from state control <P> It is 8:30 a.m. on a wintry Michigan day . In a classroom decorated with a large Scripture verse and accordion-pleated angels sit 27 third-and fourth-graders . The mood is quiet and serious . Lessons start with the Pledge of Allegiance , then a stanza of America . The students pray aloud for relatives ; they thank God for Bobby 's new glasses . For 45 minutes , their teacher , Joel Allen , 28 , leads the students through Bible study . " Who made you ? " he asks . " God made me . Job 33:4 , " the children answer . During the course of the 6hour day at the Bridgeport Baptist Academy , the students , ages four to 18 , are drilled in the basics and the Bible . Says Allen : " We do n't consider it a job working here . We consider it a ministry . " <P> The independence of that ministry was resoundingly upheld last week . In a strong , unambiguous decision , a Michigan judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state by exempting private Christian schools from state supervision of their curriculum and teachers . Ministers , teachers and parents of the Bridgeport Baptist Academy and the Sheridan Road Christian School , both near Saginaw , had charged that attempts by the state 's board of education to supervise curriculum and teacher qualifications violated their religious freedom . Judge Ray Hotchkiss agreed , ruling that the board , by imposing its secular standards of education on religious schooling , " interfered with plaintiffs ' constitutional right to freely exercise their religion . " Said Hotchkiss : " This court fails to see a compelling state interest in requiring nonpublic schools to be of the ' same standard ' as public schools in the same district . Such a scheme does not ensure even a minimum degree of quality of education . " Hotchkiss , however , did uphold the state 's right to impose on the Christian schools health and safety requirements , to which they had never objected . <P> The fundamentalists were jubilant at their victory . Said Sheridan Road Principal Bill Swain : " We knew our position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the Constitution on our side . But I did n't expect to get a favorable decision . " William Bentley Ball , a leading constitutional lawyer who argued for the two schools , called the judgment " very strong on religious liberty , clarifying the right to teach and the right to learn .
