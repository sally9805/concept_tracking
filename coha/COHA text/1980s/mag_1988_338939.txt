A leading feature in this year 's presidential race has been the competitive dramatization of each candidate 's concern about the problem of drugs . Border visits with the Coast Guard ( to squint suspiciously at fishing trawlers ) were alternated with sessions at schools and clinics ( following Nancy Reagan 's nicely charted rounds ) . No more enterprising effort was mounted on this front than the Vice President 's appearances at Chaffey High School in Ontario , Calif. , just before that state 's primary . It took the form of three assaults  --  a role-playing exercise , a box lunch with students who were addicts or were affected by addiction , and a speech to the student body . <P> In the first session , George Bush was lectured on the dangers of " enabling behavior , " that unwillingness to recognize the signs of addiction by which friends or teachers tacitly condone a pervasive drug culture . Bush , with much prompting from an officious young director of the program , is to enact a teacher 's concern for a student who has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes uncertainly to the outer ring of reporters , asks what the other " students " will be doing while he approaches the woman teacher playing the student 's role . " They will probably be listening , " the director responds . The point is to demonstrate awareness of what is going on , to break the unvoiced conspiracy of acceptance . Bush and the " student " wince toward each other asymptotically , oozing what the one hopes is concern and the other hopes is deference . " Touch her , " says the director , " on the shoulder . " Breaking the perimeter of mutual embarrassment , Bush makes the merest contact and murmurs inaudibly something about her family . As a whistle- blower , the Vice President has been miscast . <P> That became even clearer when he took the central seat in the Leonardoesque composition of a dozen or so lunchers around a long table . Early on , Bush tried to put himself at ease by telling the students , all brimming with horror stories they are encouraged to tell , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to . " This left the sandwich-room disciples speechless for a moment , each about to be deprived of some carefully prepared item of testimony . But so strong was their sense of mission that soon , despite Bush 's signals of anxiety not to hear , they were topping one another with bad things that had happened to them or their siblings as a result of drugs . Bush nodded his head in obvious sympathy and assured them again , " If any of these questions put you on the spot , do n't answer it . " <P> In his speech after lunch , Bush told the student body , " I heard this morning about something called ' enabling behavior '  --  what other people do to make you think it 's O.K. to use drugs . " Bush later assured me the words were literally true for him  --  he had not encountered the term enabling behavior till that day at Chaffey High , despite service in the President 's task force on drugs . <P> A FALSE PERCEPTION OF WEAKNESS      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
