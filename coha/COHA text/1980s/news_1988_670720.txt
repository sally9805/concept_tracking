Unwilling to use military means to unseat General Noriega , the Administration was confronted with the worst of all possible results : the continued rule of the Panamanian dictator , a failed policy and a target of attack in the midst of an American Presidential campaign. // Now , in the face of a Democratic effort to make American dealings with General Noriega a campaign issue , the Administration ' s stopgap solution for its problem has been to act , at least publicly , almost as if the general did not exist. // When asked if he and other Administration officials had been cautioned to bite their tongues before barking about the Panamanian leader , Elliott Abrams , the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs , replied : " I have no comment . I have no comment . I have no comment . " <> <> ' A Conscious Decision ' // But although there has been no move to lift a series of punishing economic and financial sanctions against Panama , both the White House and advisers close to Vice President Bush have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy toward Panama would not be welcome , according to a number of senior Administration officials. // When negotiations aimed at getting General Noriega to resign broke down , " there was a conscious decision by the political staff of the White House to remove Panama from the agenda , " according to one senior Administration official , who said he had resisted the move . " They didn ' t want Panama to be an issue in the campaign. " // Another official concurred , saying , " What we heard from the Bush people was , ' Keep the pressure on , but we don ' t appreciate a lot of stories about failures . ' " <> <> Clarification by White House // The message was so strong , some officials said , that a number of senior aides at the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency , who regarded General Noriega as a strategic asset , assumed that the initiative to oust him had ended . The State Department demanded and received clarification from the White House that the initiative was on and that only the publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of keeping publicity down doesn ' t mean you ' re stopping your policy , " said one official. // Officials at Bush campaign headquarters said that as far as they knew there had been no effort either to lower the degree of pressure being applied to General Noriega or to lessen the publicity about it . " I can say that the issue of Panama has never once come up , to my knowledge , in senior levels of the campaign in terms of discouraging a dialogue of sorts on that issue , " said Mark Goodin , Bush campaign spokesman . <> <> ' Par for the Course ' // Administration officials played down the significance of letting a high-profile policy issue drop from sight. // " Older hands tell me this is par for the course , that everybody , in every administration , just before the election , is more cautious , " said Abraham D. Sofaer , the State Department ' s legal adviser , whose office has been intimately involved in the effort to oust General Noriega. // Mr. Abrams himself , otherwise frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every day until he ' s gone , the policy looks like a failure , " he explained . " And then the day he ' s gone , it looks like a success , so there ' s really no point in putting a lot of publicity on it at this juncture. " // In this political environment , even modest diplomatic steps to register opposition to the Noriega regime and reduce American vulnerability in Panama have met with bureaucratic resistance in Washington . A State Department plan to eliminate about half the 160 diplomatic posts at the embassy in Panama City because of concern for the diplomats ' safety will be modified because of that resistance , Mr. Abrams said . " Everybody is resisting , " Mr. Abrams said . " What we ' ll end up with is compromises. " // The most dramatic compromise is that the Drug Enforcement Administration , whose officers continue to work with senior members of Panama ' s Defense Forces close to General Noriega , will not be forced to close its regional office in Panama , Mr. Abrams said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical short-term options for dealing with Panama , Mr. Abrams and other officials have begun to put forth a kind of thesis that blames the Carter Administration for the current predicament. // " The Carter Administration did ab-so-lute-ly nothing to help the development of democratic government in Panama , " Mr. Abrams said , stressing each syllable. // Mr. Abrams noted that the Carter Administration , in its efforts to negotiate the Panama Canal Treaties , made accommodations with Brig . Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera , who was General Noriega ' s predecessor as Panama ' s strongman . He suggested that this had led the United States down a path that ended in today ' s quagmire. // " The Carter Administration did the easy thing about Panama , which was to hand over a piece of paper that said , ' This is the Panama Canal Treaty , and it gives Panama title to the canal , ' " Mr. Abrams said . Then , he said , when President Reagan assumed office , " we were left with this guy Noriega , to whom we ' re supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible situation . " <> <> A 1990 Deadline // The way Mr. Abrams and other senior Administration officials now explain it , General Noriega is not hanging on by his fingernails , as they said he was a few months ago , but might be around for some time , perhaps for years. // With this in mind , there is a growing feeling both inside and outside the Administration that if General Noriega is not out of power by Jan. 1 , 1990 , it will be difficult for the United States Senate to allow the position of canal administrator to pass from an American to a Panamanian as required under the treaties. // " Obviously , the President and the Senate are going to be in trouble with that nomination if Noriega is in charge and appoints a Noriega crony , " Mr. Abrams said. // There are even hints that should General Noriega stay around , the canal itself might not be handed over to Panama on Dec. 31 , 1999 , as the treaties stipulate. // Lieut . Gen. Colin L. Powell , the national security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August that the United States would not turn operating control and defense of the canal over to Panama on schedule if General Noriega were in charge , a warning that Mr. Abrams echoed this week. // " Anyone who is dedicated to keeping those treaties should recognize that it is critical to get rid of Noriega , " Mr. Abrams said . Although he added that the canal treaties were not endangered at the moment , he warned , " A few more years of Noriega , and they will be endangered. " // General Noriega , meanwhile , has relentlessly accused the United States of trying to oust him as a pretext for keeping the canal. //
