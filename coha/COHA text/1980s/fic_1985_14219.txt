Terry started crying when she found out you were n't there  --  NESBITT Am I expected to respond to that inane comment ? I do n't work ! ZACH And I spoke with Human Resources about a transfer , of course , after your leave of absence  --  NESBITT How do you leave an absence ? ZACH It 's a personnel term . ( He grabs her ) NESBITT What 's a Human Resource ? Is it different than an Animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ANNIE struggles to get away ) ZACH Word play . That 's good .

Do you become like the Virgin Mary when you get Married ? Can you also get Jesused ? And Poped ? ( MRS . NESBITT enters , carrying a long , black net as if off an old ship . She holds it behind her . She 's no longer in costume . ) MRS . NESBITT What 's all this shouting ? ZACH I said the wrong thing . I 'm sorry . MRS . NESBITT That 's all right , Zach . Annie , I thought you might be cold . I brought you a blanket . NESBITT ( Shouting ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he talks about playing games  --  when will it end ? It happens over and over  --  MRS .

( She sits on a chair and drops the net to the side of the chair . ) Why do n't you come have a chat with your dear old mum ? I thought you might want to talk about things . p. 32 NESBITT Like what ? MRS . NESBITT You know . NESBITT No . I do n't . MRS . NESBITT ( Warily ) Okay . Well , then , do n't forget about your appointment today . At one . NESBITT One ? MRS .

NESBITT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think too much . NESBITT So you never did ? MRS . NESBITT No , I never did . Cheryl , though I love her dearly  --  you know I do  --  thinks a little bit too much . Over-analyzes . There 's a big difference between let 's say , being educated and meddling where you should n't . Let 's just sit together until we go to the Doctor 's . NESBITT Doctor . For what ? MRS . NESBITT Annie , do n't you remember ? The lady , the one you liked . NESBITT I do n't need to go back to her . Why are you taking me to the Doctor ? p. 33 MRS . NESBITT Because of what happened . NESBITT What happened ? MRS . NESBITT The horrible incident . NESBITT There have been so many lately . MRS . NESBITT You know , Annie You took some tests , remember ? After the hospital and the police  --  NESBITT ( Shuddering ) That 's no reason to go back there , Mother . MRS .

You 'll want to very soon . That 's what the doctors say . You 'll come up with all kinds of crazy new characters that 'll make the kids laugh . ( ANNIE starts to move away . MRS . NESBITT throws a net over her daughter . ) NESBITT Alice heard the Queen say , " First the sentence and then the evidence . " MRS . NESBITT What is that supposed to mean , dear ? p. 34 NESBITT And then Alice said , " You 're nothing but a pack of cards ! " If it works for Alice , I thought it could work for me  --  ( MRS . NESBITT drapes the net around ANNIE 's shoulders . ) MRS . NESBITT Stories again . That 's a good sign . NESBITT ( Fingering net ) How long did it take you to spin this ? MRS . NESBITT Annie , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? NESBITT Is it knit or crochet ? MRS . NESBITT It 's an old blanket . Crochet . Does it bother you ? NESBITT Wool or acrylic ? MRS . NESBITT Wool . Would you prefer a different one ? NESBITT Just like Charlotte 's Web . Amazing . MRS . NESBITT Charlotte 's Web ? NESBITT ( Loudly ) You 're nothing but a pack of cards ! ( She pauses . ) It 's not working . None of this is going away . MRS . NESBITT I do n't know what you 're talking about . You know , this new doctor , she says you need to go to a therapist , to talk about these things . Because I 'm not going to be able to understand you for awhile . The doctor is right . Wo n't you please think it over and let me take you ? p. 35 NESBITT ( Pushing off the blanket ) I ca n't stand to talk ! MRS . NESBITT But you have to try . There is so much to sort through . Even today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like , something I do n't like , the possibility of disease and all sorts of  --  NESBITT My heart is screaming . Can you hear it ? MRS . NESBITT You mus n't let it scream . Do you hear me ? You must stop it ! Stay calm  --  NESBITT I ca n't , Mother . I ca n't . MRS . NESBITT This is my fault . I 'm the one who took you to parks . Ever since you were a little girl . That 's why you were there . If your father knew The police said you should n't have been there at five o'clock , but I said they should blame me for that . I should have told you more about the world , or something  --  NESBITT Do n't take me back out there . MRS . NESBITT I would change everything if I could , Annie . ( Wraps net around ANNIE again . ) I would take this pain away and I 'd find the man myself and  --  NESBITT I do n't want to go outside . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls to the ground . A drumbeat is heard again . ANNIE crawls along the floor. ) p. 36 NESBITT Survival is a game of chance . A gamble . Since the invasion , there is nowhere to go but the underbrush . Blend in with the scenery to stay alive . Do not make waves . Waves attract attention , especially in your hair . No low-cut dresses . No skirts . Do not wear make-up . Have no features . Be plain . Camouflage . Since the invasion , I 'm hunted , always hunted . ( ANNIE stops crawling and puts her head to the floor . ) NESBITT ( Continued ) Someone is coming . I must hide . It must be the enemy . The giant . He tracks me . I wo n't give in . Fight through . Someday he 'll find me again . He knows me now . There 's no disguise , no place to hide  --  I wo n't go easy , you bastard . I have cultivated guerrilla moves . This is war  --  ( CHERYL , ZACH and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to get her to a therapist . MRS .

MRS . NESBITT I thought she would tell you something , Cheryl . p. 37 CHERYL So did I. MRS . NESBITT I should n't have let you take her to the police . It was too hard on her . Just because you would have wanted to go does n't mean it was right for Annie . NESBITT Woosh ! Auntie Em ! CHERYL It was the right thing to do . So they can catch him . Are we going to just let him get away ? ZACH I 'd like to kill him . MRS . NESBITT Cheryl . Even if they found him , do you think she 'd make it through the strain of a courtroom appearance  --  ZACH I 'd really like to kill him . CHERYL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . At least she 'll have the option . If they catch him . She would have done the same for me . If I could n't make decisions  --  NESBITT Toto ! We 're spinning  --  MRS . NESBITT We mus n't project our values onto others  --  ( CHERYL turns away from this reproach and stares at ANNIE , who still runs around the room . ) ZACH What is she doing ? CHERYL I 'm not sure . p. 38 MRS . NESBITT If we could just get her to settle down  --  CHERYL Then maybe she could focus again  --  ZACH ( Tries to catch her ) Hey , Annie ! Where 're you going ? ( There 's an echo . ) ZACH ( Echoing ) Hey Annie ! Where 're you going ? ( ANNIE keeps running . LIGHTS SHIFT . MRS . NESBITT , CHERYL and ZACH exit . Sounds of children laughing can be heard , dogs barking , etc . An image of a small butterfly is projected . ANNIE starts to chase it . ) NESBITT I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them feel what it 's like to be a butterfly , and make them laugh . See you later ! ZACH ( In echo ) Okay . I 'll call you tonight . Bye ! NESBITT ( Like a game , creating a story ) Slow down , butterfly . Let me take a look at you . " Once there was a butterfly who flew up high into the sky so high that it worried the butterfly 's mother who could never find him at dinnertime . The butterfly 's name was George . Yes , George . And his mother would ring a dinner flower , calling George to get him home for some honey . They used big , green leaves for plates . When George was supposed to set the table , which was part of a tree , he always forgot , because he was flying high into the blue sky . And then " What happened next ? " And then " . No ( The LIGHTS SHIFT and park noises stop . MONICA enters and sits at her desk . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . HARTFORD Annie , why do n't you have a seat ? We 've got a lot to discuss . NESBITT ( Still reacting ) No ! DR . HARTFORD Yes . Have a seat . ( She opens a file . ) The test results are in . NESBITT I like to remain on my feet . DR . HARTFORD All right . The V.D. tests were negative . NESBITT Good . DR . HARTFORD We 'll have to test again in a few weeks , when the other tests are completed , just to be sure . But I think we 're in the clear . I have n't had a chance to check with Dr. Phillips about therapy . How 's it going ? NESBITT It 's not . DR . HARTFORD Why not ? NESBITT Just look at the word . T-H-E R-A-P-I-S-T . DR . HARTFORD ( After a pause , continues ) You 've got to go to therapy so you can get better . NESBITT I 'd rather be scaling the Great Wall of China than go to therapy . Is there anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try to relax . Have a seat . I think we should talk . ( ANNIE sits down. ) p. 40 DR . HARTFORD ( With clipboard ) How are you feeling ? NESBITT I do n't like to . Feel . Anymore . DR . HARTFORD You seem much better than you were the other day . NESBITT Thank you . I have no sense of it . DR . HARTFORD Are you eating ? NESBITT What 's the point ? DR . HARTFORD You do n't want to get weak , do you ? NESBITT Obviously , I 'm already weak . DR . HARTFORD You 'd better eat so that it wo n't get any worse . NESBITT I have no control over my weakness . Seems I was born this way . DR . HARTFORD If you try , if you give yourself a chance , you might find you can regain some control . NESBITT " Might " . You people like to talk a lot about power . And strength . DR . HARTFORD Why wo n't you start therapy ? NESBITT I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk ? DR . HARTFORD What do you like to do ? p. 41 NESBITT Think . But not reminisce . That 's all you people want me to do . Jabber about the past . DR . HARTFORD We want you to be well . NESBITT It 's amazing how time just inches by , is n't it ? DR . HARTFORD That 's the wrong attitude It helps to tell people about things like this . Telling makes it better . Trust me . NESBITT Look , if I knew what everyone was talking about , do n't you think I 'd say so ? DR . HARTFORD No . I do n't think you want anyone to know what you know . Because it hurts you . NESBITT What if something hurt me ? Why talk about it now ? It 's already happened . DR . HARTFORD So you can be well . NESBITT I 'm not sick . DR . HARTFORD You have n't eaten .

HARTFORD Holding it in is the most dangerous thing you can do . For Christ 's sake , Annie , tell someone ! ( ANNIE turns away . The white masks become visible behind the scrim . The white doll is pushed through the scrim . ANNIE looks at it , as it dangles there . ) NESBITT I say nothing . DR . HARTFORD Annie  --  NESBITT I ca n't . DR . HARTFORD Try . NESBITT I ca n't . DR . HARTFORD Annie , tell me . What do you want ? ( ANNIE picks up the doll . She stares at it . ) NESBITT I want to be myself again . My old self . She was there . DR . HARTFORD Of course she was . It 's all right that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girls giggling is heard . ANNIE stands or sits behind the doll for the rest of the scene , as if it 's a puppet that she controls . Its movement is choppy , tense . ) DR . HARTFORD Yes . Outside . The report said you were alone in the park , around five o'clock . Not a very safe place to be . p. 43 NESBITT You think I brought this whole thing on , do n't you ? That I was writing stories when I should have been paying attention . That it 's all my fault . I know that 's what you think . DR . HARTFORD No . I did n't say that . NESBITT That 's not true . It 's not that simple . I was smelling flowers . Beautiful red roses that compete with the sun . About to set . DR . HARTFORD So it was getting dark , was n't it ? NESBITT The smell of flowers soars through the air , to the clouds . I revel in the moment , the beauty of the roses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly joins me in the celebration . DR . HARTFORD Someone else joined you , too . Someone real . NESBITT We dance on the roses . ( ANNIE dances with the doll ) DR . HARTFORD Someone dangerous . Why did n't you hear him coming ? NESBITT There was music . Sweet music from the playground not far away . I ca n't see it . It 's around the corner . But I hear young girls laughing , dancing . Girl Scouts . I laugh , too . DR . HARTFORD You were thinking of your work , not the park . p. 44 NESBITT I 'm with a butterfly , making up a story . DR . HARTFORD A story ? NESBITT I 'm always in the park thinking of stories . For my Story Hour . I call it " Telling Time " . For the children . It 's my inspiration . So many characters . So much to do . Like the butterfly . Dancing . DR .

HARTFORD Yes ? NESBITT But  --  DR . HARTFORD Then what happened ? NESBITT But then  --  DR . HARTFORD Then what ? NESBITT The sun was setting . DR . HARTFORD And it was getting dark  --  NESBITT It was dark . I had n't noticed because of my butterfly . I might not have noticed except for that sound  --  p. 45 DR . HARTFORD An animal ? NESBITT No The sound DR . HARTFORD A person ? NESBITT No . A throat . A throat clearing . And then a laugh . DR . HARTFORD You had company . NESBITT The butterfly and I had acquired an admirer . The throat whistled . The butterfly left . Without even a brush of my eyelash . ( ANNIE turns the doll and crouches with it . ) DR . HARTFORD You were frightened . NESBITT My first thought was for my notes . My second thought was the moon . DR . HARTFORD The man approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant . I was alone with a monster . I could see through the trees . His form . Coming closer . DR . HARTFORD Where was he ? NESBITT Near the building . He moved in slow motion . I screamed . DR . HARTFORD You hid ? NESBITT I ran into the woods , away from him . He called to me. p. 46 DR . HARTFORD What did he say ? NESBITT " I wo n't hurt you , baby . " DR . HARTFORD And you said  --  NESBITT " Who are you ? What do you want ? " DR . HARTFORD He answered  --  NESBITT " You were having such a good time dancing by yourself . Baby . " DR . HARTFORD You were thinking  --  NESBITT I do not like to be called baby . I do not like the word anymore , it means something different , it does not mean what it used to in your mouth  --  DR . HARTFORD You keep running . NESBITT I look back at him . He has on blue , blue , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . HARTFORD What ? Not police ? ? NESBITT No . Something else . Security . With a blue hat . And the hat comes at me . I trip over vines because I ca n't look backwards and still run , but I do n't want him to catch me , I do n't want to be caught  --  DR . HARTFORD You 're on the ground . NESBITT ( Looking at the doll ) I 'm on the ground . I say , " Please do n't hurt me . I was n't dancing for that reason . Please do n't hurt me . Please let me go . Why do you chase me ? Please , please , please . " Ants crawl on my stomach  --  p. 47 DR . HARTFORD And he  --  NESBITT Laughs . He laughs so hard that the ground shakes . He laughs so hard that he ca n't control it , laughter comes out of his eyes , his nose , everything . He 's so happy . I 'm on the ground . Looking up . I 've landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell the roses . And his shadow like a plague  --  ( ANNIE puts the doll on the ground . ) DR . HARTFORD Do you know him ? NESBITT I do not know him . I do not know this giant . I do not know this hat . I do not know why . DR . HARTFORD You must have struggled  --  NESBITT ( Holds doll down ) I struggle with all my strength . I push . I shove . He falls . But he falls where he wants to . I roll into the rose bushes . He rips my shirt off and my breasts are pushed into the thorns , my face is torn . I scream . There 's blood . But he has just begun . DR . HARTFORD Begun  --  NESBITT Begun to rip and tear and tear and rip and push and push and gouge and I try to stop him . I kick and tear at his eyeballs . His hat falls off his head . He starts to undo his belt . I seize the moment . I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the belt and lashes back at me with it . Again and again . Over and over . He rips at my skirt . It 's easy . It 's easy to pull up and over , anything he wants . The skirt is accomodating . His pants evaporate and he 's above me , ready to put himself into me , as if he had n't done enough , as if there were anything left to do , as if it were so pleasurable that he could n't stop . p. 48 DR . HARTFORD Does he talk ? NESBITT He laughs . He 's having so much fun . It 's the most fun he can imagine . I know because he says things like " Nice legs , bitch . Put them around me . I said , wrap them around me , like you do n't want to let me go . Like you want me . " I say , " Please . Let me go . I just want to go . " And he says , " You 're not going anywhere until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my breath in because now he 's doing what he wants . DR . HARTFORD He 's on top  --  NESBITT He 's right up against me , his skin against mine , doing what he wants , pushing , pushing , pushing . He stinks like toilets and whiskey and he breathes so hard that I hope he 'll have an attack . I freeze , like a wooden board , praying . He jabs me with his gun  --  in his pocket . He makes me move . He says , " Move your hips or you 'll get it . You understand ? Move . " I do n't remember how . But my hips do . They move . DR . HARTFORD God  --  NESBITT I 'm angry with my hips for cooperating . And I feel in his other pocket . There 's a sandwich . I wonder that this person will eat again afterwards . I smash his sandwich . He does n't know . He moans and moans . With my right fist I smash it as tight as the bread will squeeze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baby . " He murmurs like a broken record . I try to scratch the record . Then he stops . He stays on top of me , sighing . I wonder if it really is a gun in his pocket . I feel dripping . I feel an ooze that I know is his . I want to throw up . I can not see the stars . I think how happy I 'll be if he 'll get off me and let me see the stars . His sweat is all over my clothes , like a dye with a stink that can never be removed . All over my skin , my face , my eyes , my heart , my arms , my breasts , my blood  --  p. 49 DR . HARTFORD But he does n't move  --  NESBITT I hope I 've killed him . I think , maybe my hips knew what they were doing . ( Circles the doll on the ground . ) But he starts to lick me , like an animal , he licks my body . His tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . HARTFORD But you 're alive  --  NESBITT I 've become something else because there 's no heat in my body , and no blood to flow to my heart . I wonder if I 'm awake . I start to breathe I 'm afraid . And then he moves , rolls off me like a log . He stands and puts his pants on . I ca n't look at him . I close my eyes , scared to find out what he 'll do next , what he 'll do to me . I think that every breath could be my last but I do not speak . I do n't talk anymore . It does no good to talk . But hee does . He says , " There . You just stay still . You just lay like that . No one 's ever gon na know the difference . " And that was all . DR . HARTFORD Did he leave ? NESBITT I lie in the roses . The moon talks to me like a friend . I feel like part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't really know if I 'm still alive . DR . HARTFORD You did survive it  --  p. 50 NESBITT I rise above the woods and look down . ( She sits in a chair and looks at the doll . ) I see myself in the roses , my torn skirt flying like a flag in the breeze and I do n't know what to do . Maybe I 'm already dead , maybe I 'm a spirit . Or I 've become one of the flowers . And I think it 's just as well . And I 'm glad , because I know that I ca n't return to what I knew before . I ca n't remember what I knew before . DR . HARTFORD You stay all night ? NESBITT In the morning , the sun kisses me in apology . And I know then that I 'm still alive . But who am I and what do I do ? I stare at my blood and see bruises . I count the scratches on my right leg and I stop counting at 59 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be it . I move my arms . I move my mouth . They seem to work . I move my left leg . It bends . I look down and know that I should wash and wash and wash , even though I feel in my heart that it will be hopeless . I walk slowly to the building nearest me . The front door is not open . But a lady inside sees me through the glass panel . She screams . I scream back . She screams , " Annie " . I can not recall ever meeting her . Before . She calls my mother . And Zach . ( A pause . ) I think I remember now . I think I remember it all . ( AS THE LIGHTS FADE , the starfield twinkles .

How is everybody today ? ( She pauses , listening , then smiles . ) Good ! Today , we 're going to tell the story of the very hungry worm . It 's a wonderfully yummy story . But first , let 's sing a song . ( She stands up . ) Everyone , on your feet ! Come on , Todd . There you go . " Heads , Shoulders , Knees and Toes . " Ready ? ( ANNIE sings the song , touching the parts of her body as she names them : ) " Heads , Shoulders , Knees and Toes.Heads , Shoulders , Knees and Toes.Heads , Shoulders , Knees and Toes.And all clap hands together . " ( She claps . ) Very good , boys and girls . Jessica , let 's be quiet so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungry Worm . " ( ANNIE sits down by the felt pieces and starts to tell the story . First she takes out a flesh-colored felt replica of a worm . She places it on the board . ) " Once , there was a worm that was hungry . It was starving . So it started to eat . It ate through one piece of grass . One . ( She puts a felt piece of grass and all subsequently named items on the board as she mentions them . ) Everyone , count with me . And then it ate 2 pieces of apple . One , two . 3 pieces of orange . One , two , three . 4 pieces of braunsweiger . One , two , three , four . And finally a chocolate ice cream cone to top it all off . That 's a pretty hungry worm , is n't it , boys and girls ? He probably needed an Alka Seltzer that night . Then , the worm curled up on a tree branch and went to sleep . He built a cocoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He slept until one day he woke up , and do you know what happened , boys and girls ? The hungry worm was really a caterpillar in disguise , and now it was  --  ( She takes out the last piece of felt and puts it on the board . ) A beautiful butterfly . And that 's the story of the very hungry worm . ( ANNIE stops and gazes at the worm . ) Boys and girls , does anybody know this butterfly 's name ? It 's a monarch butterfly . I do n't like monarch butterflies . They do n't make good playmates . They flit around but never stay . ( She pauses . ) What , Terry ? No , thank you . I do n't need any Kleenex . I 'm just fine .

She 's trying to get back into the swing of things . But it 's very hard . You know . DR . HARTFORD Yes . I do . ( She pauses . ) I think we 'd better get right into the test results . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to talk to Annie alone . First . p. 55 MRS . NESBITT ( Surprised ) Certainly , Doctor . ( She pats ANNIE on the shoulder . ) I 'll I 'll be sitting outside . DR . HARTFORD We " ll have you join us in a minute . ( MRS . NESBITT exits . ) DR . HARTFORD The blood test and pap smear results were clear . However I 'm afraid I do n't know any other way of saying this . Normally in this type of situation , the trauma of the act is so great that the rate of conception is low . When I first saw you two weeks ago , I thought that would be the case . But your case is different . ( ANNIE sits up attentively . ) NESBITT What ? DR . HARTFORD Our tests show that you are pregnant , Annie . I 'm sure this is a great shock to you . NESBITT Yes . ( She lights a cigarette . ) It 's a shock all right . DR . HARTFORD I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've counted back the days . And NESBITT Doctor , I can tell you for a fact . It 's not Zach 's , if that 's what you 're thinking . DR . HARTFORD ( To ANNIE ) I know how hard this is going to be for you . After all this . You 're going to have to make a decision , Annie . I can offer some suggestions . p. 56 NESBITT Yes ? Like what ? You think I need a new diaphragm ? Or can one pill make me smaller or something ? DR . HARTFORD Birth is a wonderful , amazing thing . There 's no miracle as beautiful as the act of creation . I believe that . That 's why I do what I do . But sometimes circumstances make us ask what would be best for the mother and the child . And you have to make up your mind , Annie . What do you want ? Can you deal with a child now ? You can have the child and keep it yourself , or give it up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got to think about how you feel . Really sort it out . NESBITT I never even considered DR . HARTFORD No , of course you did n't . Do you want me to ask your mother to come in now ? Or would you rather be alone for a minute ? NESBITT It does n't matter , Doctor . Everyone 'll know soon enough , wo n't they ? ( MONICA nods and exits . A few moments pass ; ANNIE gets up and starts pacing , then absently puts a hand on her stomach . MRS . NESBITT enters , looking very pale . MONICA helps MRS . NESBITT to a chair . ) MRS . NESBITT ( To ANNIE ) Can I have a cigarette ? NESBITT Sure . ( She hands her one . ) ( MRS . NESBITT takes hold of ANNIE 's arm and tries to hug her. ) p. 57 MRS . NESBITT Darling . I 'm so sorry . I ca n't believe it . Just ca n't . Lord . DR . HARTFORD We 've been going over some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NESBITT To top it all off . A baby . NESBITT I do n't like the word , baby . MRS . NESBITT You love children . NESBITT But this is different . DR . HARTFORD ( Gently ) Yes . And you do have time to make up your mind . I 'll be there to help and advise you . MRS . NESBITT So much to consider . Now there 's a child 's life , too  --  DR . HARTFORD Our first concern must be with Annie . MRS . NESBITT Yes . Of course . But you know we 're Catholic . So we have little choice . And Annie 's so good with kids . DR . HARTFORD That does n't mean she should have the child . NESBITT Zach 's going to die . MRS . NESBITT It is n't the child 's fault that this happened  --  DR . HARTFORD It is n't Annie 's fault , either . p. 58 MRS . NESBITT Oh , I know . I know . ( She hugs ANNIE again . ) But someone must take responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At once . It 's very important . MRS . NESBITT And our priest . DR . HARTFORD I 'm a gynecologist . I 'm telling you the medical facts . That 's my job . All right ? Annie , what are you thinking ? You 're not saying much . NESBITT I need another cigarette . ( Gropes to find one , takes pack from MRS . NESBITT ) DR . HARTFORD Annie . You 've just got to deal with this , even though it 's painful . You must take into account your feelings , all of them , towards the child and that man . And what 's medically known about him ? Very little MRS . NESBITT What if they catch him ? NESBITT Suddenly , I 'm very cold . I 'm freezing . I 'll never be warm again . ( MONICA and MRS . NESBITT look at ANNIE as she wraps herself in medical sheets from the table . ) MRS . NESBITT Darling , what are you doing ? NESBITT ( Shivering ) I 'm sorry . But I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , all alone  --  p. 59 MRS . NESBITT She 's sick from this whole ordeal . Who would n't be ? NESBITT I 'm a mummy , in a tomb with layers and layers wrapped around me , in a shroud of darkness . DR . HARTFORD Those sheets are n't too warm . Can I get you a blanket ? NESBITT No . MRS . NESBITT Here . Take my jacket . Doctor  --  ( MRS . NESBITT puts her jacket over ANNIE . ) DR . HARTFORD Annie . Lie down on the table . ( ANNIE stands away from them . ) NESBITT Please . Just leave me alone ! ( MONICA exits . MRS . NESBITT backs away . In the light , wrapped in sheets , ANNIE looks like an image of the Virgin Mary , with the sheets around her head , like scarves , draping dramaticially over her body . She tilts her head and poses , holding an imaginary baby , made of pillows , in her arms . She stuffs some more pillows in the sheets , around her stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits it . She sits down on a pillow after it falls out of her shirt . ) NESBITT Once upon a time there was a normal woman . She had legs , and arms , feet and hands . This woman was n't so big herself , but one day her tummy started to grow . Why , the woman wondered ? What could cause her stomach to become a bowl and then a balloon ? A basketball ? A blob ? It did n't stop . Her tummy got bigger and bigger . It squirmed . So she asked it : " Hey , what 's going on down there ? " And it answered her back . " Hi , Mom . " ( CHERYL enters ) p. 60 CHERYL Hi . NESBITT Hi . CHERYL You look like you were trying to sleep . NESBITT What do you mean ? Because of these ? ( Refers to sheets and pillows . ) CHERYL Is this a bad time ? I can come back . Want some M and M 's ? ( CHERYL pulls a pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) No . It 's okay . I 'm up now . Maybe I 'll never sleep again . ( CHERYL rubs ANNIE 's shoulders to warm her . She puts the blanket around her shoulders . ANNIE moves the blanket to partially cover her face to appear " phantom-like " . She makes scary noises . ) CHERYL ( Laughing ) There . That 's better . Now you look kind of like Casper the Friendly Ghost Remember that one Halloween when you went trick or treating as a wrapped gift box ? You wore a huge box covered with wrapping paper . And ribbon in your hair . Your legs stuck out underneath like toothpicks . ( Eats candy . ) NESBITT My tights were green or something to match the paper . That same year you were a knight . CHERYL In shining armor covered with tinfoil . I had a cardboard sword . Made my brother very jealous . ( Sighs ) I worked so hard to be a tomboy. p. 61 NESBITT I was the tomboy . CHERYL ( Laughing ) You were not . NESBITT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses . Lace anklets , the works . And you read fairy tales all day long . NESBITT I always wanted to be a tomboy . CHERYL I know . I know . We ca n't always be the way we want to be . ( A pause . ) How was work ? NESBITT ( Shouting ) I do n't want to talk about work , damn it . CHERYL I do n't want to talk about work either , really . NESBITT I need to talk . I know that . The therapist tells me that . But why do I feel like it 's my problem , and not anyone else 's business ? CHERYL Do you want to discuss it ? Angry like this ? NESBITT This is how I am , Cheryl . This is me now . CHERYL You 've had a run of bad luck . This is just another one of those things . That 's all . I think we 'd better get you to a good clinic . We 'll get it taken care of . NESBITT Easy to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living inside me . It 's a child . It 's a little kid who could walk into my Story Hour one morning . p. 62 CHERYL You do n't feel anything yet . do you ? NESBITT ( Covering ) No . Not those kind of feelings . CHERYL You 'll be the perfect mother some day . But not now . Not like this . It wo n't be normal . NESBITT Cheryl , I wonder what that is normal . You ? Are you normal ? Zach ? He must be . But I ca n't tell anymore . CHERYL I 'm going to help you get an abortion . I 'll call a clinic . NESBITT I 've got to do something . I 've got to get all this under control again . That 's it . I 've lost it and I just need to find it again . CHERYL You wo n't have control if you decide to have the baby . You 're letting him run your life . NESBITT Am I supposed to just let it die ? CHERYL Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child ? It was conceived through assault . You hate the father . You 're engaged to a wonderful , loving man who wants children with you of his own . No one would want a child under those conditions NESBITT ( Warningly ) The church recommends adoption . p. 63 CHERYL More of this hell  --  eight more months ? Carrying a part of him in you ? Just because she ca n't face her priest means you have to be penitent ? Who cares what the church says in this case ? Is the church going to have this baby ? The church should butt out . NESBITT It 's a consideration . CHERYL Why should you suffer more than you already have ? This child could be Frankenstein . Frankenstein . NESBITT Do n't scare me more than I already am . CHERYL I 'm not trying to scare you . I want you to face the facts . That man did enough damage . He does n't need to ruin the rest of your life , too . Please . Trust me . I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait much longer it 'll be too late . You 're never going to feel good about doing it . No one does . I know you 're a loving person  --  that 's your nature . But you have to see that it 's best  --  for you and the poor thing inside of you . NESBITT Everybody 's taking sides and there 's so much to weigh . CHERYL There 's only one side I care about . That 's your side . Let me know when you 're ready for me to make the call . ( CHERYL exits . ANNIE crosses to the storyboard and picks up the blue puppet . She puts it on her hand and it looks up at her . She uses a funny play voice when the puppet speaks and her own real voice when she talks to it as ANNIE. ) p. 64 NESBITT ( Real voice ) Boys and girls , look who 's visiting us today . It 's Sam the Sailor . Ahoy , Sam . What ship did you step off of ? ( The puppet turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) " The Good Ship Lollipop . Well , it was the Good Ship Lollipop until I ate it . Hee , hee , hee . " ( The puppet shakes with laughter . In real voice : ) He ate it ? Did you hear that , boys and girls ? Sam , what will your mother say about you eating a ship of lollipops ? It 's not healthy to eat all that candy . ( Play voice : ) " I did n't get a chance to talk to her about it . I was too busy eating the ship and she was on it , the sucker ! " ( The puppet shakes with laughter . In real voice : ) Sam ! That 's absolutely shocking . Surely you did n't eat your own mother ! ( In play voice : ) " You 're right . At the last minute , I threw her a Life-Saver . " ( The puppet shakes with laughter . In real voice : ) Well , I hope this was n't a serious accident you caused by eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Were there any survivors , Sam , other than your mother ? ( The puppet grows serious . In play voice : ) " Yes , one . There was a strange fetus baby with a navy blue cap growing out of its head . It was grotesque and deformed . It had a mouth that would n't stop . Talk about a sucker . " ( ANNIE drops the puppet . MRS . NESBITT enters , dressed in a conservative manner . She has gone to some effort for this event and she looks very nice . She brings ANNIE a sweater. ) p. 65 MRS . NESBITT Ready to go , dear ? ( ANNIE puts the sweater on , adjusting it . ) NESBITT Just a minute . ( ANNIE brushes herself off , and then turns to her mother for approval . ) MRS . NESBITT ( Brushing ANNIE 's sleeve ) Do n't you have anything to cover your head with ? ( Organ music is heard . ) NESBITT I forgot . MRS . NESBITT Honestly , Annie . ( She rummages through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarf . ) NESBITT Thank you . ( She puts the scarf on her head and ties it loosely . MRS . NESBITT takes ANNIE 's arm and they walk together in a straight line , properly , as if going down an aisle . MRS . NESBITT smiles . ) MRS . NESBITT It 's nice to have you here with me . ( MRS . NESBITT genuflects . ) NESBITT Thank you . ( She genuflects . ) MRS . NESBITT Father is glad you 're here . He wants very much to talk to us . NESBITT I 'll try . ( They stop walking and take seats . A large cross is seen in back of them . ANNIE gazes at it. ) p. 66 MRS . NESBITT ( Punches ANNIE ) Here he comes . ( She rises and pulls ANNIE up with her . ) Father . NESBITT ( Rising ) Father . MRS . NESBITT It 's so good to see you again . NESBITT ( Extending her hand . ) So good . MRS . NESBITT ( Sitting down ) We appreciate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very appreciative . ( She sits down . ) We know how it is . ( MRS . NESBITT looks at her , then continues . ) MRS . NESBITT I think you know why we 're here . It 's about Anne . Anne Elizabeth . I believe you know the circumstances of her pregnancy . And you know my feelings about it . But it 's Anne 's feelings that I do n't think you 're aware of . And I thought that it would help her enormously if she could talk to you about what she feels , in view of the ghastly nature of the situation . Why do n't you tell him , Anne . ( MRS . NESBITT smiles and looks straight ahead . ) NESBITT Where do you want me to start ? ( There is a pause. ) p. 67 MRS . NESBITT ( Patiently ) With your feelings , dear . NESBITT All right . MRS . NESBITT ( Prompting ) Some of the things you told me . NESBITT Oh . Well , I hate this baby . MRS . NESBITT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NESBITT I hate everything about this baby and I ca n't imagine being its mother . I hate its hair , I hate its eyes . I hate its kneecaps . There 's absolutely nothing lovable about it . I hope that it comes out retarded and deaf and dumb . Or better yet , still-born . I hate the fact that it 's in me . MRS . NESBITT ( Embarassed ) You see the problem . It 's even greater than I thought . NESBITT But Mother keeps talking about bearing crosses . And evidently she is thoroughly convinced that this is mine to bear . MRS . NESBITT The doctor recommended a therapist who agreed regarding Anne 's reluctance to have this child . They want her to consider aborting it . But we know that it 's out of the question in the eyes of God . We only want your guidance on how to cope with the situation like a Christian . p. 68 NESBITT Mother loves the word martyr . I do n't mind thinking about it in regards to saints , but when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stretch . MRS . NESBITT Please , Father . Can you help us ? ( Gives ANNIE an angry look . ) NESBITT Goddamn it . What did I do to deserve this ? MRS . NESBITT Anne , please . Watch your tongue . Believe me , Father , she has never put it like this before  --  NESBITT She 's right . I have n't . It feels good . Great , even . MRS . NESBITT You 're helping her , Father . NESBITT I absolutely despise the creature walking the earth that did this to me . The thought of his offspring in my body makes me feel nauseous , gives me insomnia , stomach disorders , back pain , headaches , slurred speech , cramps , and other general problems . That ass-hole ! That fucking bastard , that slimy anal pimp ! MRS . NESBITT ( Apologizing ) You remember Annie before . The best children 's librarian they 've ever had . It hardly seems possible that this is the same girl who went to catechism class here  --  NESBITT I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth befalls this man and that he 's tortured and killed . In a bloodbath ! Like I had ! ( She stands up. ) p. 69 MRS . NESBITT Thank you , Father . It 's clear to me that we 'd better be going . NESBITT Venereal disease or leprosy  --  MRS . NESBITT Anne  --  NESBITT Syphilis  --  MRS . NESBITT ( Rising ) Thank the Father NESBITT Obliterated ! Completely dismem  --  MRS . NESBITT Annie ! NESBITT Or worse  --  beheaded . Worms ! All at once . You know , come to think of it , I 'm angry at God , too . MRS . NESBITT I will call you , Father . Thank you for your prayers , your blessings . ( She genuflects in front of the cross , dragging ANNIE with her . ANNIE genuflects . THE LIGHTS FADE ON THE CROSS . MRS . NESBITT stares at ANNIE for a moment in silence . ) MRS . NESBITT ( Continued ) Darling . You may be right about all this . There may be limits to what a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NESBITT exits . ANNIE watches her go , then crosses to MONICA 's office . MONICA is sitting at a desk , writing . ) NESBITT ( Blurting ) You said I could come to you if I needed help . Dr , Hartford . p. 70 DR . HARTFORD That 's right . Have a seat . NESBITT I 've come back because I thought you understood . DR . HARTFORD Thanks . ( Helps ANNIE sit . ) NESBITT You see , I 've had these nightmares . That he 's out there . Just waiting for me somewhere . I wake up in the night all the time . In the shadow of the monster . DR . HARTFORD In time , those will stop . But it takes time , Annie . NESBITT There are some things I have to know now , Doctor . Today . Can you tell from examining me what the child looks like ? DR . HARTFORD No . It 's too early . I 'm sorry . NESBITT Ca n't you tell me anything about it ? Anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night I dream that the baby 's head is a hat . A navy blue cap . There 's a shiny metallic badge on it and leather stitching growing down there Each detail haunts me , follows me wherever I go  --  DR . HARTFORD There 's no hat on the baby . That I can assure you . NESBITT Sometimes , I see the child 's face as a smashed sandwich , the eyes peering out of the bread . p. 71 DR . HARTFORD Have you told the therapist ? NESBITT At least twice a week , I wake up screaming . I dream that the baby is a snake , a serpent , crawling , slithering through me , through the holes in my body , hissing , and its skin is so scaly that it tears apart my organs , so I die  --  DR . HARTFORD You must tell these dreams to someone . NESBITT I 'm telling you . DR . HARTFORD I mean whenever you have them . That 's why you 're seeing a therapist , for Christ 's sake . NESBITT We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARTFORD Well , we 've got to get you talking before we can know what you really want  --  NESBITT I 'll tell you what I want . Make me like I was before . DR . HARTFORD Annie , if I could , I would . NESBITT I feel traces of what I used to be . Fragments , clues . But I ca n't put them all together again on my own . I 'm the puzzle . Someone else has to fit the pieces in . But there 's no one who can , is there ? Make me like I was before ! DR . HARTFORD If I could erase the memory , the scars , the dreams , believe me , I would . p. 72 NESBITT I do n't know how to act anymore . I 'm afraid when I should be calm . I hate things I used to love . You 're the doctor . Heal me . DR . HARTFORD Annie , I ca n't do any more . I can only advise you of the medical choices you have . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed to know how to heal from this ? DR . HARTFORD We just do . Give yourself time . We 're just humans and  --  NESBITT Nothing in today 's world prepares you to heal from such an invasion , Doctor , nothing . DR . HARTFORD You have every right to be angry . NESBITT It 's the other way . They prepare you to keep taking it . And taking it . And taking it . DR . HARTFORD Do n't talk that way . NESBITT I ca n't take it any more ! DR . HARTFORD ( Finds a sheet in her stack of files ) Annie . It 's getting a little late . Why do n't you take one of these with you and think about it when you 're not so upset . ( Hands a sheet to ANNIE . ) NESBITT What 's this ? DR . HARTFORD My OB Fee Policy . You can look at it at home . p. 73 NESBITT OB Fee Policy ? DR . HARTFORD You need to know . ( ANNIE looks at the sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prenatal Care Visits , Office Laboratory , Delivery , either Vaginal or Cesarean , and the Post-Partum Care up to six weeks " DR . HARTFORD In case you decide to have it  --  NESBITT " Two thousand eight hundred dollars . " ( Looks at MONICA ) For that , you 'd better be good . DR . HARTFORD I am . ( A beat ) NESBITT And if I decide to get an abortion , you 're the one who 'll do it ? DR . HARTFORD Oh , no . No . I 'll refer you to a clinic . NESBITT What 's it like ? An abortion . DR . HARTFORD It 's like surgery . Just surgery . You 'll have a recuperation period afterwards . NESBITT ( Rising ) A tropical vacation to boot ? Amazing . DR . HARTFORD You 're running out of time for an abortion . By not making a decision , you 're making one . Just make sure you can live with the decision you are making . ( MONICA rises . ANNIE stands staring at the sheet. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due and payable at 34 weeks . " ( Looks at MONICA ) DR . HARTFORD ( Shrugging ) This is a business , Annie . NESBITT " This fee does not include Hospital Charges , Anesthesia , Amniocentesis , Alpha Fetal Protein , Antenatal Testings or Ultra Sound . " ( Sarcastic : ) No free rides for these babies . DR . HARTFORD Annie  --  NESBITT Thanks for the sheet . I 'll try to figure out if I can afford to have a child delivered . DR . HARTFORD Do n't worry about the money part . Worry about your feelings . NESBITT Do n't worry about the money part ? You just handed me a sheet that says I need about five thousand dollars if I want to have this baby and you tell me not to worry about the money ? Doctor ? Are you crazy ? ( MONICA exits . ) NESBITT What 's the expression ? When a door closes , a window opens somewhere ? I do n't feel a breeze yet . ( LIGHTS SHIFT . ZACH sits at a park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and sits down next to him . ) NESBITT Hi . p. 75 ZACH Hi . Want a sandwich ? ( He hands her a sack . ) NESBITT Thanks . ( They both open their sandwichs . ANNIE does n't eat hers , just stares at it . ) ZACH Yum . Egg salad . NESBITT What are those things ? ( She puts it back into the sack . ZACH shows concern , but decides to let it pass . Awkward pause . ) ZACH The flowers are pretty . NESBITT Yes . ZACH Great roses . NESBITT Are you going back to work after lunch ? ZACH No . I 'll walk you back . But I think I 'm going to take a couple of hours and go by the station . I called the detectives this morning and I think it might help if I went down there and showed some interest . To let them know that it matters , if they come up with something NESBITT You think you should leave work to do that ? ZACH Why not ? NESBITT It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it 's hurting yours , too . ZACH I have some vacation time coming . p. 76 NESBITT You should save it . ZACH I 'm not going to rest until he 's locked up , put away for the rest of his lousy , miserable life . To think he could do this to you and get away with it . It really gets to me , Annie . It 's burning me up inside . Burning me up . NESBITT Do n't let him get to you , too . ZACH I 've got to do something . Then we can get on with our lives . Put this behind us forever . NESBITT There 's a lot to take care of . Before that can happen . ZACH We can do it . ( Looks around . ) Do n't you want some sustenance ? NESBITT That 's all I do anymore . Sustain . ZACH ( Puts down the food ) Okay . Let 's go for a walk instead . NESBITT I do n't know if I could live with myself . Afterwards . ZACH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with it . ZACH What ? NESBITT You know . ZACH ( He knows ) You want to talk about that now ? p. 77 NESBITT ( Quietly ) What if I went through with it ? We could get married and you could adopt it . ZACH Are you serious ? NESBITT It would make everything so simple . ZACH It would make everything hell . I love you . And I 'd do anything for you . But not that  --  You want me to raise it and send it to college ? Why ? Come on . You have nightmares already . We do n't need a psycho baby , too . NESBITT A psycho baby ? ZACH Well , who knows ? ( A beat . ) NESBITT If we 're really in love , we can work through anything . ZACH I fell in love with you before this happened . ( A pause . ) But I do n't want this to change all our plans and  --  ( Looks around the park . Little girls ' laughter is heard along with park noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , why do n't we go to your house or mine or somewhere private Any place but not here . NESBITT Everything is blue here . Dark blue . ZACH ( Gently ) I understand . Let 's go . p. 78 NESBITT You do n't understand . It 's not happening to you . It 'll never happen to you . Not the way it did to me . ZACH It is happening to me . I 'm with you through this whole thing . NESBITT Not in the same way . Not even close . ZACH We 've got to do what 's best for the two of us now . Just us . NESBITT Why ca n't something be right for me ? Just me ZACH God . We ca n't even manage to have lunch together anymore .

ZACH Because I just ca n't . ( ZACH wads up the paper bags and exits . ) ( ANNIE crosses and finds the rag doll from Act one , and holds it in her arms . MRS . NESBITT enters . ) MRS . NESBITT Your old Raggedy Ann . I forgot you had that here . NESBITT The one toy I could never get rid of . Raggedy Ann . ( ANNIE puts down the doll . MRS . NESBITT examines ANNIE . ) MRS . NESBITT How about some tea ? ( MRS . NESBITT starts fixing tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . ) I remember the day your father and I bought you that toy . Your father thought every little girl needed a Raggedy Ann . I wanted to get you a Raggedy Andy , too . But we started you out with just the Ann . And never ended up getting an Andy . You sure loved her . Right away . You were such a pretty little girl , your hair all in braids , carrying around that big old doll . I used to love to dress you up then . Your father used to tease me that I treated you like my own doll , a little girl doll for me to play with . Remember those dresses I sewed for you ? p. 80 NESBITT Yes . MRS . NESBITT ( Sitting ) We have so many pictures . Those were the best days . When your father was with us . He would be so proud of you , in your fine Sunday outfits . Proud of the three of us together . Our family . ( She puts out teacups , tea bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ANNIE . ANNIE takes the cup and starts to sip . She holds the Raggedy Ann doll next to her . MRS . NESBITT finishes with the tea , pouring one for herself . ) MRS . NESBITT Now you can pass that doll onto your own child . That 's what having a family is all about . NESBITT What child ? ( ANNIE puts the doll down . ) MRS . NESBITT ( Knowingly ) Annie . You forget . I know what you 're going through . I know what it feels like to have a baby . NESBITT Not this one . You do n't know what this feels like , Mother . MRS . NESBITT It 's just a baby . A little , tiny thing trying to breathe , trying to get ready to see the world . With tiny eyes . A tiny nose . The smallest , cutest mouth you 've ever seen . When you put your finger in its hand it will hold on to you , the fingers curling over yours , wanting to love you . Wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's who it is. p. 81 NESBITT Suddenly you know everything about it . MRS . NESBITT I 'm a mother , Annie . I remember . And if you knew what I know , you 'd feel this way , too . It 's the purest , most innocent thing you 'll ever see , a newborn baby . And if you decide not to have it you 'll have done away with an innocent . What could be worse than that ? Nothing . NESBITT Was n't I innocent ? MRS . NESBITT Of course . But I 'm talking about in God 's eyes . NESBITT How does God feel about what happened to me ? Why did n't he stop it if he 's so concerned with everything ? MRS . NESBITT ( Sips her tea ) You are not weak . His laws are disobeyed by the weak . We ask for His forgiveness for all , when it happens . He 's forgiven the man who attacked you . We must try to do the same . NESBITT I ca n't forgive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sins ? I 've got enough of my own . That 's all I want . Responsibility for myself . MRS . NESBITT You should n't pay for his sins , Annie . But you should forgive . And you should n't be guilty of committing another sin . Murder is a sin . NESBITT This thing , in my stomach , will just remind me . All the time . Of the most horrible moment of my life . I did n't ask for this . Why should I have to live with it ? p. 82 MRS . NESBITT It 's not a thing . It 's a baby . NESBITT It 's not formed into a baby yet . MRS . NESBITT It 's a pre-born child . NESBITT It 's barely a fetus . MRS . NESBITT How can you say that ? It 's living in you ! It depends on you already . NESBITT It 's the product of an assault . MRS . NESBITT We both know it 's a human baby , Annie . Stop playing with words . And if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who NESBITT ( Aghast ) Mother  --  MRS . NESBITT At least you lived ! This child wo n't have a chance to ! NESBITT If I have it , I wo n't have a chance to live any more . Not the way I was before . Does this thing matter more to you than I do ? MRS . NESBITT No . Of course not . But I 'm your mother . And I 've been through more  --  of life  --  than you have . And I 'm thinking about not just your life here on earth , but also about your soul ! NESBITT I 'd like to worry about my own soul , Mother . p. 83 MRS . NESBITT How can I ever have peace knowing that you , the only daughter I 've ever had , the person I love the most in the entire world , will not meet with me again , in the afterlife , because of temporary misfortune ? NESBITT How can you call it " temporary " ? MRS . NESBITT Is n't this good tea ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you calling temporary , Mother ? MRS . NESBITT Nine months . That 's all I ask . NESBITT It 's forever . While I live and breathe . MRS . NESBITT I 've tried Maybe it would help if I brought over some people . NESBITT Friends ? I ca n't talk to a church committee about this . This is a private matter . What 's it to these people whether or not I have a baby ? Why does it matter to them ? This is my problem ! MRS . NESBITT They 'd do it for me . Father thought it might help ease my mind for both of us . NESBITT I wo n't meet with anyone , Mother . No . MRS . NESBITT Just for a few minutes . Just listen . You wo n't have to talk . NESBITT I like talking . Why should I keep listening to other people ? I want control , too . I want some power . I want to talk my way out  --  Out of this maze  --  it 's all part of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness  --  Attack , run away , right into another corner  --  the doctor , hold your hands over your head and catch your breath , run to another bend and you hit the legal system , back up and run into a brick wall  --  Zach 's family plans , and on the last curve , the biggest loop of all , you hit your mother 's soul . There 's no way out . I do n't see a way out . ( ANNIE rises. ) p. 84 MRS . NESBITT That is n't the way the world works . NESBITT I thought I was a person . With a right to my own opinions and decisions . Why do n't we allow that anymore ? ( ANNIE rises to exit . ) MRS . NESBITT Honey , what about your tea ? NESBITT No thanks . MRS . NESBITT I 've come over to talk to you . NESBITT I 'm going back to the library . MRS . NESBITT But you do n't have to work today . You said it 's your day off . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NESBITT What 's that supposed to mean ? ( ANNIE takes the Raggedy Ann doll with her . She crosses to the storyboard . ) NESBITT Goodbye , Mother . MRS . NESBITT Annie , please . Just give them a chance to tell you  --  ( LIGHTS FADE ON MRS . NESBITT and up on ANNIE , in the library . The Raggedy Ann is at ANNIE 's side . ) NESBITT Good afternoon , boys and girls . I know you did n't expect to see me today . But you see , it 's a special circumstance . A very special one . And I wanted to share it with all of you . ( She holds the Raggedy Ann . ) See this Raggedy Ann ? Does anyone know what makes a Raggedy Ann so special ? She 's made of rags , cloth tied together , to make her arms and legs . And inside , under her dress , in the place where you find her heart , what 's there ? Candy hearts . It 's filled with sweetness . And where does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's always filled with cool , blue-green shadows , and spots of golden sunlight , and it 's a magical place . ( She holds the doll up . ) But one day , a big monster came to the Deep , Deep Woods . He ripped Raggedy Ann to shreds , throwing her cloth arms this way and that . Around the trees . The monster even ate all the candy hearts . He stomped away , leaving pieces of Raggedy Ann scattered far and wide . He cut himself and left a piece of his foot as he stomped away . It was gross . ( She pulls out funny pictures , that slightly resemble Raggedy Ann . ) Her friends tried to sew her back together . They could n't remember exactly what she looked like , so they drew a lot of pictures , and voted on the best likeness . ( She shows the pictures one at a time . ) But these do n't really look like her , do they ? They could n't find any candy hearts , so they put peppermints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compares peppermints to candy hearts . ) By mistake , someone sewed in a piece of the monster 's foot , sewed it right into her stomach . Ugh ! ( She points to the stomach ) So she did n't feel the same . And her friends tried to tell her what to do and how to feel . But they could n't put her pieces back together the way she was before . And neither could she . That 's why she 's so sad today . Because she has the personality of a rag , a dishtowel . Nothing works like it used to . She was n't herself . She was more a rag than an Annie . More Raggedy than she was a fun doll . And her stomach hurt . So she decided to go away . She told everyone goodbye . Sometimes , boys and girls , it 's the only way to have some control over your life . To say goodbye . And that 's what she did . She went far , far away . And it made her happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann . She missed her friends , but she could live with herself . She could live with the decision . The monster 's foot , in her stomach , shriveled up and died , and that seemed like a happy solution , too . ( ANNIE puts down the doll . ) And so if you do n't see me anymore around the library , boys and girls , remember , I 'll miss you . But I want you to think of Raggedy Ann 's story . Because that 's where I 'll be . And know that I wish you lots of sweet candy hearts , and send you stories in the wind . Listen to the wind , boys and girls . Especially when it whispers . And if you see a falling star , catch it . And put it back in the sky .
