CHICAGO  --  The far-flung Beatrice Cos. empire is about to be peddled piecemeal . The tricky part will be trying to get top dollar for all of the pieces . As shareholders of the food and consumer products giant vote today on a $6. 2 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg , Kravis , Roberts &; Co. , some Beatrice insiders say they are poised for what they expect to be a near liquidation . Donald P. Kelly , the former chairman of Esmark Inc. , who left when it was acquired by Beatrice in 1984 and who will run Beatrice for Kohlberg Kravis , is expected to sell many of the empire ' s jewels to pay debt and then rebuild the company around what is left . Such a restructuring means Mr. Kelly also will have to contend with an exodus of talent , company sources say . One executive recruiter says he receives a dozen resumes a week from Beatrice supervisors , mostly those who work in planning and research . Analysts estimate that Mr. Kelly will reduce Beatrice ' s work force of 112 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divestitures . The businesses for sale are likely to include the Tropicana juice line , Coca-Cola bottlers in nine states , the Avis Inc. car rental unit and Swift &; Co. meats . Indeed , because of Beatrice ' s huge size  --  it earned $479 million in fiscal 1985 on $12. 6 billion of sales that were nearly three times the average of its 16 major competitors  --  the divestitures could sharply change the competitive landscape in a wide range of businesses as diverse as cheese , cosmetics and luggage . But once in the Beatrice executive suite , Mr. Kelly must deal with an unappealing finding : The company ' s investment bankers  --  Salomon Brothers Inc. and Lazard Freres &; Co.  --  have queried 100 potential buyers about bidding on individual businesses and found that the likely break-up total is roughly equal to Kohlberg Kravis ' s bid for the whole company . Mr. Kelly , whose specialty is buying and selling companies , thus faces the task of trying to negotiate better prices  --  something for which he is well known . When he was Esmark ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with making such moves just before market events occurred that changed the companies ' value ; such transactions were known in the early 1980s as " pulling an Esmark . " For example , he dramatically reshaped Esmark when he sold its energy business to Mobil Corp. just before the downturn in that industry . Mr. Kelly should be able to move quickly in paring Beatrice because he managed many of its lines when they were owned by Esmark . Beatrice ' s borrowing agreements require it to sell at least $1. 45 billion of assets by mid-1987 . Mr. Kelly will inherit a daily debt load of about $2. 1 million  --  62% more than the company ' s average daily net income last year . What is more , Mr. Kelly must find a way to restructure Beatrice without reducing it to a shell of leftover businesses that are its least profitable and hold the least potential as a core for rebuilding . Before agreeing to the Kohlberg Kravis bid , Beatrice examined such plans as selling all of the company ' s domestic food businesses  --  34 brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wesson cooking oils . " The problem is , no matter what you sell , you keep getting down to problem parts that you ' re just stuck with , " says one Beatrice executive . Mr. Kelly , who declined to be interviewed for this article , isn ' t tipping his hand on what businesses may go , but a few of Beatrice ' s pieces are potential hot sellers . Insiders estimate that the group of Coca-Cola bottlers , one of the largest units , had pre-tax profit of about $100 million on sales of $1 billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 28 . Analysts estimate the group could fetch $1 billion , and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. is considered the most likely buyer . Already this year , Coke bought its bottler in New Orleans and agreed in a joint venture to buy a Mississippi bottler . Coke wouldn ' t confirm or deny its interest in Beatrice ' s group but says it is always interested in buying bottlers when they come on the market . Tropicana , another of Beatrice ' s largest businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate . Salomon Brothers estimates that Tropicana had fiscal 1986 pre-tax earnings of $51 million  --  a fourfold rise from a year earlier  --  on sales of $600 million . But potential Tropicana buyers may view the chilled-juice business as too risky . Procter &; Gamble Co. ' s three-year-old Citrus Hill brand is nibbling at Tropicana ' s industry-leading market share of roughly 25% . Industry analysts expect Tropicana probably will have to spend more on advertising and promotion to maintain market share and will have a tough time increasing it . One potential buyer , Kellogg Co. , recently said it had decided against seeking Tropicana . Other Beatrice businesses have been on the block for some time . Prior to the Kohlberg Kravis bid last October , Beatrice said it wanted to sell the Avis car rental unit ; International Jensen Inc. , a maker of car radios and speakers ; the Danskin leotard and leg warmer business , and the Pennaco Hosiery operation . Of the four , Avis is thought by analysts to be the only significant profit-maker . The four have generated little interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed its efforts to sell the units during its negotiations with Kohlberg Kravis . Estimates of what the four would sell for vary from a total of $300 million to $500 million . Several other Beatrice units are sizable . Industry sources say Sara Lee Corp. is interested in buying Beatrice ' s meat businesses , which include the Swift and Eckrich brands . Salomon estimates that these lines had pre-tax earnings of $100 million in fiscal 1986 on sales of $1. 8 billion ; analysts say they might sell for $1 billion . Sara Lee wouldn ' t comment . Anheuser-Busch Cos. , which says it wants to expand its bottled water business , is a potential buyer of Beatrice ' s profitable Arrowhead , Ozarka and Great Bear brands , which Salomon estimates had combined pre-tax earnings of $45 million on sales of $200 million in fiscal 1986 . Anheuser-Busch declined to comment . Other Beatrice businesses that analysts say may be for sale include Playtex Inc. apparel , Stiffel lamps , Samsonite luggage and Culligan water treatment . But some of the company ' s operations aren ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , Beatrice ' s marginally profitable Danskin knitwear operation is beset by foreign competition and some analysts have long said it should be sold . And profit margins in the international food operations  --  which account for about 14% of the company ' s pre-tax profit  --  have been hurt by currency exchange rates . Some analysts worry that these margins remain vulnerable . Indeed , analysts say Mr. Kelly will have to strengthen Beatrice ' s weaker businesses to improve their value on the market . But Mr. Kelly is best known for disposing of troubled units , not turning them around , analysts and industry executives say . Joel Smilow , who will run Beatrice ' s consumer products group for Mr. Kelly , has said that he and Mr. Kelly are more interested in restructuring the company than in managing brands . Strengthening the weaker businesses will be particularly difficult while also cutting costs to pare debt . Many food industry competitors say they are increasing their advertising and promotion budgets at least 10% this year ; if Beatrice doesn ' t keep up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cash flow it needs to pay debt . Competitors expect that Mr. Kelly probably will redirect advertising dollars from corporate image to specific brands , easing the problem somewhat . Last month the company stopped its year-old sponsorship of two professional race-car teams ; this promotion , analysts estimate , would have required Beatrice to spend $70 million during the next several years . Mr. Kelly also is expected to dump the company ' s " We ' re Beatrice " theme that identifies its various products under the corporate logo . Analysts expect that Beatrice will have so few lines left that a unifying theme won ' t be necessary . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
