As the recession intensifies , fears grow that unemployment will top 9% <P> Like a pilot bailing out of a flaming aircraft and then waiting terror-stricken to see if his parachute will open , American businessmen and economists hung impatiently last week trying to see how deep the recession of 1980 would go . Just about everybody agrees by now that the nation is in a slump , yet no one knows whether plummeting interest rates , soaring unemployment and lethargic consumer spending foretell an economic decline that will be brief or prolonged , shallow or deep . <P> There was certainly enough material for the bad news bears . The nation 's industrial production declined 1.9% in April , the sharpest drop since February 1975 . The housing industry continued its free fall , as starts on single-family homes fell to their lowest level in ten years . Alan Greenspan , President Ford 's chief economic adviser , predicted that the nation 's business output would decline this spring at an annual rate of 7.7% , while Data Resources , Inc. , in Lexington , Mass. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate executives was the sharp .8% increase in unemployment that occurred in April alone , sending the overall rate to 7% . Mindful that the jobless rate jumped from 4.8% to 9% in the 1973-75 recession , a few warned last week that the Administration 's stringent anti-inflation policies could quickly push joblessness from its current 7% level to a chilling 12% or beyond by early next year . <P> Economists readily admit that they do not know how high unemployment will go in this recession . Confessed one top White House policymaker : " We 've simply thrown away the textbook on this one . We 've never started a downturn with such a high unemployment rate . " <P> Despite the sharp dive , the slump continues to look like a " two-and-a-half industry recession , " according to Michael Evans , a private Washington economist . The two : autos and housing . The half : recreational products like vans , boats and outboard motors . All three areas represent purchases that consumers are generally able to postpone in times of economic uncertainty . In addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days of May over the same period last year , and sales of recreational vehicles were off 40% in the first quarter . <P> In those fields and others closely related , unemployment is indeed soaring . Michigan Budget Director Gerald Miller expects the jobless rate in his state to jump to 15% or 16% by next month . Says June Collier , president of National Industries , a Montgomery , Ala. , firm that makes electrical equipment used by Ford and Chrysler : " In the next couple of months we can see the unemployment rate hitting the 15% mark .
