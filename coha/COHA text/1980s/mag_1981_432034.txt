 | On a May afternoon some three and a half years ago , a plump , matronly American diplomat named Shirley Temple Black delivered a tough , pointed speech to the prestigious Commonwealth Club of San Francisco on the subject of " Communist China , " which she had just spent three weeks touring . When she finished speaking , the master of ceremonies simply commented that he had had 20 requests from the audience for Mrs. Black to sing a verse of The Good Ship Lollipop . Shirley sighed and chalked up yet another victory for the " little girl . " For more than three decades now , Shirley Temple Black has been haunted by that " little girl " ? a figure clad in a starched , puffy-sleeved white dress and Mary Jane pumps . " Sometimes , " she says wistfully " I feel like the oldest living American . That little girl has opened a lot of doors all over the world for me. and that 's been a big advantage , but she 's not me . " Yet , whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Shirley Temple the top entertainer ? and the seventh leading money-maker ? in the United States during four years of the Great Depression are  | still very much a part of her personality today ... . Shirley was born on April 23 , 1928 , at Santa Monica ( California ) Hospital , less than 10 miles from 20th Century-Fox , the film studio she would soon make rich . Her father , George , was a clerk in a Santa Monica bank . Her mother , Gertrude , was a tall , darkhaired woman with a toughness of character that was evidenced in her handling of Shirley 's film career . Gertrude met George Temple in high school in Los Angeles . They were married when she graduated at 17 , and their first child , Jack , was born a year later . A second son , George , Jr . ( called Sonny by the family ) , followed in four years . " For a long time , " recalls Shirley , " my mother was afraid to have a third child because she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 12 and seven when Shirley was born ? a tiny , perfectly formed , beautiful child with dainty features and natural golden curls . The Temple family lived quietly in a continued on page 185  | modest , one-story stucco house in Santa Monica . Because Shirley walked at 13 months and kept time to music when she was two , Gertrude , over mild objections from her husband , enrolled her at age three in the Meglin Dancing School . By this time talking pictures had been on the scene for several years , and depite the Depression , Hollywood was booming . Because of this , Charles Lamont . a talent scout for a motion-picture copany called Educational Studios , happened to visit the Meglin Dancing School in the spring of 1932 . According to Shirley . she hid under the piano during Lamont 's visit while he sized up all the eager moppets . Then he said , " I 'll take the one under the piano . " Just about to turn four , Shirley was put to work by Educational in a series of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were used to satirize well-known adult movies . Shirley 's big breakthrough came in 1933 when songwriter Jay Gorney ( who also discovered Jackie Cooper ) asked Gertrude to bring Shirley to audition at Fox for a musical number in a film called Stand Up and Cheer . Two hundred children were there to audition for the part . Shirley waited her turn , then sold herself the moment she took the stage , singing the song Baby Take a Bow . She not only got the job . she stole the picture with her one e brief appearance . The film that made her an overnight sensation , however , was Little Miss Marker . This film also firmly established the character of the " little girl . " She was always an orphaned or abandoned child . dumped on mindless or unfeeling or confused or venal adults , who little Shirley shaped up before the final reel by being thoughtful , courageous , and wise . This formula , of course , was mixed with as many song-and-dance numbers ? at which Shirley was superlaitive ? as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being adorable , she embodied all the old-fashioned American virtues combined with the kind of wishfulfillment people desperately needed in the Depression years . As studio head Darryl F. Zanuck pointed out , " Her films did n't make Shirley ; she made : hem . " When Little Miss Marker not only made a lot of money but drew critical plaudits as well , Fox immediately starred Shirley in a film with the same title as the musical number that launched her , Baby Take a Bow . The studio also lopped a year off her age , increased her salary to $150 a week , and put Gertrude Temple on the payroll . An avalanche of mail , gifts , and public adulation began pouring in for the new child star . Shirley made eight films in 1934 , her first full year of film-making , and she ended up in eighth place in the national box-office poll ( behind such imposing  | names as Clark Gable , Mae West , Joan Crawford , and Bing Crosby ) . In midsummer 1934 Shirley 's weekly salary was upped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , her father was promoted to branch manager at his bank ( deposits took a quantum leap thanks to Shirley 's fame ) . and the family moved to a much larger house in Brentwood . A few hundred yards from the sound stages where she worked , the studio built Shirley a four-room , white bungalow with rose-colored gables , latticed gate , birdhouse , bunny house , kitten pen , and rope swing ? all surrounded by a white picket fence that also enclosed a half-acre playground . She says of herself during this period , " I had a lot of fun and caused a lot of trouble . I was a tomboy , although no one really knew that because they always saw me in nice little dresses and gloves . At home , I was a blue jeans and T-shirt kind of little girl . I wanted to join the FBI and be the first woman G-man . " Four more Shirley Temple films were made in 1935 ? the most notable being The Little Colonel because it paired her for the first time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning Robinson once taught Shirley three dance numbers that she picked up simply by listening to his feet . A t the Academy Awards in 1935 , Shirley was presented with an honorary gold statuette for bringing " more happiness to millions of children and millions of grown-ups than any child of her years in the history of the world . " ( She put the Oscar with her other dolls . ) And that year she became the top boxoffice draw in the movies , a position she maintained for the next four years . Studio executives were understandably paranoid about their valuable property . Every minute thing that happened to Shirley was big news . When she lost a front tooth , it was reported instantly to Darryl F. Zanuck , who allegedly said , " A front tooth ! For God 's sake , get the best dentist in town ? and close down the studio ! " At the Temple home things were much less frenetic . But it grew increas- ingly difficult for Shirley to go anywhere but the studio or her home . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so her mother took her to a downtown department store ? where she was instantly trapped by a horde of fans . A few months later she had to have a police escort when she wanted to go to the circus . The first time the family tried to travel after Shirley became famous , 40,000 children in Honolulu fought to get a glimpse of their idol . Shirley took all this in stride , apparently unspoiled . She was obedient without being docile , poised without being forward . She could n't be lied to or tricked , and neither coaxing nor honeyed words could undo a breach of faith . Her humor tended to be surprisingly pedestrian , although it was always bubbling close to the surface . ( Her idea of an uproarious joke was : Question : What does the tailor say when asked how he is ? Answer : Sew-sew . ) The wry , selfdeprecatory wit that would have her saying , " I stopped believing in Santa Claus at an early age when Mother took me to see him in a Hollywood department store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come along for many , many years . Shirley 's salary had swollen to $1,500 a week by the end of 1935 , and the following year Zanuck more than dpubled that figure ( while raising Gertrude Temple 's salary to $500 a week ) . In 1936 in the depths of the Depression ? when less than one percent of the American population earned $10,000 a year ? Shirley 's salary and bonus arrangement brought her between $3,000 and $4,000 a week . She also kept the money pouring in for 20th Century-Fox ( which insured her with Lloyds of London ) . She displaced Janet Gaynor and Greta Garbo in box-office polls ( Shirley topped the Motion Picture Herald poll four years in a row , from 1935 to 1938 ) , received up to 4,000 fan letters a week , and was lauded in Congress as the most beloved individual in the world . Her salary , by 1938 , had jumped to $10,000 Depression dollars a week . During this period , Shirley was received in the homes of some of the world 's most imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She met the President through his wife , who came to visit Shirley on the set when she was filming an especially difficult dance number with Buddy Ebsen for Captain January . Recalls Shirley : " Eleanor Roosevelt was a hero to me . When we first met , she had planned to stay for 10 minutes ; instead , she stayed four hours , and we ended up having lunch together . She found a friend , and I found a hero ? or heroine , although I did n't worry very much about genders in those days . I 'll always be grateful to her for providing so impressive a model to a 10 year old . " The model was n't so impressive , however , that Shirley could resist an act outrageously at odds with the " little girl " image . As she tells it today : " Mrs. Roosevelt was bending over an outdoor grill cooking some hamburgers for us at their home in Hyde Park . I was in my little dress with the puffed sleeves and white shoes and had this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried with me . When I saw Mrs. Roosevelt bending over , I could n't resist . I hit her with a pebble from my slingshot . She jumped quite smartly , and the Secret Service men assigned to her were extremely upset for a while . But no one saw me do it except my mother , and she did n't blow the whistle on me until we got back to the hotel . Then she let me have it in the same area I 'd attacked the First Lady . In 1939 , when Shirley was 11 , she lost her position atop the box-office poll . and from that time on her career went into decline . Inevitably , she grew up . and unlike other child stars ? such as Judy Garland and Elizabeth Taylor ? Shirley 's appeal did n't grow up with her . At age 12 , she had her first real flop , a saccharine version of Maeterlinck 's The Blue Bird . This was followed by a big money loser , Young People , her 22nd film for 20th Century-Fox . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's contract from the studio . reportedly for $300,000 . In the summer of 1940 Shirley was given a retirement party . The studio for which she had earned $30 million presented her with an upright piano , a rack of her old costumes , and some glowing speeches ? then waved her through the studio gates . There were immediate movie offers elsewhere . But Gertrude and George Temple chose instead to send Shirley to The Westlake School for Girls . In late 1941 Louis B. Mayer offered Shirley $2,500 a week ( about onefourth her final salary at Fox ) to do a junior-miss type story called Kathleen . The movie did badly , however , as did Shirley 's second comeback effort , Miss Annie Rooney . After these failures Shirley devoted her full attention to school for the next two years . She went back to work when she was 15 and a junior in high school when producer David O. Selznick signed her for Since You Went Away . This picture did well so Selznick then starred her with  | Joseph Cotten and Ginger Rogers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Westlake and took a husband ? in that order . She had done some carefully supervised dating during her teen years ? among her escorts were actors Guy Madison and Sydney Chaplin ? but she was permitted to go out unchaperoned only after she turned 16 . She told an interviewer then , " 1 want to marry , but not until I 'm much older . When I marry , I want to announce it at a party with all the girls from school present , and I want the showers and everything that goes with it . " Her prediction on the time of her marriage was badly off target . Shirley met John Agar through a classmate at Westlake . He was seven years older than Shirley , a tallish , lighthaired young man whose father was a wealthy Chicago meat packer . When Shirley met Agar. he was an Air Force sergeant ( World War II was drawing to a close ) stationed at nearby March Field . The two saw a great deal of each other during the winter of 1945 . Shirley says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station in Brentwood , presenting her with a two-and-ahalf-carat diamond ring that she wore for the first time at a luncheon for the senior class at Westlake . Gertrude Temple , who married when she was 17. had once said , " I hope Shirley does n't do that . " When Shirley did indeed do that , Mrs. Temple issued a statement saying : " Mr. Temple and I could n't be happier with the boy Shirley has chosen . " Shirley and John Agar were married September 19 , 1945. in a double-ring ceremony before 600 guests at the Wilshire Methodist Church in Los Angeles . Looking back on that day from the perspective of several years . Shirley recalled . " I wanted marriage more than a career because you can get awfully lonesome with your scrapbooks . " Shirley was to discover you can also get awfully lonesome with a husband .

While he was attempting to learn his new craft , Shirley made two poor movies ( Kiss and Tell and Honeymoon ) , and a couple of good ones ( The Bachelor and the Bobby-Sorer , with Cary Grant , and That Hagen Girl . which Shirley considers her best adult film ) . Then she retired once again , this time to have a baby . She was 19 when Linda Susan Agar ( who came to be called Susan ) was born . In 1949 Shirley 's film career and her marriage wound down simultaneously . In October 1949 Shirley went off to Palm Springs alone to think and six days later announced that she would seek a divorce . Shirley asked only for her freedom and the custody of Susan . then 20 months old . At her divorce trial Shirley , just turned 21 , admitted that she had even contemplated suicide at one point . David Selznick , who still owned Shirley 's contract , urged her to go abroad @# after the divorce , to study acting and pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shirley made three more unsuccessful movies : Mr. Belvedere Goes to College , The Story of Seabiscuit , and A Kiss for Corlisr . The latter turned out to be her last film . ) In January 1950 Shirley took Selznick 's advice . Accompanied by her parents and her daughter , Shirley went to Hawaii . There she met Charles Alden Black . A 30-year-old Harvard and Stanford Business School graduate , Black was the son of the president of the largest private utility company in the world . In addition to being wealthy , he was also darkly handsome and very self-assured . Shirley 's two-week vacation in Hawaii was suddenly extended to six weeks . She finally left in mid-March . A few weeks later Black quit his job to go to work for a Los Angeles television station ( he 'd been with the Hawaiian Pineapple Corporation ) because , " I felt I could n't compete for her hand from 3,000 miles away . " Shirley 's divorce from John Agar was final on December 1 , 1950 , and two weeks later she married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calif . The press did n't even know about it until the couple returned from their honeymoon . Early in 1951 Shirley and Charles Black , with daughter , Susan ( whom Black legally adopted ) , took up residence in a Bel Air house only a few miles from the Santa Monica home from which Shirley Temple , two decades earlier , had sung and danced her way to stardom . The United States was involved in the Korean War at this time , and Charles  | Black ? a reserve lieutenant commander in the Navy ? was recalled to active duty in Washington , D.C. Almost overnight Shirley became a suburban housewife in a rented house in Bethesda , Md . When word got out that Shirley Temple was living there , it became a regular stop on the tourist circuit . Shirley liked to mow her own lawn and was several times asked by tourists to move out of the way so they " could photograph Shirley Temple 's house . " She remembers , " I loved Washington even though I was pregnant most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of myself at Embassy parties , I get bigger and bigger . " The Black 's first child ? Charles , Jr . ? was born at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda , and his birth almost ended in tragedy . He was delivered by cesarean section , and two days later Shirley was put on her feet and told to walk . Her stitches broke , but the damage was n't discovered for almost eight hours . As a result she developed pleurisy and was near death for several weeks ? a " very frightening experience . " Soon after she recovered , Charles was discharged from the Navy , and the Blacks moved back to Los Angeles . Lori , their second child , was born on April 9 , 1954 ? also by cesarean but without complications this time ? in the same hospital in which Shirley had been born . Six months later , the Blacks moved to a five-bedroom ranch home about 30 miles south of San Francisco , where Shirley became a full-time homemaker . Shirley and Charles shared a broad range of interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mutual love of the outdoors . This interest led Charles , finally , to the work in which he is deeply involved todayaquaculture , which develops and markets instruments and methods to get food from the sea . At home Shirley ran a tight ship , bounded by the same strict and simple ethics by which she had been raised . She had a set of her old movies on hand , and the children looked at them for a few years , then lost interest . ( " We ran them at birthday parties , " Shirley recalls , " until the kids were about seven . Then they seemed to prefer the roller rink . " ) The children also adopted an ecological life-style , recycling cans and newspapers for years . Lori worked at a local marine park and participated in a wilderness program . Charles , Jr. , loved backpacking , and Susan was a fine horsewoman . About the only sign of modest rebellion was Charles ' long hair and mustache . Charles attended a military school , then went on to get a graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine musician ? has become a photojournalist , and Susan ? with an arthistory degree from Stanford ? married an Italian diplomat who specializes in African affairs . In her mid-thirties , with the children at school and the household running smoothly , Shirley began to indulge a strong sense of community and social responsibility . She involved herself in volunteer activities ranging from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society to the local Junior League . She also began to involve herself in Republican politics . On Easter Sunday , 1967 , as Shirley and her family were having dinner at their local country club , an old friend , Arthur Younger , the Republican congressman for Shirley 's district , came over to talk . He told Shirley he planned to retire soon and suggested she give some thought to running for his seat in Congress . She said she would think it over . - Two months after this conversation . Congressman Younger died . On August 29 , 1967 , Shirley announced that she was running in the Congressional primary . " Little Shirley Temple , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 years old , became deeply involved in that fall 's presidential election and worked tirelessly for Richard Nixon . She was rewarded a few months after he took office with an appointment as U.S. delegate to the United Nations . One of Shirley 's finest accomplishments was the respect she built ? brick by brick ? in her year of service at the UN . Her performance in that arena won her an appointment as U.S. delegate to the International Environmental Conference in Stockholm in 1972 . For the two years following her UN stint , Shirley traveled the world frequently on private and public missions . In 1972 her new career in public service was halted ? almost permanently . She was in Moscow as a delegate to a U.S.-Russian environmental treaty conference when she first felt a burning sensation in her chest . A few days later . in Washington , D.C. , she discovered a lump on her left breast . After an Xray disclosed a breast tumor , the doctor " decided I should have a biopsy to see whether the tumor was benign or malignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought were pretty good odds . " Typically , Shirley 's public commit-  | ments took precedence over her diagnosis , and it was almost a month later before the biopsy was finally performed . Also typically , Shirley kept tight control over her own life and destiny . " I only signed the release to let them do the biopsy , " she wrote several months later . " I said , ' Doctor , you make the incision , and I 'll make the decision . ' Because it 's my body , I have the right to decide what happens to that body . I think if the cancer had spread all over my body ( which it had n't ) . maybe I would have chosen not to have any surgery at all .

" The surgery was successful ( a modified radical mastectomy , involving the removal of one breast and 12 lymph nodes in the adjacent armpit ) , and a few hours after she regained consciousness , Shirley was distributing flowers from the virtual greenhouse in her room to other patients on her floor . A few days into her convalescense Shirley told her family she would like to discuss the mastectomy openly to get the word " cancer " and the removal of a breast talked about . Her children and husband agreed , and with characteristic enthusiasm , Shirley went public with her operation , writing about it in detail in a national magazine and discussing it on radio and television . Shirley was overwhelmed by the response . " There were some 50,000 letters sent to me , " she said . A few weeks after the operation Shirley was back to a full work schedule . assured that she was cured . She said then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing after an operation of this sort .

I 'd like to be an ambassador in one of the developing countries . " And with a Republican President now in the White House , Shirley may get her wish . But wherever Shirley goes , for the rest of her life , the ghost in the white dress will he alongside .
