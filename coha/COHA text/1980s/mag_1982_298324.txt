They 're back workin'on the railroad after a four-day strike <P> In Chicago , some 160,000 commuters who normally ride the train to work suddenly were forced to take to the highways in cars and buses , producing traffic jams up to 17 miles long . In St. Louis , General Motors shut down its truck plant and laid off 2,350 workers after running out of parts usually delivered by rail . And in Maine , the Acton Corp. , the largest purveyor of brown eggs in the country , narrowly averted a foul-up when it sent five trucks to bring in 100 tons of corn , thereby ensuring that its 4 million DeKalb hens would not miss dinner after all . <P> In such ways was the country affected last week when 26,000 members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers walked off their jobs . The strike , which began one minute after midnight on Sunday , lasted only four days . By its second day Ronald Reagan had introduced emergency legislation in Congress ordering the engineers to accept a new contract and report back to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next two days . " It 's not pleasant to bring forth legislation that affects the right to strike , " said Democratic Congressman John Dingell of Michigan chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . " But the economic situation in the country leaves little alternative . " Secretary of Transportation Drew Lewis had predicted that the strike would cost the nation 's economy $80 million a day , but it appeared that the walkout actually inflicted far less damage . <P> At the heart of the dispute was the insistence of the engineers on preserving their traditional 15% to 20% pay advantage over other railworkers . Negotiations for a new contract for all 13 railway unions began in August 1981 ; although eleven of the 13 unions agreed on the terms , the talks broke down last July . Reagan invoked a 60-day cooling-off period and appointed a panel to make recommendations . In August the board suggested that the two holdout unions accept the 28.8% wage hike over 39 months already agreed to by the other unions , along with a no-strike pledge . The twelfth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lack of a guaranteed wage differential . When the cooling-off period ended on Sept. 19 , the engineers walked out . <P> The union must now accept the 28.8% pay hike , which will boost the annual earnings of each engineer to more than $47,000 by January 1984 . The Brotherhood is also prohibited from striking until July 1,1984 , when the current contract expires . <P> A generation ago , a national rail strike might have paralyzed the country . Last week 's walkout , however , was no crippler : both the sluggish economy and the diminishing role of rail transport blunted its impact . In the Northeast , service was relatively unaffected since the region 's major line , Conrail , was not struck by the engineers . The Southern and the Family Lines systems , the two major railroads in the South , drafted supervisors and other skilled personnel to operate the trains , and most major runs were made .
