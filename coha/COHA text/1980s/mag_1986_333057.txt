In the American West , gold mining has long been a romantic if not always profitable enterprise . But nowadays gold mining is back in those parts as a booming , albeit unromantic , big business . No fewer than 22 new gold mines are expected to open up in the U.S. this year , most of them speckled across California , Nevada , Montana and Colorado . The treasure hunt is bound to bolster the position of the U.S. as No. 4 among gold-mining countries . America 's importance as a producer has increased lately because traders have become fearful of disrupted output from the world 's leading supplier : South Africa . The precious metal 's price surged last week to nearly $421 per troy oz. , up from about $333 last April . <P> The rush of ' 86 is considerably different from that of the late 1970s and early 1980s . Back then , when the price of gold soared to $850 per oz. , dozens of small operators and thousands of individual prospectors jumped into the hunt . Most of those revenants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that began in the early 1980s , as the value of gold headed downward . The boom is now mostly confined to large , well-financed firms that were initially attracted by gold 's higher price . With gold currently selling at more than $400 per oz. , the operators can still make an average profit of as much as $200 per oz . <P> As part of an industry-wide drive to cut costs , most of today 's gold mines are surface , or open-pit , operations , a method used in copper and coal mining . The new excavations can take as long as eight years to start up , but then can handle thousands of tons of low-grade ore daily . The latest mines make use of a chemical technique called heap leaching to reduce costs . The procedure involves the spraying of crude ore with a cyanide solution that absorbs microscopic amounts of gold as it filters through the heaps of rock . After further processing , a low-grade bullion is produced that can be used in jewelry and industrial products . Some 25% of U.S. gold production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6% in 1980 . <P> The leaching process retrieves even marginal deposits . One place where the method will be used is Angels Camp , Calif. , about 120 miles east of San Francisco . Angels Camp provided Mark Twain with notebooks full of prospecting lore for his short story The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County . Today workers for the Carson Hill gold-mining company are blasting and carving out a 1,100-acre open-pit site . When it begins full operation in October , the Carson Hill venture will be the first commercial gold mine to open in the Angels Camp area since 1950 . The company 's general manager , W.B. Williams , expects to cull only .046 oz. of gold per ton of ore mined . But , says Williams , " if prices go down , we still make a profit . " <P> Other miners continue to see a bonanza in more traditional methods . About eleven miles southeast of the Carson Hill site , Canadian-backed Sonora Mining has invested $85 million to build the largest conventional gold-processing mill in North America , due to open early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold from the hills around Jamestown ( pop . 950 ) , a sleepy settlement born during the 1849 gold rush .
