Seven people die after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol <P> Adam Janus , 27 , had a minor chest pain last Wednesday morning , so he went out and bought a bottle of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules . About an hour later in his home in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights , Janus suffered a cardiopulmonary collapse . He was rushed to Northwest Community Hospital , where doctors worked frantically to revive him . " Nothing seemed to help , " said Dr. Thomas Kim , chief of the hospital 's critical-care unit . " He suffered sudden death without warning . It was most unusual . " <P> <P> That evening , grief-stricken relatives gathered at Janus ' home . Someone offered to go out for aspirin . No need , said Stanley Janus , 25 , Adam 's younger brother , who had noticed a bottle of Tylenol in the kitchen . He and his wife Theresa , 19 , each took at least one capsule . At 8:15 p.m. , five hours after his brother died , Stanley was pronounced dead . Theresa died on Friday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents had died under similar circumstances . Each had ingested an Extra-Strength Tylenol capsule laced with cyanide . Food and Drug Administration officials suspect that someone unconnected with the manufacturer tampered with the drug ; by their reasoning , the killer bought Extra-Strength Tylenol over the counter , inserted cyanide in some of the capsules , then returned the bottles to store shelves . Illinois Attorney General Tyrone Fanner suggests that " a disgruntled employee in the production chain " was the more likely culprit . Whatever the method and motive , the killer clearly knew what he was doing . In each case , the red half of the contaminated capsule was discolored and slightly swollen . When opened , the capsules emitted the telltale almond odor of cyanide ; the poison was present in quantities thousands of times the usual fatal dose . Says Police Chief Carl Sostak of Winfield , Ill. , home of one victim : " Apparently a very sophisticated and very malicious person is at large who had to spend a lot of time and a lot of effort on this terrible plan .

" <P> The link to Tylenol was first noted by two off-duty firemen in the area who were monitoring their police radios at home . Philip Cappitelli and Richard Keyworth compared notes over the telephone and were struck by the fact that the painkiller had been mentioned in two of the reports . " This is a wild stab , but maybe it 's Tylenol , " Keyworth speculated . They mentioned their hunch to their superiors .
