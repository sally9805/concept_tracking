Octophiles were transfixed last week when the second Monday of this month produced the rhythmic four-digit 8-8-88 . Gamblers bet on the numeral , and some came up lucky , albeit a little bit late . Three straight eights topped the New York State lottery on  --  sorry  --  the ninth day of August , and 10,000 bettors who kept the faith for 24 hours will divide $6 million . <P> Couples considered the day an auspicious start toward the risky business of living together happily ever after . Manfred Kies and Regine Kubos , two West Berliners , outdid 55,000 other West German couples who exchanged vows on the day by adding on a few pieces of eight to go with their wedding attire . They were married in Blindheim , a village 20 miles northwest of Augsburg , which has the postal zip code of 8888 . The ceremony was scheduled for precisely 88 min. past 8 a.m. on , of course , 8-8-88 . Ten thousand philatelists also swarmed into Blindheim to collect a rare postmark . <P> For the Japanese , the character that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom  --  indicates suehirogari , or increasing prosperity . So does Mount Fuji , whose graceful slopes mirror the character . To observe the once-in-a-century day , nearly 1,000 Japanese climbers gathered at the top of Fuji in the early-morning hours of the 8th . They erected a cairn at the crest with 216 stones collected from mountains whose names include the word fuji , such as Kofuji or Rishirifuji . At 8:08 the last stone was placed by an eight-year-old boy , Akinori Yasuda . His birthday : 8-8.
