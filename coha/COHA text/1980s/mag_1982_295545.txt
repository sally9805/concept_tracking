A victory for moderation <P> The hecklers in the back of the gilded dance hall of Blackpool 's Winter Garden Complex were , for the most part , uncharacteristically silent . The debate , Labor Party Leader Michael Foot , 69 , coolly told his party 's annual conference , was vital to Labor 's chances of ousting the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . Thatcher is expected to call a general election by next fall , and Foot 's warning did not go unheeded . After hours of impassioned speeches by partisans of left , right and center , the 1,229 delegates voted by an unexpectedly large ratio of more than 3 to 1 to curb the rapidly rising power of Labor 's militant far-left fringe . <P> The instrument of the purge , and the focus of last week 's debate , was a Foot-proposed " register " of approved party organizations .

Labor 's standing in the polls has slumped to a 15-year low and a number of popular party figures have defected to the centrist Social Democratic Party formed last year . <P> The establishment of the register and a subsequent move last week to give moderates a majority on Labor 's policy-setting National Executive Committee represent a clear victory for the party 's majority of middle-of-the-road socialists . But the militants have vowed to fight back . Meanwhile , Thatcher is still riding the wave of public approval caused by her two-fisted conduct of the Falklands war , though such memories are beginning to fade .
