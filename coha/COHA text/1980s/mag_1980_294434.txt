It 's dim now , but the future of nuclear power may brighten <P> Even the strongest advocates of nuclear power have warned for years that it would take only one accident to cripple the U.S. atomic energy program . Just hours after that pump failed at Three Mile Island , the chief environmentalist for a New England utility predicted : " This is the end of nuclear power . From now on in , it 's going to be coal city . " <P> His prediction may have been premature . A year after the accident that drove thousands of Pennsylvanians from their homes and did even more than Jane Fonda to familiarize the American public with the hazards of atomic energy , nuclear power is still alive and managing to provide the U.S. with about 12% of its electric power . But the nuclear industry has been badly damaged . " I 'll be honest , " said an industry official , who prefers to stay nameless to preserve his job , " we 're fighting for our lives . " <P> The fight actually began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like utilities generally , was hurt by a slowing expansion in the demand for electricity as the population growth rate stabilized . Perhaps more important , the cost of building nuclear reactors has more than doubled , partly because of inflation , partly because of tighter Government regulations . Safety and environmental concerns , meanwhile , stretched the average time required to build a nuclear plant from about seven years in 1970 to twelve years today . <P> The result was that orders for new reactors , which hit a high of 41 in 1973 , declined to two in 1978 and zero in 1979 . Since the accident , five utility companies have dropped plans to build a total of nine nuclear plants . The cancellations hit hard at the reactor manufacturers . Westinghouse , which has long dominated the U.S. nuclear industry , has built 25 of the 72 nuclear plants licensed to operate in the country and has orders dating back a decade for 69 reactors , 24 of them to be built abroad . But other U.S. reactor manufacturers are faring badly . Babcock &; Wilcox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with seven others in the U.S. , has no new orders . General Electric has received no orders since 1975 . <P> To make matters worse , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission lost credibility because of the Three Mile Island accident and has yet to get it back . The special commission appointed by the President to investigate the accident called the NRC , in the words of Commission Chairman John Kemeny , " an agency hypnotized by equipment . " This faith in technology , charged the investigators , was at least partially to blame for the lax safety procedures and lack of qualified personnel that they felt contributed to the Three Mile Island nightmare .
