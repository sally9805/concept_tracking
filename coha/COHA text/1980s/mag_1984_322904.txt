Colored voters get a small voice <P> Apartheid , South Africa 's system of racial separation , is designed to keep blacks and whites far apart in education , employment , public accommodations and even sex , which is outlawed across racial lines . Before the sex barriers were drawn , however , South Africa had developed a mixed-race group or , as South Africans call them , " coloreds . " They now number 2.8 million of the country 's 31 million people . For the first time , South Africa 's dominant minority of 4.7 million whites has taken a step toward giving coloreds a real voice , though small , in the political process . <P> In nationwide elections last week , colored citizens chose from among 207 candidates to fill the 80 elective seats in a new , all-colored chamber of the South African legislature . The government called the election " satisfactory , " but the modest turnout-only 30% of registered voters-led opponents to declare it a failure and many coloreds to wonder whether their votes would speed the eventual dismantling of apartheid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmingly by white voters last November , the new legislature consists of three chambers : one for whites , one for coloreds and one for South Africa 's 850,000 citizens of Indian origin . Whites will retain almost total control of legislation , but coloreds and Indians will be allowed to pass bills that would affect them as racial groups . Proponents of the new system point to it as evidence that the government of Prime Minister Pieter W. Botha is serious about its promises of political reform . But because the country 's 23 million blacks are completely excluded from the new Parliament , some critics regard it as a divide-and-conquer strategy to set blacks against coloreds and Indians . The United Nations Security Council , with the U.S. and Britain abstaining , last week condemned the new South African constitution as " null and void . " <P> Within South Africa , antiapartheid groups-principally the United Democratic Front ( U.D.F. ) , a multiracial coalition of some 600 South African union , church , cultural , sports and community organizations-called for a boycott of the polls . On election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and universities stayed home in protest . Chief Gatsha Buthelezi , leader of South Africa 's 5.5 million Zulus , the country 's largest black ethnic bloc , hinted ominously of possible black reprisals against those who voted . Said he : " We feel betrayed because so many of our colored and Indian brothers and sisters are rushing forward with their tongues hanging out to endorse the white rejection of us . " Indeed , in the one-month election campaign that preceded the vote , colored political meetings were disrupted , and the homes of several colored candidates were firebombed . South African security forces responded by detaining 152 people the day before the balloting .
