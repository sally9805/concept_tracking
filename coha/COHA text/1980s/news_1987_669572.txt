The signs of South Korea ' s burgeoning export economy are everywhere . Hyundai Motors made a record-setting entry into the US compact-car market last year . Korean manufacturers are strengthening their hand in semiconductor production . Daewoo , which already sells computers in the United States , is poised to enter the car market with the Le Mans , made for General Motors. // But South Korea ' s move into sectors associated with the Japanese export machine is raising protectionist cries in Western countries . Korean exports to the United States grew almost 30 percent last year . And with Hyundai ' s tremendous success that year , the protectionist and fair-trade spotlight has suddenly focused on Korea , with demands for more-open markets to deal with its three-year-old trade surplus with the US. // // ' ' Korea has to realize that if it wants to do business , it has to give up something , too , ' ' says Shafiqul Islam , a fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington , D.C. ' ' Korea has to play very carefully. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stepping up efforts to buy American goods ( see story , Page 18 ) . But the all-too-familiar trade issues have brought inevitable comparison of Korea to Japan and concern about Korean plans for a continued barrage of exports in sensitive areas such as autos and semiconductors . <> <> The mouse and the elephant // Is Korea a second Japan ? // ' ' Korea hates being identified as a second Japan , ' ' says Kim Yoon Soo , deputy general manager of the Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul . The difference with Korea , he says , is that , unlike Japan in the past , ' ' Korea tries to trade on a reciprocal basis . It ' s more receptive to demands. ' ' // Koreans are quick to assert that , while comparisons with Japan are flattering , they overlook very real differences between the two countries. // ' ' Comparing Korea to Japan is like comparing a mouse to an elephant , ' ' says Jacqueline Y. Pak , a researcher at the Il Hae Institute , a think tank in Seoul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brand-name recognition , but maybe the Korean profile has been raised too rapidly. ' ' // ' ' Korea now exports cars , so it ' s reminiscent of Japan , ' ' comments Mr. Islam . ' ' It is following Japan in export-led growth . But it will take another 20 years for Korea to be like Japan. ' ' // While Korea and Japan may be linked in the minds of importers of cars and consumer electronics , there are significant differences between the economies of the two countries . Korea , with a population of 42 million , is less than half the size of Japan . Its per capita income hovers around $2 , 300 per year . It is also the fourth-largest debtor nation in the world , with a debt of $44. 5 billion. // Nevertheless , Korea ' s outlook for economic growth is extremely good . In 1980 , Korea had a $5 billion current-account deficit . Now it has a $4. 6 billion surplus . ' ' This was a major turning point , ' ' says Mr. Kim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a path where it will continue to have a balance-of-payments surplus . ' ' He expects this trend to continue as it did in Japan. // ' ' Some say that this may be temporary , because of the three blessings : low oil prices , low interest rates , and the high Japanese yen , ' ' Kim comments . ' ' But the strong yen will continue , low oil prices may be here for another two to three years , and interest rates won ' t change abruptly . ' ' <> <> Most PhDs per capita in world // Ask anyone what the pillars of this economic strength are , and you are likely to get the same answer . Koreans put in long days six days a week . Wages are low compared with other industrialized nations . The average household savings rate is 17 percent . And the quality of the goods Korea exports is rising. // Perhaps most important , the highly competitive school system produces a well-educated and well-disciplined work force . In addition , Koreans put a high premium on advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PhDs per capita in the world , ' ' says Ms. Pak of Il Hae Institute . A large number of these are from US institutions . And because of Korea ' s feeling of running to catch up with other countries , she adds , industry is putting increasingly heavy emphasis on research and development. // ' ' Korea has lost its attraction as a cheap labor country , so we have to rely on knowledge-intensive growth , ' ' Kim points out. // Still , there are dark spots . Korea is not self-sufficient in agriculture , and it has no oil , iron , or coal . Thus it relies heavily on imports for basic resources . Political issues also cast a shadow over Korea ' s economy. // ' ' Our weak points have always been the noneconomic factors , ' ' comments Suh Sang Mok , vice-president of the Korea Development Institute , an economic think tank . ' ' We have the North-South issues , political uncertainties . The two parties here are not on talking terms. ' ' // Because of these problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , while they are very bullish on the economy , rank Korea fairly low in their investment-grade ratings. // Labor relations is another touchy area . The large conglomerates do not have unions , and there is powerful resistance to their formation. // ' ' Labor-management relations are different from the West . The owner of the company provides school , dormitory , etc . , ' ' Kim points out . ' ' As the economic structure gets larger , however , the confrontational ethic gets more voice . The labor movement is international , so there is foreign influence . So it is departing from the old paternalistic ethic. ' ' // Increasingly , radical students have attempted to enter factories as laborers and organize workers . Such efforts bring government weeding-out operations and crackdowns because of fear of disruption of the economy as well as the development of a potentially powerful political force . The specter of North Korean opportunism is often raised as a rationale for strong control. // Others feel a stronger labor movement is simply an inevitable part of the industrializing process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other areas as well. // ' ' We are too highly dependent on exports , ' ' Kim says . Korea is trying to diversify its markets for exports , more than half of which have gone to the US and Japan . In addition , Koreans are trying to shift their traditional dependence on Japanese parts suppliers to US suppliers instead. // Korea says it is taking other steps as well to reduce the heat from Washington over exports . Such products as American tobacco and citrus are now sold in Korea , although in the case of tobacco , foreign cigarettes were limited to 1 percent of Korea ' s domestic demand . One US insurance company will enter the market , while two other firms will participate through a pool system run by Korean firms . Korea is also ending restrictions that are left against foreign banks . The market will open for medium-size cars this year. // ' ' We ' re trying to open the domestic market as much as possible while emphasizing export orientation , ' ' says Suh , the Korea Development Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been pegged to the dollar , will rise at least 5 percent this year , although the US would like to see it rise still more . Korea has benefited tremendously from the fact that , while the Japanese yen has soared in value , the won has stayed relatively low in relation to the dollar , making Korean goods even more competitive in the US market. // Suh adds that Korea is well aware of the ire Japanese exports have aroused internationally . ' ' We try to differ . Japan ' s is not a wise strategy - accumulating such a huge surplus , ' ' he comments. // Nevertheless , changing the ' ' buy Korean ' ' propensity of Korean consumers may prove difficul . While tobacco markets have been opened , for example , it is considered poor form to smoke anything but Korean cigarettes. // While Koreans say they are trying to respond to US pressure - which many Koreans see as a result of the US feeling that it got cheated by Japan - they also resent it . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the market at the behest of the US , only to watch 60 percent of the increase in foreign market share go to Japan. // In addition , Koreans question why they have gotten all the attention from Congress when Taiwan , for example , has a larger and older surplus with the US . But there is a strong desire to try to avoid a serious confrontation with the US over the trade imbalance. // ' ' Japan developed in a very free trade environment , ' ' says Kim . ' ' Korea faces a more difficult environment , and has more to overcome. ' ' // But , he says , Korea has learned a lot from the Japanese experience . ' ' Reciprocity is the name of the game now. ' ' // //
