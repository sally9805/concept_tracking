Two new British bands tap into some island roots <P> Not boom , boom , boom , boom . It is more like chi-boom , chi-boom , chi-boom . Come down easy on the offbeat , like a rhythmic shrug of the shoulders . Kind of bluesy . Kind of calypso . Kind of fun . <P> Ska-a back-pocket onomatopoeia for the distinctive sound of the beat-means no harm , carries no heavy freight , sets out to make you happy and keep you dancing . Ska is the no-account stepfather of reggae , the blues-inflected Jamaican soul popularized Stateside by Jimmy Cliff and Bob Marley and seen to splendid advantage in The Harder They Come , one of the best and most popular cult films of the ' 70s . Reggae shouldered a lot of political burden and social outrage , sometimes sounded almost introverted in its island concerns and religious visions . By contrast , ska is flat-out party music played faster than reggae and meant to be , if not frivolous , then feckless . <P> Reggae has already been absorbed into the English punk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reggae tunes . But a group called the Specials , as well as their allied band , Madness , have dusted off ska and made it shine like new . Both bands have had hit singles and albums on their home turf . Now the records have been receiving an encouraging amount of FM air play here , while Specials and Madness concerts around America have been enthusiastically attended by disenfranchised new wavers and punks without portfolio . Ska may or may not be the latest crest of the new wave , but it is at least clear that the Specials and Madness could safely join in a proud chorus of Stranger Cole 's 1963 ska tune , We Are Rolling . <P> Stranger 's original version , along with 15 other vintage ska songs , is available on a recently released compilation called Intensified ! ( Mango Records ) , which offers some interesting source material to set against the carnival modifications of the young English revivalists . Most of the Intensified ! tunes have a loping energy , even when the recording quality is dense and almost smothering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a bowl of tapioca . Both the Madness and Specials albums ( the latter produced by the sullen genie of punk , Elvis Costello ) are careful to preserve a spontaneous sound that just skirts being primitive . The groups rock a little harder than their forebears too . " We were the first band which wanted to combine punk and reggae , " says Jerry ( " General Dankey " ) Dammers of the Specials , " because we liked them both . " Bass Player Horace ( " Sir Horace Gentleman " ) Panter adds , " Both were rebel music . " Notes Jerry : " Humble beginnings , what ? " <P> Humble enough for musical comfort . <P> The seven members of Madness are middle-class kids from north London , who range in age from 18 to 23 . The seven Specials all hail from Coventry , in central England , and will remain grounded right there because , according to Panter , " it 's a small town and we know all the kids . " " People there know we 're nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Anglican minister . " It 's important to keep on the same level as the people who buy your records .
