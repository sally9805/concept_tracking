Among wealthy Brazilians , such pastimes as sunbathing and the samba have been joined lately by stock-market speculation . Since May 1987 the bourse in Rio de Janeiro has jumped almost 400% . Lebanese immigrant Naji Robert Nahas , who alone accounted for nearly half of the market 's trades in recent weeks , brought Brazil 's bulls to a halt last week after several brokerage houses discovered that $31 million of his checks had bounced on them . To avoid a bearish stampede , the Rio and Sao Paulo markets were forced to close last Monday . When trading resumed the next day , the benchmark I.B.V. index plunged 9% and ended the week down 32% . Nahas is a past master of shady finance : three years ago the U.S. Government fined him $250,000 for his role in manipulating silver prices .
