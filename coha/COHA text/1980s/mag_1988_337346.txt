When the rebels attacked her village at night , Felice Maria Arundo snatched up her son and daughter and fled into the bush until the screaming and shooting stopped . Morning found the grass huts burned and the ground strewn with the bodies of older villagers . Some of the young had been carried off . Defenseless and desperate , Felice Maria and other survivors headed east . Her two-year-old son died before they reached the protected settlement of Inhaminga eight days later . Her ten-year-old daughter was shriveled from starvation but still alive . All they wore was strips of bark . " They come in like this every day , " said Mike Mispelaar , head of operations for CARE , the New York City-based international relief agency . " It 's like seeing people walk out of hell . " <P> That is an unfortunately apt description for one of Africa 's most impoverished lands . A once beautiful country with a striking 1,500-mile - coastline , Mozambique ( pop . 15 million ) has fallen into the double grip of famine and civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 6.5 million Mozambicans could face starvation as a result of drought and the depredations of the rebels known as the Mozambique National Resistance , or Renamo , whose support comes from right-wing sources in South Africa and the U.S. Determined to oust the Marxist-oriented Frelimo government in Maputo , Renamo has cut rail lines , sacked villages and destroyed countless schools and clinics since it began intensifying its attacks in 1981 . In a particularly vicious assault on the town of Homoine last year , the rebels massacred nearly 400 civilians . " The destruction is maniacal , " says U.S. Ambassador Melissa Wells . <P> Renamo , which claims 24,000 followers , is not the only group that Mozambicans fear . Local warlords and bandits armed with Soviet-made AK-47 rifles murder and plunder at will . Some 80% of the nation is torn by mindless violence . Together with the outlaws , the rebels have driven more than 1 million people from their homes and halted food production by an estimated 2 million farmers . Once uprooted , the farmers are reluctant to plant again . Many refugees build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the rebels will return and destroy their new abodes . <P> The guerrillas , who have long hindered relief efforts by looting emergency provisions and destroying what they can not carry away , are now even cutting off food deliveries . On Christmas the International Red Cross halted airlifts from Maputo to rural villages after Renamo threatened to shoot down the planes . Land routes are hardly safer . More than 400 people were killed in ambushes on the main road from Maputo to the north in the past three months alone . Traveling in convoys guarded by ill-equipped Frelimo troops , relief vehicles are easy prey . Fifteen CARE drivers and assistants have lost their lives since 1984 . Driver Vincent Joao Mendes was ambushed twelve miles from Maputo last November as he headed north with a truckload of corn . Mendes escaped by leaping from the cab of the truck , but a soldier and two others were wounded by gunfire . " Now I think a lot about my seven children , " Mendes says .
