Sonny Jurgensen , once a Redskin quarterback of note , stood near a catwalk above the stands as Jay Schroeder , a future Redskin quarterback of note , pranced into the cool mist that enveloped RFK Stadium Sunday . " There 's no question the Redskins are better off with Schroeder , " Jurgensen said . " Joe Theismann was having a bad year anyway . Schroeder 's passes do n't spend much time in the air . He 's got the gun . He beat two good teams . But today is another day . " Jurgensen did n't look across the field , where the 49ers were spilling forth from their locker room . He did n't have to look to know what was coming . " Today , " he said , " Jay Schroeder will meet the world champions . " // Schroeder was anxious to play . Walter Mitty had never had it so good . Since taking over for the injured Theismann on Nov. 18 Schroeder had been living a fantasy , directing Washington to wins over the New York Giants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process . He had n't been sacked and had shown that he could throw the ball over the moon . But his reverie would soon end . // The 49ers showed Schroeder and 51,321 zealots at RFK why they are the world champions , and why the Redskins are not . The Niners ( 8-5 ) beat the Skins 35-8 , for their fifth win in six games , setting up a showdown with the NFC Western Division-leading , free-falling Los Angeles Rams ( 9-4 ) this Monday night at Candlestick Park . Schroeder proved he will one day be a quarterback to be reckoned with by throwing for 348 yards , outgaining a curiously absent 49er offense by 124 yards . But though Schroeder completed 30 of 58 passes against San Francisco , the Niners did n't allow him to throw a touchdown pass , sacked him four times and forced him into two fumbles and two interceptions . There are a lot of ways to win a football game and , in their competitive hearts , the talented , rallying 49ers know most of them . // Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards for a TD . The 49er defense , reverting to its impenetrable form of 1984 , turned back the Redskins inside the San Francisco 20 three times in the first half , allowing but two Mark Moseley field goals . Late in the first half linebacker Keena Turner returned Schroeder 's first fumble , the result of a blind-side hit by safety Jeff Fuller , 65 yards for a TD , and San Francisco took a comfortable 21-8 lead into the locker room . There the Niners learned that the Rams had been beaten 29-3 by New Orleans . San Francisco had come a far piece since being 3-4 to the Rams ' 7-0 , four games out with nine to play . // " The first six games of the season are won on execution , " said Niner safety Ronnie Lott . " And we were n't executing . But then , as the season goes on , things start to jell . The good teams begin to hit things . The talent comes out . " // From the opening Redskin series , two incompletions and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niner corner-back Eric Wright , " Schroeder can fire it . But our rush got the push on him , put him on his back a couple of times , and he started short-arming it . " // Passing the ball 58 times on the 49ers is inviting trouble in the first place , since their secondary boasts four Pro Bowlers . " If we make ' em pass , " said Lott , " then they 're playing our game . You throw it 50 times , you know we 're going to get our share . " Dwight Hicks and Lott intercepted Schroeder . " When we stop the run , we can beat anybody , " said Lott . " We have been stopping the run ever since we got the Big One back from his injury . " // The 49ers ' hard turn for home began on Oct. 27 , when they manhandled the Rams in Anaheim . In that game , nose-tackle Michael Carter  --  the Big One  --  came back from a torn hamstring that had sidelined him for four games . Since his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood . It has not allowed a touchdown in the last 14 quarters . // " We got beat because we could n't run on first down against their basic 3-4 , " said Redskin center Rick Donnalley . " The scheme they play allows Carter to gamble . " The 6 ' 2 " , 285-pound Carter had six tackles and stuck the Redskin running backs for losses twice . He made a shambles of the Redskins ' feared inside-rushing series . Carter also knocked down a pass and forced Schroeder 's second fumble with a sack that sent the second-year quarterback from UCLA directly into Niners defensive end Jeff Stover , who jarred the ball away and recovered it . That turnover led to a four-yard Wendell Tyler touchdown with 9:45 remaining in the third quarter . // Niner quarterback Joe Montana , who has been discombobulated by the new-wave blitzing he has seen this season , was 11 of 22 for 119 yards against Washington . In the second quarter he was called for intentional grounding in the end zone , a penalty that brings with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they 've taken that away with blitzes , " said Lott . " Teams have exploited us with the blitz . " Later in the second quarter , though , Montana did catch the Redskins in a blitz , changing a rushing-play call to a post to Freddie Solomon and hitting it for 39 yards to the Redskin one . From there Tyler scored the Niners ' second TD , which was all San Francisco needed this day . // And as the Niners headed home , offensive lineman Randy Cross put the team in perfect perspective : " That pitter-patter of our feet that the Rams have been hearing has become thunder . "
