The Reagan look : assured , affluent and , yes , conservative <P> Clothes do not the man or woman make , but they can tell a great deal about both . This is particularly true of a U.S. President and his First Lady , whose every costume change is remorselessly recorded by the color camera . In this respect , Ronald and Nancy Reagan seem all but certain to win approbation and exert considerable influence on American style . The Reagans dress in quiet , expensive-and yes , conservative-good taste . <P> In the eyes of fashion followers they will be the most interestingly turned out White House couple since the Kennedys . <P> Though neither of the Reagans is a fashion plate , both dress with assurance and a keen sense of what is appropriate for almost every occasion , be it a barbecue on their California ranch ( top-of-the-line cowboy garb ) , a press conference ( Ron may be in plaid jacket and slacks , Nancy in a preppie blazer and skirt ) or a fund-raising banquet ( business suit for him , cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan will be the first President since J.F.K. to wear formal morning attire . The selection , made by Reagan himself : an Italian-style black jacket of barathea cloth and striped gray woolen trousers with a three-button dove-gray vest , an outfit for which Reagan 's Beverly Hills tailor , Frank Mariani , will charge him $1,250 . Average rental price of a similar suit for Washington dignitaries : $42 . The new President has no head for toppers . Nancy has a new mink in the closet , but may forgo it in favor of a Republican cloth coat . The Reagans ' attire will be a considerable departure from the populist style of the Carters . For his Inauguration , Jimmy Carter wore a $175 suit he had bought off the rack a week before , which was consistent with his announced desire to de-emphasize the pomp of the White House . <P> For the nine Inaugural balls on Jan. 20 - all of which he intends to drop in on , save a party for the young-the President will wear tails made for him a few years ago by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be white tie , virtually every formal wear rental store in the capital was stripped of tails . In accordance with the Cinderella rule , which precludes a new First Lady from disclosing her gala getup , Nancy would not say what she will wear for the ball , though rumor has it that it will be a white gown by Galanos , one of her favorite designers ( price for the ordinary buyer : up to $8,000 ) . She will wear white shoes and carry a rhinestone-decked white handbag by Manhattan 's Judith Lieber , who makes the priciest totes in America .
