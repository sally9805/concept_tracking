<P> Moscow tries for parity in the arms propaganda race <P> <P> Lavishly illustrated with four-color photographs , vivid maps and authoritative-looking charts , the glossy 78-page booklet could well have been produced on Madison Avenue . Instead it came from Moscow 's stolid Military Publishing House . Whence the Threat to Peace is the Soviet Union 's rejoinder to the Reagan Administration 's slick 99-page analysis , released last September , of Moscow 's strategic and conventional arms buildup . Many of the claims made in the Soviet booklet are false , but the production represents a quantum leap in Moscow 's mastery of military propaganda . <P> Whence the Threat aims to show that the U.S. and its " bellicose partners " are upsetting the global military balance and seeking the means to start a nuclear war . The claim is nonsense , but the Soviets make skillful use of statements by Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State Alexander Haig , and of unclassified Western military data , to get their spurious message across . <P> Moscow 's pamphlet is organized along roughly the same lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size ( 8 in. by 10 in. ) and has a sequence of chapters assessing U.S. military capabilities and the East-West balance . It is replete with statistics culled from Western sources ; the Soviets almost never reveal their own military data . In one respect , Whence the Threat is even superior to its U.S. counterpart : the Soviets were able to print actual photographs , which are readily available , of such new American weapons as the B-1 strategic bomber and the M-1 battle tank . The U.S. booklet , Soviet Military Power , used artists ' renderings of satellite photographs of Soviet weapons . The Soviet effort contains many distortions and a few outright lies . The total strength of the U.S. armed forces is listed at " close to 3 million servicemen , " when in fact it is 2,049,100 . The Soviets say that there are more than 7,000 tactical nuclear warheads in Western Europe ; there are about 6,000 . It is claimed , correctly , that the U.S. defense budget rose 13% between 1978 and 1980 . But Moscow 's pamphlet does not mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere 3% , and it did not grow at all in the mid-1970s . <P> The key failing of the Soviet document , which was also a weakness of the Reagan Administration 's effort , is that it does not address U.S. and Soviet forces in comparative terms . Thus much is said about the U.S. 's Ohio class Trident submarine , but nothing about the U.S.S.R. 's new Typhoon equivalent ; much about the B-1 bomber , but nothing about a new Soviet strategic bomber under development . The Soviets term the U.S. space shuttle a " space attack system , " but omit mention of their own orbiting " killer " satellite . <P>
