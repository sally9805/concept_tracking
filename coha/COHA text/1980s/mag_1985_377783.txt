New Immigrants <P> To the Editors : Your issue on immigration SPECIAL ISSUE , July 8 was superb . It takes courage , initiative and moxie to pull up roots and go to a land where the culture and probably the language are totally foreign . Most immigrants are willing to start at the very bottom and work doubly hard to get to the top . Immigration is America 's way of staying young and vital . May it never cease ! Michael J. McClary Anaheim , Calif . <P> This spectacular special issue reminded me once again of what a blessing it is to be an American . My parents immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico in 1952 . As the youngest of nine children , I have seen seven sisters receive college degrees . My brother will soon be added to the list , and I am not far behind . My parents will leave us not an inheritance of wealth but one much more valuable , and that is the citizenship we hold in America , a land that makes it possible to obtain an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fortunate . Steve Ramirez El Paso <P> They come to better themselves . By doing so they also stimulate our economy , diversify our cuisine , enrich our language and culture , bring innovative ideas and strengthen our gene pool . Some say we can not afford to have more immigrants . I wonder if we can afford not to . Guy Langsdale Miami <P> As a native-born American , I feel like a member of an endangered species in my own country . Joe Arnold Columbia , Mo . <P> The tide of immigrants changing the face of New York does not threaten me . If America is as good to these newcomers and benefits as much from their efforts as it did from those of my parents , who arrived in 1913 , then all will be well . Rabbi Ronald Millstein Great Neck , N. Y. <P> I could feel blood from all my immigrant ancestors flowing through my **31;17854;TOOLONG veins as I read every word of your stimulating articles .

As their stories show , despite prejudice , the success of Asian Americans through hard work is not new . Jock K. Chung New York City <P> The U.S. has welcomed far more than its share of immigrants and political refugees . With a population of nearly 240 million and all of its attendant social and economic problems , the last thing our country needs is a flood of additional people . It is high time for the U.S. to end its unrealistic and anachronistic immigration and refugee policies by drastically restricting the admission of newcomers to our shores . Russell S. Garner Arlington , Va . <P> In all the glow about new immigrants , what about a few words of acknowledgment for those of us whose families have been here for many generations and who helped make America the kind of country that attracted these people ?
