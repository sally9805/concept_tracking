Cheek resting gently on folded arms , the attractive , dark-eyed woman stares from the page with that familiar cover-girl gaze . But wait . Are n't those wrinkles on her forehead ? And creases in her cheek ? " At last ! " declares the cover line . " A magazine for the woman who was n't born yesterday . " At last , indeed . After a tempestuous 2 1/2-year start-up that had Manhattan media circles sniffing with disdain , readers this week will see the first issue of Lear 's . The brainchild and namesake of Frances Lear , former wife of Hollywood Producer Norman Lear , the new magazine is dedicated to the proposition that " women over 40  --  yesterday 's ' mad housewives '  --  are today 's sanest , most creative , most interesting Americans . " <P> In 1985 , as her 30-year marriage was falling apart ( she has two grown children ) , Lear decided to move to New York City to pursue an idea for a magazine . Bolstered by her $112 million divorce settlement , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to make money , " she says firmly , sitting in her cluttered Park Avenue office . " If it does n't make money on schedule , we wo n't continue it . " Behind that calculus , however , lies a crusade . After years of watching women get pushed aside at an age when many men reach their prime , Lear , 64 , wants to change the way women over 40 perceive themselves and are perceived by others . <P> " Personally , professionally and creatively , these may well be the best three years of my life , " she enthuses . " I am experiencing a rebirth . " Such themes  --  independence , job fulfillment and spiritual renewal  --  are central elements of Lear 's . Divided into five sections , including " Pleasures " and " Self Center , " the premiere issue features an interview with Philippine President Corazon Aquino and original fiction by Doris Lessing . There are also inspirational profiles of half a dozen exemplars of the Lear 's woman , a combination of elegance , success and self-awareness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from 33 to 60 . " We are breaking the perception that age is dowdy , " says Fashion and Beauty Director China Machado , 58 , once of Harper 's Bazaar . The only problem she notes is with the " male photogs . . . The poor guys are taking some time to adjust . " <P> So did the editorial and advertising communities . When Lear set out , media types fed on her large fees for articles and dined out on her atrocities : editorial meetings attended by her masseuse , hairdresser and manicurist ; mercurial changes of mind ; an interview with a job applicant at which Lear announced that if she had such a resume she would consider committing suicide . But it went both ways . One early employee remembers an army of consultants , " men with boiled-out faces who said ' gals ' and complained about ' old women . ' So you see what the attitude was and how she had to fight . " Isolde Motley , who was wooed from an editorship at Arts &; Antiques and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I never met an entrepreneurial publisher who was n't an egocentric maniac , " Motley says . " She has a lot of guts and a great sense of mission . "
