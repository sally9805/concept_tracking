txt In the theater as elsewhere , time has a chemistry all its own . When Paul Osborn 's " Morning 's at Seven " opened on Broadway in 1939 It was given a lukewarm reception and ran for only a few weeks . Now there is a revival at the Lyceum Theater , and thoneh no one can say how lone it will nin it is clear already that the play has been received with an enthusiasm that far outstrips its previous reception . Several factors seem to account for the change . The time of the play is 1922 in a small Midwestern town , and the action occurs in the adjoining backyards of two homes . DeThe Theater " Morning 's at Seven " signer William Ritman has beautifully captured the lawns , the picket fences and the back porches of the two houses , with their details of fan-shaped , wooden filigree . The story concerns four sisters . One sister , Ida Bolton ( Nancy Marchand ) and her husband Carl ( Richard Hamilton ) live in the house on the left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " took the wrong fork in the road " and chose the wrong career . When Carl gets this feeling he has a " spell " and places his head against the nearest tree , his body leaning there like an old step ladder . ? Ida 's son Homer ( David Rounds ) is a 40-year-old bachelor who has been courting Myrtle Brown ( Lois de Maude ) for 12 years , When Myrtle lightly touches his am , Homer goes into a paroxysm of embarrassment . Given this reaction , it is no surprise that Homer looks askance at Ike idea of marriage . But events are closing In on him and one of the burning questions of the play is how long Homer can hold out . ( The antics of Carl and Homer are one reason why " Morning 's at Seven " is a comic delight . ) ' In the house on the right are Ida 's sisters Ally ( Elizabeth Wilson ) and .. Cora ( Teresa Wright ) as well as Cora 's husband Thor ( Maurice Copeland ) . Arry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thor for 40 years . Cora , aware that she has this long-time rival under her roof , wants desperately to move with Thor to another house and leave Arry behind . Esty ( Maureen O'Sullivan ) , the fourth sister , lives in another part of town at the insistence of her husband David ( Gary Merrill ) . David , an intellectual snob , forbids Esty to visit her sisters on pain of confining her to a separate apartment on the second floor of their house . One attraction " Morning 's at Seven " has for us today is its affectionate look at a bygone era . The setting , the characters and the problems they face are part of an America that has all but disappeared . And the further it recedes into the past , the more people want to reach out for it . The values , the relationships and the flavor of family life in small towns across the country fascinate us today , partly because they are gone , but also because they represent a place so many of us came from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mixture of the comic and serious , of sentimentality and skepticism . The title of the play is from Robert Browning 's poem that ends , " God 's in his heaven ? All 's right with the world . " On one level the play seems to fit the poem . So much of it is pure Norman Rockwell : the backyard setting , the ladles ' mid-calf length dresses with their ribbons and laces , the " aw , shucks " playing of David Rounds as Homer when he shyly ducks his head or hits his fist on a fence post . But this is Norman Rockwell with an edge , and the title of the play is partly ironic . During the play every person faces a crisis and has to make an important adjustment . If all is right with the world at the end , it is becauie a price has been paid . In other words , the play is a mixture of the bitter and the sweet . Forty years ago audiences wanted their comedies pure , uncluttered by harsh realities . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of course : a reflection in the theater of the way life is . , A third aspect of " Morning 's at Seven " more acceptable today is its focus on older people . Except , for Homer and Myrtle , who are around 40 , all of the characters are in their 60s and 70s . A play dealing with people that age was a rarity in 1939 . Today , with an increasing interest in the elderly , the subject seems highly appropriate . Of course , all of these assets would go for nought if " Morning 's at Seven " had not been given a first-rate production . Fortunately it has . Under Vivian Matalon 's finely tuned direction , the performances represent the best ensemble acting now on Broadway . Watch Elizabeth Wilson throw her head back , proclaiming that she does not need other people and can live alone , then a moment later tilt her head to the side and reach for a porch rail to let us know that just the opposite is true . And watch the others note the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment or one performer . Person for person , it is an exceptional cast : They listen to each other , they play together and their comic timing is impeccable . " Morning 's at Seven " is an evening of pleasure .
