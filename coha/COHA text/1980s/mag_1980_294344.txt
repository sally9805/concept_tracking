Directed by Richard Lester Screenplay by Charles Wood <P> Havana on the eve of revolution : Batista 's people clinging to their corrupt ways ; Castro 's men closing in on the cap ital ; and Sean Connery , as a soldier of fortune , flying in to try to help the govern ment turn the tide . Sounds lively . <P> But right away , Connery spies his lost love , Brooke Adams . Then and there the picture goes blank . As blank as the lady 's face , which Director Lester dwells on obsessively , as if fascinated by an actress who uses the same expression in all her scenes . Eventually , she leaves Connery . Her playboy husband ( Chris Sarandon ) womanizes blatantly while she runs the cigar factory , but she chooses to remain loyal to him even after his untimely demise - untimely because the audience would have felt well rid of him long ago . <P> Focusing on this listless triangle , Lester and Screenwriter Wood present as a dazzling insight into the smugness of power a scene showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves in for the kill . The decadence of Batista 's supporters appears about as wild as that of the fast crowd in an Ohio country club , while Castro 's revolutionaries behave like a hirsute Boy Scout troop . It is hard to believe that this dumb picture is the work of the director who did the delicious Three Musketeers movies . <P> - Richard Schickel
