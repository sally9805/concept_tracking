Their campaigns cost a grand total of $200 . They made few speeches , avoided appearing on television , and distributed only a smattering of pamphlets . They kept quiet about their platform , which proposes mandatory testing of all Americans for AIDS and " Nuremberg tribunals " for those suspected of treason . Although the ballot in the Illinois state primary listed them as Democrats , that designation cloaked their true affiliation . <P> The two candidates who won the Illinois Democratic state primary nominations for Lieutenant Governor and secretary of state in shocking upsets are actually followers of reclusive , ultra-right-wing , perennial Presidential Candidate Lyndon LaRouche . Mark Fairchild and Janice Hart , two travelers from the Twilight Zone of politics , narrowly defeated the handpicked nominees of Adlai Stevenson III . Stevenson won the Democratic primary for Governor with an overwhelming 88% of the vote . <P> The returns jolted everyone in Illinois politics . " This is insane , " said an incredulous Republican Governor James Thompson . " A disaster , " exclaimed Democratic Chairman Calvin Sutker . Stevenson was both angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purge these extremists from the Democratic ticket , " said he . " But one thing I want to make absolutely clear . I will never serve on a ticket with candidates who espouse the hate-filled folly of Lyndon LaRouche and the U.S. Labor Party . " <P> The victory of the LaRouche candidates left the Democratic Party in agitated disarray and may torpedo Stevenson 's chances . Though candidates for statewide offices in Illinois are chosen individually , the Governor and Lieutenant Governor must run in tandem in November . Stevenson is considering forming a third party , a complicated maneuver that would require renouncing his Democratic nomination and organizing a slate of candidates for nine offices . But many Illinois Democrats , including U.S. Senator Alan Dixon , regard that as imprudent . Dixon urged Stevenson to run as a Democrat and promise to eliminate the Lieutenant Governor 's office if elected . <P> After his victory , Fairchild , 28 , an earnest-looking electrical engineer who won the Lieutenant Governor 's spot , attributed the upset to " anger on the part of the public at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , he would like to reach some kind of agreement with Stevenson . Hart , 31 , the new Democratic nominee for secretary of state , was less gracious . A dark , alarmingly intense woman who has been a LaRouche disciple since she was 17 , she spoke at her victory press conference in the flat tones of a military commander : " We will roll our tanks down State Street , and make sure every citizen is armed , with reason and beauty . We will hang traitors and hang people who are responsible for feeding our children drugs . . . " There was more : " He ( LaRouche ) will put the fear of God in people like Henry Kissinger and the State Department , the biggest hotbed of treason in this nation since Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton . " <P> The bizarre outcome was skewed , in part , by the Chicago races , where Mayor Harold Washington campaigned against the regular Democratic ticket ( see box ) . In the statewide contests , regular Democrats were too cocky ; Stevenson did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like everyone else , that they would be ushered in on his coattails.
