At first nobody noticed how much had disappeared because heists in high places occur without ski masks or guns . But now the House Banking Committee , the thousands of duped bondholders and the public have caught on : to the empty vault at California 's Lincoln Savings and Loan , to the perfidy of its owner Charles Keating and to the complicity of the Government . Says Banking Committee member Jim Leach of Iowa : " Keating is at fault because he is a bank robber , but we in Washington made it , in part , a legal bank robbery . " <P> Keating , the Phoenix businessman who is accused of using Lincoln as a private casino , is emblematic of the nation 's $300 billion-plus S &; L disaster . But he has no dearth of accomplices . There are the so-called Keating Five  --  Senators Dennis DeConcini and John McCain of Arizona , John Glenn of Ohio , Donald Riegle of Michigan and Alan Cranston of California  --  who received $1.3 million in contributions from Keating and went to bat for him against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week when the Senate ethics committee appointed outside counsel to investigate . The FBI also expanded its Keating probe to include questions about the Senators ' involvement . <P> Riegle , meanwhile , had to confess to several meetings with Keating that he forgot to tell the Senate ethics committee about until it came out in congressional testimony .

Gray , a onetime captive of the savings and loan industry , lost his job when he began to speak out about the extent of the S &; L fraud . <P> In 1988 Wall removed the Lincoln investigation from the bank board 's San Francisco office to Washington , postponing the closing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add $1.3 billion to the taxpayers ' cost of repaying depositors and unloading Lincoln 's washed-out investments . " My responsibility was to see that this was not a lynch mob after Keating , " Wall explained to TIME last week . " The San Francisco office has a history of being hysterical , overzealous , swept away by smoke where there is no gun . " Yet ; Wall 's Washington audit eventually confirmed San Francisco 's warning to the Senators that Lincoln was a " ticking time bomb . " Wall 's auditors discovered a whole ticking arsenal , in fact , but not for two long years . <P> Unlike the Senators who seek campaign contributions from the likes of Keating , Wall had nothing to gain but the continued esteem of the thrift industry for his consistently low estimates of the extent of the savings and loan debacle . He is a stolid former city planner from Salt Lake City whose only extravagance seems to be his natty suits and monogrammed shirts .
