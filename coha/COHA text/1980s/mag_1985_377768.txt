On Monday , if we are to believe his manager 's estimate , he gave 18 interviews , mostly to reporters who did not forget to bring , along with their tape recorders , that other essential of the up-to-date journalist 's trade , a checkbook . Then he flew off to Monte Carlo to visit his money , for after all a tax shelter can spring a leak if your attention is too long diverted . <P> By Friday he was back in Leimen , the small West German town ( pop . 17,000 ) where he is the biggest thing to happen since they opened the cement factory . The good burghers turned out 8,000 strong for a motorcade . There was a cannon salute and a trumpet fanfare , and then a town-hall reception . Everything was golden : the commemorative ring and the specially processed album by the Deep Purple rock group that he received , the distinguished-visitors book he signed . Down the street , at the Helmut Weber bakery , which displays in its windows the scuffed shoes and muddy togs he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped up thousands of " Bobele " pretzels . They are B-shaped , and their name is an acronym standing for Boris Becker of Leimen . He does not receive any royalty on their sales . Not yet , anyway . <P> But who can say what the future holds for Becker ? No question about it , he is an authentic phenomenon on at least three indisputable counts . He is , at 17 , the youngest man ever to win Wimbledon , which may be media frazzled but is still by irrational common consent the world 's premier tennis tournament . He is also the first unseeded player to do so and the first from Germany . Other unheralded players have used this great stage to announce their arrival at the threshold of greatness ( Bjorn Borg , who reached the quarter finals in 1973 at 17 ; John McEnroe , who gained the semis at 18 in 1977 ) . On the other hand , think of Chris Lewis , who made it to the finals in 1983 , and last year 's quarterfinalist Paul Annacone and semifinalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glory into a permanent condition . <P> Will the Baby Boomer 's Monte Carlo stash someday rival the $60 million Borg is alleged to have there , or will he become just another tennis courtier , serving ( and volleying to ) its true monarchs ? The problem of predicting arises from the ambiguities inherent in any Wimbledon victory and from the mysteries inherent in reading any adolescent 's psyche . Since the U.S. Open ceased using grass , and since the major players pretty much abandoned the Australian Open , the computer rankings on which Wimbledon 's seedings are based do not have adequate input regarding abilities on what is now the exotic tennis surface . That is why , in recent years , many of the top seeds leave the tournament suddenly and why one or two strong-serving kids , whose hot spell comes upon them here rather than in darkest Stuttgart , find themselves on Centre Court and on international TV . Indeed , the tournament 's size favors heedless youth . In a draw containing 128 players , the eventual victor must win seven matches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played on ill-kempt outer courts , some of which are bound to be interrupted by rain or darkness . The physically tireless have the edge in these circumstances . And so do those who can avoid dank brooding on fate 's fickleness .
