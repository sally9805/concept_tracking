A time for fun , diversion and a few tears <P> Escapist entertainment is what 's doing the business-whatever gets your mind off the Ayatullah . " In that brief capsule , Marvin Goldman , chairman of the National Association of Theater Owners , has summed up the mood of the country . During the Christmas and New Year 's holidays , always the movies ' biggest weeks , Americans went to the flicks primarily for one purpose : fun and diversion . Those films that offered some of both either did well , or even better . Those that did not quickly became the ghosts of Christmas present . <P> The biggest bomb was Steven Spielberg 's World War II farce , 1941 , which cost Universal Pictures nearly $40 million , including promotional costs . " It was overdone , overproduced , overeverything , " says Goldman . " It was like building a $1 million mousetrap to catch one mouse in the kitchen . " Universal 's president , Sidney Scheinberg , argues that " it 's too early to say " how the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who co-financed the film , will lose any money . Yet movie analysts reckon that the film may have to gross as much as $100 million before the studios can recoup their investment . So far , 1941 has done only $15 million and is fading fast . <P> The season 's two science-fiction pictures , Star Trek and The Black Hole , have been disappointments , but only by comparison with the inflated expectations of their backers . Star Trek opened first , 2% weeks before Christmas , when there were no other films being launched . " The first week it was outlandish , " says Don Baker , vice president of advertising and promotion for Loews Theaters in New York . " It seemed as though almost all of the millions of U.S. trekkies were trying to get in at once . The problem was that this made the second week look bad . " <P> In fact , the second week witnessed a 38% drop in receipts , but miraculously , the third week saw a 30% gain over the sagging second and the fourth a 26% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Trek brought in a total of $53 million . By ordinary standards , it is a blockbuster . But it went far over budget , finally costing Paramount Pictures more than $50 million to produce and promote ; thus the film will have to gross between $75 million and $100 million before the studio makes its money back . <P> The Black Hole 's budget was a comparatively modest $19 million , but it is still the most expensive film that the Walt Disney studios has made . So far , after ten days , the movie has made a promising but by no means spectacular $16.5 million . Disney is disappointed that the film is not doing more matinee business ; grownups , who tend to go to evening shows , outnumber kids at the box office 7 to l.
