No one on the set of the movie " Tex " could believe that the guy playing the 18-year-old big brother was a 31-year-old actor who ' d given up a newspaper career to follow his dream . But that was Jim Metzler . " I thought doing ' Tex ' was a step down , " said Metzler . " I didn ' t think it would do much for my career . " After all , Metzler had just finished " Four Friends " with director Arthur Penn , no less , who had directed " Bonnie and Clyde , " " Little Big Man " and " The Miracle Worker . " Metzler was sure his first screen role as the boy who goes to Vietnam in " Four Friends " would catapult him into the rarified air of stardom . But " Four Friends " fell with a thud . And " Tex " brought unexpected accolades to the struggling actor who played Mason with such solicitous strength . Maybe he wasn ' t 18 years old , the critics said . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more seriously . " Metzler , speaking by phone from Mexico city , is glad he made the decision to give up journalism . He still sounds like a reporter . " It ' s very strange the way some areas are devastated by the earthquake , " he said , " and the first couple of nights here I was pretty edgy as I watched the hotel develop hairline cracks . And we filmed in an old house yesterday that was intact , and on either side it was just rubble . " Metzler is there filming " On Wings of Eagles " with Burt Lancaster , a difficult assignment because he has to be away from his wife and 3 1/2-month- old baby . But Metzler is used to location shooting . He costars in both " North and South " and its sequel , " Love and War . " " I play the twit of the year , James Huntoon , " Metzler said . " He ' s so naive . The audience knows his wife is the tramp of the century , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she won ' t consummate our marriage on our wedding night , I say , ' Well , OK by me . ' " Though Metzler has a fresh , boyish aura about him , naive he ' s not . A college baseball star , he pitched for two years in the Boston Red Sox farm system . After his release , he tried his talents as a journalist in his home town of Newburgh , N.Y. " I was working for a small town newspaper and had trouble with high school sports . I really had a hard time . . . . The job was to glorify the high school athletes , and I had a hard time with that , primarily because I don ' t think it ' s good for the kids that much . " An athlete has such a hard time making decisions because all the decisions are made for you . And you also have a built-in social status that is exalted by the fact that you ' re getting all this glorification by everyone . It makes it very difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t really prepare you for life . " He does admit , though , that it was " masochistic " to go from baseball to acting . Dumping journalism was even worse . " I was in a career I could not do for the rest of my life and I was also engaged to be married . And I realized that I was not really in love with her . It was the hardest decision I ever made in my life , but I also think it was the best one . I tried to run away from it . I hopped into my Pinto and drove across country , then drove back to Florida where my folks lived . " Metzler started his " restaurant career " as a bus boy at the Breakers in Palm Beach . He worked his way up to waiting tables . But he was never really suited to that . Metzler thinks that talent is important , but the ability to handle rejection is even more crucial to an actor . " There are too many good actors who get turned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they don ' t double- and triple-cast things , so there are disappointments . " He said the important thing to realize is that there is another life besides acting . " I have a wonderful marriage and now a child . You have to put things in perspective . You realize that things will open up and you will work again . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Jim Metzler : Boyish but not naive . Illustration PHOTO <>
