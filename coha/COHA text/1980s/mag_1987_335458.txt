Athol Fugard 's great gift as a playwright has been an almost journalistic evocation of the distorting impact of apartheid on blacks and whites in his native South Africa , coupled with a lyric ability to lift those observations to the level of metaphor . It is not enough for an artist to be right-minded on even the most potent political issues of his day . To earn a lasting place in literature , to rank with Ibsen or Shaw or Brecht , he must also demonstrate subtlety of craft , power of language and insight into character  --  and probably must reach beyond his immediate context into other realms of the real world or imagination . Significantly , after the autobiographical catharsis of ' Master Harold ' . . . and the Boys ( 1982 ) , which reflected his formative bond as a white youth with a black father figure , Fugard has moved into brave new territory . <P> His most recent works , A Place with the Pigs , which debuted at the Yale Repertory Theater in April , and The Road to Mecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.A. in Charleston , S.C. , last week , have no black characters and concern wholly different kinds of repression and liberation . Pigs , about a Soviet World War II deserter , as yet amounts to an unfinished work . Road , if not as poignant or politically apt as Master Harold , is Fugard 's wisest , most balanced and most nearly universal play . <P> Outwardly , Road is an issue melodrama about an old woman no longer able to take care of herself . To the outrage of a visiting younger friend , her pastor wants to move her into an old-age home  --  and , not incidentally , thereby make her give up the backyard Mecca of Magi , camels , owls and other mystical sculptures she has built from cement , rusting wire , ground-up glass bottles and found objects . Her house is a shrine to her , an eyesore to neighbors , a mark of witchcraft to children and an affront both personal and theological to the pastor and his church . <P> Underlying the soap opera is an essay on the seductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free thinkers inescapably disquiet the people around them . When the pastor speaks of faith , he means order , moral certitude , freedom from doubt . To him there is no deeper satisfaction than to be regarded as normal . His attitude echoes the values of a police state ; when Road opened at Yale in 1984 , then more effectively at Britain 's National Theater in 1985 , the pastor seemed a humbug , professing affection for an old friend while ruthlessly trying to have his way . In Charleston , Fugard directed and also played the pastor . He found great sympathy in the man and showed compassion for the common throng 's yearning  --  in this or any society  --  for ritual pieties as an alternative to reason .
