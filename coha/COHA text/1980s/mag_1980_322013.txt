The living room of Prime Minister-designate Robert Mugabe 's new home in suburban Salisbury is filled with the furnishings of its former owner , a white businessman . A nondrinker , Mugabe is oblivious to his surroundings , which incongruously include a massive cocktail bar . Instead , his attention is consumed with his dream for a socialist Zimbabwe . In the only interview he has given to an American publication since his election , Mugabe discussed his plans for the future of his country with TIME Johannesburg Bureau Chief William Me Whirter . The meeting was interrupted just once , when a diplomatic emissary entered the room to deliver a personal letter from President Carter . Excerpts from the interview : <P> On socialism : We are socialist . We will espouse socialist principles , but our principles must take cognizance of the realities of our country-the history , traditions and particular circumstances in which we find ourselves . The country is based on free enterprise and is therefore capitalistic . We have to accept that we will not bring about an immediate disruption of the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our goal . In the civil service , of course , racialism will have to go . But it would be a very foolish man who would immediately take over and overthrow the system . <P> On democracy : We want people to participate in shaping their own Lives at various levels , especially in the countryside . The workers there will be established into various committees which have a management role . That 's what we envisage . I refuse to borrow political models . The principles-yes , the principles that people must finally be their own masters , share the ownership of their resources , peasants being well organized into collective units ... These are principles from the experiences of others , like China , Yugoslavia , Rumania . I do n't want regimentation . I just would n't like that I feel revulsed by dictatorship personally , whether it is done by individuals or by states . People have got to have the democratic right to make their decisions even if they do n't want to be collectivized . <P> On Marxism : There are certain principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our own traditions , communal land ownership , for example . The Marx ists believe in it , but I do n't think the Nigerians , who have nationalized their land , are Marxist in any way . <P> On the constitution : We are prepared to work under a parliamentary democracy , as accepted by us in the Lancaster House Agreement . Even though we have the power with the Patriotic Front coalition , I do n't think we would want to make any major amendments . I think we want to try the constitution as it exists and see how it works . True , we had our reservations about certain clauses , but it is only fair that we give the constitution a fair trial . <P> On martial law : Curfews must go ; they are unnecessary now . The war has come to an end . We are a country at peace . We do n't need martial law . We do n't need unnecessary poli tical arrests . Those who have been arrested must now be released . We are beginning a completely new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victimization of anybody for political reasons . We will allow as much freedom of political organization as possible . Why should n't opposition parties continue to campaign as they campaigned during the elections ?
