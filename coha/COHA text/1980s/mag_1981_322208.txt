Yamit diehards vow to remain <P> " To those who think they can hold onto Yamit , all I can say is that peace is more precious than anything in the world , and in order for there to be peace , we must honor our commitments . " <P> <P> - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak <P> Just south of Gaza on the highway to El Arish is the turnoff to Yamit . A long line of cars , full of sightseeing Israelis , is halted by a roadside stand where Israeli youngsters are handing out leaflets and soliciting signatures for a petition supporting a group called the Movement to Halt the Withdrawal . Afterward the youngsters paste bumper stickers on the cars . The slogan : DO N'T UPROOT A TREE . <P> The scene is evidence of an increasingly vocal campaign by some Israelis to stop the final phase of the government 's withdrawal from the Sinai next April , when this northern strip of the desert is scheduled to revert to Egypt under the terms of the Camp David peace accords . The focus of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a strand of sand beside the Mediterranean . Settled six years ago , Yamit even now is no bigger than a college campus . Behind a 110-ft. wire-mesh antiterrorist fence that looks incongruous in such a peaceful setting , Yamit 's residents have skillfully managed to turn their town into a blooming oasis of lush , neatly manicured gardens . Outside the community , a series of smaller farming settlements has prospered with the aid of the latest in irrigation methods and plenty of hard work . <P> Now many of Yamit 's white stucco homes and concrete apartment blocks have been deserted by those who have accepted the Israeli withdrawal as inevitable . But not everyone is going quietly . Empty buildings are occupied by squatters who have been brought in by Gush Emunim , the ultranationalist religious movement that has spearheaded the establishment of Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank . The Gush now has about 125 families settled in and around Yamit expressly to prevent the Israeli withdrawal . Just last week 25 families moved into the local motel .

They argue that international law recognizes that circumstances change , and believe that in a national referendum , which they hope will be called , Israeli voters would reject the Sinai withdrawal . <P> Fears are growing , however , that the rebellion could end in a violent confrontation between the settlers and Israeli troops . " The withdrawal should be as ugly as possible , " says Menachem Digli , a former Israeli intelligence colonel who runs a resort south of Yamit . " It should leave a deep scar in the Israeli national memory . " His reasoning : a fight would prevent future governments from making similar agreements about giving up the Golan Heights or the West Bank .               @ @ @ @ @ @
