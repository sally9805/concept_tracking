Piqued at Raisa Gorbachev 's one-woman triumph at the Reykjavik summit , Nancy Reagan was known to consider the Soviet First Lady imperious and dogmatic . Preparations for the Washington summit seemed to confirm that impression . Raisa had taken her time accepting an invitation to tea , insisting that the hour be changed . She was keeping her schedule a mystery , confounding efforts to plan ahead . So when the Soviets asked to bring five extra guests to Tuesday 's state dinner , the word quickly came back : forget it . <P> But if the East Wing of the White House was waging cold war while the West Wing celebrated a thaw , the rest of Washington found Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev dazzling . Vivacious and voluble , she beamed her strobe-light smile , melting the eye glaze of receiving lines . She asked questions and delivered on-the- spot sermons and exhortations . She cracked jokes . And , rivaling her husband , she tamed the media like the tiger handler at the Gorky Park circus : with flourishes , grins and bows to the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the onetime lecturer on Marxist-Leninist philosophy at Moscow State University . At the National Gallery , when employees gathered to applaud her , she stopped to chat , noting that she was " glad to see so many of the staff are women . " On a White House tour , she peppered Nancy Reagan with queries : Was that a 19th century chandelier ? Did Jefferson live here ? And , by the way , when was the White House built ? The First Lady , already irritated by her visitor 's magnetic gravitation toward the television cameras , was stumped . An assistant curator came to the rescue with dates : between 1792 and 1800 . " I 'm not much help , " Nancy Reagan confessed , in obvious exasperation . <P> The tour was an almost comical confrontation of the two superwives , each ; fighting to get her way with elaborate politesse . But as much as Nancy Reagan tugged at Raisa Gorbachev 's elbow , trying to steer the diminutive ( 5 ft. 3 in . ) Russian away from the cordoned-off journalists , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be meeting ordinary Americans . Her flattering reply : " Meeting you , for me , is meeting Americans . This time our visit is too short . I hope next time will be longer . " At one point she launched into a discussion of modern life : " In our age , all of us have to work . We have professional duties . We have family duties as well as social duties . A person in the 20th century is at a loss to distribute his or her time . " <P> Repeatedly , Nancy Reagan was asked about frosty relations . " I 've answered that five times , " she snapped and turned deliberately toward Raisa Gorbachev . Coolly correct , Raisa added , " Everything is all right . Mrs. Reagan gave the answer . She is the hostess , and that was her word . " Another reporter asked if Raisa would like to live in the White House . Perhaps unaware that the Reagans ' living quarters are upstairs , Raisa glanced at her opulent surroundings . " This is an official residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanly speaking , that a human being would like to live in a regular house . " Smiling , she added , " This is a museum of American history .
