Gerald Tsai , 59 , is a legendary Wall Street figure who made millions as a mutual-fund manager during the go-go ' 60s . Now the Shanghai-born whiz is chief executive of Primerica , formerly American Can , once a pillar of Smokestack America and currently a $2.9 billion financial-services conglomerate . Last week Tsai burst back onto Wall Street when Primerica announced that it had agreed to buy Smith Barney , one of the country 's best-known brokerage firms , for $750 million . <P> The acquisition caps Tsai 's efforts to transform Primerica into a financial powerhouse . Since he joined Primerica , the company has shed more than 25 businesses and acquired 15 others . In snaring Smith Barney ( 1986 revenues : about $1.1 billion ) , Tsai paid double the assessed value of the firm 's assets , which Wall Street analysts called a bargain .
