NEWS MEDIA  | It was sheer coincidence that brought 650 editors and publishers to the scene of the crime last week . Journalism 's generals had been planning to come to Washington for months ? to attend their regular reunion and gossip festival , the annual convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors ( ASNE ) . But as it turned out , there was only one topic on everybody 's mind : " Jimmy 's World , " the Pulitzer Prize-winning report on an 8-year-old heroin addict , written by Washington Post reporter Janet Cooke , that turned out to be a fake . In small clusters and large , the editors gathered to discuss what it meant ? and what effect it would have . The consensus : nothing good . " It 's a punch to the solar plexus of journalism , " said Norman E. Isaacs , a former newspaper editor , now an elder statesman of the craft , who runs an unofficial watchdog group called the National News Council . " It gives all opposed to freedom of the press the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything you read ' . " As Isaacs spoke , the fallout of the Cooke scandal was already becoming apparent . " People have thrown it up to me as if that 's what journalism is all about , " complained Houston Chronicle reporter Leslie Loddeke . Her boss , Chronicle managing editor Don Pickels , reported a particularly frustrating encounter last week : lunch with an attorney friend who kept insisting , " You make things up all the time . " That sort of thing hurts . There is nothing more important to journalists and journalism than credibility ? and even before " Jimmy 's World " was exposed as a hoax , the public had reservations about how much the news media could be trusted . The Cooke affair undoubtedly deepened those reservations . According to a NEwsWEEK Poll taken last week , fully a third of those who know about the scandal reject the view that it was an isolated incident , believing instead that reporters often make things up ( chart ) . Most of those interviewed give television news pro- grams , news magazines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias , but more than 60 per cent say they believe " only some " or " very little " of what they read in the press and hear on television . Some editors at the ASNE convention last week assailed the Post for exposing their business to ridicule , arguing that if Post editors had been less interested in sensational stories and prestigious prizes ? and more concerned with basic journalistic standards ? Cooke 's fabrications would have been detected long before they appeared in print . " Editors did n't do the job they should have , " said Los Angeles Times editorial-page editor Anthony Day . Post executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee conceded , as he had all along , that he and his colleagues were far from blameless , but he insisted that there was a limit to what editors could do to protect themselves from dishonest reporters . " You can not make a rule that is going to . . . save you from a pathological liar , " he said . Standards : For the most part , few in the business were willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this and more ca n't happen at your shops , you 're crazy , " Isaacs told the convention . Some editors maintained privately that their safeguards were foolproof , but most agreed with Isaacs . Indeed , within hours after the Pulitzer hoax exploded a fortnight ago , editors had begun to discuss how their own hiring policies should be reviewed and newsroom procedures tightened . At the New York Daily News , editor Michael J. O'Neill immediately called fifteen of his editors together to reiterate the paper 's policies on the use of unidentified sources and quotes . Los Angeles Times executives considered a proposal to start checking every employee 's educational references . At The Boston Globe , assistant managing editor Alan Richman called for a staff meeting to discuss establishing journalistic standards for the paper . To date , he said , " it 's been all seat-of-the-pants , individualized within a department . " And It The Washington Post itself , there was also talk about setting new rules ? but only after the furor dies down . " We 've decided ... not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like this , " said metropolitan editor Bob Woodward . Debating the rules of the game is nothing new for journalists . Journalism is n't a profession like law or medicine with ancient precepts set down in stone and panels of venerable masters to decide who should be admitted to the practice . In fact , journalism probably is n't a profession at all , but rather a craft that involves what Walter Lippmann once defined as " an incredible @# a'I NEWSWEEK/MAY 4 , 1981  | medley of fact , propaganda , rumor , suspicion , clues , hopes and fears . " Most reporters and editors take themselves quite seriously today , but it was not so long ago that the raffish irresponsibility epitomized by " The Front Page " was far more the rule than the meticulous double-checking glamorized more recently in the film " All the President 's Men . " Though there have always been serious American newspapers and magazines committed to accurate , responsible reporting , U.S. journalism as a whole did n't really start to get respectable until the 1940s and 1950s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at the same time , news organizations and news people began to think of themselves as public servants of a sort . Guardians of Truth : In Vietnam , journalists found themselves challenging their own government 's statements ? and Watergate became an all-out adversary story . The Washington Post 's tenacity in the Water- ' gate chase at first embarrassed , then inspired the rest of the news media . When the dust finally settled , journalists began to see themselves as heroes ? guardians of truth and morality in a corrupt society . But the new glamour had its price in public misgivings : if journalists were powerful enough to bring down a President , how could they be held to strict standards of truth , fairness and accountability ? It has n't been an easy role to play . Many journalists like to think they serve a profession , but none would pretend it is a science ; as often as not , getting things right is a matter of circumstance . The spectrum of things that can go wrong at even the most determinedly responsible news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair ) to honest misinterpretation . Perhaps the Post should have subjected " Jimmy 's World " to more intense scrutiny ; but how were the editors of The San Francisco Examiner to know that the experienced reporter they sent to China in 1972 never got beyond Hong Kong ? They ran a five-part series describing his totally fabricated travels before they were tipped off to the truth . Similarly , Clifford Irving hoodwinked both McGraw-Hill and Life magazine with his fake biography of Howard Hughes in 1972 . Journalists rarely make up stories . But occasionally they do embroider the truth to make a story sound better ? sometimes to further their careers , sometimes to tell the " real " story . When this happens even the best can get caught out . In 1964 , for example , a New York Times reporter wrote a front-page story about a paramilitary gang in Harlem : a 400-member group called the " Blood Brothers " said to be preparing to invade white neighborhoods . At the time , the story was denounced in Harlem and elsewhere as a vast exaggeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but last week Times spokesman Leonard Harris admitted that the story was " hyperbole to a high degree . " Hyperbole has always been part of journalism ; it is still tacitly accepted , to greater or less degree , in columnists ' yarns and on the sports and gossip pages . And in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s , it became almost respectable among some serious journalists as " the new journalism " ? using doctored or fabricated quotes , incidents that did n't quite happen but might have , and characters who were composites of real people . All this was justified in the name of a higher truth : the real situation , the " new journalists " argued , stood out in bolder relief if inconvenient facts could be ignored . After a few excesses were given wide exposure , such practices lost respectability long before Janet Cooke created " Jimmy . " Most errors have far more to do with ordinary human fallibility than with premeditated duplicity . Accuracy is not the journalist 's only priority ; speed counts nearly as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaos surrounding the release of the American hostages from Iran , a NEWSWEEK correspondent in Wiesbaden filed a report that quoted Elizabeth Ann Swift as accusing her Iranian captors of " torture . " In his haste to get the file off , the correspondent failed to specify that he had seen the quote in a West German newspaper that he regarded as reliable . Swift later denied having said anything about torture , and NEWSWEEK apologized in print the following week . Similarly , in the confusion following the attempted assassination of President Reagan last month , all three TV networks broadcast erroneous reports that White House press secretary James Brady had died of his wounds . And just last week , in the scramble to find a woman named Shirley McGill who was said to know the killer of at least six black children in Atlanta , The Miami Herald mounted an investigation that led to a 26-year-old drug addict and prostitute . A few hours after the paper published a detailed account of her checkered past , it discovered to its horror that it had the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive fires . After Washington Gov . Dixy Lee Ray was defeated last year , the Portland Oregonian got her promise of an interview and advertised it in advance . Veteran reporter Wayne Thompson conducted the interview , but then was appalled to find that his tape recorder had malfunctioned . Without telling his editors , he tried to reconstruct the talk ? and the Oregonian lost considerable face and credibility when the governor complained that it was fabricated . When caught in a major error , news media until recently have tended to bury their retractions ? perhaps in the instinctive belief that the pretense of infallibility would enhance credibility . But in recent years a few newspapers have appointed ombudsmen to deal with complaints . The Washington Post is one of them , and ombudsman NEWSWEEK/MAY 4 , 1981 51  | Bill Green 's 18,000-word inquiry into the Cooke hoax was credited by many editors at the ASNE meeting with clearing the air and helping to repair the damage . The myriad chances for error say less about the inadequacies of journalists than about the nature of journalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely pure , and never simple . " Just giving the facts involves choosing which facts to give ; quoting a source involves an assessment of how knowledgeable and truthful he may be . In making that judgment , journalists have increasingly been willing to withhold a source 's name in exchange for a candid view . In former years , anonymous sources and " blind " quotes were the exception . But as journalism has become more probing and institutions have grown sensitive to embarrassment , people who speak out with anything other than officially approved statements may find themselves punished as whistleblowers . In withholding their identity , a reporter makes another bargain with his readers : they get the inside dope , but they must trust his judgment and integrity in picking a source and weighing the source 's stake in the story . Watergate was something of a watershed for anonymity in journalism . Nurturing a network of anonymous sources , but always double- and triple-checking everything they said , the Post 's Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were able to uncover the biggest political scandal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story that raised questions about someone 's conduct or integrity , you had to have something more than anonymous sources , " says Jack Nelson , The Los Angeles Times 's Washington bureau chief . " After Watergate , some people decided they could just go with anonymous sources . " Pie-eating Contests : Most journalists agree that some important stories would be impossible to do if reporters were forbidden to rely on anonymous sources . " You should n't allow reporters to say Congressman X is an idiot on the basis of an anonymous source , " says Newsday 's Washington bureau chief , Anthony Marro . " But if you go to the other extreme and can only print quotes where you can identify people , then we 're all going to be covering pie-eating contests . " Still , there seems little question that anonymous sourcing has gotten out of hand . " Particularly in Washington , reporters let people talk on background without pressing them to talk on the record , " says The New York Times 's Nicholas Horrock . Some journalists abuse the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official . Worse , some have come to believe that anyone who is willing to be quoted by name can not possibly have anything interesting to say . " For years , everybody believed that if you could name your source you had a harder and more reliable story , " says Associated Press reporter Michael J. Sniffen . " But there are some reporters who stand that principle on its head . They think they have a better story if it comes from an unnamed source . " Strictly speaking , the Cooke hoax was a fabricated story ; it touched on anonymous sources only in her editors ' belief in her statement that she had promised confidentiality . But the editors in turn were so convinced of the journalistic imperative to tell the story that they paid remarkably little attention to its human implications : by her own account , Cooke had witnessed an 8-year-old boy being injected with heroin . " There 's something more important than a story here , " protests Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mike Royko . " This 8-year-old kid is being murdered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kid . Who do they think they are , God ? People in any other profession would have gone right to the police . " Watergate had yet another profound impact on journalism that may have helped @# NEW'WEEK/MAY 4 , 1981 53  | to lay the groundwork for Cooke 's hoax . It made celebrities of journalists . With Robert Redford playing Woodward and Dustin Hoffman portraying Bernstein , reporters could n't help but seem glamorous . At the same time , it seemed to redefine the journalist 's role in life : no longer a passive observer , he was now an active participant ? a powerful force in society who could uncover corruption and bring down a government . " The journalism I went into in the mid-1950s was a sort of dark corridor where only screw-ups went , " says former New York Times reporter David Halberstam . " Now we have a hot profession that attracts people viscerally interested in exercising power . Reporters are not that interested in issues , but in becoming stars . " The result has been awesome competitiveness in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To many young reporters , it seems as if there is only one way to break out of the pack : to hit , as Los Angeles Times media critic David Shaw puts it , " a grand-slam home run . " That 's what Janet Cooke was looking for ? and , indeed , immediately after " Jimmy 's World " appeared in the Post she was promoted from one of the paper 's weekly community supplements to the far more prestigious metro staff . Malady : What seemed to worry some editors at the ASNE convention last week was the extent to which the Cooke scandal reflected a general malady afflicting the news business ? one that New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis diagnosed as " hubris . " " So often in any one profession ? be it government , law , medicine or journalism ? there is a feeling that we have some particular mandate , that we are doing something very important , " says Harvard philosopher Sissela Bok . " And because we are doing something unusually important , maybe it 's more right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cooke affair reminds journalists of their obligations , it will more than have made up for the embarrassment it caused them . But journalists are n't the only ones who need to rethink their attitudes about the role of the news media . " One of the most interesting things about the Janet Cooke affair , " says director Jonathan Moore of Harvard 's Institute of Politics , " is the reaction of astonishment ' as if the media were different and the people working in it did n't misbehave . . . . Presumably , the press is a community of human beings . An assumption of purity is unrealistic for the press to assume about itself and unfair for others to assume about it . " The American media may well be the most accurate and unbiased in the world ; but journalists are not acolytes at the altar of truth . They are fallible human beings , and the greater the skepticism with which the public regards them , the better off both press and public will be .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
