Since he was first elected mayor of New York City in 1977 , Edward I. Koch has emerged as a supremely confident entertainer who has fine-tuned his media image into one of the country 's most powerful political weapons . Wisecracking , noisy and energetic , Koch has not merely run the city but has also written two memoirs about its often byzantine politics , with himself as the hero . Cramming his days with television appointments and public ceremonies , the three-term mayor had a standard greeting : " How 'm I doin ' ? " Until recently the answer was usually " Not bad , Ed . " <P> But now the critics are raising their voices . Among them is the mayor 's least likely detractor : himself . After a flood of revelations about corruption in New York City government , the feisty Koch came forth last week with an uncharacteristic mea culpa . Said he : " I am embarrassed . I am chagrined . I am absolutely mortified that this kind of corruption could have existed and that I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly dramatic fashion : in early January , Donald Manes , the mayor 's close political ally and president of the borough of Queens ( one of New York City 's five administrative units ) , was pulled from his car , bleeding and near death from knife cuts to the wrist and ankle ; Manes eventually admitted that the wounds were self-inflicted . Soon after , Manes ' associate , Geoffrey Lindenauer , a former official in the city 's parking- violations bureau , was accused of extorting $410,000 in cash , trips and theater seats from agencies that had been granted plump city contracts to collect unpaid parking-ticket fines . Queens Attorney Michael Dowd , a collection-agency owner , is reported to have told federal prosecutors that it was Manes who ordered him to pay bribes to Lindenauer to safeguard a lucrative city contract that had netted his firm some $2 million . <P> Last week Lindenauer was also charged with making " false representations " to gain a $22.7 million parking-bureau computer contract for Citisource , a company partly owned by Stanley Friedman , the Bronx Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breaking , Lindenauer 's supervisor , Transportation Commissioner Anthony Ameruso , resigned , as did the director of investigations , the city 's anticorruption chief . As many as eight separate city , state and federal investigations are looking into allegations of corruption within various city agencies . " My administration , " Koch admitted ruefully , " lost the distance and the controls I had to maintain in order to avoid the undue influence of party leaders on the workings of government . " <P> The scandals surrounding Koch have not sullied his own clean-as-a-whistle reputation . But the mayor 's exuberant self-assurance , an essential part of his leadership style , has been undermined . The mayor is now apparently trying to revive his old take-charge image after weeks of untypical faltering . " You do not allow the problem to overwhelm you , " Koch says . " You have to overwhelm the problem . " <P> Trying to do just that , the mayor proposed a series of reforms , including a panel to monitor appointments . He also plans to forbid officers of political parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Garth , a longtime Koch adviser : " When the mayor really wants to put his shoulder to the wheel , he is very tough . " But the critics are still out on whether Koch can stage a comeback .
