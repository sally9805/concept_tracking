 | Ronald Reagan appealed to the nation again last week in behalf of his economic program ? but this time , his avuncular delivery seemed at odds with the pressures that had brought him before his national television audience . Buffeted by disbelieving financial markets and an increasingly combative Congress , the President outlined a second wave of $13 billion in spending cuts aimed at containing an outsize budget deficit in the next fiscal year and reassuring the skeptics that Reaganomics could work . But it was a measure of his growing political difficulties that Reagan was forced to abandon his plan for revamping the social-security system ? and even with that , both Democrats and Republicans in Congress were almost certain to strip the ribbons from his new package and refill it according to their own design . On Capitol Hill , GOP leaders publicly applauded the President 's resolve to take a second bite out of the budget . But privately , Republicans acknowledged that they would be forced to slice more from the Pentagon budget than the $2 billion Reagan had proposed for fiscal 1982 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's new deficit target of $43.1 billion seemed problematic . The Democrats were lying in wait , plainly eager to capitalize on Reagan 's new attack on entitlements and quick to underscore their improving fortunes . House Speaker Thomas P. ( Tip ) O'Neill set the tone by trumpeting the Presidential skinback on social security , and Senate Demo- cratic leaders ? having ceremoniously nibbled minuscule hamburgers , French fries and ketchup-as-a-vegetable earlier in the week ? later celebrated an Administration about-face on reducing the nutritional requirements for school lunches . Wall Street , meanwhile , continued to vote no on the Presidential program . The day after Reagan 's speech , bond prices plunged and the Dow Jones industrial aver- age of 30 stocks fell more than 11 points to its lowest level since May 1980 . Reagan was also losing ground on Main Street . A NEWSWEEK Poll , taken before his speech , showed that the President 's job-approval rating had dropped 9 points , to 51 percent , in one month . The White House heralded the speech as the opening round in Reagan 's secondphase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Presidential resolve . " He did n't want to slip into the Jimmy @# Carter syndrome ' on defense spending Carter syndrome , " an aide explained of Reagan 's refusal to reverse himself on defense spending . But even the President did not expect to win an unconditional victory on the Hill . Although Reagan called for a " difficult and painful " crusade , aides passed the word that the Chief was " not in a confrontational mood " and would settle for a negotiated package of cuts he could call " a manageable victory . " The one wholly new element in Reagan 's legislative package was a so-called " revenue enhancement " program aimed at raising $22 billion over the next three years . It called for a variety of tough-minded measures to close tax loopholes , collect delinquent student loans and impose " user fees " for Federal services to yachtsmen , barge owners and commercial and private aircraft . His proposals for cutting the budget : Domestic spending . Reagan proposed a potpourri of reductions in domestic spending of which the most spectacular single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Education ? will result in only minimal savings even if Congress goes along . He also announced that the government 's civilian work force will be cut back by 75,000 jobs by 1984 , and he called for an additional 12 percent rollback in government " discretionary spending " to save $8.4 billion in ' 82 and a total of $17.5 billion by 1984 . The 12 percent target , said budget director David Stockman , was only an average ? and with a number of pet pro- grams now on the block for far deeper cuts , the prospects in Congress were doubtful . Entitlementprograms.This $2.6 billion package of reductions seemed likely to open at least a few holes in the Administration 's " social safety net . " Stockman said there will be " a whole variety of changes " in welfare , food stamps , the school-lunch program , student-loan programs , Medicaid and Federal retirement programs . By streamlining current benefit formulas , he said , the Administration hopes to save $2.6 billion in ' 82 , $10 billion in 1983 and another $15 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to relatively prosperous families who now benefit from vague or poorly drawn eligibility rules , but Democrats took a different view . The President , said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , was trying to " afflict the afflicted in order to comfort the comfortable . " Loan-guarantee programs . In proposing a $20 billion cutback in Federal-loanguarantee programs , Reagan announced his intention to restrict government 's " offbudget " borrowing by agencies such as the Federal Financing Bank . The loans , mostly to farmers and other government agencies , draw directly on the commercial money markets and tend to reduce credit available to private industry . Defense spending . One way previous administrations financed their " social experiments , " Reagan told the nation , was to reduce expenditures for national defense . Now , he said , " we have no choice " but to commit more than $1 trillion to catch up with the Soviet Union . Reagan 's cuts in the Pentagon budget ? $2 billion in 1982 , $11 billion more by 1984 ? were only token amounts , and his aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain his mammoth arms buildup , even though some of them believe he is wasting political capital in the process . Reagan hoped to shift the political focus to the life-or-death issues of strategic security and to big-ticket weapons programs ? like the MX missile and a new B-1 manned bomber ? that the Administration was expected to unveil this week . Even so , Reagan 's defense plans seemed headed for critical scrutiny on Capitol Hill . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger encountered skeptical bipartisan questioning before a House appropriations subcommittee last week , and Democrats said it was probable that the subcommittee would simply scrap funding for a new manned bomber . " The feeling is unanimous , " said one staffer , " that the B-1 would only siphon off money " from the planned stealth bomber , a radar-evading plane still in the research stage . Meanwhile , Senate Finance Committee chairman Robert Dole of Kansas predicted that Reagan 's proposed cut for fiscal ' 82 probably would be doubled in the chamber controlled by the GOP ? and in the House , " gypsy moth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . The danger , said one GOP aide , was that the Reagan defense budget for 1982 would be cut below the one proposed by Jimmy Carter ; House Republican loyalists hoped to limit the surgery to $3.8 billion . Demagoguery ' : Social security was even knottier . House Minority Leader Robert Michel and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker had told Reagan that his plan to reduce social-security spending was hurting the GOP ? and his Presidency . Finally , Michel and Baker , backstopped by a blunt letter from GOP Rep. Barber Conable of New York , prevailed on Reagan , never a fan of the program , to change course . In what was plainly the most heartfelt passage of his television address , the President complained of " misinformation " and " pure demagoguery " about his proposals to cut benefits for early retirees and to delay costof-living increases ? then abandoned them both . He gave his support to interfund borrowing , the Democrats ' stopgap remedy for @#  | the hemorrhaging main retirement fund , and his blessing to the restoration of the $122-a-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be excluded . He also appealed to O'Neill to help " remove social security ... from politics " by creating a bipartisan commission to make proposals for the system 's reform . But Reagan 's proposed commission would be made up of fifteen members ? five appointed by Baker , five by O'Neill and five by the President himself . With that arithmetic on the table , the bipartisan mood fizzled abruptly the next morning when O'Neill bluntly suggested that Reagan 's compromise on social security was based on " hard , plain politics " rather than " the sympathy of his heart . " Pyrrhic Victory ' : The squabbling in the House seemed an omen of bitterly partisan debate to come ? and even in the Senate , where the GOP holds a majority , Reagan faced a wave of jittery disbelief . Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici , summing up the prospects of a balanced budget by 1984 , told his Republican colleagues that the combined fiscal impact of the Reagan tax cuts and a sour economy " wo n't let us get there from here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's tax reductions ? but one Republican staffer said the President 's triumph last July now seemed " more and more like a horribly Pyrrhic victory . " Against that backdrop the White House could only hope , as Reagan assured thr ! . nation , that " our plan for recovery is sound , and it will work . " Given the doubts on Wall Street and in Congress , the unspoken corollary was that it had to work quickly as well . @# 26
