I wer jus going to say les Eas roun by Monkeys Whoar Town and Norf up a long the Nellys Bum when I had like a mynd flash of colourt lites with clicking and bleaping it wernt like nothing I ever acturely seen nor heard only in dreams . I cud like feal the woal circel of the dead towns in me and see a line of grean lite sweaping roun that circel from the senter . Lissener said , What is it ? ' I said , What dyou mean ?

Which I wer beartht at Crippel the Farn near Fork Stoan and the sea is all ways somers in my mynd no matter where I am . I said , I wunt want to be out this nite . ' Then I had to larf and shake my head calling to memberment Durster Potter and how he said them same words that rainy nite after the Eusa show which it seamt so long pas yet it wernt no moren 3 niter back . Now I wer wel gone out in to that rainy dark he dint want to be in and where wer he ?

' We gone a head on the qwyet slow and easy nor no lert from the dogs no soun only the hisper of the rain . We wer farther in nor ever I ben when I ben littl we kep on thru heavy rubbl til we come in unner some thing and out of the rain . Cudnt see nothing at all in there . Gone a littl farther and come to big steps going down and warm air coming up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ben here befor ? ' Becaws he wer moving like a dog on hot foller . He said , No but weare coming strong on some thing . Be ready to move qwick . ' He neadntve tol me that I wer ready for any thing and wivvering all over with it . That place wer a Power place you cud feal it all roun you . Smel the Power even with the dog pong . Breave it in to your arms and legs . I cud feal a terning and a rushing in it so strong and Lissener the same . Lissening to our foot steps eckoing in that ringing dark . We seen a feabl shaky glimmer like from a far off candl it wer jus a nuff so we cud see the edges of the steps . Slow and easy slow and easy . From there on it wer only the black leader and his 2 nexters with us the others ternt roun I gent they wer poasting ther selfs back at the top of the steps I fealt sorry for any body coming that way on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nt give us warning of no lookouts yet . Lissener said , The out poasts do nt keap sharp they do nt think no is ever coming in on them . ' From there on it wer mosly cavit in rubbl we had to sqweaze thru then it opent up big you cudve lissent the diffrents even without looking . The lite wer coming from behynt some girt mouns of rubbl unner where the over head ben barmt out . It cudntve ben no moren a cuppl of candls or lanterns jus a feabl glimmer and the jynt shadders wivvering on the stanning walls and broakin stoans and rubbl and what ever over head wer lef . The jynt shadders wer from girt machines o they wer guvner big things and crouching allp100broakin but not dead they cudnt dy there wer too much Power in them . Where we wer stanning you cud hear the sea beyont us in the dark . Breaving and sying breaving and sying it wer like them machines wer breaving and sying in ther sleap . Lissener hispert me , What is it ? Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Its broakin machines they ai nt moving . ' It wernt nothing like when you dig up old rottin machines out of the groun these wer in ther parper working place nor nothing rottin they wer some kynd of iron dint rot it wer all shyning all catching that shaky glimmer . Some of them ther shels ben broak open you cud see girt shyning weals like jynt mil stoans only smoov . Id all ways usit the word shyning same as any 1 else myt . The sun is shyning or the moon is shyning . Youwl see a shyning on the water or a womans hair . When you talk of the Littl Shyning Man its jus the middl word of what he s callt there ai nt no real meaning to it . Suddn when I seen the shyning of them broakin machines I begun to get some idear of the shyning of the Littl Man . Tears begun streaming down my face and my froat akit . Lissener hispert , Whats the matter ? ' I hispert back , 0 what we ben ! And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snuffling then . Me looking at them jynt machines and him lissening ther sylents . Right then I dint know where I wer with any thing becaws all on a suddn I wernt seeing any thing from where I seen it befor . Up to then I ben agenst Goodparley and I ben agenst what ever he wer for . I dint like him for his littl eyes and his big sqware teef nor I dint like all that Eusas head rubbish nor the res of it . The way he talkit of putting the Littl Shyning Man to gether and that . Now all on a suddn Eusa and Eusas head and the Littl Shyning Man be come some thing woaly diffrent in my mynd to what they ben befor . How cud any 1 not want to get that shyning Power back from time back way back ? How cud any 1 not want to be like them what had boats in the air and picters on the wind ? How cud any 1 not want to see them shyning weals terning ? All what Ive wrote jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wylst thinking it I wer scanning sharp and lisseningp101hard . Stil dint see no 1 nor nothing moving only them jynt shadders shaking and me shaking with them . Not from fear it wer as citement . Some peopl can feal ther mooning in them some cant . The moon of ther bearthing I mean . Parbly the moon of ther getting and all . Which I know I can . Some times Iwl feal the cross over in my sleap and it takes me strange . I ben got in the las thin sickel of the failing moon and I ben beartht in the Ful . When Im in my ful bearthing moon Im wide on and sharp strung . When Im coming off it to my getting moon Im reaching on and hungering for that nex Ful . That nite in that Power place in Fork Stoan I cud feal that hungry moon what I cudnt see . Feal it thin . Feal it craving . Feal the tide making for the hy I dint have to see it I knowit wer hy water coming on . Feal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nex Ful . I hispert to Lissener , O yes we done right to foller the circel here its fulling on so strong . ' He dint say nothing I sust how it wer with him some times when we wer boath lissening hy 1 of us wud starve the other like when 1 boat puts a nother in its wind shadder . Becaws I begun to know by then I wer some kynd of lissener as wel . Being with Lissener brung it out and brung it on . I wunnert how I ever cudve fealt real up to then . How I ever cudve fealt a live befor I begun to take things in like I wer now . I wantit to move I wantit to do I wantit to happen with what ever wer happening roun me . Like it says in Eusa 5 : Evere thing blippin &; bleapin &; movin in the shiftin uv thay Nos . Sum tyms bytin sum tyms bit . ' Thinking on from there . Eusa 6 : Cum to the wud in the hart uv the stoan . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wer in the wud in the hart of the stoan . Or the stoan in the hart of the wud it do nt make no odds . Youre all ways there only you do nt all ways know it . We movit roun easy for a scan behynt the rubbl where the lite wer coming from . There wer a shelter it lookit to be about a 6 peopl 1 it wer the userel thing baskit and gunge with a thatch roof . Them as bill it theyd movit rubbl so they cud put the shelter unner the hoal in the over head where itp102wer open to the sky . Big big that Power place wer you cudve stood 10 men 1 on top of the other nor they wuntve reacht the over head . The black leader wer looking the same way I wer . I movit my head and han a littl like you wud out foraging and giving some 1 the syn to move up closer . That dogd all ready be come so much like regler crowd I jus done it without thinking . No soonerd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ben foraging to gether our woal lives . Big and heavy as he wer he dint make no soun he jus slyd like a shadder getting longer til he come to the shelter then he easit to the doar way and lookit in . He lookit back tords Lissener and me with his ears up and waving his tail then he startit on beyont and looking back agen showing all clear as plain as any 1 cud . Lissener and me follert on then and the 2 nexter dogs with us . I lookit in to the shelter with a arrer on the string . 3 pairs of up and down sleapers 2 benches a tabel with 3 candls lit and a fire place with the fire going . Pots and gear but no weapons in site . I had to smyl at the candls I knowit them Fork Stoan hevvys wer afeart of coming back in to that big place in the dark . I wudve took a doss bag only I dint want to leave no foller . Follering the black leader we gone down some steps in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We come out in to the open nite and the littl girzel on our faces agen the sea wer beating loud on the stoans it wer by water right a nuff . Where we come out then it wer some where a long the snug I think it wer jus inshoar of the lite house stump . Lissener and me wer boath on the lissen and boath waiting for some thing we dint know what . Working our way a long the shoar then tords Do It Over we seen a fire and figgers black agenst it . 1st look I got I cudnt be cern how many it wer but I gest it wer all 6 Fork Stoan hevvys parbly changing the look out . Looking beyont the fire and the figgers looking in to the dark a long the shoar then looking out to the sea dark andp103Lissener hispert to me , The littl come big took by the far come close . ' I fealt like putting my 2 hans roun his froat and sqweazing hard . I hist back at him , Why in the worl did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on me ? ' He hispert , Trubba not I wernt saying it to you I dint even know I said it out loud it wer jus some thing come in to my head . ' We workit up on to the top of the clif behynt the hevvys til we wer over where they wer . They had ther fire about 2 way down on some kynd of stanning . Looking over the edge I cud see the woal 6 of them . We kep back out of the fire lite then and we lissent a littl . Mosly they wernt talking they wer passing a flask roun . Which what they did say mos of it got los in the soun of the sea beating on the stoans . We did hear a littl of it tho. 1 of them said , ... Goodparleys boy and ben throwt over . He cud wel be ... ' A nother 1 said , ... do any how ? ' The 1st 1 said , His dad ben 1 Stoan Phist bint he . Iwl give odds there ben knowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ' Lissener pull me back he hist , Come on theres some thing else here les get to it befor some 1 else does . ' I hist , What is it ? ' He hist , I do nt know til we get to it . ' He wunt even hol back 1 minim so off we gone a long the clifs tords Do It Over . We come to where the clifsve fel in to the sea time back way back its broakin groun there all a jumbl we use to go there our crowd of kids when I ben littl . That place stil had its old name from way way back it wer call it The Warnings . Coming on to it I thot : Here ! The sea wer stil chopping and beating on the stoans but there come a nother soun it wer that holler bonking soun of a boat knocking on stoan . Looking hard I cud make out the shape of it black agenst the foam . Lissener said , There ! ' Stanning on The Warnings looking at that boat out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p104O  that water wer col . I pult the boat on to the stoans it werful of water and hevvy . Sail dragging in the water the marsed bustit itd come down on the bloak what ben sailing the boat he wer stil unner it dead with his head smasht in . Musve happent in the storm parbly he ben blowt Souf of Fork Stoan then with the tide terning he ben driffing back the other way a long the shoar tords Do It Over . That dead bloak wer from other side dark as it wer I cud tel by his boots . What ben he doing out there any how ? Cawt in the storm parbly and nitefel on the water . Ben he stearing for that fire on the clifs when the marse come down on his head ? Nothing in the boat only oars and a bayling skoop . Hooker roap and hook . Bow and arrers and spears . The bloak had a knife on him he had some roady and some drowndit bread in 1 pockit . In a nother pockit he had flint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 cut of hash and some rizlas . Plus a bag of littl stoans all wet and crummly . Not hard at all you cud break them with your thum nail . There wernt nothing else on the bloak nor nothing else in the boat I got my self good and wet looking every where I even lookit inside the drobber case . It wer only a littl open boat there wernt that many hidey places . Lissener took that littl bag of littl crummly stoans in his hans he said , This is what I ben lissening . Hol it in your hans and you can feal it in them stoans and scrabbling to get out you can hear it hispering to its self and clacking like a skelter of crabs . ' I said , What is it ? ' He said , I tol you I do nt know nothing only when we gether but I know theres Power in it . And where theres Power theres foller . We bes not ful this circel on no farther we bes get in to Cambry qwicks we can with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deap Im going to work that Power . ' I had that bag in my han I begun to feal like it wer liting up the dark like a torch and bleaping follerme all over Inland . Suddn I wantit the nite to get darker I wantit dark a nuff to smuvver it qwyet . I thot a littl on our ruching waytion and Ip105done what I cud to dark it down a littl . We roalt mos of the water out of the boat so I cud row it then we put the bloak and every thing else back in it only kep out what ben in his pockits and the bow and arrers for Lissener plus I cut off a good lenth of sail roap it wer boun to be neadful some time . Then I got in and pult out to where it wer deap a nuff even at low water . I tyd the hooker roap short roun the dead bloaks leg then over the side I droppt the hooker and him boath . Thinking wylst I done it : That Powers working me all ready nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back tords shoar and when I come to where some big rocks wer sticking out in to the water I clum out on to them and ternt the boat over and lef it floating up side down and driffing how it wud . Then we vackt our wayt out of there and roading for Cambry.  |p106Heading  for senter then . I never ben to Cambry befor but I knowit wer a bit farther from Fork Stoan to there nor it wer from Bernt Arse to Fork Stoan . I reckont we had dark a nuff to las our road out if we kep on steady . Out thru the Norf part of Fork Stoan outers we gone and Norfing on the A260 track by the Frogs Legs . Going thru the outers the 2 nexter dogs forkt off to the lef and by the time we come to Stickit Flats they wer back and the others with them we had the woal pack with us agen . I kep wunnering how long wewd have them I knowit they ben long pas ther markings and far off ther groun . Peopl talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you myt be in youwl feal that pul to Cambry in the senter . May be its jus in the air or may be where the Power Ring ben theres stil Power in the groun . You tern your self that way and it comes on so strong you cud beam your self in with your eyes closd . Or with no eyes thats how Lissener gone . He dint go slow and easy like a blyn man on strange groun which that wer about the only kynd of groun there wer for him he had nt never ben no where in his woal life only 1 hoal to a nother from Cambry roun the circel 9wys to Fork Stoan . No he dint go slow nor easy . He stayd with that black dog some times with a han on his neck some times not he leggit so fas I cudnt hardly keap up with him . Hewd stummel and fall in to hoals hewd go arse over head down suddn drops it dint matter nothing to him . It wer like he had a winch inside him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his self in . All ways lissening and out of him there come a farring voyce with no soun going a head in to the dark.  |p107I  said to Lissener , Howre we going to work it so you can gether with them Eusa folk in Cambry ? Have you got that progammit ? ' He said , Not yet . ' I said , With the woal 44 of them to gard therewl be moren 6 hevvys wont there ? ' He said , Theres all ways 12 in Cambry plus theyve put on a exter 6 . ' I said , Be them Eusa folk all in 1 hoal to gether ? ' He said , Yes . ' I said , Wei we bes progam some thing had nt we ? ' He said , There you go agen getting in front of your self . We dint progam nothing in Fork Stoan and we come out of that all right dint we ? ' So I dint bother him no mor about progamming nothing . I said , How dyou do that kynd of gethering what youre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pul datter or dyou jus think to gether or what ? ' He said , We do some poasyum . ' I said , Whats poasyum ?

' He said , I never but 1 of the hevvys tol me they do the same they'll get all in a tangl slyding and sqwirming and ryving to gether . Which is how we do it all the many rubbing up to 1 a nother skin to skin and talking vantsit theary . Which is a kynd of by telling and trantsing . Thats when the singing and the shouting come the many cools of Addom and the party cools of stoan . The strong and the weak inner acting and what happent in the cloudit chaymber . ' I said , Is that where the seed of the red and the seed of the black come in to it ? ' He said , Yes howd you know that ? ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking vantsit theary . If you cud do it then and you can do it now may be you do nt even nead to gether may be you can get them Nos. oansome. '  |p108He  said , No when I talk in a fit or what Im saying now that do nt mean nothing thats jus only the outers of it . It never comes the woal thing realy without the all of us gethering . Weare jus like scattert peaces of a broakin pot them peaces wont hol water without theyre gethert nexy and glewt ferm in the shape of holding do nt you see . I cant make the shape of holding oansome . ' I said , What is that fit you get is it some thing coming in to you and you going out of your self ? ' He said , Im mosly out of my self Im mosly elser lissening like I do . Thats what brings on the fit some times Iwl lissen some thing in too strong then the vy brations of it move in on my emty space and I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know for cern what put it in my mynd then may be it wer the word connexion or him talking of scattert peaces but suddn it come to me we wer like Eusas 2 boys we wer going to have to go 2 diffrent ways some time I dint know why nor how nor when but it fult me sad it come like a weaping inside me . In the dark beside me Lissener begun to cry . I said , Whatre you crying about ? ' He said , Im crying for what ben Im crying for whats going to be . ' I said , Whats the use of that ? ' He said , Whats the use of not ? ' I said , May be it do nt have to be . ' He dint say nothing he jus let my words littl off and dwindlstupid on the air . The black dog bumpt agenst my leg like hewer showing me at leas his part of the dark wer frendy . I said , I wunner where they gone them 2 boys of Eusas ? ' Lissener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys gone 1 to lite and 1 to dark roading on Never did the Good Luck brother Tern a roun to help the other Never did the other 1Ever have the Bents to runp109I said , Whats that then ? I never heard that song is it about Eusas boys ? ' He said , I do nt know what it is its jus a bit of a old song nor I do nt even know the res of it . ' I said , Did you ever hear any story of Eusas boys tho ? ' He said , No I never . Whats the diffrents any how it wunt help us nothing knowing what be come of them . ' I said , Why do we have to go to Cambry why do we have to go for that gethering ? ' He said , What else is there to do ? Wait for Goodparley to close his han on us ?

Soons I movit off tho the 2 nexter dogs movit with me and it lookit like 2 the pack follert on behynt so I wernt qwite oansome in the worl after all . Lissener gone Norf and Wes tords Cambry then and I gone Wes and Norf tords Widders Dump . For a wyl I dint hardly know which 1 of us I wer with . I knowit I wer Riddleyp112Walker heading for Widders Dump but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ben there I never ben no closern the Ring Ditch yet I cud feal it coming closer to me with every step I took the other way . No 1 uses the old place names now they ben unspoak this long time but mos of them are stil there in the places . You know Cambry ben Canterburyin moufs long gone . Canterbury . It has a zanting in it like a tall man dantsing and time back there ben foun there girt big music pipes as big as fents poals peopl said . You try to think of how it musve soundit when the Power Ring ben there and working not jus crummelt stannings and a ditch . It musve ben some girt jynt thing hy hy up and with a shyning and a flashing to it time back way back when they had boats in the air and all the res of it . Did it woosh and hum or ben it dumming and beating like the hart of the wort and what ben the music come out of them pipes ? You do nt know nor you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power there . You go down 1 side of the Ring Ditch and up the other side you can feat it in your knees how youre walking tremmery and you can feal it in your belly . Feal it hy hy over you and overing you . Old foller in the air the after blip and fading of what ben . Fading fading dwindling on the air but the fading and the dwindl sending out ther sylents roun and roun that circel never slowing to a stilness . Wel realy there ai nt no stilness any where is there . Not ice you begin to take noatis . When I forkt off from Lissener it musve ben about a 6fag after 1st seeing that boat with the dead bloak in it . I stil had plenny of time and a nuff to get to Widders Dump befor day lite . I begun to get in front of my self thinking how Iwd do when I got there . Even if Id sust it right as Belnot Phist wer agenst the Ram I dint know how things stood at Widders Dump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and Phist permuch a persner amongst them . I neverd had much to do with any of them formers only Chalker Marchman at the digging and chatting some times to the bloaks at the reddy . I cudnt realy see my self stepping up to that gate and saying Trubba not . On the other han if I slyd in over the fents howp113wud I fynd Phists shelter befor some 1 foun me ? And the woal time I wer thinking them thots part of me wer heading for Cambry with Lissener wylst a nother part wer wunnering when some thing wud come up to stop me . Realy I cudnt beleave I wer going to be let to walk all over Inland any where I fantsyt and partly I wantit some thing to stop me . Becaws I knowit by then any thing at all myt happen and parbly wud. ice that eye starts roaling itwl roal right off the board and gone so easy . So easy . You can go the worl a way so easy . This nite Im writing down here it wer jus only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Widders Dump fents in the morning . Which that seamt time back years back and long long pas . Yet here I wer now coming back to that same fents and thinking how to get inside agen . With my mynd going all diffrent ways stil my feet gone jus that 1 way . Them dogs and me we slyd a long thru dark and girzel by forms and fentses pas all them sleaping in ther doss bags and all them looking out on hy walks be twean Fork Stoan and Widders Dump . No 1 seen us no 1 heard us nothing stoppt us nor it dint seam no time at all til we come sydling that hy groun sholder and nearing on to Widders Dump . My face and hans wet with the girzel my cloes hevvy with the wet my feet slyding in the mud my boots and leggers sogging with it . Smelling the dog pong the rain the mud and the nite . Sylents in my ears only the rain hisper . Far far back behynt my eyes some other place some other time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . No me . Jus barrens and the dry dus blowing . I thot : Who knows ? May be Goodparley is the Littl Shyning Man nor he do nt know it his self . That thot come to me then sydling that sholder in the rainy dark so I write it down here now . Looking down to the low groun in the farness I cud see candl glimmers in the gate house at Widders Dump . Where I wer then its where the hy groun sholder goes in and out theres a long deap holler its like a short valley its that place they call Mr Clevvers Roaling Place . They say some times when Mr Clevvers roading thru Inland he gets a larfing fit hep114cant help his self he jus has to let his self go he roals on the groun there . It wer stil common groun they use to forage there time back . Long befor my time the goats had et it bare and since then there bint nothing only granser rats . They use to say there ben the goast of a batcherd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come too close to where he use to play with his cubs when he ben a live . I do nt know what made me go down there may be I wer hoaping for a site of that goast batcherd or may be Mr Clevver wantit me to have a larf . Userly any crowd I wer with wewdve took the upper track the 1 what come down easyer off the sholder by where Belnot Phistd put the crew to timbering . Any how I dint go down that way I gone thru Mr Clevvers Roaling Place . I wer thinking thinking how wer I going to get to Belnot Phist and wishing I wer clevverer that way . Thinking if I wer realy clevver I wunt be busting my head over it oansome Iwd sly in to How Fents and have a word to Fister Crunchman him asd wantit me to stop pontsing for the Ram and do a mans doing . There wernt much wind then jus a littl and freshening it wer fulling and lulling fulling and lulling . Come the nex littl ful and whatd it bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small thru the hisper of the rain its like it ben pickt up ever so delkit by the wind the way you myt lif a keepaways egg from a ledge on a clif and clym down with it only this here wind egg it hatches in my ear and littl qwyet words come out of it . I do nt feal right about it , ' says Fister Crunchmans littl voyce . Nex voyce is Straiter Empy he says , For his can good and all . ' Farner Salvage is the nex voyce he says , Filter you know they wont do nothing moren dock his fraction for the nex l4nt or so . You jus cant go sticking Mincery peopl in bogs when ever you feal like it . Weare living on burrow time as it is . Wunt take hardly nothing at all for them to largen us in the same as Dog Et done Littl Salting . If youre thinking of putting some thing to gether youre wanking man youre roaling a fools pair of dice . '  |p115Then  some is hushing them qwyet the talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ben to go down thru Mr Clevvers Roaling Place it cernly lookit like he wantit me to have a larf with him . That lernt me some thing about them dogs too they wernt all of them as fine tunet as that black leader . Hewdve give me warning and early . Even had nt he smelt nor heard nothing hewdve col sust any body waiting a jump on that hy groun up of us and hewdve let me know . Thinking of Lissener roading in to Cambry blyn at leas he had that black dog . Plus I wer thinking how close I come to being jumpt and how stupid I ben not to know my crowdwd have the grabbers out for me . I do nt think Fister Crunchman wer in it I think he ben keaping them talking so Iwd be lertit . I ai nt had a chance to ask him yet . I kep wide of the regler track then and working slow and scanful tords Widders Dump and that littl candl glimmer . I knowit I dint have too long til day lite I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I come out of the woodlings to the edge of the Widders Dump clearing . That candl glimmer I seen from up on the hy groun sholder lookit lovely and brite and ever so warm and coasy thru the col girzel it wudve ben nice to be abel to walk up to that gate and say Trubba not in stead of slying roun in the dark . Widders Dump Form is perwel spread out it ai nt no littl 40 peopl fents theyve got 200 and mor plus all ther stock and cattl which theyre all inside the main compoun at nite so its a big fents to walk roun and its a big fents to look out for as wel . Even a small fentswl have 4 lookouts on the hy walk so I thot they mus have at leas 6 at Widders Dump but them being formers and with the nite so col and all I thot there myt be emty spaces here and there with some bloaks keaping ther look out in the gate house with a nice cup of tea . Its a big clearing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from the gate house its the side tords the rivver . Cruising roun the primmeter ditch trying to keap my self on for any kynd of nindicater which there come 1 to me then it wer the terbel sharp pong from the dy working where theyp116boyl up the pig shit earf . I thot : Hewl be close to the dyers . Dint realy think it it jus come to me . They do nt have no poynty stakes at Widders Dump its jus only the ditch which its a wide 1 and it wer ful of water from the rains . I stript off and bundelt my cloes roun my spears then I throwit the spears over the ditch in to the bank on the other side . In to that col water then and swum acrost . Come out of there with my teef clattering loud a nuff to lert the lookouts 5 faggers off . Dryd off with my clout put on my cloes and lissent hard . Not a noun not a creak from that hy walk . I thot : Formers . There parbly ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throwit my roap over a fents poal and up I gone . All clear on the hy walk so Thump . Down to the groun and I wer over that Widders Dump fents 2ce that same day . ice going out and ice coming in . No lites in any shelters only the 1 neares the dy working which I thot that mus be Phist . Jus then I wunnert if I cud be walking in to a trap and in that same minim with that thot some 1 grabbit me from behynt.  |p117Wel  Im telling Truth here ai nt I. Thats the woal idear of this writing which I begun wylst thinking on what the idear of us myt be . Right then when I got grabbit my 1st thot wer : Wel now may be I do nt have to progam nothing for a littl . Who ever had a holt of me clampt me in a strangl holt with a arm like iron and the other han stuck a knife agenst my belly . I thot : It ai nt even that long since I had my E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scab on it yet . Any how this hevvy in charge of me he pushes me tords the doar of the shelter and he says , Here he is Guvner . ' The doar opens and of coarse theres Goodparley sitting there who else wud it be . With his fit up . He do nt have Orfing with him its jus him and Belnot Phist which Phists face is even witern userel . Looking at poor old Phist then I thot we myt even end up frends if the boath of us come thru this littl rumpa a live . Goodparley he smyls his teef at me and his littl eyes theyre near dantsing wylst theyre peaping over the fents of his cheaks . He says to me , ' Wel Riddley yung Walker its ben a long day for you ai nt it . We bes change your name from Walker to Runner you ben moving so fas 1 place to a nother and back agen . All the way to Fork Stoan to meet a boat with a dead sailer in it . Funny thing to do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all .

They took his head off then they put it on a poal for telling . Eusas head tol them , " Onlyes part of Inland kep ther hans clean of this ben the Ram which is the head of Inland .

Them on the Ram took in the head and this is what it tol them : " Make a show of me for memberment and for the ansers to your askings . Make a show with han figgers put a littl woodin head of me on your finger in memberment of my real head on a poal . Keap the Eusa folk a live in memberment of the hardship they brung on .

Thinking : Never did the Good Luck brother Tern a roun to help the otherWith a sickish fealing as I myt be the Good Luck brother and I contrackt I wud help the other Iwd get to him soons I cud and what ever Trubba he wer in wewd boath be in it . Cursing my self for leaving him and coming to Widders Dump which I had nt done nothing only put them yeller stoans in Goodparleyshans . Goodparley had a peace of paper in his han and holding it in front of me . He said , Have a read of this . ' This is what I read wrote down the same : The Legend of St EustaceThe Legend of St Eustace dates from the year A.D. 120 and this XVth-century wall painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The setting is a wooded landscape with many small hamlets ; a variety of wild creatures are to be seen and a river meanders to the open sea. 1 . At the bottom of the painting St Eustace is seen on his knees before his quarry , a stag , between whose antlers appears , on a cross of radiant light , the figure of the crucified Saviour . The succeeding episodes lead up to his martyrdom. 2 . The Saint and his family appear before the Bishop of Rome renouncing their worldly possessions and becoming outcasts. 3 . His wife is taken off by pirates in a ship ; on the right the father and sons stand praying on the shore. 4 . St Eustace and his boys reach a river swollen by torrents . Having swum to the opposite side with one of thep124children , he returns for the other . As he reaches the middle of the stream a wolf runs off with the child he has left . He looks back and beholds a lion in the act of carrying off the other child . We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fifteen years pass by . St Eustace has recovered his wife and sons and is the victorious general of the Emperor Hadrian , who orders a great sacrifice to the gods in honour of his victories . Eustace and his family refuse to offer incense . We see them being roasted to death in a brazen bull . The Emperor Hadrian stands on the left with a drawn sword in his hand. 6 . At the top of the painting two angels hold a sheet containing the four souls ; the Spirit of God in the form of a dove descends to receive them into heaven . The date of the painting is about 1480 ; the work is highly skilled in an English tradition and is a magnificent example of wall painting of this date . Wel soons I begun to read it I had to say , I do nt even know these words . Whats a Legend ? How dyou say a guvner S with a littl t ? ' Goodparley said , I can as plain the mos of it to you . Some parts is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know for cern jus what they mean . What this writing is its about some kynd of picter or dyergam which we do nt have that picter all we have is the writing . Parbly that picter ben some kynd of a seakert thing becaws this here writing ( I do nt mean the writing youre holding in your han I mean the writing time back way back what this is wrote the same as ) its cernly seakert . Its blipful it ai nt jus only what it seams to be its the syn and foller of some thing else . A Legend thats a picter whats depicted which is to say pictert on a wall its done with some kynd of paint call it fidelity . St is short for sent .

Episodes thats when you do a thing 1 part at a time youve got to get the 1st episode done befor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if youre working chemistery or fizzics . Youwl do your boyl ups and your try outs in episodes , " Wooded landscape with many small hamlets .

" Mazy ways to a open see meaning a look see isp127what I take that to mean . Whatre we follering them mazy ways for ? Have a look right here now weare coming on to the nuts and balls of the thing weare coming to the hart of the matter and the Hart of the Wud where them dogs is on the foller of them littl pigs . Whats at the bottom of the thing and whats this sent bloaks name ? Wel it says right here : " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mynd you of any other name ? ' I said , Eusa . ' He said , Thats it . Its the very same name jus woar down a littl . Who ever this bloak wer what wrote our Eusa Story he connectit his self to this here Legend or dyergam and the chemistery and fizzics of it becaws this here Legend writing and the Eusa Story the 2 of them ben past down to gether in the Mincery . " St Eustace is seen on his knees before his quarry . " Which a quarry is a kynd of digging . Whys he on his knees ? What brung him down what knockt him off his feet ? What come out of that digging ? A stag . Wel thats our Hart of the Wud in n it we know him wel a nuff . Whats he got be twean his antlers its " a cross of radiant light " . Which is the same as radiating lite or radiation which may be youve heard of . ' I said , No I never . ' He said , Youve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that hoal in Bernt Arse where you foun Lissener . ' I said , Yes I seen that wite shadder . ' He said , Wei it ben radiant lite as made that shadder . Radiant lite . Shyning . Wel we know from our can Eusa Story where you fynd the Hart of the Wud youwl fynd a shyning in be twean his horns . Which that shyning is the Littl Shyning Man the Addom . Only in this Legend its call it " the figure of the crucified Saviour " . Figure is a word means moren 1 thing and 1 of the things it means is number . Number of the crucified Saviour . Now Iwl tel you some thing intersting Riddley Walker son of Brooder Walker you what put the yellerboy stoan the Salt 4 in my hans . Iwl tel you theres ap128working in this thing theres a pattren theres mor connexions nor wewl ever fynd reveals of . You know who put me on to what this woal things about ?

" Wel you know every now and agen youwl hear some thing it means what ever it means but youwl know theres mor in it as wel . Moren wer know it by who ever said it . So that reveal stayd in my mynd . You see how it wer up to then I never thot this Legend ben anything moren a picter story about a bloak with a name near the same as Eusa . Nor I dint know nothing of chemistery nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any how I wer reading over this here Legend like I use to do some times and I come to " the figure of the crucified Saviour " . Number of the crucified Saviour and wunnering how that be come the Littl Shyning Man the Addom . Suddn it jumpt in to my mynd " A littl salting and no saver " . I dint have no idear what crucified myt be nor up to then I had nt give Saviour much thot I thot it myt mean some 1 as saves only that dint connect with nothing . Id never put it to gether with saver like in savery . Not sweet . Salty . A salt crucified . I gone to the chemistery working I askit 1 Stoan Phist that wer Belnots dad what crucified myt be nor he wernt cern but he thot itwd be some thing you done in a cruciboal. 1st time Id heard the word . Thats a hard firet boal they use it doing a chemistery try out which you cud call that crucifrying or crucifying . Which that crucified Saviour or crucifryd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2 by Eusa . So " the figure of the crucified Saviour " is the number of the salt de vydit in 2 partsp129in the cruciboal and radiating lite coming acrost on it . The salt and the saver . ice youve got that salt youre on your way to the woal chemistery and fizzics of it . Right up to your las try out which is the brazen bull which is to say your brazing boal and the chard coal . But thats all tecker knowledging realy you wunt hardly unner stan it nor I wont wear you out with it . Youve got to do your take off and your run off and your carry off . Which its wrote in the story its the wife took off by pirates and the wolf run off with 1 littl boy and the lion carrit off the other . The wife is the sof and the sweet you see which is took off by the sharp and the salty . Them pirates and wolfs and lions theyre all assits theyre all sharp and biting its all chemistery in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twis " which is what you put in to qwicken on your episodes .

The scare crow jus kep on beckoning . On we gone tords Cambry . Dint see no other dog packs tho we wer far and a way beyont the Bernt Arse packs markings . It fealt to me like other packs wer keaping out of our path . Like every thing holding its breaf waiting for some thing special to happen . So far that morning it had nt ben raining only hanging over grey . Coming acrost the barrens the sky darkent on and hevvy . When we come to the Ring Ditch the stannings of the Power Ring stood up wite agenst the dark like broakin teef . I tryd to see the Power Ring in my mynd . Hy and shyning with the 1 Big 1 wooshing roun inside it . That story of why the dog wont show its eyes where it tels of putting the 1 Big 1 in to the Power Ring which the very 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day then every thing gone black I do nt beleave that . Looking at them stannings I knowit inside me they musve had that 1 Big 1 going roun there regler . I cud feal the goast of it hy over me farring roun and out of site going roun that circel and coming back and roun agen EEEeeeeee.  |p156Black  sky . Wite broakin teef . SPIRIT OF GOD , ' I yelt . Becaws thats where Goodparleyd said the 1 Big 1 come out of . I dint know nothing about chemistery nor fizzics but I wer getting to where I neadit some thing hy to yel at . I cud feal it like a rushing hy over me roun the hy goast of the Power Ring . The dogs all laid back ther ears and grovvelt so I knowit they cud feal it over them and all . CANTERBURY , ' I yelt . Becaws that wer the old name . The new name wernt no good it wer a stanning in the mud name it dint have no zanting to it . I run down in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrengroun I cud feal it coming up in to me thru my feet the Power of the goast of the Power what ben . IT STIL IS , ' I yelt . Becaws it come to me then I knowit Power dint go a way . It ben and it wer and it wud be . It wer there and drawing . Power wantit you to come to it with Power . Power wantit what ever cud happen to happen . Power wantit every thing moving frontways . The same as Goodparley wantit . The same as I wer wanting then . Thinking back to that nite when I took the scar which it ben jus only 3 nites back it wer that same nite they done the Eusas head show and that same nite Goodparley tol me he wer looking for the Littl Shyning Man nor it wernt jus only the idear of him it wer some thing real . Now I wer beginning to get a idear of what he meant . Plus thinking agen on what Orfingd said . How the Littl Shyning Man wer what ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power wernt it . The Power of the 2ness trying to tear the 1 a part . What if you put the 2 and the 1 to gether tho ? What if you put the 2ness inside the 1 ? Power inside of Power myt that be 1 Big 1 and Spirit of God ? The 2 inside the 1 the Big inside the littl like thunner and litening inside a egg shel . Then what if you broak that shel . Parbly thatwd make such a noys such a noys such a noys . Or may be you cud work it so it jus come wooshing out like the Wind of the Worl . Myt that be the same what I cud stil feal the goast of rushing hy in the air roun the circel of the goast of the Power Ring ? I begun to see why Goodparleyd ternt me luce hed parbly sust it myt come to me by its self if he lef me a loan . I begun to get as cited then thinking on them things . I wudve liket to gether with Goodparley right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Thinking like that I begun to wish I had nt progammit nothing with Lissener agenst Goodparley . Wunnering then why I ben so qwick to go in with him jus becaws that black dog brung me to him in that hoal in Bernt Arse and I fealt sorry for him . Now Orfing and his hevvyswd parbly have him and what wer I going to do about it ? Cambry coming up in front of me nor I dint have ap157idear in my head . I begun to wish that black dogd never brung me to that hoal I jus dint want to have to bother with Lissener right then . Thinking on Lissener and wunnering how much him and the Eusa folk realy know it when they gethert . Membering what he shoutit when he ben took with that fit : WE PROGAMMIT THEGIRT DANTS OF THE EVERY THING . WE RUN THE BLUE THE RED THE YELLER WE RUN THE RED THE BLACK WE RUN THE SEED OF THE RED AND SEED OF THE BLACK . WE RUN THE MANY COOLS OF ADDOM AND THE PARTY COOLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOOT . 1 AND 2 AND SHAKE OF THE HORNS AND 1 AND 2 AND SPLIT OF THE SITYNING . . Then it come to me . Onlyes reason Goodparley ben giving Lissener bother wer becaws he wantit the knowing of how to do that 1 Big 1 . Wel what if I put Goodparley to gether with Granser and give them the yellerboy stoan and they got the 1 Big 1 . Then theywd tern Lissener luce they wunt help no qwirys on him then . Parbly that wer the bes thing I cud do for Lissener and the mor I thot on it the better it lookit . I ternt roun then heading back tords Goodparley but soons I done that there come a woal lot of grooling and smarling and ever so many sharp and toofy teef looking at me . It wernt jus only them 2 nexters then it wer all them dogs grooling low and deap it soundit like it wer coming out of the groun . I ternt roun agen tords Cambry and the grooling stoppit . Coming in to Cambry outers and fealing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Jumbelt stoan and crummelt birk . Grean rot and number creaper . The old dry parcht smel and the wet grean smel to gether like in all the dead towns . No stilness like the other dead towns tho . Qwick it wer . All of it qwick and a qwickful by moving coming up out of the groun and hyering hyering up thru the rain in to the dark what stars for ever on them broakin stoans with its hans over its face . Day time it wer then nor not raining but the rain wer in it and the dark is all ways there . The shape of the nite what beartht the day when Canterbury dyd . Hart of the Wud in the hart of the stoan . I cud feal that thing inside us how its afeart ofp158being beartht . I cud feal how every thing is every thing . I fealt like if I stampt my foot therewd come horns on my head and the Littl Shyning Man nekkit be twean them . Thinking on the Littl Shyning Man he be come mixt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belnot he bint pult in 2 acturel peaces and yet in a way of saying he ben pull a part and it wer the Power of the 2 as done it . Now that 2 wantit to be 1 agen and moving me I cud feal it strong that Big Power what ever it wer . Spirit of God may be that same what woosht roun the Power Ring time back way back . I wantit to be the happener for that Big Power . I wantit to happen that 1 Big 1 . I thot of the yellerboy stoan 2 of it with me and Z of it with Lissener . Reaching out then with my mynd I tryd to lissen him . Cudnt lissen nothing only jynt sylents there wernt nothing of him in it I wer all a loan . Eusas littl son nor cudnt fynd the other 1 . Be your can black dog and be your can Ardship . Becaws you wont all ways have me . ' Thats what hed said . Now I knowit why hed said it . Becaws he knowit time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hy Power back agen and wooshing roun the Power Ring not jus the goast of it . I wantit that Spirit of God moving Inland frontwards agen . I wantit the same as Goodparley I wernt agenst him no mor and that wer the hart of the matter . Lissenerd lissent that and pult his mynd a way so I cudnt lissen him nor where he wer . Boath of us looking for that 1 Big 1 but we wernt on the same side no mor . Suddn it flasht in to my mynd may be he wer the Good Luck brother not me . So sad I fealt then . Sad and emty with a crying in me . I fealt like that Other Voyce Owl of the Worl musve lissent the woal worl a way and every thing gone . Every thing emtyd out of the worl and out of me . Funny fealing come on me then I fealt like that Power wer a Big Old Father I wantit it to do me like Granser done Goodparley I wantit it to come in to me hard and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thot . Stanning on them old broakin stoans I fealt like it wer coming in to me then and taking me strong . Fealt like it werp159the han of Power clampt on the back of my neck fealt the Big Old Father spread me and take me . Fealt the Power in me I fealt strong with it and weak with it boath . And stil I fealt a nother way . Grean rot sweating on the old grey broakin stoans all roun me and number creaper growing on the rubbl . I knowit Cambry Senter ben flattent the werst of all the dead town senters it ben Zero Groun it ben where the wite shadderd stood up over every thing . Yet unner neath that Zero Groun I lissent up a swarming it wer a humming like a millying of bees it wer like l0s of millyings . I begun to teal all juicy with it . Juicy for a woman . Longing for it hard and hevvy stanning ready . Not jus my cock but all of me it wer like all of me wer cock and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs begun running roun me all in a circel roun and roun with ther littl heads up hy and ther hy sholders up . They begun running on ther hynt legs . The sky wer black the stoans gone wite the dogs gone all diffrent shyning colours and the wite stoans shyning thru them . I tryd to hol it like that but I los it I wernt man a nuff right then . I cud boy for the other but I cudnt man for her what has her woom in Cambry . The sky gone grey the stoans gone grey the dogs gone back to how they lookit befor and come down on to all 4s . It wernt a circel it wer a nother shape they wer running like a black rivver out and a roun out and a roun it wer a big shape they wer running in amongst the rubbl and a roun I begun to run it with them . It wer 2ce as wide acrost as the divvy roof at How Fents I run it 3 times roun befor I knowit jus what shape it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman dollys they hang over where a womans bearthing . Which them dollys theyre the same shape as the woman cakes they bake . Not realy like a real woman shape its a bulgy body like a jug or a flask with a littl roun head . The out line of that shape ben dug out of the broakin stoan and rubbl it wer the line of a old old wall in that woman dolly shape it wer that same and very 1 what has her woom in Cambry.  | ... Shes that same 1 shows her moon self or she jus shows her old old nite and no moon . Shes that same 1 every thing and all of us come out of . Shes what she is .. . I cud teal all them millyings of bees humming in me but they wer humming the emtyness they wer humming what I cudnt hol when them dogs ben running shyning colours on ther hynt legs they wer humming what Id los . Yet Id know it the shape of nite Id gone in to the nite in the day time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai nt a nuff . Miss your connexion nor you do nt even know til its ben and gone . The woom of her what has her woom in Cambry ai nt inside the out line what the dogs ben runnin its a littl to the Wes of that which its unner neath the groun . Thats where I gone sad and emty it wer the dogs took me to it . Old stoan steps going down to it . That wer the hoal where the Eusa folk ben I lissent that strait a way . It wernt dark there winders ben dug out of the rubbl it wer like that shaddery lite youwl see amongst the trees on a grey day . When ever Id thot of a hoal with Eusa folk in it Id thot of some thing filfy with a terbel pong like the hoal in Bernt Arse where Id foun Lissener . This place wer clean tho nor it dint have no pong it smelt good it had jus the fayntes foller of a bernt smel like the goast of the blue smoak in amongst the aulders. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berning is hart of the chyldI do nt have nothing only words to put down on paper . Its so hard . Some times theres mor in the emty paper nor there is when you get the writing down on it . You try to word the big things and they tern ther backs on you . Yet youwl see stanning stoans and ther backs wil talk to you . The living stoan wil all ways have the living wood in it I know that . With the hart of the chyld in it which that hart of the chyld is in that same and very thing what lives inside us and afeart of being beartht . The wood be come stoan in the woom of her what has her woom in Cambry . That place unner the groun where I wer it wer a wood of stoan it wer stoan trees growing unner the groun . Parbly that stoan ben cut and carvit by them as made them jynt music pipes I never seen . Roun trunks of stoan and each 1 had 4 stoan branches curving up and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connectit 1 tree to a nother . Stoan branches holding up the over head and growt in to it . Stoan branches unner a stoan sky . A stoan wood unner the groun the hart of the wood in the hart of the stoan in the woom of her what has her woom in Cambry . I fel down on to my knees then I cudnt stan up I cudnt lif up my head . The 1 Big 1 the Master Chaynjis it wer all roun me . Wood in to stoan and stoan in to wood . Now it showit 1 way now a nother . The stoan stans . The stoan moves . In the stanning and the moving is the tree . Pick the appel off it . Hang the man on it . Out of the holler of it comes the berning chyld . Unner the stoan . See the bird boan . Thin as grass . Be coming grass . I opent my mouf and mummering only dint have no words to mummer . Jus only letting my froat make a soun . Becaws it come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me what it wer as made them peopl time back way back bettern us . It wer knowing how to put ther selfs with the Power of thep162wood be come stoan . The wood in the stoan and the stoan in the wood . The idear in the hart of every thing . If you cud even jus only put your self right with 1 stoan . Thats what kep saying its self in my head . If you cud even jus only put your self right with 1 stoan youwd be moving with the girt dants of the every thing the 1 Big 1 the Master Chaynjis . Then you myt have the res of it or not . The boats in the air or what ever . What ever you done wud be right . Them as made Canterbury musve put ther selfs right . Only it dint stay right did it . Somers in be twean them stoan trees and the Power Ring they musve put ther selfs wrong . Now we dint have the 1 nor the other . Them stoan trees wer stanning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put our selfs with the Power of the wood the Power in the stoan . Plus wed los the knowing whatd woosht the Power roun the Power Ring . May be all there ever ben wer jus only 1 minim when any thing ever cud be right and that minim all ways gone befor you seen it . May be soons that 1st stoan tree stood up the wrongness hung there in the branches of it the wrongness ben the 1st frute of the tree . I put my han on a stoan tree trunk . There wernt no grean rot on it the stoan fealt clean and dry . In the 2 lite in the grey lite it lookit like it wer stanning in its oan time not the same time I wer in . Cud it hear the music of them los jynt pipes I wunnert . Fealing the carving unner my hans it wer like shaller runnels cut in the stoan . The runnels come down strait and parrel 1 to the other . Then they ziggit then they zaggit then gone strait agen . Running my han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how other hans done the same thing time back way back . Some 1 carvit that stoan with a chiswel and mowlit then they run ther han over it . That carving wudve took some time too . 1st that stoan trunk ben shapit roun then the runnels ben cut in to it . Then there wudve ben the fitting to do the measuring and the cutting and the pegging and the hoaling and the joyning when they fittit them curving branches on to the trunks . They wudve had top163prop them branches with shapers wunt they . All of that to make that wood of stoan . All them hans digging and cutting and hoysting and joyning and carving . All of that to put the Power of the wood to gether with the Power of the stoan in that wood of stoan trees . This nex what Im writing down it ai nt no story tol to me nor it ai nt no dream . Its jus some thing come in to my head wylst I ben on my knees there in that stoan wood in the woom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing it down here . StoanStoans want to be lissent to . Them big brown stoans in the formers feal they want to stan up and talk like men . Some times youwl see them lying on the groun with ther humps and hollers theywl say to you , Sit a wyl and res easy why do nt you . Then when youre sitting on them theywl talk and theywl tel if you lissen . Theywl tel whats in them but you wont hear nothing what theyre saying without you go as fas as the stoan . You myt think a stoan is slow thats becaws you wont see it moving . Wont see it walking a roun . That do nt mean its slow tho . There are the many cools of Addom which they are the party cools of stoan . Moving in ther millyings which is the girt dants of the every thing its the fastes thing there is it keaps the stilness going . Reason you wont see it move its so far a way in to the stoan . If you cud fly way way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down you wunt see the waves moving youwd see them change 1 way to a nother only you wunt see them moving youwd be too far a way . You wunt see nothing only a changing stilness . Its the same with a stoan . Theres a kynd of stoan its all mos like a mud stoan it ai nt hard . Some times youwl see 1 broak open all mos like it ben shapit with a ax . It looks like 1 cut then a nother making a poynt like a short beak . Owl beak or hawk beakp164some times you can see the eye bulge unner the skin of the stoan . Wel them stoans ai nt ben ax shapit theyve broak ther selfs open its that bird head in the stoan what peckt the stoan a part . Some times youwl see the 2 peaces stil to gether the bird head and the other to gether they look like a broakin hart . Come back a nother time the bird head wont be there no mor nor it dint grow a bird body on to its self and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man body on to its self and off it gone walking its self a way . Stoan men growt out of the bird head in the stoan 1 for every 1 of us . Where they are theyre up side down in the groun . Like youwl see a picter of your self up side down in the water theres a stoan self of your self in the groun and walking foot to foot with you . You put your foot down and theywl put ther foot up and touching yours . Walking with you every step of the way yet youwl never see them . Theywl stay unner the groun longs youre on top of it . Comes your time to ly down for ever then the stoan man comes to the top of the groun they think theywl stan up then . They cant do it tho . Onlyes strenth they had ben when you ben a live . Theyre lying on the groun trying to talk only theres no noun theres grean vines and leaves growing out of ther mouf . Them vines getting thicker and pulling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curling roun the head . Vines growing out of ther mouf . Vines and leaves growing out of the nose hoals and the eyes then breaking the stoan mans face a part . Back in to earf agen . Them stoans ben trying to talk only they never wil theyre jus only your earf stoans your unner walkers . Trying to be men only cant talk . They had earf for sky wylst you had air . Its jus only stoan men walking unner the groun like that . Women have some thing else . Your other stoans your stoan stoans not earf stoans they talk ther can way which is stoan talk . They ben there wylst you ben walking they'll be there when you ly down . The hart of the wud is in the hart of the stoan where the girt dants is . That come to me in the Eusa hoal in Cambry with the dogs allp165roun me that day . From now on when I write down about the tree in the stoan Iwl write wud not wood . You see what Im saying its the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . You cant all ways know when some things happent . Some times youwl think there ben some thing and realy it ben nothing at all . Other times you do nt take no noatis til later it comes to you what happent . This time in the Eusa hoal in Cambry I knowit wer some thing happent . Some thing come in to me . Some thing I lissent out of that place . Else how cud I have in my mynd how the saddelite bird a way way up over the sea looks down on the waves . I can stil see it in my mynd the blue water and the wite foam far far a way down be low me . Thinking then of when Goodparley ben terpiting of the Eusa Legend and there ben that part about the open sea which he terpitit that wer open see . Thinking on that other thing that with the stoan men I cud see it in my mynd so plain that face with the vines and leaves growing out of the mouf . Them stoans like birds heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vines and leaves Id never seen . I knowit that dint come out of my mynd it musve come in to it from comers . Where ever that mans face come from it full me sad . It wer a thick kynd of face . Thick nose lookit like it ben bustit . Thick mouf z open and the leafy vines growing out of boath sides and curling up roun his head . Lookit like he myt be wearing a hood as wel . The way his mouf wer open and how his eyes lookit it wer like he dint know what to make of it . Like he ben breaving and suddn the breaf coming out of his mouf ternt in to vines and leaves . Cudnt swaller them back and tryd to bite them off but theyre too hard and thick and pulling his mouf a part wider all the time . His eyes wide open with sir prize . Lite grean eyes open so wide . The look of that face saying so many diffrent things only no words to say them with . Never seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a way the vines and leaves and it myt be Punchs face or it even myt be Eusas face . Which wud be onp166the front of Eusas head wunnit . Id never realy thot much on that befor . How Eusas face and headwd go to gether . That face in my mynd with the vines and leaves growing out of the mouf I begun to see it wer the onlyes face there wer . It wer every face . It wer the face of the boar I kilt and the dog that old leader . It wer the face of my father what ben kilt in the digging . It wer Belnot Phist hung up by his hans tyd behynt him and it wer the Littl Shyning Man . Wer it the Ardship of Cambry and all ? The Ardship dint have no eyes in his face . And yet myt it be him ? I dint know I cudnt say . I cudnt put that face to gether with his face . And yet we wer moon brothers . Goodparley ? Yes it wer Goodparleys face moren any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ways had Orfings in it . What wer it made the Ardship odd 1 out then ? Why wer it every bodys face only not his ? I dint know . Too many things coming in at Ice . Like all ways . Mixt up I wer . Like all ways . Yet some thing happent there in Cambry . It happent where the dogs run them shyning colours on the wite stoans agenst the black sky . It happent in the Eusa hoal amongst them stoan trees . It happent in my head when I seen the changing stilness of the far a way waves and the face with the grean vines and leaves . I wer progammit diffrent then from how I ben when I come in to Cambry . Coming in to Cambry my head ben ful of words and rimes and all kynds of jumbl of yellerboy stoan thots . Back then I ben thinking on the Power of the 2 and the 1 and the Hy Power what ben wooshing roun the Power Ring time back way back . The 1 Big 1 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myndy thinking . Thinking who wer going to do what and how I myt put some thing to gether befor some 1 else done it . Seed of the red and seed of the yeller and that . That on with of the yeller boy and the pig shit in the hart of the wood . Hart of the wud . Now I dint want nothing of that . I dint know what the connexion wer with that face in my mynd only I knowit that face wer making me think diffrent . I wernt looking for no Hy Power no mor I dint wantp167no Power at all . I dint want to do nothing with that yellerboy stoan no mor . Greanvine wer the name I put to that face in my mynd . I cud feal some thing growing in me it wer like a grean sea surging in me it wer saying , LOSE IT . Saying , LET GO . Saying , THE ONLYES POWER IS NO POWER . There come in to my mynd then music or the idear of music I do nt know what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only I know I heard it then . It wer as much colours as it wer souns only if I try to see the colours now I cant . The souns and the colours they be come a moving and I thot I cud move with it . I startit up out of that stoan wood . The dogs dint grool nor nothing only them 2 nexters black and yeller black and red ther moufs opent like larfing and ther eyes 2 closd and up they gone on ther hynt legs agen . Soons they done it the woal res of the pack done it with them . They had ther littl heads up by they had ther front legs liffit with ther paws dangling they wer running on ther hynt legs in and out of them stoan trees they wer moving with the souns and colours . There come mor dogs then it wer the res of the Bernt Arse pack and the black leader with them . Him and them what ben with Lissener . All of them running on ther hynt legs with the others . Runnying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idear of Greanvine . Then the black leader stil on his hynt legs he led a way thru the rubbl and the stumps and stannings not too far then down on all 4s and down in to a place dug out be low some fallin stoans . At the back of that place the black leader sniffing and scratching on a stoan with his paw and looking at me . It lookit like he wantit me to shif that stoan . Which I done . It come out easy there wer a hidey hoal and some thing in it rapt up in a bit of red and black stripet hard clof it wer that same and very clof the Eusa show men use for ther fit ups . I had a idear what it wer going to be when I unrapt it . I wer right . It wer Greanvine . Carvit out of wood and paintit it wer may be 2 as big as a real face . The back of it flat and the frontp168of it ful roundit it wer that same and very face I seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me wylst the vines and leaves growit out of his mouf . Wunnering if it ben jus only this 1 dog foun that rapt up face or ben it past down 1 dog to a nother 1000s of years and 100s of dogs lifes . The clof wernt old but that face wer . Nothing blackent nor rottit I dint know how I knowit but I knowit . It wer his look he wer looking at me from time back way way back is how I knowit . I lissent it ben past down 1 dog to a nother 1 man to a nother as wel . Not a woman this wernt a woman thing . A woman in this place by the woom of her what has her woom in Cambry wuntve bothert hiding a way this face of a man with vines and leaves growing out of his mouf . This here man dying back in to the earf and the vines growing up thru his arse hoal up thru his gullit and out of his mouf . Not a woman thing . Becaws a woman is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woom shes the 1 with the new life coming out of her . You wunt carve a womans face with vines and leaves growing out of the mouf . A woman shewl dy back in to the earf but not the same as a man . You cud see the knowing of that in Greanvines eyes . A man myt get 100s of childer but the onlyes new life growing out of him wil be that dead mans vine at the end of his run . Wunnering who ben the las to look at Greanvine befor me . That red and black stripet hard clof it wer old but not as old as Greanvine . Did it come from a Punch mans fit up or a Eusa show mans ? Ben there Punch back then in what ever time Greanvine come from ? How far back did Greanvine go ? Ben he there when them jynt music pipes ben making ther music ? There wer a broak off peg in the back of him . May be he ben peggit to a poast or he ben a kynd of head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parper town of Canterbury . Hummering girt and tall in some shape I wunt never know . Them stoans come down when the wite shadder stood up over Canterbury . Parbly Greanvine come down with them and some Punch man foun him and savit him a way in thisp169hidey hoal . Dint walk off with him no he savit him a way in this hoal for who everwd be the nex to come a long and fynd him . So there I wer then may be I wer 1 with Greanvine only it lookit like Id come in 2 with every 1 else . 1st I ben with Lissener agenst Goodparley then in my mynd I begun to go tords Goodparley and a way from Lissener . Now on a suddn I wer off the boath of them . I wernt on for no mor yellerboy stoaning nor all the res of it I dint care who wer doing it . Every body juicying for Power 1 way or a nother nor I dint want no part of it no mor . I realy fealt like the onlyes Power wer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wantit to be on the same side with no mor . Wel the dogs . And here they wer the woal Bernt Arse pack and the black leader all them dogs what ben with Lissener now they wer with me . Which that mus mean Lissener ben took by Orfing . I dint like to think of him hung up like Belnot Phist ben . Nor coming to no harm for lack of me . Dint want to have to do nothing about it only I knowit I wunt have no res if I dint . I said to the black leader , Wheres the Ardship gone ? ' By then I wer talking to him like you wud to a nother person you cudnt help it . He showit which way with his head then he gone that way and I follert . It wer the out poast he took me to it wer close by . I gone slow and scartful but it wer emty . Tabels benches and sleapers cook pots and buckits but no weapons nor no doss bags . On a wall some bodyd drawt some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wer it wer a joak picter of Goodparley . Rough done but you cud see it wer him easy a nuff . With his littl eyes and big chin and big teef he wer easy to do . Coming out of each side of his mouf wer vines and leaves the same as Greanvine . I wer holding the 1 face in my han and looking at the other on the wall . On the wall unner Goodparleys face wer wrote : HOAP OF A TREETook strange a nuff by that I wer . Hoap of a tree ! Comingp170from them stoan trees like I wer jus then them words put me I dint know where . Hoap of a tree ! Hoap of a tree for what ? Hoap of a tree to grow out of Goodparleys mouf ? Hoap of a tree to hang Goodparley on ? Greanparley ? Goodvine ? Greangood ? Parleyvine ? My head begun to go roun with it . Goodparley had a long chin and the chin in the picter wer even longer . At the top of that long chin the vines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the long chin lookit like the stags head . There ben a bit of chard coal lef on the floor I pickt it up and drawit in the stags eyes and nose and ears . There wer Goodparley in be twean the horns of the Hart of the Wud then . Unner neath of it the words : HOAP OF A TREEWhat kynd of a tree wud that be then ? The aulder ? Never mynd , I thot . Iwl parbly fynd out soonern Iwd like . I brung my mynd back to the Ardship . From the 1st I come to Cambry realy I ben fealing like I had the place to my self . If I ben lissening every 1 gone then I thot may be I mytve lissent where they gone as wel . I tryd to let it come to me . I wer looking at that picter on the wall and the words unner it agen . They dint look like they ben done by the same han . The picter of Goodparley wer big and sprawly and the words wer wrote littl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree . Tree in the stoan . Fork in the tree . Fork Stoan . I said to the black leader , Wheres the Ardship now ? Wheres Liss-ener ? ' He lookit at me with them yeller eyes of his then he jus tost his head and like give a sylent larf with his mouf . Wel any how I dint have no other place in mynd only Fork Stoan so thats where I wer heading for nex.  |p171Wel  I dint go to Fork Stoan strait off . Seamt like I kep fealing different ways 1 minim to the nex that day it come on me then I dint want to road no mor by day I wantit to go dark . I dint want no 1 to know where I wer no more even if Goodparley did want me running luce . Special I dint want him to know . I dint want him all ways knowing where he cud put his han on me . Goodparleyd said hewd be coming to Cambry but I dowtit that . It seamt too simpl . I dint think Goodparley ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fynd it emty . Parbly he knowit bettern me where Orfing and the Ardshipwdbe . What ever HOAP OF A TREE and that picter meant they wer agenst Goodparley some way I knowit that . Nor I dint think I knowit any thing Goodparley dint know . He wer a girt 1 for letting peopl run luce and til they run in to his han . If he pirntowt Orfing wer putting some thing to gether agenst him hewd be sure to tern up where itwd do him the mos good and Orfing the leas . Which I dint think thatwd be Cambry jus now . I laid up in the out poast with dogs on look out . No sleap the nite befor and I wer ready for some kip . Nothing only bare sleapers there nor nothing to get warm with . The black leader come and floppit down on the floor and I floppit down with him I kep warm that way and off I gone . Woak up with a lam leg in my face it wer that dog forage sqwad looking after me agen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and chewing it raw same as the dogs . I thot I myswel get use to it . Thinking that thot and suddn it come to me I dint know when Iwd ever be living like regler peopl agen.  |p172I  hung a bout there til it got dark I past the time with my old black Punch on my right han and Greanvine on my lef . Punch said to Greanvine , Whats it all about then ? ' Greanvine said , You do nt nead me to tel you that do you . Youve put in your time this long time unner groun you know what its all about . ' Punch said , Whats that then ? ' Greanvine said , Wel air is the short sky in n it but earf is the long 1 . ' Punch said , Balls my boy . Thats what you ai nt got a nuff of . ' Greanvine said , It do nt matter how much balls youve got its all the same in the end . ' Punch said , No it ai nt the same its diffrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rows it diffrent ? ' Punch said , Its diffrent right the way up to the end and thats why the end is diffrent . If the way is diffrent the end is diffrent . Becaws the end ai nt nothing only part of the way its jus that part of the way where you come to a stop . The end cud be any part of the way its in every step of the way thats why you bes go ballsy . ' Greanvine said , Is that how you all ways go ? ' Punch said , I am the balls of the worl I am the stoans of the worl . I am the stoans and I have my littl stick . ' Greanvine said , Is that your tree then is that your living wood ? ' Punch said , Yes thats what it is its that same and very wood what never dys . ' Greanvine said , Wel then is there hoap of a tree ? ' Punch said , Theres hoap of the wud in the hart of the stoan . ' Greanvine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Balls . Which thems the stoans what never dys . ' Wel of coarse Punch wud say that . Thats how he is he s that way myndit . Me I dint have Punchs balls nor I wernt all that sure them wer the stoans what never dys.  |p173Any  how when nite come on I put Greanvine back in his hidey hoal and my self on the road to Fork Stoan . It come on to rain I dint mynd that I like the rain plus by then I wer out path myndit . Put me on a muddy track in a black nite with the rain pissing down and I wer hoam . Roading with them dogs thru the dark it wer like I wer in a diffrent country from the res of Inland . Every 1 else the formers and them what jobbit or foragit or what ever they had the country of the day time . That same country I use to go in . In the day time there wer all ways things coming up in front of your eyes . In the nite you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stil ai nt qwite said how it wer . Not like a diffrent country . It wer mor like I wer behynt the back clof in a show . Thats how it wer . Thru the clof I cud see the other figgers moving I cud see the peopl watching only no 1 cud see me . If I wer a figger in a show what hand wer moving me then ? I cudnt be bothert to think on that right then . Theres all ways some thingwl be moving you if it ai nt 1 thing its a nother you cant help that . Fealing that black leader bumping agenst me roading thru the hispering rain and dark and Fork Stoan coming closer and closer . Nor I dint realy want to think about it . Dint want to get in front of my self . I cudnt lissen what wer happening but I cud lissen wel a nuff there wer things happening . In my mynd Fork Stoan wer like a hoal in a fents . It wer the place where some thingd come thru all ready nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stil fresh in my mynd from the nite befor I cudnt keap my mynd from showing me that big space with the girt sleaping machines in it . I cud see figgers moving in that space and ther jynt shadders wivvering and wayvering all roun . Not wanting to see no faces til I had to . Closer closer the rain hispering down on the old stoans and my new foot steps going on top of my old 1s . Trying to lissen and not lissen boath at Ice . Knowing the Ardship mus be lissening me as wel.  |p174Closer  and closer . No lookouts on the steps it wer like they wantit any body to come in as wantit to . There I wer then . By then I knowit what I wer going to see befor I seen it jus by lissening the regler way . The dogs helt back only the black leader come forit with me . They had Goodparley hung up by his hans tyd behynt him lames hed hung up Belnot Phist . I thot I wer going to vomit when I seen that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later every 1 wer going to have a tern . I cud feal it like it wer happening to me I cud feal my hevvyness pulling my arms out of ther sockits . Goodparley wer twissing and terning on that roap he wer pulling up his feet like he thot he cud Stan on air and ease his arms . There wer some twissit iron beams sticking out of the wall by them girt broakin machines theyd past the roap over 1 of them . There he hung and ternt and twissit and his jynt shadder twissing and terning with him and him crying and moaning with his head hung down . Orfing and his hevvys looking on . The Ardship and the Eusa folk looking on as wel . Faces like bad dreams . Faces with 3 eyes and no nose . Faces with 1 eye and a snout . Humps on backs and hans growing out of sholders wer the leas of it they had every kynd of crookitness and ther shapes and shadders wivvering and wayvering on the wall with the shadder of Goodparley twissing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poyntit his nose up at the shadders and he begun to howl . Some of the hevvys uppit bow but the black leader stayd where he wer . Orfing said , Down bows . ' Which they done . I said , What is it you want from him ? ' The Ardship said , I want to hear him sing like that its a good soun to lissen to . ' I said , Orfing whyve you hung him up like that ? ' Orfing said , I ai nt Orfing no mor Im Goodparley now . ' I said , Whats Goodparley then is he Orfing now ? ' Orfing said , He ai nt nothing no mor. '  |p175I  said , Then whyve you got him hung up whynt you let him go ? ' Orfing said , Now you know he ai nt a bloak you can jus let go of . Tern him luce and hewl be binsyern ever . He cant live qwyet you know he s all ways got to be doing and moving . ' I said , Stil you do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ardship said , O yes we do we have to hang him up sames he hung up my father we have to hang him up the sames he wer going to do me . ' Goodparley said , Riddley do nt you look at me like this o please do nt look at me this ai nt me youre seeing this ai nt me no mor . ' The Ardship said , O yes it is and its the reales part of you . Its the Littl Shyning Man of you in n it . Which thats what you ben looking for this long time Ive heard you say that times a nuff . ' I gone over to where the roap wer tyd to a iron ring on 1 of the girt machines and I untyd it I lowert Goodparley til his feet toucht the groun and his arms come down . He screamt when his arms come down . I cut the roap what tyd his hans . Dint know if I myt be the nex 1 hung up twissing and terning I had a suddn idear . Shaddery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wylst bending over Goodparley and helping him up I took the yellerboy stoan out of my pockit I slippit in to the fit up thinking theyd parbly sercht that all ready . Goodparley seen what I wer doing his littl eyes they sparkelt in the shadders . No 1 else took no noatis . Eusa faces and strait is they wer all stil looking at Goodparley not me . Orfings limpit face and the Ardships no eyes face staring like a blyn owl . Stretching his self out tords Goodparley and the way he lookit made me think of the Other Voyce Owl of the Worl . I said to Orfing , Is this HOAP OF A TREE then ? ' He said , Yes it is . Which theres hoap of a tree if its cut down yet itwi sprout agen . And them tinder branches theyre of wil not seaze . Tho the root of it works old in the earf and the stick of it dead on the groun yet even jus only the smel ofp176water and itwl bud and bring forit bowing like the plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mincery year on year it ben past down 1 shadder mincer to the nex .

Orfing said , This ai nt no vine its the tree what never dys . ' I said , And youre 1 of them branches what keaps coming are you . ' He said , Yes I am and growing seeds of the new . ' I said , Which Goodparley is that face whats dying out then is he . ' He said , It looks that way dun n it . Whatre you then are you the Asker of the Worl ? ' I said , It seams like every body elses got ansers only I havent got nothing only askings . ' He said , Now Iwl ask you some thing if youwl jus be so kynd wud you please han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , I havent got it have I. Theres a Rivver Sour runs thru Cambry which I sweetent it with that yeller boy . ' The Ardship said , Thats a ly if ever I heard 1 youve got it hid somers I can lissen that . ' Orfing said , Les jus have a look then shal we . ' Wel I had to take off all my cloes then and Orfing his self gone thru them . He lookit at my old black Punch for a long time he put his finger in the head and all then finely he put every thing back in my pockits and give me back my cloes . The Ardship said , May be it ai nt on you but youve hid it somers havent you . ' I said , No I never . ' With my hart jumping in me . He said , Whats the use of lying wewl jus hang you up the sames we done your new frend here . ' I said , Lissen me if you think Im lying . When I come to Cambry I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoans in the rivver I knowit I cudnt do nothing with them nor I dint want no 1 else to have them moon brother . ' In my head I wer singingSharna pax and get the poalWhen the Ardship of Cambry comes out of the hoalhard as I cud hoaping he wunt lissen nothing only that . Orfing said to the Ardship , Therewl be mor stoans soon a nuff weve got boatswl go where that 1 come from what we need is the knowing for our 1st try out with the stoans weve got . Have you got that knowing or not ? ' The Ardship said , I tol you I do nt know nothing til we gether . ' Orfing said , ' Wei you bes gether then . ' The Ardship said , What about these 2 then ? ' Orfing said , They do nt have no knowing nor no Belnot Phist nor no hevvys they cant do us nothing . ' The Ardship said , May be theres stil a littl some thing we can do them tho . ' Thats when the Eusa folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get the poalWhen the Ardship of Cambry comes out of the hoalWhich the way they sung it wernt like nothing I ever heard befor . Then I seen some thing flashing and like dantsing in the lite of the candis it wer a ax the Eusa folk wer passing it from han to han only it lookit like it wer zanting a bout all oansome . Looking at that shyning ax nor I cudnt take my eyes off it . All them Eusa faces with ther eyes shyning . All of Orfings hevvys which they ben Goodparleys hevvys wester day ther eyes wer shyning the same . Orfings littl eyes shyning as wel . That shyning ax zanting amongst the many agenst the few . Agenst the 2 of us . It wernt even Goodparley and me I wer thinking on jus then . It wer how that ax wer dantsing for the many . I knowit we wernt going out of that place the same as we come in . All this time Goodparley wer huddelt by me hep178wunt look up agen ice he seen that ax . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wer shyning pernear like that ax . He wer singing : Whatwl we take Whatwl we leaveWhatwl we chop chop chopWherewl we start Wherewl we end Whatwl we lop lop lop ' Finely Orfing said to the Ardship , Les not be talking of no chopping we never progammit nothing like that . ' The Ardship said , O no we wunt chop the Pry Mincer like he choppt my father we wunt never do that . Onlyes thing wewl do is make him lissen bettern what he s done so far . He s all ways telling and asking yet he do nt never lissen to no 1 nor nothing . ' By then the Eusa folk had holt of Goodparley and passing him 1 to the nex like they ben doing with the ax . He showit fight then only it dint help him nothing . That black leader dispeart like magic there wernt no 1 on our side only the 2 of us . I jumpt in to it and trying to pul Goodparley out of it only I got clubbit on the head and every thing gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a howling coming and going a roun me. 1st I thot it wer the black leader then I heard a slubbering and a moaning in it I knowit wer some thing else . It wer Goodparley he wer running and falling down and getting up agen running in to stoans and rubbl falling down and getting up agen slubbering and moaning the woal time there wernt no words in it .

Every 1 else wer qwyet too all of them wer looking at him like he wer magic now theyd made him blyn . Goodparley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please . Put me in front of the new Goodparley . ' I led him over and he poyntit to his blyn and bloody face and said to Orfing , This for you and what for me ? ' Orfing said , You know that wernt for me Abel that jus happent befor I cud stop it . ' Lissening to him I cudnt help noatising how ful fed he soundit . He said , Whats your asking ? ' Goodparley said , Plomercy Erny I ai nt asking nothing only jus a littl Plomercy .

It seamt like hed come pas the werst now jus in them littl few minims hed come to a qwyet place where he wer man a nuff for any thing . Orfing said , Abel you cudnt run a fun show to save your life . If I put you on the road with a fit up that figger on yourp180hans going to come the shadder mincer to Eusa and wel you know it . ' Goodparley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show nor Eusa are you afeart Iwl bring down your Mincery with Punch ?

Iwl give you letshow for that fun figger only you wont be showing Eusa no mor Iwl have a drop or 2 mor of your blood Im putting the down stroak on your scar . ' Goodparley larft then he said , O youre a careful 1 Erny youre afeart Iwl sly a roun making Eusa say the wrong things are you . ' Orfing said , You jus mynd what I say Abel do nt stress me now do nt strain me . ' Goodparley said , Iwl be careful not to do that Erny I realy wil . ' He opent his anrack and pull up his jumper and his vesses then . Here we go Erny , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my E. ' Which he steppit up to Orfing then with all them Eusa faces looking on and his hevvys from wester day . The Ardship now when he lissent to Goodparley you cud see even with his no eyes face he wer lissening him diffrent . The Ardship never ben afeart of Goodparley when Goodparley ben Pry Mincer but he wer afeart of him now . The woal lot of them wer that littl bit afeart they sust theyd put some kynd of Power in him when they blyndit him . There wer Goodparley with his belly uncovert agen the same as when I took my scar from him . Which the scab wernt even off my E it wer only 4 days back I took that scar . Which the wood slid out from unner me that nite and I had to grab him and he said , Take that for a blip . ' There wer them jynt shadders wivvering and wayvering . Orfings han with the knife poyntit at Goodparleysbelly . Theres words for down stroaking a scar as wel as putting 1 on . Orfing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone from my belly like Im gone from his hart . ' Orfing said , Do nt lissen for his voyce in you no mor . ' Goodparley said , Iwl have the sylents I know that . ' Orfing said , Do nt talk for him out of your memberment . You cant talk for Eusa now he s going a head and leaving you behynt . ' Goodparley said , I know that I know Im the 1 whats lef . ' Orfing said , Its E to Z then . ' Goodparley said , My blame my shame . ' Orfing cut the down stroak then . Goodparley took some mud off his boots and prest it in to the cut he said , Inland be my healing . ' Orfing said , That ai nt in the wording . ' Goodparley said , It is now . ' Then we wer outside in the rain and the dark and Goodparley with a bloody clout roun his head . In my mynd I cud stil see that ax shyning and dantsing in the candl lite I wer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The handl of that ax ben what they blyndit him with . It all happent so fas and now there I wer with blyn Goodparley took on me . When I said Iwd stay with him I never give no thot to how long . A mooning ? A year ? The res of his life ? I took his fit up on my back . The littl man all ways carrys the fit up the big 1 is the hevvy . Goodparley said , Let me carry the fit up Riddley its me as put this woal thing on our backs . ' I said , Its me as took it on with you . ' He said , Do nt you see it ai nt going to heavy me down its going to hol me up . ' I let him take the fit up and I took his bundel . Here come the Bernt Arse pack then with the black leader . Goodparley said , I ai nt ben this close to dogs this long time . ' I said , You myswel get use to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I dint noatis them doing no hevvying in there jus a littl wyl back .

They had ther oan progams . We headit out of Fork Stoan going Norf . Goodparley said , Where we going ? ' I said , You tol me Granser done healing and curing . ' He said , Gransers dead . ' I said , No he ai nt he s berning chard coal in the aulders acrost the rivver from Good Mercy . He tol me to tel you he wer Drop John the Foller Man . ' Goodparley dint say nothing to that he wer qwyet for a long time . Jus walking a long keaping nexy but not holding on to me . In the dark I cud see the clout roun his head moving he wer shaking his head and tsissing thru his teef . Finely he said , O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding my hump . I stuck that knife in him and I run . Looks like I dint have it in me to finish him . May be I never had it in me to start my self nyther . ' I said , No 1 never starts his self . ' He said , Yes they do . You do nt start the life in you thats like a rivver running in you stil there comes a time when you push your can boat out in to the middl of it . ' I said , Or you put your self on the road to the hart of the wud . ' He said , How dyou spel that ? ' I said , W-u-d . ' He said , You think this is the road to the hart of my wud ?

Theywdve ben looking a woal lot sharper a long that shoar if they ben waiting on a boat with all the storm there ben that nite . May be that bloak in the boat bint even heading for Inland may be he jus ben blowt here . ' Goodparley said , ' Wel may be . Any how it do nt matter now . That yeller boy is luce now and of it with us . ' I said , All that what you said about the Punch show wer that jus to get the yellerboy stoan out of there ? ' He said , No it wernt . I wantit to hol on to it the same as you but what I said about the Punch show wer strait it jus happent youd put the 2 of them to gether .

The old man never dyd nor the boy never be come a man . Every thing is stil where it wer may be when I grow up Iwl be Pry Mincer . ' On we gone roading thru the dark and rain roading for the aulders and the chard coal berning . In your mynd places bep184come the name of what happent in them . Like Iwd say in my mynd befor Cambry ' or after Cambry ' meaning befor or after what happent there . Thinking on the aulders it wer a jumbl of words and picters all mixt up . All kynds of diffrent things in it when I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ardshipd said about his dead father : I can feal him in me when its moving I can feal him in me when its stil . ' Why that ? May be becaws the aulders put me in mynd of seed of the berning and hart of the chyld . The berning chyld and the dead father may be its all 1 thing . And Goodparley trying all them long years to man for his self that wer part of it the same . With Granser and the bloody meat and boan . So roading thru that rainy dark my mynd wer saying to its self : Now for the aulders . Saying the name of what wer going to be yet not knowing what itwd be . Jus saying that over and over : Now for the aulders . We wernt doing no mor talking we sunk in to a sylents . It wer slow going Goodparley wernt up to much by then . Hed had like a hy after they blyndit him . Hy on stil being a live nor not being Pry Mincer no Mor . Hy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear off he be come a plain woondit man slow and herting . Time we come over the Bundel Downs it wer broad in the day . Stil raining it wer . Looking down from the hy groun in to the aulders you cud see in to the chard coal berners fents . Smoak and steam coming up in the rain from the harts and huts all huddelt they wer crouching in the wood like girt old shaggy wet naminals sleaping .

' And wankt with it , ' I said . Yet I done like he tol me I gone in to that littl hump back hut with Granser . He wer pounding the yellerboy stoan to a fine powder . Then he done the same with some chard coal . Done it with a boal and pounder . He had the Saul &; Peter all ready that wer kirstels like salt . He took littl measurs and measuring out yellerboy and chard coal and Saul &; Peter . Mixing them all to gether then and me watching .

' Which he dint anser me nothing then I ternt to look at him and he had Gransers pounder sticking out of the front of his head . Clout stil rapt roun his head and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung over the place a kynd of scortchy smel a kynd of stinging scortchy smel and the grey smoak driffing thru the blue smoak of the chard coal harts . Twean lite it wer the 1st dark coming on . Bat lite it wer and dimminy the pink and red stumps glimmering in the coppices like loppt off arms and legs and the rivver hy and hummering . The dogs wer howling nor it wernt like no other howling I ever heard it wer a kynd of wyld hoapless soun it wer a torn and oansome yoop yaroo it soundit like they wer runnying on ther hynt legs and telling like thin black men and sad . Crying ther yoop yaroo ther sad tel what theyd all ways knowit theywd have to tel agen . I gone to where Gransers head wer on the poal . His eyes wer closd his mouf wer shut .

I took a las look at Goodparley I Z thot I myt see vines and leaves growing out of his mouf . Then I slung his fit up and my bundel on my back and off I slyd.  |p196My  feet begun to walk me down rivver tords Cambry . Thats where the senter is .

Dark nite it wer Dark of the Moon but where the woodlings link off to barrens I cud feal it on my face the open of it and I had a fealing inside me I never had befor . Sour groun and dead the barrens are you cudnt grow nothing on them only the dry dus blowing in the summer and the grey mud in the winter . Even the wind blowing the dus is some thing moving tho it ai nt jus only dead groun in a stilness . Seeds blow in the wind and what is earf but a deadness with life growing out of it ? Rottin leaves and dead branches and naminal shit and that it all makes live earf on the dead groun and if you look at woodlings edge all roun the barrens youwl see the runty coming up where skin of earf growit back on nekkit groun . Nekkit groun what ben the bloody meat and boan of Bad Time covering its self with skin of earf and grass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my groun . Here I Stan . We ben roading like all ways with the black leader josseling nexy but 2 way acrost the barrens he pusht his nose in to my han . He never done nothing like that befor I cudnt beleave it . Him what lookit like Death on 4 legs with his yeller eyes what dint even care if he livet'or dyd and he wantit me to pet him . Thats when I cryd for the dead . After a wyl I cud feal on my face a littl stilness where the wind wer cut off I cud hear the sylents of the stannings of thep197Power Ring . Feal the goast of old Power circeling by over me . Only this time I fealt a Power in me what circelt with it . Membering when that thot come to me : THE ONLYES POWER IS NO POWER . Wel now I sust that wernt qwite it . It ai nt that its no Power .

When Goodparleymade some of the hevvys help the qwirys on others of them they wer ready for the bringdown which I jus clymt on it and movit with it . ' I said , What dyou think wil happen now dyou think the hevvys at Fork Stoan wil sen ther oan farring seakert tryer to bargam some thing with the other siders ?

Nor I never fealt right when them hevvys wer calling me Goodparleynor I wunt put that name on you nyther les jus call it Walker &; Orfing . ' I said , Why not Orfing &; Walker ? ' He said , The name as comes 1st is the man as works the figgers and does the voyces . Which I never ben no good at that I never do nothing only strait man for the patter . So Walker &; Orfings what itwl have to be . ' Erny slung the fit up then and we gone back to the out poast . Which I fealt like sitting down to a tabel with a candl and putting some words on paper . That ben the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabel now . Longs we had the dogs to keap look out we thot why not hoal up there and til such time as any new hevvys myt be coming in . Its ben a 14nt now tho nor there bint no blip of hevvys nor no 1 else . It looks to me like that Fools Circel is broakin now I do nt think therewl be no mor regler hevvys nor Eusa folk in dead towns from now on . Parbly all the hevvys and any Eusa folk whatre stil a live theyre all too binsy running a roun trying to go bang . Plus a woal lot of other peopl as wel by now parbly . Fars we know there bint no mor bangs yet but we do nt have the leas idear whats going to happen . Right now there ai nt even no Pry Mincer its what they call a care maker Mincery with regenneril guvner men from the Ram at all the forms . How it looks to Erny and me and strapping the lates from what littl datter weve got we pirntow the other siders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mor farring seakert tryers . Parbly itwl be a littl wyl befor they sen a nother 1 to Inland but the thing is luce now . By nex mooning Iwl bet you can walk from here to other side withoutp203getting your feet wet jus stepping from 1 boat to the nex and every 1 of them boats after yellerboy . Orfing and me we know weare living on burrow time but then who ai nt . The way things are now it ai nt jus only you do nt know whos going to go bang nex you do nt even know where the arrer myt come from with your name on it you cant be too sure whos your frend and whos your nemminy life ai nt qwite as simpl as it use to be . It use to be if you wer agenst the Ram youwd be agenst the forms becaws you knowit they wer all 1 thing jus like a body and its head . Now the head myt say 1 thing only you do nt know what the body wil do . 1 thing Lucky them dogsre stil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do nt worry too much about getting snuck . Orfings getting a littl dog frendy now even tho when he come oansome from Fork Stoan to Cambry he said he ben measuringhis life from 1 tree to the nex and when he come to the barrens he said he jus tol his self 1 way or a nother he parbly wunt be a live too much longer . Which ice he got use to that idear then every minim he wer stil a live he wer that much a head . Walker &; Orfing . I liket the idear of making up shows only with things how they are now I wernt all that kean to road no show I ratherwd live qwyet and ly low til we seen who come out on top . It wer Orfing as wantit to start showing . I said , Wunt it be bes to wait til things settl down a littl ? ' He said , The sooner we do whats on us to do the sooner thingswl settl down . ' I said , You know Erny theres places where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put foot . You what brung down Goodparley and let them crookit peopl put his eyes out . He said , ' Wei Riddley if I brung him down for any thing it ben becaws he thot you cud move the out side of things frontways and leave the in side to look after its self . Which I think its the in side has got to do the moving its got to move every thing and its got to move us as wel . If I say diffrent time after this itwl be fearbelly talking I know I ai nt brave . Butp204thats what Im saying now . Its moving me the way its moving me and Im going with it fars I can . ' So we begun to ready our selfs for the road . When I unbundelt Goodparleys fit up to do a littl prackters work it come to me agen the 2ness of things . Any other fit up I ever seen there ben 1 bag of figgers in it which you hang it inside when youre showing then youve got the figgers ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theres 2 sets of figgers . Theres the is for the Eusa show then theres the is for the Punch show . That show what he never showit to no crowd only odd times done it for his self and that ice for me . You take a figger out of the bag nor it ai nt nothing only some colourt clof with a paintit wood head and hans . Then you put it on . You put your head finger in the head you put your arm fingers in the arms then that figger looks roun and takes noatis it has things to say . Which they wont all ways be things youwd think of saying o no them wood heads the hart of the wood is in them and the hart of the wud and all . They have ther knowing and they have ther saying which you bes lissen for it you bes let it happen . I never look for my reveal til its ben . ' Thats what my dad said time back . My dad the connexion man . In my woal life Ive only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I begun with trying to put it to gether poal by poal only my reveal dint come that way it snuck me woaly . I wer keaping that in memberment now . Ready to cry ready to dy ready for any thing is how I come to it now . In fear and tremmering only not running a way . In emtyness and ready to be fult . Not to lern no body nothing I cant even lern my can self all I can do is try not to get in front of whats coming . Jus try to keap out of the way of it . You myt talk about how youre going to show you myt think about it only on the nite there it is if its the 1st time or the 100th it ai nt never happent befor it ai nt nothing you know any thing about . You look out thru the weave of the back cloth and you see the torches shimmying and glimmering you hear a hummering and a mummering from the crowd in frontp205of you . Theres a prickling all over your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark . Time back is in them Punch figgers . Dead hans and gone carvit them heads and colourt them and follering some idear they dint jus happen randem . Its a lot of work to carve a head that wel you have to have it in you to begin with then you have to take the neak of it thru all the diffrent episodes of the work from the rough cut to the finel smooving and the pryming and the painting of it . I knowit wel them figgers never ben made up jus only for that 1 littl show what Goodparleyd showt me . It ai nt in the natur of a show to be the same every time it ai nt like a story what you pas down trying not to change nothing which even then the changes wil creap in . No a figger show its got its can chemistery and fizzics . What it is its all ways trying to fynd out what it is jus now this same and very minim going thru its chaynjis . Which Ive wrote that in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Littl Shyning Man tol Eusa of . Punch says to me , What am I ? ' Says it to me in his can voyce which now I can speak that voyce the same as Goodparley done . In the figger bag I foun a littl thing its 21itt1 curvit peaces of iron with a thin peace of clof rapt roun and in be twean so its like when you hol a blade of grass be twean your thums to shril with it . The iron holding the clof the way your thums wud the grass . This littl thing you put it in your mouf and when its parper wet you can do Punchs voyce with it . Orfing tol me its what they call a swazzl . And Pooty . I know she ai nt jus only a plain sow . Ive wrote down early on in this writing that song Lorna Elswint sung me on the nite of my naming day . That Moon Pig song . Iwl give odds Pootys mixt up with that Moon Sow . You look at that sow face of hers and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for meating youre looking at some 1 ben offert to . And that pig babby that pig chyld . Meat chyld . Theres other figgers Goodparley never showit in that show he done for me . Theres some great grean naminal with longp206joars and ever so many teef . Theres a black man and other figgers as wel Iwl never know ther story . Them in the 1 bag and of coarse in the other bag the other lot and the Little Shyning Man with them . Which he s qwite a peace of work that Littl Shyning Man . The way he s made he s all wood he s got a woal varnisht wood body with parper arms and legs and riggit with wires so he comes in 2 or slyds back in to 1 . He s the only figger there is with a cock and balls . Like it says in the Eusa Story when he comes in 2 his cock and balls theyre on his lef side his head and neck theyre on his right . He s hung from a pully you work him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 and you slyd him to gether the 2 Is of him come to gether with a clack . I wunner if Goodparley ever thot of a bang when he heard that . Theres figgers in that bag you never seen in a show . You get to wunnering if you gone down deap a nuff in that bag if you mytnt get right the way down to Bad Time and fynd out all what realy happent . Theres Eusas 2 boys in there I never seen them befor . Cant say for cern its them but I lissen it is. 1 has red eyes 1 has yeller . Them 2 pairs of eyes wide open all them years in the dark inside that bag . Dogs . Folleree and Folleroo with ther toofy joars opening and closing they want to talk like men. 1 figger tho. 1 figger he s the same and very 1 in boath bags of figgers . Mr Clevver . Which he s Mr On The Levvil and he s call it Drop John as wel . There he is the name changes but he do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the 1 . He s your lad for clevver work or Drop Johning which ever myt be neadit there he is the boath of him plus the goast of him . Same red face and littl black beard and the same horns growing out of his head . Same red cloes even . All them diffrent figgers in the 2 bags only he ai nt diffrent he s the same . You begin to wunner myt he be the 1 Big 1 of it ? Or the 1 Littl 1 of it . Or maybe there ai nt no such thing as a Big 1 or a Littl 1 its jus only all 1 and you see what diffrent things you see in the chaynjing lites of the diffrent times of the girt dants of the every thing . Sum tyms bytin sum tyms bit . If youre a show man then what ever happens is took in to your figgers and your fit up its took in to your show . If you do nt knowp207whats happent sooner youwl hear of it later youwl hear your figgers tel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the end of my spear hewl be in my shows I do nt know how but hewl be there . That crow what call it , Fall ! Fall ! Fall ! ' and my smasht father that greyling morning at Widders Dump and that old leader with his yeller eyes and woar down teef . Gransers head glimmering in the twean lite and Goodparley sitting qwyet in amongst the black and nekkit aulders loppt off pink and red in the hart of his wud with the stoan in his head and the twean lite holding its breaf and lissening . In amongst it all the thot of may be I wer the aulder kincher . May be the idear of it ben waiting all them years for me to come a long and be it . Wel of coarse there wer the matter of letshow . We dint know if that care making Mincery wer going to let us run luce with our fit up and our 2 bags of figgers . We pult datter and we pirntowt we wer roading Goodparleys show which he ben give letshow by Orfing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wer letshow on that fit up which that wer good a nuff for us . If them guvner men thot diffrent wewd parbly fynd out soon a nuff . So we got our selfs ready and off we gone with our fit up and our figgers and our dog crowd . It wer in boath our mynds to do our 1st show at Weaping Form which that ben Bad Mercy Fents time back it ben Goodparleys hoam fents when he ben littl . Its about the same farness from Cambry as How Fents only its Wes of Cambry and its wel Wes of the Sour its on the A251 2 or 3 faggers Norf of Moal Arse . Its on the track to Fathers Ham which roun there its hard line Eusa country moren some other places are . Some say Mr Clevver use to live in Fathers Ham befor he come to Cambry . Any how here we come out of Cambry on a grey day with a littl girzel and roading Wes for Weaping on the old iron track . Dogs strung out in parper roading form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus 2 on each wing them dogs are real hevvys . I askit Erny if he dint think we bes proach up to that gate without no dogs and say we forkt off from a **27;7110;TOOLONG to protect me from the Boisterousness of the Rabble . We descended finally to the Lower Dungeons , past the Press Room , where Prisoners who refus 'd to plead were press 'd with iron Weights , and wail 'd horribly under their Torture . And adjacent to that Pit of Terrors we saw a still more terrible Room where , of Old , the Hangman us 'd to seethe the Quarter 'd Limbs of Traitors in Pitch , Tar , and Oil . ' T was not now in Use , and thank the Goddessfor that , since , had the Smell of cooking Flesh and Tar been added to the Smell of Excrement , ' t would have made an e'en more nauseous Brew than that which caus 'd my Guts to heave and made me glad I 'd eaten no Breakfast ! In the very lowest Dungeon , chain 'd piteously in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his Legs in heaviest Irons , his Body clad in the filthiest of Rags , sat our Lancelot , his beauteous Form doubl 'd o'er as in Pain . Littlehat brib 'd his Guard with a Shilling to leave us alone with Lancelot for a Time , and tenderly , my Heart breaking with the Pain of seeing him in Circumstances so much Reduced from his former Glory , I sat down at his Bare Feet and held ' em in my Hands , chafing ' em warm , e'en tho ' Rats scurried nearby and Vermin crawl 'd . Ne'er had I been indiff'rent to Vermin before , but Lancelot 's Plight engaged my whole Heart and made me forget my wretched Surroundings . For a Moment or two , he scarce acknowledged my Presence . " They have been hard on him , " Littlehat said , " fer they fear his Influence upon the Prisoners due to his Miraculous Escape upon the last Occasion , an ' tho ' they permit the likes of me to walk about at will , they saw him be stripp 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him Freedom of the Rules . " " Garnish ? " I askt . " Pray what is that ? " " ' T is the Pay the Convicts expect from each new Prisoner . 0 , Madam Fanny , there are a thousand little Fees in Gaol  --  Payment to the other Convicts , to the Turnkey , to the Cook who dresses the Charity Meat ( e'en tho ' most Convicts ne'er see , much less taste it ) , to the Swabbers ( e'en tho ' the whole Place is Filthy as ye see an ' not once swabb 'd in twenty Years ) , an ' e'en to the Hangman , who , in Former Times , did seethe the Limbs of Traitors all Day long in Pitch , an ' now dispatches the better Part of these Poor Wretches at Tyburn Tree . Some innocent Prisoners are freed at the Old Bailey only to be thrown back into Gaol because they can not pay their Fees ! " " What will it cost to get Lancelot Freedom of the Rules ? "  | " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would make an Example of him , break his Soul , as ' t were , upon the Wheel , as they could ne'er break his Body . " " And where are the others , " I enquir 'd of Littlehat , " the Merry Men ? " " Black Paul , bless his Pyrate Heart , escap 'd , taking his Latin Learning with him  --  where , we know not . An ' Mr. Twitch was kill 'd upon the Thames , God rest his Soul . Likewise poor Sotwit an ' gentle Mr. Thunder . Puck Goodfellow an ' Francis Bacon made off , too , an ' presently I hope fer Word of ' em . Sir Fopling an ' Beau Monde are here as well , tho ' Fop is grievous ill with Gaol Distemper , an ' as fer the others , I can not say . God bless ' em all . " " Who turn 'd you in ? " I askt . " Who was that Traitor ? " At this , Lancelot came to Life , and Fury lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The Wretched Captain o ' the Hannibal turn 'd me in an ' took the Swag an ' the Price upon me Head as well ! I trusted him , I did , an ' swore he ne'er dealt in Human Flesh . Alas , what a Fool was I ! " And with that he slump 'd back down again and moan 'd , whereupon Littlehat whisper 'd in my Ear : " I 've ne'er seen our belov 'd Lancelot so cast down . Pray , Madam Fanny , can ye beg or borrow Guineas enough to get him Freedom of the Rules ? Fer they mean to make him suffer more than the common Lot of Convicts an ' I fear fer the Soundness of his Mind . " " I 'll try , good Littlehat , good Friend , " said I. But i'faith , I knew not how I could relieve Lancelot when I could not relieve myself . Just then Lancelot came to Life again , lookt up with a Wildnessin his Eyes , and cried , " Why hast thou forsaken me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd me , but the Look of Betrayal upon his haunted Face was unmistakable . Now I , too , fear 'd for Lancelot 's Sanity and understood Littlehat 's Concern . " They sold me Soul fer thirty Pieces o ' Silver ! " rav 'd Lancelot . Then he sank down again , moaning like a Woman in Travail . " Pray go , " said Littlehat , " an ' try not to despair . When he is quite himself he says he loves ye best in all this World . He raves now an ' he hath forgot his Golden Tongue , his Faith in God an ' Robin Hood  --  fer the Betrayal by the Captain of the Hannibal went hard with him . Friendship 's all to Lancelot , an ' Honour amongst Thieves was all his Creed ; now he sees his Confederate Thieves in as harsh a Light as all the Great World of Lawyers , Statesmen , an ' all such respectable Rogues . ' T was e'er thus withp202Lancelot  --  one Minute high upon his Fancies an ' his Words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he were a raving Bedlamite . Go , Madam Fanny . Tell me where to send fer ye . " I gave the address of Coxtart 's House in the West End , praying Littlehat would not know ' t was a Brothel . Then I threw my Arms around his Neck and kiss 'd him , bent again to Lancelot and kiss 'd his chilly Cheak , and fled from the Depths of the Prison like Persephonefleeing Hades to shelter in the Arms of her Mother Demeter in Blossoming Spring . But sure Coxtart was no Demeter ( and perhaps I was no Persephone ) , yet I would find a Way to rescue Lancelot , I vow'difI had to be deflower 'd ten thousand Times ! 0 I would study Devious Ways to cheat that sly old Coxtart out of Guineas that I had sweated for upon my own ( poor but honest ) Back ; and if I was bound to be a Trollop for a Time , at least ' t was in the sweet Name of Loyalty to Lancelot , and ( dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' London ; Dissension in the Body Politick , and a most amazing Revolution , which Whigs will applaud but Tories may grumble of ; after which our Heroine learns sev'ral important Lessons , which we hope will help her her whole Life long , but ne'ertheless is mov 'd to an Act of great Desperation which causes her untold Anguish and Agony . I FLED THRO ' THE Streets of London then , as if Pluto himself ( or indeed the Grim Reaper ) were pursuing me . The Soles of my Feet felt each Stone thro ' the worn Leather of my Shoes , and the Sweat ran down my Face like Raindrops down a Window Pane . The Day was clear and hot ; the Sun shone strongly . My Stays were fair to bursting from my heavy Breathing and the Strain and Exertion of running . Perhaps I shall run so hard , I shall lose this Babe , I thought ; for the Treachery of my Body against my Mind in conceiving a Babe at this worst of all possible Times was ne'er far from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clock and saw that ' t was already half past Eleven ! I had miss 'd my Meeting with Kate and doubtless won her Enmity for Life ! I ran harder now , along the Length of Fleet Street , then thro ' the Temple Bar , adorn 'd with the Figures of Kings and Queens below , and the horribly rotting Head of a Traitor upon an iron Spike above . As I ran thro ' , a ragged-looking Man offer 'd me the Use of a Spying-Glass for a Ha'penny so that I might better see the grisly Traitor 's Head ; but I shook my own Head with Distaste and Dislike  --  for what could be the Joy in feasting my Eyes upon this gruesome Relick ?  --  and ran furiously onward . The Streets were crowded now , and ' t was not always easy to make my Way . People stood aside with Wonder at the Fury of my Running ; but oft ' an unruly Chairman took special Delight inp204pinning me ' gainst a Wall , or hitting my Back with the Poles of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one Turning and became so distraught with the Lateness of the Hour , sheer Weariness , and Despair that I compleatly lost my Way in some filthy back Alleys and had no Notion whatsoe'er of how to return to the West End . My Clothes reekt of the Prison ; my Hair flew about my Face like a Madwoman 's ; and finding myself lost , late , doubtless in grievous Trouble with both Kate and Coxtart , I began to weep with Self-Pity for my Plight . What had I hop 'd for when I went to Lancelot ? Had I hop 'd for his Aid in my Perilous Predicament ? If indeed I had , ' t was clear as Crystal that he could not help me in his present State . I would have to draw upon whate'er Reserves of Strength I had and be his Saviour instead ! Friendship and Love both demanded it ; and tho ' I did not feel myself to be equal to the Task , I would have to learn to be stronger than I had e'er been in the Past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch my Breath . I mopp 'd my fever 'd Brow and daub 'd my moist Eyes with the dirty Hem of my Petticoat . Just then , there came the Cry of " Gardy-loo ! " above and I darted out of the Way scarce in Time to avoid being drench 'd with the unlovely Contents of someone 's Chamber-Pott ! ' T was all I needed in my Mood of Dark Despair , and the sheer Absurdity of it stopp 'd my Tears as they sprang and made me laugh where I had previously cried . Very well , then , Madam Fanny , said I to myself , since Fate herself hath decreed that you would miss the Contents of the Chamber-Pott , ' t is clearly an Omen you will survive ! Nay  --  survive and prosper . If Lancelot can not save you , you 'll save yourself and save him into the Bargain . Onward , Fanny ! Onward , Fanny Hackabout-Jones ! Thus I began to run again ( tho ' whither , I knew not ) ; and as I ran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would direct me to the West End , and I remember 'd , all in a Jumble , as if in the Moment before Death , the Losses of the last Weeks : the Loss of my Childhood Home at Lymeworth , of my Step-Mother , Lady Bellars , of my Faith in First Love ( so cruelly betray 'd by Lord Bellars ) ; I remember 'd , too , the dastardly Murders of the Good Witches , the Loss of Lustre , the Loss of my Great Epick Poem ( yet in its Infancy ) , the Loss of my Friends the Merry Men , and worst of all , the Loss of Lancelot  --  or , dare I say it , the Loss of Lancelot 's Mind ! But just then Lines from the Witches ' Prophecy came back top205me , I know not how . " Your own Father you do not know , " I remember 'd . " Your Daughter will fly across the Seas . Your Purse will prosper , your Heart will grow . You will have Fame , but not Heart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whate'er the Meaning , I must not now throw myself headlong into the Thames . " From your Child-Womb will America grow , " the puzzling Prophecy continu 'd . " By your Child-Eyes , you will be betray 'd " ; well , that had already occurr 'd with Lord Bellars ' wretched Letter ! " You will turn Blood into driven Snow . " Puzzling , puzzling in the extream . Whereupon the last Line echo 'd in my Ears as if spoken by the strong Voice of Joan Griffith herself : " By your own strong Heart will the Devil be stay 'd ! " ' T was hopeful , hopeful indeed ! I might become strong if only I could believe myself so ! I might prosper if only I could conquer my Terrors ! I might save Lancelot if only I could save myself ! By the Time I found my Way back to Mother Coxtart 's ( after many wrong Turnings and the well-meaning Assistance of a poor Half-Wit , who claim 'd to know the Way but knew it e'en less than I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mother Coxtart had cruelly lockt Kate in the Cellar for her Deviltry in setting me free ; the Butler she had threaten 'd to flog within an Inch of his Life for his Laxity in letting me escape ( tho ' i'faith , she knew he 'd lain abed with her ) ; and the other Girls were also trembling in Terror of her Wrath . This was the unhappy Scene into which I return 'd . Since ' t was clear that neither Lyes nor Demonstrations of Submission would avail me of any Mercy whatsoe'er with her , I made the Decision to brazen it out  --  to stand upon my Honour and Dignity rather than upon my Knees ! " Well  --  you wretched Baggage ! " Mother Coxtart exlaim 'd . " Where have ye been that ye dare return here smelling like the Fleet Ditch itself after all my Kindnesses to ye ! " " Madam , " said I , " I know not the Kindnesses of which you speak . I have workt hard and been paid nothing . I have been ravish 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne the Indignity of having my Dishonour watch 'd by Swains who paid you for the Privilege . And tho ' I did not rebel at this , I must now declare that I am a Free Woman , not a Guinea Slave , and I 'd sooner starve upon the Streets than have you treat me like a common Cur to be chain 'd at your Back Door ! " At this Speech , the other Girls gasp 'd in Awe , and Coxtart herself was stunn 'd , for ne'er before had one of her Wenches dar 'd to stand up against her Authority . I'faith , I knew not where I gotp206the Courage for it ; ' t was as if some Spirit possess 'd me and spoke thro ' my Lips . " Filthy Baggage ! " were all the Words Coxtart found upon this Occasion . " How dare ye address me with such Impertinence ? " " Madam , " said I , " I mean no Impertinence to you . I mean only to assert that I 'll be treated like a Woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will be paid some Share of it ; if I must leave this House upon Errands of my own Concern , I 'll not be question 'd like a Criminal . I'faith , Madam , I ask only for the Rights that all the Great Philosophers assert belong alike to ev'ry Human Soul ! For are we not , as the Third Earl of Shaftesbury says , Rational Creatures who crave Generosity , Gratitude , and Virtue as we crave Life itself ' ? Are not the twin Senses of Right and Wrong as native to us as Natural Affection itself ? " At this , Mother Coxtart was mute with sheer Perplexity . Her Mouth hung open as if ' t were a Trap for Flies , and she presently began to sputter and shake like a Tea Kettle o'er an open Fire . " Fie on yer Impertinence , Strumpet ! If ye have such a fine Protector in this Mr. Chaffberry , why doth he not keep ye then ? " But ' t was clear to see I had fought her with Weapons beyond her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enraged . Meanwhile , the other Wenches , beginning to perceive that perhaps some Good might come from this for them as well , harken 'd to me e'er more attentively . " Madam , " said I , " I demand that each of us be paid each Time she entertains a Swain , that we be treated like reasonable Creatures and not unthinking Beasts , that our Keep be tallied in a Book of Accounts open for all to see , and that it not be more than you yourself must pay for the Provisions . " " Trollop ! " she scream 'd . " Ye mean to ruin me ! Out with ye into the Streets again . I 'll not tolerate such Impertinence ! I take the Risques and pay the Landlord here , I feed yer ungrateful Mouths and clothe ye like the Ladies ye are not ! Why should I countenance such Mutiny ? Damn yer whoring Eyes ! Begone ! " Whereupon she dramatically opens the Front Door and stands , Arms folded , with a curt Nod of her hennaed Head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Merciful Heaven , I think , have I gone too far , stretch 'd the Limits of her Endurance quite to the Breaking Point ? But I dare not show my Indecision nor my Turmoil . With Chin held high and my stinking Skirts trailing in my Wake as if I were the Queen of Mudpyes and Chamber-Potts , I make ready to depart , with all Mock-Dignity . I advance towards the Door , trembling within and calm without ,  |p207|pause  a Moment to bid Farewell to the other Wenches who stand agog at my unwonted Courage , and say : " Gentle Ladies , thanks for all your Kindnesses to me . I wish you well , " whereupon I turn upon my Heel , step across the Doorjamb mincingly , as if ' t were a Basket of Eggs , and out the Door . But no sooner is my Back turn 'd and it is clear that I am really going , than a Cry rises at my Back as if a Mob of Maenads had just glimps 'd the Great God Pan himself ! To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first runs forward , grabs me by the Skirts , and cries ( as much to me as to Mother Coxtart ) : " If Fanny goes , then I go , too ! " Whereupon the consumptive Roxana joins the Cry , and next the red-cheakt Molly ! All three restrain me there without the Door , challenging Coxtart for the first Time in their Cow'ring Lives ! She is aghast , agog , amaz 'd . She turns and looks at us , the Four Mutineers , and then back at the other Girls  --  Raven-hair 'd Druscilla , the Creole Evelina  --  wond'ring , no doubt , how soon they , too , will rebel against the Divine Right of her Queenship . Like the Canny Politician that she is , she decides ' t is best to bargain now , whilst two Wenches yet remain in her Party , rather than waiting for the Mutiny , nay the Bloody Revolution , of all her Charges ! " Ladies , Ladies , Ladies , " says she , in a new , gentle Tone . " Pray sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anger ne'er solv 'd the Woes of Humankind , and War is e'er a poor Alternative to Peace . Let us reason with each other then , like true Philosophers . " I could scarce believe my Ears ! Was it possible I 'd won ? Had my Brazenness accomplish 'd what Submission ne'er could ? Slowly , with Dignity ( and hiding my great Relief at being taken back again ) , I enter 'd Mother Coxtart 's House once more , closing the Door behind me , whilst my loyal Confederates , Nell , Roxana , and Molly , walkt two Paces behind like Ladies in Waiting . ' T was thus I learnt my first Great Lesson in the Conduct of Diplomacy . I had sought only to cover my own Fault in coming Home so late , and in my Brashness had spoken like the very Spirit of Lancelot Robinson himself  --  whose Notions of Fair Play and Camaraderie I had learnt during my Travels with the Merry Men . Little did I dream that Coxtart would truly propose a CounterSchemewhereby each Wench earn 'd a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seniority and Industriousness ! But now I saw that my Determination had frighten 'd Coxtart , particularly when she saw all too clearly the Threat of her most valu 'd Wenches all departing at once ; and suddenly my bluffing Brazenness to acquit myself of Blame had turn 'd me into the Heroine of all the House !  |p208'Twas  droll indeed ! ' T was perhaps a Lesson to me . For when I worried and fretted with Indecision , trembl 'd lest I be turn 'd out of Doors , no Good came of it  --  only more Worry and Fretting  --  but when I pretended to the Courage which I lackt , Coxtart herself capitulated and the other Wenches declar 'd me reigning Queen ! All of ' em , that is , but Kate . For her part , she had been lockt in the Cellar upon my Account , and now nurs 'd bitter Enmity ' gainst me . I tried to reason with her , to tell her that henceforth e'en she would have a Share in all she earn 'd , but she was bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , then trusts a little , is betray 'd , and now hates Humankind for good . Friendship came hard to Kate . She had put out the first delicate Tendrils of that rare Plant ; and when they were so unkindly lopp 'd off by my Carelessness , Enmity took Root in their Stead . " I knew I should ne'er have trusted ye , " she said bitterly , when we were . " " What kept ye , then ? " " I dare not say . " " Filthy Swine , " she mutter 'd . " Perhaps ye met the Scoundrel that put ye in the Family Way . I 'll tell Coxtart that , I will . " " Tell her , then , tho ' I swear ' t is a Lye . Have you no Wits about you ? Do you not understand that you , too , will profit from this new Scheme ? " ( For tho ' Kate had been lockt in the Cellar during my great Mutiny ' gainst Coxtart , the other Wenches had related the Incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embellishments as a clever Comedian adds to the Words of the poor Poet who first penn 'd his thund'ring Lines in a draughty Garret . ) " Who requires such Foolishness ? " she said , with great Disdain . " I learnt to survive an ' prosper before ye arrived here , Madam Fanny . Ye think yerself the Saviour o ' the Girls  --  those simp'rin ' Strumpets that are in Bondage because they can do nought but dream o ' their Freedom ! I 've been savin ' Shillin 's these half a dozen Years an ' mean to have a Shop o ' me own thro ' me own hard Work and me own lovin ' Man . Poo  --  I care not a Fig fer yer fine Words to Coxtart an ' all yer fake Philosophy . Ye ne'er did it the hard Way as I did , ye Baggage ! " Thus I learnt , ( for Kate continu 'd to hate me passionately , despite all I did to make amends ) that Gratitude is , for some Mortals , the most unwelcome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunt of Woman 's Lot wish all their Sisters to be as unfortunate as they ; that not only doth Misery love Company , but those who account themselves amongst the Miserable have a positive Hatred for those who would lure them amongst the Happy ; and many Lessons of the like Nature  --  too num'rous to account for ' em all here , without unbearably delaying our Tale . Now , I began to work like a very Devil , both to secure Lancelot Freedom of the Rules , and because , having won a Share of my own Earnings ( tho ' admittedly a small one ) , I was more eager than e'er before to play the false Virgin  --  or any other mischievous Role Coxtart devis 'd for me  --  so long as it would yield the most Guineas . Of the many Times my Maidenhead was taken , the Great Figures of the Day who enter 'd the Brothel ( only to enter my Bow'r of Bliss ) , and of their curious Predilections and Practices betwixt the Bed-Clothes , I shall have to tell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , for any Woman who must at some Time in her hapless Life make her Bread and Board with her Body ; and what Woman alive hath not at some Time been brought into that Predicament ? For , are not e'en Wives  --  especially Wives of Great Men  --  nought but Whores in bart'ring their Board ( e'en if it include gilt Coaches and rich laced Clothes ) for their Bed ? And do not e'en our Poets and Philosophers show that a Woman who is a wily Merchant of her Maidenhead will make a better Match than one who spends it thriftlessly  --  as witness Mr. Richardson 's cloying Pamela Andrews , who ensnares her Squire , Lord B , by holding fast to her Maidenhead until the very Moment after Marriage and thereby receiving the very best Goods in Exchange for it ? Belinda , you well may ask whether I , who was e'er prone to Deliberation and Philosophical Debate within my own Soul , deliberatedwith myself about earning my Living as a Whore . To be sure , I did so . But when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not clear to me the House was a Brothel at all  --  so innocent and rustick was I. After that , I was restrain 'd there under Lock and Key ; and finally , knowing myself with Child and knowing now of Lancelot 's great Need of me , I remain 'd in order to obtain pecuniary Benefits for myself in the only Way I thought open to me . But unlike wily Pamela Andrews , I was an Honest Whore and no Hypocrite ! I sold my Body freely , but not my Mind !  |p210Whereas  the Wives of Great Men , or those who aspire to be the Wives of Great Men , sell e'en their Minds and account themselves blest into the Bargain ! No , Belinda , I preserv 'd the Independence of my Mind e'en tho ' I could not preserve the Independence of my Body . And so I account my Whoring more honest than the common State of Matrimony , wherein the Wife is sold to her Husband in exchange for Land to be added to her Father 's Holdings and reaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Merchant 's Shop of the Matrimonial Bed ! But now I come to a Subject far more unpleasant than e'en the one before , a Subject which makes my Quill tremble and my Eyes run with Tears  --  especially since these Pages are intended for my own Belinda . Would I were not sworn to Honesty above all ! Would I were writing a Tale to pass the Time of Idle Ladies , or a Farce to be perform 'd upon the London Stage ! For now I must tell what I did upon the Ev'ning after my Mutiny ' gainst Coxtart and my Discussions with Kate in which I strove to make amends with her . I lockt myself in the Basement Privy ( " The Stool of Repentance , " as Coxtart call 'd it ) , and , with trembling Hand , I inserted the hellish black Suppository into the unwilling Mouth of my Womb . ' T was no easy Thing ; I bled profusely from my Nether Eye , and I also wept with those other Eyes which knew all too well the Import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murder , in my View . I think there is no Woman in the World who murders her own Babe , Flesh of her own Flesh , without terrible Remorse and Pain ; and yet my Desperation was so great that I knew I could not bear the Babe . Coxtart would throw me out upon the Street if she knew of my Condition , and not only would I surely starve , but Lancelot would starve and lose his Mind into the Bargain . How can I explain this to you now , Belinda ? How can I explain that you , the dearest Person in the World to me , the most precious Mortal on this spinning Globe , were once the Object of my murderous Wrath ? Alas ! Not Wrath , but Desperation ! And yet , ' t was not , i'faith , you yourself ! For a Mother in the first few Weeks of her new Condition , before she hath felt the Stirrings of Life within her , and before she hath borne a Child at all , can not conceive with her Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atoms and its coursing Blood ! So I inserted the horrid black Thing into my Womb , and bled , and waited ; and before a half an Hour had pass 'd , I was wracktp211with Pain so terrible I had to stuff the whole Hem of my Petticoat into my Mouth to keep from Screaming . I doubl 'd o'er with the Pain . I held my Vitals . My Legs began to shake and Sweat ran down my Brow . I dug my Nails into my Palms until they bled , whilst I pray 'd silently to the Great Goddess , to Jesus Christ , our Lord , to any Deity at all who chanced to hear my Pray'r  --  e'en if it be the Foul Fiend Himself !  --  to grant me a Cessation of this Pain . Pain was a great Red Ocean in which I swam , and I was a Shipwreckt Sailor . Pain was my Heaven , my Earth , my Native Element . I was near to fainting with the Pain , expiring there in the Reek of the House of Easement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ante-Room to Hell itself  --  when , in a trice , my Womb cramp 'd entirely in one horrid Convulsion , and the wretched black Thing ( or what remain 'd of it ) came out . I lost the Suppository with a fair Amount of Blood , yet I did not lose the Babe ! That you know , since you yourself are that Babe ( who held on with a Will of her own e'en before you had a Hand to grasp with , or a Rational Mind ! ) . But at that Moment , I myself knew not whether I had loosed the Homunculus or no . I only knew I could not endure a Repetition of such Anguish e'er again , and I threw the other two ghastly black Things down the Hole of that stinking Privy , with scarce a Thought except to vent my Rage at being curst with Pain so unendurable ! In the Days that follow 'd , I debated with myself as to whether I was still with Child . My Desire argument 'd No ; my Reason argument 'd Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until , well four Months later , ' t was unmistakable that my Belly had begun to grow . But now I must go back again to that horrid Jakes and capture with my Quill the shaken , weeping seventeen-year-old Wench , who unlockt the Door , and with unsteady Tread , bloody Thighs , and bloody Linen , crept into her borrow 'd brothel Bed to fall asleep and dream of the Home she had fore'er lost , whilst in her teeming Brain she could not ascertain  --  either by Logick or the wildest Guess  --  whether she would bear a Babe in nine Months ' Time or no ; but she suspected the Truth and it terrified her . At the Washstand in my Chamber , I cleans 'd myself as well as I could , wishing truly for a proper Bath , but not daring to call the Maid to assist me at this Hour . I cast aside my smelly Newgate Clothes , my bloody Linen ( which I swore to burn in the Grate come Morning ) , and crept into my Bed . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamt of Lymeworth ; but ' t was not the Lymeworth I had known , but a strange House with many dank Cellars in whichp212Tortures were carried out whilst Rats scuttl 'd past the bare and bleeding Feet of Victims . A hooded Man in black boil 'd and stirr 'd the Limbs of Traitors in Tar and Pitch , and I leant over the ghastly Cauldron only to see a fearful sever 'd Head bubble to the Top  --  and lo ! ' t was Lancelot 's Head , and it open 'd its Lips to speak . " Be there Honour amongst Thieves ? " it cried . " Nay  --  fie on Humankind ! They 'll sell yer Soul fer thirty Pieces o ' Silver ! Beware the Captain o ' the Hannibal ! Beware the Captain o ' yer Soul ! " And then the Head submerged into the Pitch again . I awaken 'd with a sudden Cry . My limbs were shiv'ring and an icy Sweat stood in Drops upon my Brow . The Bed-Clothes were wet , as if with Rain . If my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sleep at all , I thought ; whereupon I lit a Taper by my Bed , and sat up holding my Knees to my Belly like a Child . My Thoughts roam 'd back o'er the preceding Day and all the hellish Visions I had seen in Living London which had then fill 'd my Dream of Death ; I thought of Lancelot in Gaol , of Mrs. Skynner , of angry Kate , of my triumphant Mutiny and then my abject Misery , not long after . Rage fill 'd my Heart where Sorrow once had been . How could my Body mutiny so against my Mind ? I was just beginning to learn of Life ; were all my Hopes of Pow'r o'er my Fate to be snatch 'd from me so soon by this small Intruder in my Belly ? No sooner did I feel this Anger than I was stung by bitterest Remorse . I pitied the poor unform 'd Creature to be so hated before ' t was e'en born ! What a Monster I was ! Had I no Pity upon the Small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the full Force of an Invasion . The Babe had enter 'd quite against my Will  --  as if I were a Castle or a Fort , and some Imposter , in the Guise of Friend , had penetrated to my very Centre , and now sought nothing less than my Life ! Alas , Belinda , perhaps you will forgive me for these Thoughts when you , too , bear a Babe ; for no State is as much akin to Madness upon the one Hand and Divinity upon the other , as being with Child . First , there is the Fear of Death , which no Woman who lyes down to bear a Babe can be sure she will escape ; next , there is the Fear of Pain ; finally , there is the Terror that she will prove an unloving Mother , wishing her Babe dead each Time it cries , instead of pitying its prodigious Need of her . But with each Month that the Babe within grows bigger , the Certainty grows stronger that her own Destiny is intermingl 'd with her Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least inp213part , as the Mother of that Babe . If it dyes , she is the Mother of a dead Babe ; if it lives , its Smiles and Tears will be her Smiles and Tears . If ' t is taken from her , still , she is changed fore'er on Earth and in Heaven , too . She has been doubl 'd , then halv 'd ; and she will ne'er be whole again.  |p214Containing  a short Sketch of the celebrated Dean Swift of Dublin , Author , Misanthrope , and Horse-Fancier extraordinaire ; together with some philosophical and moral Lessons which our Heroine drew from her curiousFriendship with him . THE EXPECTATION OF A BABE , for a Woman who is without Dowery , Husband , or i'faith without loving Relations , creates , above all , an immense Capacity for hard Work . Ladies with Child who languish in the Country whilst their Husbands pursue Whoring and Gaming in Town , may indeed be curst with ev'ry Ailment of the Female Flesh ; but Ladies who must work to put Bread into their own Mouths are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spleen , from Lethargy or Megrim , Sciatica or Vomiting . Idleness itself creates the Spleen , but good hard Work cures all these Maladies better than the costliest Physician . My Work was hard  --  hard upon my Body and harder still upon my Mind , for ' t is no easy Thing to be put to Bed with Gentlemen for whom one has nought but Dread and Loathing . Picture to yourself a young Girl , still in love with Love itself , being forced to frolick betwixt the Bedsheets with cadav'rous old Men , bandy-legg 'd Actors , pockmarkt Booksellers , and young Merchants ' Apprentices still with Pustules upon their boyish Cheaks . All these loathsome Swains I will , howe'er , pass o'er ; I have already given an ample Picture of my Initiation both with Coxtart herself , and with Theophilus Cibber . I shall now devote myself to describing the other Swains I met within the Brothel  --  particularly the Illustrious Ones ; for just as Honest Women in this weary World derive all Honour from the Men ( whether Husbands or Lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Illustriousness of their Swains . For a Woman is ne'er thought to make her Way in thep215World upon her own Merits , but she will fore'er be judged according to the Men who love her . I'faith , Women know well ' t is true that oft ' they flourish despite their Men rather than because of ' em , yet the World will e'er judge us in reverse ; and Wags will always say we gain 'd whatsoe'er Preferment we have found from our Lovers . Did I gain Preferment from my Illustrious Lovers ? Rather I would say , with all Modesty intended , they gain 'd it from me , for I had begun to learn , having had Womanhood so rudely thrust upon me in my seventeenth Year , that Men come to a Brothel as much for Understanding and Compassion as for the Fulfillment of their Lustful Desires , and that a Whore who pays Attention only to their Bodies ( and not to their Minds ) will ne'er flourish long in her Trade . Sure there are Whores who trade only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon clapp 'd , soon dead . The Whores who endure despite their perilous Profession are those who minister as well to the Souls of Men as to their Bodies . Truly , we are Clergy , of a sort . Speaking in this Vein , I think , above all , of Dean Swift , later so famous as the Author of Travels into Sev'ral Remote Nations of the World by " Lemuel Gulliver , " and so infamous in England , yet rever 'd in his Hibernian Homeland as the Author of The Drapier 's Letters . He was in England secretly for a brief Time during my first Summer in the Brothel . Secrecy was indeed of the utmost Import , since had the Crown but known that the detested Drapier who had done so much to arouse the Ire of the Irish Patriots , was upon English Soil , his Neck would ne'er be safe , and he might suffer the same Fate as my beloved Lancelot . Dean Swift was a curious Fellow  --  the cleverest Man I e'er had met but for Lancelot himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I had rever 'd Mr. Pope for his Poetical Works before I met him , and then grew disappointed with the Man himself , so ' t was the Reverse with Dean Swift : my Admiration grew , first from my Knowing him , then from the Splendour of his Works . Of course I had not read his notorious Travels , when first I made his Acquaintance ( nor had the World ) , and yet I was charm 'd by the Man himself , and understooda good deal more of his Enigmatick Character when I came to read those Travels two Years later . He was a rather short Man , above fifty Years of Age , and his Eyes were surely his most striking Feature . Bright blue they were , almost piercing and somewhat protuberant , as if he 'd had a Goitrep216once , or else was goggle-eyed at the Injustice of the World ( which , indeed , he could be quite as furious o'er as Lancelot ) . When he was mild , his Eyes were azure as the Seas of the Spanish Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could quite terrify . He was a great Card Player ( he taught me Ombre , Picquet , and Whisk ) , a great Giver of little Gifts ( tho ' he could ill afford ' em ) , and quite prodigal in his Charities . For a Man who had a Reputation as a Misanthrope and Malcontent , he was oft ' merry and the best of Company , but I believe he suffer 'd greatly from Dizziness and some Disturbance in his Ears , which , ne'ertheless , he bore with the Stoicism of an Ancient Roman . We had sev'ral Passions in common , in particular the Love of Horses , and the Belief that a Good Horse was better than the best of Men . Likewise , we were both haunted by our common Want of a Father ; for Presto ( as he call 'd himself amongst the Ladies ) was born Months after his Father 's unfortunate Demise , and always accounted himself an Orphan of sorts ( which perhaps explain 'd that heighten 'd Sensitivity in his Character , a Species of Skinlessness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the World prick him more than they prickt the ordinary Man ) . His Passions were many , and contradictory in the extream . He hated Fanaticism of any kind , Projectors who would improve the World by Schemes , and Criticks who cluster 'd about the greatest of Authors . " A Critick , " he once said to me , " is one who can not write very well himself and therefore spends his Days and Nights in laying down the Law to those who can . " Similarly , he hated Divines , tho ' he was one himself , for as he said , " Is not Religion a Cloak , and Conscience a Pair of Breeches , which tho ' a Cover for Lewdness as well as Nastiness , can be pull 'd down for the Service of both ? " He lov 'd La Rochefoucauld above all other Authors , for showingso well that Man is not the Rational Creature he claims to be , but is riddl 'd with contradictory Passions , Lusts , and Vanities . And yet he avow 'd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World rather than divert it " and " to bring Mankind to his Senses before ' t was too late and all Hope of Reason was lost fore'er . " " If you despair of Reason , my dear Presto , why do you write to bring the World to Reason ? " I askt him more than once . " Because I am a Fool , Fanny , " said he . But like all Men who readily admit their Foolishness , he was amongst the cleverest . And yet there was something uncontrollable and contradictory in his Character , for he always claim 'd he had wisht to rise in Courtp217and yet had stood in his own Sun by insulting all those who could help him . " Had I but curb 'd my Tongue and Pen , I might have rose like other Men , " said he , the Couplet coming as readily to his Lips as a Cough to the Lips of a Consumptive . But sure , he could no more curb his Pen than a Nightingale can curb his Song . ' T was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearly for that Genius . He was helpless to refrain from lashing the Criticks in whose Pow'r it was to help him rise , or the Courtiers , or the Ladies in Waiting , who had the Ears of the Great . All these he call 'd Whores and Parasites , and then was stung bitterly when they wreakt Vengeance upon him in return . Passion he had aplenty , but no Tact whatsoe'er . Brilliance , but no Gift for Diplomacy . Lying he hated and could so little manage it that he worried constantly lest his Stella in Dublin should know of our Liaison and be vext with him . He had not married her , he said ( despite Rumours to the Contrary ) , for Marriage ruin 'd the best of Women and made them Scolds . Besides , the World already had too many unlov 'd Brats within it ; better to practise Continence than coax another hapless Infant into this sorry World . " For , consid'ring the Miseries of Human Life , " said he , " why should a Child be under any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World ? Life is neither a Benefit in itself , nor was so intended by the Babe 's Natural Parents , whose Thoughts in their Love-Encounters , were otherwise employ 'd . " I was glad , indeed , ' t was not yet apparent I was with Child ; for had he known , he would have despis 'd me as a " Yahoo "  --  his curious Word for all those Mortals who give in to the Appetites of the Flesh . He lov 'd Women to be young and girlish , slim and virginal , like unattempted Brides . Little Girls of Twelve , with Breasts still unfledged , represented his favourite Female Forms ; thus when Coxtart first brought him to my Chamber , she bade me tell him I was e'en younger than Seventeen and instructed me to wear my Bridal Costume , yet not be vext nor insulted if he ne'er touch 'd my Flesh . He would talk instead and feast his bright blue Eyes upon me , discoursing of Philosophy and Literature , Politicks and Religion ; and once , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him strange , he propos 'd that we go together into the Countryside and spend a curious Afternoon romping amongst Foals and Mares and Stallions at the Park of one of his Friends . We hir 'd a Barge upriver , upon that splendid Summer 's After/noon , rode as far as Maidenhead , there were met by a One-Horse Chaise belonging to the Dean 's Friend , and carried to a beauteous Country Estate call 'd Dumswood , whose Owner was said to have some of the finest Race Horses in England . Perhaps by design , Dean Swift 's Friend had been call 'd away . Only his Grooms and Trainers and other Servants were in attendance ; thus we could be almost entirely undisturb 'd as we picknickt upon the Green , watching the Mares and Foals frolicking upon the velvet Grass . " Observe the Horse , " said the Dean , " observe his nimble Gait compar 'd to the shambling Gait of Man . For a Man is a Creature that hath but lately determin 'd to walk upon his hind Legs , whereas a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ancients themselves identified the Horse with Poesy ! " ( Ah , when the Dean said this , I knew beyond any Doubt that we were Friends of the Soul , for had I not oft ' thought the very same Thing concerning Horse and Poesy , Horse and Man ? ) " For mark you , Fanny , " he went on , " from the most ancient Times , Man and Horse have known a Mystick Bond . The Mare hath been identified with the Earth Goddess , Persephone , and the Stallion with the Sun God , Apollo . Warriors , from Ancient Times were buried with their Steeds ; and e'en in the Greece of Homer , Horse Races form 'd part of the Funerary Games . The fierce Mongols and the ferocious Tartars drank of Kumiss , or fermented Mare 's Milk , to raise Visions in their Brains ; and the Celts perform 'd a sacred Wedding betwixt Mare and King to ensure Fertility of Crops and Men . In the remote and Pagan Counties of Ireland , I have heard , e'en Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crops and stave off Famine  --  but the Irish are a Barbarous Race and capable of any Nastiness ! " Just then a dappl 'd Grey Mare walkt curiously up to our Picknick Spot , turn 'd Tail , and harken 'd to one of Nature 's profoundest Necessities . The Dean was entranced . " Observe , Fanny , " said he . " E'en the Droppings of a Horse are Golden Stones compar 'd to a Man 's brown and putrid Excrement ! Mark how beautiful they are  --  these Golden Droppings ! And is this not because the Horse eats nought but the purest Grass and Hay , whilst we , who claim to be the Rational Race , eat largely dead and decaying Flesh ? By a Creature 's very Droppings shall ye know him ! " " But Presto , Dear , " say I , " a Horse has no Rational Speech , whilst we can converse in Language and thus improve our Reason . . . . " And yet I said this merely for the Sake of Argument ,  |p219for  had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lustre ? Alas , that I could not introduce the Dean to him ! " Bah , " says the Dean , " we but use Language to obfuscate the Truth , as if we were all Lawyers ! Yet the ' Whinnying of a Mare to a Foal is a purer Language , if we could but understand it ! " I listen 'd deeply to the Whinnying of the Mares , striving to hear the Rational Language which the Dean assur 'd me was to be found there  --  but all I could hear , alas , was Whinnying ! Perhaps one must live with a Horse to understand him  --  for tho ' surely had I understood Lustre , these strange Horses I could not . The Dean , it seem 'd , had finer Ears ; for within the Brute Noises of the Beast , he heard Philosophies and Poetries no other Mortal Ears could hear . " Houyhnhnms , " he call 'd the Horses , pronouncing the Name as if ' t were the Neighing of a Horse ; and " Yahoos , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , he avow 'd , was neither as human nor as kind as it pretended . For an Hour or more , he discours 'd to me of Horses . He explain 'd the History of the Horse in England , how the heavy Horses of our Ancestors had been cross-bred with the Arabians to produce the Noble Thoroughbred , the finest Horse the World hath e'er known . He spoke of the slender Beauty of the Thoroughbred , the Wildness of the Pure Arabian , the Pow'r of the heavy Breeds , the Charm of the Connemara , Shetland , and the Welsh Ponies , the soulful Eyes of Mares , and the flaring Nostrils of Stallions  --  almost as if he were a Lover besotted with his Beloved 's Charms . He spoke at length of his Contempt for Mankind in making this Creature , so much more noble than himself , into a Beast of Burden , and he told me of the Bedouin Tribes who rais 'd their Horses in their own Tents , sleeping and eating with ' em , keeping ' em as tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Horsemanship , he had nought but Contempt . The artificial Gaits , the Paces these Noble Creatures were forced to learn , disgusted him . The Galopade , Volte , Pirouette , Terre a Terre , Mezair , Pesade , Courbette , Croupade , Balotade , Capriole , and such , he view 'd but as Expressions of Human Vanity forced upon the gentle Horse . Indeed , the entire Art of Equitation he detested . " For Man bath taken this splendid peaceable Creature and forced him to the Arts of War . No Horse in his Native State would go to War , " said he . " The Horse is by Nature a Peacemaker ; Man alone makes War upon his Fellows . Ah , Fanny , when I see the Sadness of Horses in Harness , my Eyes fill with Tears and I curse the Race that claims me as its own ! Oppressors are we all  --  vain ,  |p220|proud  , stupid , but pretending to Reason ! The Horse is Reason itself . If any Creature deserves to rule the World , ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in his Fancies and Reveries about Horses , that I could scarce tell him of my Horse , Lustre , of the fine Arabians Lord Bellars had imported , of the many Foalings I myself had witness 'd as a Child , of that splendid Moment , the Culmination of eleven Months of great Anticipation , when the Foal emerges , Forelegs first , then Muzzle , then Cheaks , then Ears , then Withers , then Flank , and then the Foal entire , with the Moon-blue Membranes gleaming , and the Waters of the Womb still glist'ning upon his infant Fuzz ! My own fondest Childhood Memories were also of Horses . Perhaps that was why I made no Objection to the Dean 's next Fancy . Now he would try a fanciful Experiment , he said . He would cause me to strip naked upon the Grass , and then he would strive to coax a Stallion to copulate with me . So carried away with this Scheme was he , that he ne'er consulted me as to my Willingness , but rav 'd only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that upon his Honour I would be uninjur 'd , and that he himself would owe me his whole Life , if only I would do his Bidding . ' T was indeed the most curious Request I had e'er entertain 'd in my brief Life as a Whore , but ' t was my Duty , after all , to satisfy the sundry Lusts of my Swains no Matter how peculiar , and a Sense of Curiosity motivated me as well . Indeed the Stallion he chose lookt so like Lustre  --  but for a lack of white Markings  --  that , i'faith , I would almost conceive him as my Lover ! I put off all my Garments on the sunny Greensward and lay upon the Grass drinking in the Summer Sun , whilst the Dean , his Eyes gleaming with Mischief , went off to fetch the Stallion . He caus 'd the Grooms to lock up all the Mares and Foals within the Barn , so as not to tempt the Stallion to furious rampaging Lust , then he led the Chestnut Stallion to me , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was endow 'd with a Cock to make any Pretty Fellow green with Envy ; and as the Dean spoke softly in his Ear , in the whinnying Language of the Horses , and rubb 'd his Belly and his Balls , the Stallion 's Cock grew until ' t was of a Size to affright the most lascivious old Whore . The Dean watch 'd with Wonder and Admiration , as if he , too , were half in Love with the Stallion . Then , when he was assur 'd the Stallion 's Cock could grow no more , he bade me climb upon his own Back ( so that together we almost reach 'd the Horse 's Height ) ,  |p221|put  my Arms ' round his Neck , and spread my Nether Cheaks as wide as e'er I could , presumably to tempt the Stallion . Soon the Dean began to romp and whinny , with me stark naked clinging to his Back . He coaxt the Stallion in the curious Language of the Horses , and play 'd the Horse himself , trotting across the Grass with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed us curiously , and once e'en came forward to look at our strange twobacktBeast more closely , ' t was clear as Crystal that he 'd no Intention to copulate either with me or with the Dean ! This " Experiment " we continu 'd for well nigh half an Hour , until the Stallion , in Boredom and Ennui , wander 'd off , his Cock now much reduced to normal Size , and began to graze in an adjoining Field . With a Cry of Triumph and the cunning Smile of a Lawyer who hath won his Case , the Dean cried out : " Sweet Fanny , now dismount ! " To which I happily obey 'd , and as he help 'd me dress , he drew such Moral Lessons as he could from this . " For mark you , Fanny , a Man in Heat will mate with any Hole that presents itself to his View ! He 'll mate with Hens , Sheep , or e'en ripe Melons , a pregnant Woman , or one that flies the Monthly Flag ! But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mare to bear a Foal , mates not out of her proper Season , and thus is far more rational than Man ! " As we made our Way back to Town once more , by the mighty Highway of the Thames , the Dean discours 'd continuously of the Diff'rences betwixt Men and Horses ; and , i'faith , I had to agree that his curious Logick had some Justice in it . If I seem 'd on the Verge of Tears as he spoke , ' t was because I was thinking always of Lustre , and tormenting myself concerning his Fate . Was he a common Pack-Horse , being workt to Death , fed little , languishing for Want of Rational Discourse ? Was he a Freak in a Raree Show , caus 'd to leap through flaming Hoops , or jump flaming Barrels , or dance upon his hind Legs like a Circus Dog ? " I have no Love for Man 's Hubris , " said the Dean , not noticing my welling Tears . " His Tragick Flaw is that he thinks himself a Rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acts that he is more benighted than the lowest Insect that crawls along the Ground . I have e'er hated all Nations , Professions , Communities , dear Fanny , and all my Love is for Individuals . Ah  --  wait until you read my Travels . They are admirable Things and will wonderfully mend the World . " This was the chief Contradiction in the Dean  --  that he claim 'd Mankind had no Pow'rs of Reason , and yet he fore'er tried to mendp222the World and bring it to its Senses . He was a slighted Lover of Mankind , one who lov 'd not wisely , but too well . And having seen his Love rejected , trampl 'd in the Mud , he grew Bitter . From him I learnt that ev'ry Misanthrope is nought but one who once hath lov 'd the World too well ; ev'ry Misanthrope 's a wounded Innocent , I fear . When I came to read the Dean 's Travels two Years later , I was indeed amaz 'd ! ' T was then I most wisht to discourse with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Book astounded me with its Brilliance of Invention . That plain Man Gulliver amongst all those fanciful Creatures ! What a merry Book indeed ! To Swift I accorded the greatest Compliment one Author pays another : I wisht his Book were mine ! And yet I knew e'en then that Books  --  especially the greatest Books  --  are like the Wrinkles in our Faces ; each Man makes his own . And we can no more imitate ' em than we can seek to wear another Author 's Face . The Books we love the best are quirky and curious indeed as the Minds that gave ' em birth ! I need not tell you , Belinda , how the Book at once captur 'd all the Town and was the Rage of ev'ry Tea-Table , replacing Ombre and Gossip as the Ruling Passions of the Ladies . I wisht to write the Dean my Felicitations , but , having heard that his Stella was ill and close to Death , I dar 'd not , for fear my Letter would be discover 'd and hasten her Untimely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known the Dean in such an intimate Fashion , I have my Piece to add to the furious Discussion of his Works which raged amongst both his Lovers and Detractors . Did he mean his Gulliver to be a sane Man , or a Poor Bedlamite , driven out of his Wits by too many Shipwrecks ? Alas , I fear that Knowledge of Dean Swift 's last tragick Illness hath prejudiced the World concerning his Books . I heartily affirm that his Gulliver possesses the soundest of Minds , that he alone of all Mankind sees the World quite clearly ; and truly , when he retreats to a Stable to live with Horses and will no longer have Intercourse with Men , ' t is because he hath discover 'd the two great fatal Flaws in Humankind : the Stink of Mendacity and the rotting Odour of Vanity . He would rather feast his Senses upon the good clean Smell of Horses ' Flesh than suffer the putrid Odour of Mankind 's Lyes . And , for this , who indeed can blame him ? Living in Coxtart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Acquaintance with those two curious Figures , Mr. William Hogarth and Master John Cleland ; their opposing Views of her Character , their Predilectionsboth in Life and Art ; together with our Heroine 's Motives in composing this True and Compleat History of her exotick and adventurous Life . MR . HOGARTH ALSO FREQUENTED Coxtart 's Brothel , both to satisfy his fleshly Lusts and to sketch the Girls . During that fearsome Summer of 1724 , when all my Care was to procure Money to get Lancelot Freedom of the Rules , and to put some by for my Lying-in , I met countless Swains besides the illustrious Dean Swift , the young Painter Mr. Hogarth , and that dastardly Stripling , Master Cleland , who was later to exploit my History so callously in his Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure . But of these three , I have the most vivid Memories ; for , howe'er reduced my Circumstances to humble Whoredom , my Mind was still keen for Learning , and from these Swains , above all , could I improve my Intellect as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Mock-Maidenhead ( having heard from his whoremong'ring Colleagues that there was a new and delicious Wench in Town ) . He was , howe'er , too clever a Fellow to be gull 'd by my ravish 'd maiden Pantomime ; for , unlike so many of the others , he was no foolish Aristocrat , no Strutting Player , no Poet besotted with his own Verses , but a plain young Fellow from Smithfield who had grown to Manhood in the Precincts near Bartholomew Fair , and had feasted his Childhood Eyes upon all Manner of Mountebanks , Merry Andrews , Strolling Players , Acrobats , Rope Dancers , Quacks , Jugglers , Puppets , Huxters , Giants , Dwarfs , Drolls , Jilts , Harlots , and Sharpers . From the tend'rest Years , he had known the hard Life of the London Streets , for the Area of Bartholomew Close and Smithfield was still the London of Olden Days , untouch 'd by the Great Fire . ' Twasp224a Cattle Market where the Oxen and Sheep were driven up each Monday and the narrow ancient Streets were fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puppies , dead Cats , and straggling Turnip Tops . Hogarth himself , tho ' he lookt the most unprepossessing Pug ( being short , blunt-featur 'd , and stout as a little Bulldog ) , was a canny Fellow , the Son of a distracted Schoolmaster turn 'd CoffeehouseKeeper , who 'd been gaol 'd in the Fleet for Debt ; and he was determin 'd to escape his Father 's hard Fate . His Father , said he , had spent the better part of his Life toiling at Dictionaries for callous Booksellers , who neither paid him a Fair Share of Earnings when the Book sold , nor fail 'd to blame him when it dy 'd stillborn . He had resolv 'd , therefore , e'en at the Age of Twenty-Seven ( when I met him ) , not to be a Victim like his hapless Father ; for he aspir 'd to Great Things , knowing himself blest with the Gift for getting the most telling Likeness with two Strokes of a Quill or Brush , and possess 'd , as well , of the Lit'ry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He quickly call 'd my Bluff as a false Virgin . " Fanny , my Girl , " said he , " ' t is clear you 've been a Virgin fifty Times , if you have been so once . " " I beg your Pardon , Sirrah , " said I , all full of Mock-Dignity . " How dare you jest with a poor Country Girl that offers up the only Jewel she hath ? " " Jewel , my Arse , " says Will Hogarth . " The Jewel is Pigeon Blood and the Country Girl hath learnt some City Ways ! But I 'll not tell Coxtart that I 've call 'd your Bluff if you 'll sit for me both in your Clothes and out ! " ' T was thus I became Hogarth 's Model as well as his sometime Whore , and as he sketch 'd me , filling endless Books with my Face , my Breasts , my Rump , my Legs , my Hands , we told each other of our Youths , our Hopes , our Dreams . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and on about the Bad Taste of the Town . " No self-respecting English Lord , " he said , " will buy a Painting unless it comes from bloody Italy ! For the English disdain their own Native Genius . In Musick they must have Mr. Handel  --  and other curious Germans or Italians who sing in Gibberish no True-born Englishman can understand  --  and in Painting , they call for the Italian Rogues , spend Fortunes upon Forgeries of Nymphs and Dragons , or else pay Homage to a Mountebank like William Kent , who declares all Englishmen devoid of Craft and Art , paints Pretty Pictures in the Italian Mode , styles himself a noble Ancient Roman ,  |p225and  bath the Earl of Burlington to lick his Arse and settle his Bills for Port ! By God , Fanny , I hate the Palladians worse e'en than the Italian Charlatans , for they spit upon our Native English Genius , whilst they tout the rankest Mediocrity in the Name of Noble Rome ! " " What would you do ? " I askt , scratching my naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Love , I would show the wide World as ' t is ! I would show the Streets of London with their dead Cats and squalling Babes . I would show Trollops and Mountebanks and Strolling Players at Southwark Fair ! I would show Rope Dancers falling from their Ropes , and Actresses disrobing in a Barn ! I would show Taverns and Brothels ; Paupers drunk on Gin and Burghers drunk on Beer ! I would show Whores as well as Grecian Goddesses , Rogues as well as Heroes , Bakers and Brewers as well as Noble Lords ! For which amongst us hath e'er glimps 'd St. George , or a Dragon , for that matter ? But the very World we see around us  --  the sprawling Streets , the squalling Mob  --  why should we disdain it ? ' T is the very Stuff of English Life ! " As he spoke , he sketch 'd , as always , his Tongue moving quite as rapidly as his Quill . Then , in a trice , he leapt up and ran to me where I lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Hand . " See , Fanny , " said he , showing me the Sketch . I had to laugh out loud to see ; for he had caught me in that very Moment when I scratch 'd my Rump , and upon my Face was a quizzical Look as if I doubted all he said . ' T was so true a Likeness that I roar 'd at my own Foolishness ; all the Time I had been posing like a Goddess , fancying the Ideal Form that would emerge ' neath the Artist 's Quill , he had seen nought but a Country Wench that scratches her Rump and looks most quizzically upon the World ! " Is that how I appear to you ? " said I. " At Times , " said he , " you are a Country Maid , at Times a Queen , but with your flaming Hair and flaming Nether Hair as well , I think of you more as a raging Fire than a mere Woman , a Conflagration that might consume all of London and me as well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropp 'd his Quill and Paper and his Breech ; and made love to me as vigorously as any Swain had done . But enough of that . Why interrupt my Tale with still another inflaming Love Scene , as if I were Mr. Cleland himself ? Alas , it bores me to detail all the various and sundry Cocks that slipp 'd betwixt my youthful Legs that Summer . Suffice it to say that Mr. Hogarth 's Tastes were simple ; not for him the Excitement ofp226Stallions and Mares , nor the Thrill of Disguises and Masquerades . He lik 'd his Ladies wanton , compliant , and built for Use ; and his Cock was quite as energetick as his Quill or Tongue . Not all Great Artists are Great Orators and Great Fornicators as well , but Mr. Hogarth surely was . Perhaps ' t was due to the Shortness of his Stature , all his Animal Spirits were compact , as ' t were , into a smaller Space . Some eight Years later , when the Artist and I had not seen each other for sev'ral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display 'd " The Harlot 's Progress " or " The Humours of Drury Lane " by Mr. William Hogarth . There , I saw the Use to which he had put all his Sketches of me ! E'en the Name of his Trollop ( which many assum 'd was inspir 'd by Francis Hackabout , the notorious hang 'd Highwayman , or Katherine Hackabout , his hapless whoring Sister ) , was , in fact , inspir 'd by my Tales to him ( whilst posing in the nude ) of my Travels with the Merry Men and Lancelot 's naming me in accordance with my Fortunes ! The Prints near broke my Heart , for they show 'd the Fate which might well have been mine  --  and which , i'faith , I 'd narrowly escap 'd . In the first , the Harlot comes to London from the Country , an Innocent , prey 'd upon by Bawd and Rapemaster alike . She knows not what her Fate will be , but a wrung-neckt Goose in the Foreground of the Picture shows that the clever Artist knows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being kept by a rich Jew ( whom she cuckolds ) , to being the tainted Whore of Highwaymen , to beating Hemp in Bridewell ( still in her Whore 's Finery ! ) , to dying of the Pox in a Garret , whilst her poor Urchin sits by the Grate , waiting for his meagre Supper . In the last Print of all , she lyes in her sad Coffin whilst the Whores and Clergymen around her are yet more interested in their own tawdry Pleasures than in the grave Lesson of her Death . ( ' T is a sad Commentary indeed upon the Clergy that have so little Interest in the spiritual Welfare of their Flock . ) But sadder than all these Lessons is the Fate of Moll Hackabout herself . For truly she endures the Wages of Lust whilst her Swains go free ; and she dyes a Pauper 's Death of Clap , whilst the Rapemasters and Clergymen flourish to work their Wickedness upon the next Innocent . Canny Hogarth knew that ' t is the Woman who always suffers for the Sins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch 'd me , that this would be my Fate ? No doubt he did . And there were dreadful Times I fear 'd ' t would be so myself . Yet I do not fault him for using my Name nor indeed Aspects of my Face ( a certain sad-eyed Look for thep227imprison 'd Whore , the Curve of a plump Breast or slender Ankle ) , for clearly his Sympathies are with the innocent Girl , whom the World abuses , then casts upon the Refuse Heap of Death . Mr. Cleland , upon the other Hand , I consider no Friend of mine , nor of the Fair Sex in gen'ral , for the Portrait he paints of his simp'ring Strumpet leaves the World to think that the Whore 's Life is nought but a Bed of Roses . Of Clap , Consumption , the Evils of Drink , Death in Childbed ( and the other Ravages of the poor Harlot 's Life ) , he hath nought to say . Reading his Book , you 'd think that the Whore 's Life was as great a Lark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Physician ! ( I mention , of course , those who batten off the Sorrows of the Poor ! ) For mark you , Belinda , here were two Men whom I met at the self-same Time of Life ; whilst one saw me as a Figure fit for Tragedy , the other saw me as the very Embodiment of Comedy and Light-heartedness . And which indeed was the Truth ? Is there , i'faith , one Truth indivisible ? Are our Characters not more oft ' form 'd in the Eyes of our Beholders than in our Souls themselves ? For tho ' , ' t is true , we must learn to know ourselves  --  in order to survive this Wicked World , and also Divine Judgement in the World to come  --  oft ' the Image the Publick hath of us is more compounded of the Follies and Fears of those who lov 'd ( or hated ) us than of our own true Mettle . Thus ' t is that ev'ry Woman 's most Profound Lesson must be to learn to disregard the World 's Opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own Opinion of herself ; for whilst the World may at Times be just in judging the Characters of Men ( tho ' e'en here , more oft ' it errs ) , ' t is ne'er so in judging the Characters of Women . Indeed , Women are thought to have " no Characters at all "  --  in the Words of Mr. Pope , and to flit from Fancy to Fancy as a Butterfly flits from Flow'r to Flow'r . Perhaps this accounts for the Hubris of the Male in fashioning the Female , in Novels and Poems , as the very Creature of his own Fancies ; and perhaps the Masculine Poet avers that " Women have no Characters at all , " so as to better justify his unfeeling and unthinking Treatment of her in his Verses ! But I must pass now to Mr. Cleland , who came into my Life not long after Will Hogarth . Unlike the Painter , who stood upon the very Threshold of his Fame , John Cleland was a mere Stripling  --  with the Pustules of Youth still standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lust ! Nor was he more than two Years out of Westminster School . He came into my Chamber all full of Swagger and Braggadocio , claiming that he requir 'd a fresh Maidenhead a Day to keep hisp228Spirits up ( as a Vampyre requires Blood ) , and declaring himself to be a Man of the World , a weary Voyager in the Ports of Love , a jaded Rake , a bor 'd Libertine  --  when indeed ' t was clear as Crystal that he was not above my own Age . I'faith , I later learnt he was e'en two Years younger ! I was , once more , in my Bride 's Attire ( tho ' how much longer I could claim to be Virgin was doubtful  --  for I was already becomingquite famous in the Town , and to speak the Truth , I was also growing rather bor 'd with the Game myself ) when I made Mr. Cleland 's Aquaintance . I 'll ne'er forget how he lookt upon that first Occasion when I met him . He 'd got himself up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laced Hat , Full-bottom 'd Wig , and a Velvet Waistcoat , laced with Silver , despite the Summer 's Heat . Yet all these Clothes fit him quite ill , as if indeed they were borrow 'd , or purloin 'd , Finery . And his Hat , in particular , was sev'ral Sizes too big  --  e'en with the Wig ' neath it  --  and slipp 'd o'er his Eyes most comically . " My Beloved Bride ! " he cried , entering the Chamber . I could scarce conceal a Yawn at the Words . 0 I was weary of my Work , and weary of this foolish Pantomime ! How , in the Name of the Goddess , would I e'er find the Zeal to play at this absurd Virginity still one more Time ? I was bor 'd in the extream . " Come catch me , Groom ! " I cried , going through the Formality of the Chase ' round the Bed with barely conceal 'd Ennui . Young Mr. Cleland chas 'd me dutifully , and yet , he seem 'd in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught . I'faith , he seem 'd more truly afraid of me than I was pretending to be afraid of him ! This Masquerade of Chase and Pursuit we kept up as long as we could  --  I darting about the Bed , he chasing me ( like a fat , lazy Cat chasing an agile Mouse ) , but ' t was plain he had no Stomach for it . " Come catch me , " I cried again . Yet how could I play the unwilling Virgin when he was still more unwilling than myself ? At last he collaps 'd upon the Floor ( in all his Finery ) and began to weep most piteously . " I'faith , Madam Fanny , " says he , " I am a Virgin myself ! " And with that , he pulls off the absurd Full-bottom 'd Wig , revealing to my Sight the sweet Face of a Boy of Fifteen ( albeit a sweet Face bespeckl 'd with Pustules ! ) , with frighten 'd Eyes that regard me ( me ! ) as a Woman of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne'er be rais 'd , and sweetly and tenderly I begin to undress him , revealing his bare pinkp229Chest , his tiny Hips , his spindly Legs , his poor naked vulnerable Toes . But surely you will ask , what sort of Cock had he who invented more fanciful Names for that common Organ than Adam invented Names for Animals ? ' T was a middling Thing , neither larger nor smaller than the Majority of Cocks , and tolerably wellshap 'd , but without the inflam 'd Redness of which he so constantly writes in his foolish Memoirs . Indeed , ' t was a pasty white Thing , as pale as uncookt Pye Dough , and it took all my Coaxing and Reassurance to make it stand up in my Hand  --  and e'en then I fear 'd it should faint again upon the Instant ! But I roll 'd it in my Hands and then betwixt my Lips until ' t was hard enough to suck upon , and when ' t was slick with Spittle and firm enough for Use , I lifted my Bride 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in corkscrew Motions until he swoon 'd with Pleasure and , i'faith , quite fainted away . At first I swear I thought him dead , so cold and still was he . I fear 'd I 'd kill 'd him quite with Voluptuous Pleasure and I scarce knew whether to laugh or weep . ' T was droll how all his Swagger had come to this ! He lay upon the Floor like a dead Fish , nay like a Loaf of Bread , for no Part of him e'en twitch 'd at all . By and by , he recover 'd his Senses . 0 he was mad with Gratitude to me ! He said he could ne'er repay my Kindness , my Thoughtfulness , my Christian Charity ! I laugh 'd and reassur 'd him that he 'd have to pay Coxtart for my Virginity  --  tho ' he himself had prov 'd the Virgin Bride . And that seem 'd to put him in mind of a Fancy of his , which he was half afraid , he said , to voice . " Pray tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here to do your Bidding . " " I dare not , " said he , giggling like a Schoolgirl . " Marry come up , " says I , " I 'll not mock you for it , I swear . " " Do you truly swear ? " says he . " I swear , " say I.Whereupon he proposes to me that now we exchange Clothes  --  he 'll be the Bride and I the Swagg'ring Groom  --  and repeat our little Game . This indeed tickles my own Fancy , so bor 'd am I with playing Bride , and now I strip and offer him my Virginal Clothes , whilst he does the same , off'ring me his Fop 's Finery . He unlaces my Corset for me , and in a Minute or two , I lace him into it , giving him a tiny Waist , but alas no Breasts at all . These we form with cambrick Handkerchiefs roll 'd into Balls , andp230he primps and views himself in the Glass as if he is quite pleas 'd with all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petticoat , Veil , Shoes , and Stockings . I e'en offer him my Paints  --  my Bavarian Red Liquor for the Cheaks  --  and my Scents as well . All these he is happy enough to use ; and he shows less Discomfort in ' em than a Lapdog put into a Bathing Tub . Indeed , female Dress brings out all his Confidence and Daring , and he minces and curtseys with more Aplomb than he swagger 'd as a Beau before . For my part , I am content to be in his Attire ; for wearing a Man 's Disguise always fills me with a Sense of Freedom , e'en Wantonness . I chase him ' round the Bed again , delighting in the Novelty of this Change in Status . I growl that I shall catch him ; he squeaks that I shall not . I now cajole , now threaten , now pursue . He now protests , now pleads , now flees . At last I catch him and throw myself upon him with all my Weight . " Pray , Sir , desist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam , yield , " I thunder , Basso . Whereupon I thrust my Knee betwixt his Thighs and like a hopeless Maid he cries in the highest Voice : " Please , Sir , I have no Jewel but my Vartue , and if you strip me of it , I am lost . " Then he begins to weep withal , yea , weep so convincingly that my Heart is mov 'd and I forget that ' t is only a Play . After some Time at this Pantomime , we fall to Love-making in earnest , I playing the Man and he the Maid . I'faith , he is more arous 'd by playing the passive Virginal Maid than he was by playing the Seducing Rake ; for upon this Occasion his Cock requires no coaxing . But 0 ' t is droll to see it emerge ' neath a Petticoat and Hoops ! Thereafter , whene'er Master Cleland came to Coxtart 's Brothel , ' t was our usual Sport to mimick the Sexes neither one was born to . Playing the Wench seem 'd to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after our frenzied Bouts in Bed he could be persuaded to tell me of his Dreams and Plans . He was besotted with the East , dreamt continually of Venice , Constantinople , Smyrna , Bombay , and long 'd to travel to those distant Parts . For he had heard and read much of Oriental Luxury , of the Freedom Turkish Ladies enjoy 'd ' neath their Veils , of the wicked Seraglios of the East , of the lustful Sultans and of their voluptuous Concubines . " Sure you must be mad , John , " said I , " to imagine that Turkish Ladies have more Freedom than English ones . " " ' T is true , Fanny , " says he , " for ' neath their Veils , ' t is saidp231not e'en their own Husbands can recognize ' em , and they go about the Streets of Constantinople quite Incognita . Thus , you see the Jealousy of Husbands creates a Disguise which quite defeats its own Purpose . ' T is a solemn Lesson in the Vanity of Human Passions ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plight of the Turkish Lady could be better than that of the English , but perhaps ' t was true . For English Ladies liv 'd at the Mercy of their Husbands , their Fathers , and all the gossiping Tongues of the Town . They , too , could know Freedom in Disguise , which surely accounted for the great Popularity of Masquerades in London . Perhaps the Slaves of the East had more true Freedom than we Englishwomen who only seem 'd so free ; ' t was a Paradox indeed . But what was Master Cleland 's secret Wish in travelling to the East ? Did he dream perhaps of dressing up to play the Turkish Lady ? That I 'll ne'er know , for he would not trust me so far with his Fancies . Within the Year , howe'er , he 'd disappear 'd from London altogether to journey across Europe ; and I heard tell that he turn 'd up in Smyrna by and by , having secur 'd a Consular Appointment by some Means or other . Was he tasting all the forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was the sort of Man who would have lov 'd to play the Concubine whilst a savage Turk ravish 'd him in his Nether Regions . Neither proper Man , nor proper Woman was he , but an odd Blend of the twain , a curious Person who seem 'd torn betwixt East and West , betwixt Male and Female . I later heard that he fled Smyrna for Bombay , where the East India Company employ 'd him for a while . Then he was banish 'd from India , too , after some Quarrel or Scandal , and wander 'd across Europe like a Lost Soul , until he return 'd to his Native Land , where he was promptly thrown into Gaol for Debt . Thus he came to write his loathed Memoirs ; for those on whom the Muse seldom smiles are driven to write only by Want of Money , not , like Dean Swift , by the Noble Desire of bringing Mankind to its Senses . His Book surely did inflame the Town , and it made Ralph Griffiths rich as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Copyright of Cleland for twenty Guineas and thereafter earn 'd from it more than ten thousand Pounds . As oft ' occurs in these Cases , the Bookseller was able to set up like a proper Gentleman , with Chariots and Steeds and a Householdfull of Servants , whilst the Author , for his Pains , was nearly clapp 'd in Gaol . He later got a Pension of Lord Granville , who pitied him , but still he remain 'd a struggling Grub Street Hack , andp232ne'er free from Want his whole Life long . Indeed , the Bookseller fatten 'd whilst the Author starv 'd , and drove about in Coaches whilst the Author walkt . ( ' T is e'er thus , I fear , when Commerce meets the Muse  --  but Cleland deserv 'd no better , having stolen my Name in Hope of Gain ! ) For my own part , the Book caus 'd me only great Embarrassment , for ev'ryone thought ' t was my True Life Story , and correct in all its Particulars . I'faith , Belinda , the printed Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  e'en if it be malignant and scurrilous  --  carries more Weight in the Scales of Life than the truest Oath upon the heaviest Bible . After Cleland 's Volume appear 'd I had no Peace at all , since ' t was presum 'd that I myself was the Model for Fanny Hill . All that I protested to the Contrary , only serv 'd the more to convince my Enemies that I was lying . This , indeed , is one of the most compelling Reasons for my writing my own True and Compleat History of my Life and Adventures ; so that you , my beloved Belinda ( and the scurrilous World as well ) , shall know the Truth of my Life and not labour under the dark and dingy Veil of Falsehood . For the sugar 'd Tale of cloying Fanny Hill is as far from my own Life and Philosophies as the sugar 'd Tale of virtuous Pamela is far from the Truth of Serving Maid and Master . Neither Comedy nor Tragedy alone rul 'd my Life , but ' t was a Mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fell ; and indeed I came to believe the Adage of La Rochefoucauld , that " Greater Virtues are requir 'd to endure Good Fortune than to endure Bad . " Whilst all my Care was to survive , bear my Babe in Peace , and aid my dearest Lancelot , I was too busy to suffer prolong 'd Fits of Melancholy or Spleen ; but later when my Fortunes improv 'd , I was able to learn the Truth of another of that clever French Duke 's sayings , to wit : " Violence done to us by others oft ' pains us less than Violence done to us by Ourselves . " But more of that anon.  |p233In  which we look in upon Mr. Lancelot Robinson in Newgate Prison and learn what hath transpir 'd with him whilst our Fanny was very much Otherwise Engaged . AFTER MY FIRST SEV'RAL WEEKS in the Brothel , I had , by dint of great Industry as well as Thrift ( for I ne'er took Breakfast or Lunch from Coxtart , for Economy 's Sake ) , earn 'd and sav @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T was also plain by now that some new Life was coursing thro ' my Veins ; for , tho ' my Belly was as flat as e'er before , my Skin show 'd a new Bloom , my Eyes sparkl 'd like the brightest Stars , and ev'ry Swain who saw me remarkt that my Beauty grew more dazzling Day by Day . Indeed , I could see it myself , in my own Glass . How very curious , I thought , that this unwanted Babe , this Child conceiv 'd in Betrayal and Treachery should , ne'ertheless , create such Beauty . Perhaps ev'ry Woman who hath e'er drawn Breath , hath made the self-same Observation ; but to me ' t was novel and most unexpected . I loath 'd the Father , yet I lov 'd the Babe . But did I truly loathe the Father ? There raged still in my Breast a War betwixt Love and Hate for Lord Bellars . I had lov 'd him like a Father and he had betray 'd me like a Rogue . Surely , Belinda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are by Violence to our tender Sensibilities and Betrayal of our Trust . From Time to Time I could rekindle in my Heart the Tenderness I had once felt for Lord Bellars ; but more oft ' the Love curdl 'd into Hate , and I felt Rage against him and indeed against all Men . Some Days I would walk the Streets of London to buy some necessary Item of my Trade  --  new Patches or Paints , Scents , and such  --  and I would feel the sheerest Fury ' gainst ev'ry Man I saw . The Beau that strutted with his Snuff-Box and Sword , the Footmanp234that ap 'd the Beau 's Fine Manners and wore his cast-off Clothes , the proud Physician all in black , the Officer of the Guard in his Finery , the Linen Draper that mimickt the Officer 's Fine Manners in his turn , e'en the lowly Nightmen and Polemen whose assorted Stinks call 'd forth Memories of the Privies they clean 'd  --  all of ' em could strut imperiously above the best-hearted , most learned Lady in the Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must bear the Great Belly that assures all Humankind of its Survival ! If Men had to bear the Babes , I thought , the entire Race would perish ! For what Man would risque his Life for a mere Babe ? E'en he , who would so readily risque it disputing some foolish Point of Honour in a Duel with another Man , would balk at the very Thought of enduring Pain or Death for a helpless Lump of shiv'ring pink Flesh that can neither walk nor talk to pay him Homage ! For the Curse of the Male Sex is its constant Need of Homage  --  Homage to its Intellect and Wit , Homage to its Gallantry and petty Prowess betwixt the Bed-Clothes ; whilst the Female Sex , said to be so vain , is vain only of mere superficial Beauty . And e'en that Vanity  --  oft ' , I confess , so noisesome and tedious  --  is nought but an Instinct for Survival ; for a Woman knows that in a World where Women have no Pow'r  --  Beauty , like Witchcraft , is her only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rage at their Betrayal and my Body 's , and sheer , irrational Delight at the new Life pulsing thro ' my Blood . Oft ' I would catch myself smiling for no Reason , smiling at the Babe in my Belly that could not see my Smile . Then , quite as suddenly , my Smile would turn to furious Tears , and I would weep and rage at that which could not be undone . 0 I felt trapp 'd and imprison 'd by this Babe as well as blest by it . I lov 'd it and I hated it , both equally and both by Turns . ' T was Time to go again to Lancelot in Newgate ; for tho ' I had been sending Money lo these many Weeks , the Press of my Work had prevented my visiting that foul Prison . Indeed , the Idea quite affrighted me ; my last Visit to Newgate had left me haunted by terrifying Dreams and Visions for many Days afterward . Upon this Occasion , howe'er , I arriv 'd to find Lancelot in a changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been before , just so much was he high and buoyant now . Indeed , he was almost the Lancelot of Old  --  the green-eyed Wonder I had first met upon the Road ! No longer did he languish in a Dungeon in Rags , but he was restor 'd to his Proper Place above Ground , and dress 'd finely as you please in the Clothes I 'd sent him ( with the Money I had earn 'd upon my Back ! ) . Moreo'er , he was surroundedp235by a Mob of Prisoners , who lookt to him for Wit , for Philosophy , and , above all , for Hope of bett'ring their wretched Condition . ( I'faith , a Man may be starving and diseas 'd , but if he bath Hope , t he will not swiftly perish . For Hope is as a floating Spar to a drowning Man ; it buoys him up yet a little longer , and puts him above the Waves when he might well be under ' em ! ) Lancelot stood upon a Table in the High Hall , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd quite grandly to the Prigs , whilst his good Friend , John Littlehat , stood by with troubl 'd Mien , wond'ring what new Mischief Lancelot would bring down upon himself now . I went first to Littlehat , for Lancelot was raving upon his Pulpit and was separated from me by a Wall of stinking , mutt'ring , shouting Humanity . " Ah , Madam Fanny , " says Littlehat . " Bless yer Soul , fer ye have sav 'd our Friend from deep Despair ; an ' yet I fear that when he raves like this , he is in greater Danger still ! He hath won the Prisoners to his Party by the finest Talk an ' also by his Arts of Healing . I'faith , many are convinced he is a Saint , if not Jesus Christ Himself , fer he bath done such Miracles in raising the Sick an ' restoring ' em to Health that they are now convinced of all he says , an ' I fear fer him more now than e'er before . " " What is this bloody Code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 's Height . " Why , ' t is nought but an Excuse to kill the Poor , whilst the Rich may steal an ' go free ! " To which fine Sentiments the Rabble chear 'd . Hearten 'd by their Adulation , Lancelot grew more fever 'd still : " Why should a poor Man hang fer stealin ' a Sheep or a Horse ? Why should a poor Man hang fer stealin ' five Shillin 's worth o ' Toys from a Toy-Shop , or cuttin ' off a Watch from a Pretty Fellow that hath ten gold Watches if he hath one ? Hath not that self-same Pretty Fellow stolen yer Daughter 's Honour or the Fruits o ' the Land where yer Father labour 'd ? Why should the Sweat o ' yer Father 's Brow be worth nothin ' an ' the Pretty Fellow 's Watch be worth yer Neck in the Noose ? Why should it be call 'd Lawlessness an ' Highway Robbery when a poor Man steals what he needs to eat an ' yet be call 'd Fine Manners when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man 's Brow ? Doth not God Himself say Consider the Lilies o ' the Field ' an ' how little they toil an ' sweat ? Yet He provides fer ' em ! Why not likewise fer the Poor ? Are the Rich alone God 's Lilies an ' the Poor nought but Clods o ' Mud ? " Whereupon the Rabble shouted " Amen ! " and " Blessed be our Lancelot ! " and other Sentiments of like Nature.  | " I fear he means to lead a Rebellion of the Prisoners , " says Littlehat to me privily , " an ' surely he will hang fer that . " " An ' now , ye Debtors , " Lancelot goes on , " where is it writ within the Holy Book that one Man may lock another up an ' throw away the bloody Key because o ' bloody Debt ? I say there is no such Thing as Debt ! Each Man must have whate'er he needs to live an ' no Man may be his Creditor nor Usurer , nor can he seize him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all God 's Debtors  --  are we not ?  --  an ' if God can forgive Sinners , sure he can forgive Debtors , too ! " More Chears and Blessings rose from the Rabble now , and Lancelot rais 'd his Arms to acknowledge his frenzied Publick , then leapt down from the Table with all the Grace of a Cat , and made his Way thro ' the Mob to me and Littlehat . Without a Word , he press 'd me in his Arms , enfolded me , and strokt my Hair . Then , quite suddenly , as if remembering himself , he drew back , startl 'd by his own Affection for me , and essay 'd again to conceal it ' neath his wonted Swagger . " Fanny , me Girl , let me look at ye ! Why , what Finery ! Hath Fortune smil 'd on ye in wicked London Town ? " " You might call it Fortune , " say I , " but I would not . Come  --  may we speak somewhere privily ? " Whereupon Littlehat led us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bed and Table , which my Largesse to Lancelot had secur 'd . " Whence comes this Finery ? " asks Lancelot again , regarding my lavender silk Morning Dress , with pale green satten Ribbands , and my lavender silken Shoes with Pattens that lookt too fine to endure e'en one Hour in the muddy London Streets . " The same Place your Finery comes from , " say I , brazenly as you please . " I have sweated for it upon my Back ! " " A Common Strumpet , Fanny mine ? " " Nay , Lancelot , a most uncommon one ! For the Tricks I 've learnt in lo these last few Weeks would take the Crimp out of your flaming Locks and cause your very Toes to curl towards Heaven ! There is nought common about my Strumpeting ! " " Fanny ! " says Lancelot , aghast . " How can a Lass o ' yer Quality stoop to such a low Occupation ? " " A low Occupation ! A low Occupation ! What ? Do my Ears deceive me ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Preacher of true Christianity ! Did not Jesus Himself forgive the Harlot ? Marry come up , Lancelot , I ne'er thought I 'd see the Day when you yourself talkt like a hypocritical Whig ! " " But Harlotry , Fanny , to sell yer Soul fer fine Ribbands  --  "  | " Not my Soul  --  but merely my Body , and not for myself , but for you and the Merry Men . 0 this is a fine State of Affairs ! I rescue you by the Sweat of my unwilling Thighs and this is all the Thanks I get ! Damn your Eyes , Lancelot , I leave you to your Fate ! " And with that I pickt up my Petticoat and prepar 'd to leave the Chamber . " Pray , sweet Fanny , do not be so rash . " " Pray , sweet Lancelot , I might say the same to you ! " " But why Harlotry , Fanny ? " " If I must explain that to you of all People , Lancelot , then truly I am curst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wit and Learning alone ? Hardly ! I could be as great a Philosopher as Plato himself , yet would I starve unless I were to earn my Keep the only Way a Woman can ! Yea , you would starve , too , and my Babe as well . " " Yer what ? " says Lancelot . " Lancelot , I am with Child . " Lancelot lookt wildly at me , as if he 'd kill me for the very Words . " Is it that Black Swine , Horatio ? " he rav 'd . " No  --  " say I , " a thousand Noes . Would that my Bastard Babe belong 'd to the Merry Men ! But ' t is my own Step-Father ! " " An ' where 's the scurvy Blackguard now ? " " That I ca n't say . " " An ' what d'ye mean to do ? " " I mean to work as hard as e'er I can , to put by Money for the Babe . What else can I do ? " " Ye can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've sent fer those that remain alive  --  e'en Horatio , if we can track him , an ' I mean to raise the fiercest Army o ' Prisoners that London e'er hath seen  --  fer we mean to change the World ! " " Lancelot , you are daft . Surely you 'll hang ! " " Sure I 'll hang whether I raise an Army or no  --  fer I was to hang before , an ' now I stand accus 'd o ' new Crimes by the wretched Captain o ' the wretched Hannibal ! Death 's not me Fear , Fanny . I fear Gaol an ' Melancholy more than Death . Death 's a Reprieve , me Girl . Death will bring Martin back . Besides I 've nought to lose . " I shook my Head sadly . " Fanny , ye grow hard in yer new Life . Come with us ! We 'll be the happiest Outlaw Band since Robin Hood 's an ' raise yer Babe up in the Forest as the Child o ' all the Merry Men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll raise him in the Wild without the Lyes o ' Society to warp his little Soul ! "  | " And what if he 's a Girl ? " " Nonsense , ' t is a Boy . I can see it in yer Eyes ! " " Lancelot , you are mad ! You 're the next Thing to a Bedlamite . " " An ' proud o ' that ! " cries he . " Fer is not Wit to Madness oft ' allied ? Think o n't , Fanny . Think o ' the Babes expos 'd in Dung-Heaps thro'out London Town . Is not me own Proposal better ? D'ye wish yer Child to dye upon a Heap o ' Straw when ye yerself are clapp 'd or consumptive from yer vile Trade ? " This indeed brought Tears to my Eyes , for I knew ' t was no idle Chatter . All o'er London and in the outlying Fields , one could see hapless Babes thrown out in Dustbins , expos 'd upon the Heaths , and mewling like so many abandon 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clos 'd their Eyes , putting ' em out of their brief Lives of Misery . " ' Twill ne'er happen to my Child , " said I. But e'en so saying , I doubted the Truth of my own Words . Infants there were aplenty in London , but no Money to clothe or feed ' em ; and oft ' the very Mother who had borne in Pain , at risque to her own Life , put her own sweet Babe out to starve upon the Street for no Reason but Harsh Necessity . Thus , she shed double Tears , both for herself and all her wasted Griefs , and for the Babe and its sad Life , though brief . I mus 'd upon these Melancholick Thoughts as I left Newgate and found a Chair back to Coxtart 's Brothel , for Lancelot 's dire Warnings might portend my Fate . Far better to cast my Lot with the Merry Men than waste away of Pox and leave an orphan 'd Babe  --  or worse , see my own Child waste away for Want of Food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I held my Head , all too briefly , above the Rabble . But what would happen when I grew great-bellied as I must in a Month or two ? What would happen when I could not earn my own Bread ? Or if I contracted a fatal Fever in Childbed ? Or if , i'faith , I dy 'd and left a Babe to Coxtart ? Perish the Thought ! From the Height and Isolation of my Chair , I lookt down into the London Streets . There clamour 'd all the sundry London Throng  --  ragged Orange Women , Serving Maids , Street Urchins , and Chimney Sweeps . Nothing separated me from their Fates but a few Months ' Work upon my Back and my Goddess-given Beauty , which someday soon should fade . E'en riding in a Chair , I could scarce forget that a fearful Fate awaited me upon the Streets ! I had but narrowly escap 'd , and not for long . Fortune 's Wheel might turn again and leave me helpless as before . I might be thrown in Prison by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p239by  a miserable Magistrate who found his greatest Joy in blaming Harlots for the Sins of Men ! I myself had seen Harlots flogg 'd in Newgate , and heard tell of many who beat Hemp in Bridewell . What did it profit me to cast my Fate with respectable Society ? What had respectable Society e'er done for me ? My Fate was with the Outlaws ! For despite my Finery , a red Witch 's Garter lay beneath it all ! And despite my hir 'd Chair , I was a Wayfarer , a weary Pilgrim , a Traveller upon Foot ! E'en my Magick Steed was lost to me by now and the only Witchcraft I possess 'd was in my Garter and my long red Hair . Better to cast my Lot with Lancelot , than , by and by , to starve in London . Very well , I thought , I 'd return to the Brothel for the nonce , and wait for further Word from Robin Hood.  |p240Containing  a most edifying Excursion into the World of London Clubs , in which our Heroine journeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finds him a more familiar Figure than she otherwise would have guess ' d . PERHAPS YOU WILL RECALL that upon my first Acquaintance with the fair Wenches of Mother Coxtart 's Emporium , I mention 'd that four of the Girls were away , upon my Arrival , for they were employ'dat a Private Revel . These Ladies were Melinda , Sophia , Rosamund , and Bridget ; and they were , in many Ways , the most skill 'd Wenches in the whole Establishment . They specializ 'd , so to say , in Private Revels , and they were better paid , I learnt , than the other Wenches ; but what they did remain 'd mysterious to me , for they were always coming and going , and did not ply their Trade within the Brothel itself . I was eager to learn what private Business they were engaged in ; howe'er , as you may guess , the Girls were not so eager to tell their Doings , fearing , as they did , my Competition . For ' t was true that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their Eyes . And tho ' I myself knew , having been beautiful my whole Life long , that Beauty creates as many Woes as it bestows Advantages ( not the least of which is the Envy of other Women ) , they , lacking Great Beauty , and fancying it a Cure for whate'er ail 'd ' em , did not share this Wisdom . Of these four Wenches who carried on at Private Revels , Melindawas the most amiable and the least suspicious of me . She was a pretty Thing , with light brown Hair , and a Merry Face ( which , sad to say , was marr 'd by Pockmarks ) . ' T was bruited about that she was of Noble Birth , but had been banish 'd from her Home in Yorkshire by an evil Father , who ne'er forgave her Refusal to marry a deprav 'd and ancient Suitor whom she loath 'd . Melinda , herself , soon bore out the Rumour ; for she was no poor Countryp241Girl like the others but carried herself like a depos 'd Princess ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , but only a Baronet ) . She 'd grown from Girlhood at Gigglesden Hall in the West Riding , and spoke often and longingly of its mullion 'd Windows , its great Gables , its beauteous circular Window of eight Lights , and its brooding Topiary Garden , casting ominous Shadows upon Velvet Lawns . No sooner did she make my Acquaintance , than she wanted me to know that she was no Common Strumpet but a banish 'd Bride , that she was accustom 'd to Finery beyond these tawdry Brothel Rags , that she found the Manners at Coxtart 's Tea-Table distasteful in the extream , and that the Life she liv 'd Today was but a pale Reminderof her former Glory . " Oft'times I dream I 've dy 'd and gone to Hell , " says she , speakingof the Brothel Life . " My Childhood was the sheerest Paradise . At Gigglesden , we din 'd off golden Plates and had our Wine brought in Venetian Goblets of Emerald swirl 'd with Amethyst , like unto an Adriatick Sea whereon a low Sun sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the Past , not the Present , she spoke in a Voice that was more a Child 's than a Woman 's ; i'faith , for all the gorgeous Rhetorick she us 'd when speaking of her long-lost Home , she seem 'd at other Times to lapse into Baby 's Prattle . Before long , I won her Confidence by refusing to mock her Dreams of vanish 'd Grandeur ( as the other Wenches did ) , and indeed , by becoming the only Wench in the House with whom she could reminisce o'er her Youth . I appear 'd , in fact , to share her Obsessions with her Past ; and I paid her Tit for Tat  --  her Memories of Gigglesden with mine of Lymeworth . Soon we form 'd a Pair and were fast Friends ; whereupon I took the Liberty of enquiring about the Nature of these Private Revels . There were , she told me , many Clubs in London , and most of ' em met in Coffee and Chocolate Houses ' round the Town . Some were Lit'ry Clubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Golden Fleece , wherein each Member assum 'd a new Name , such as Sir Whore-Hunter , or Sir Boozy Prate-All . There was the celebrated Mollies Club , whose Members dress 'd up as Women and titter 'd behind their painted Fans . They had a Secret Couplet which was the very Proof of Membership , and they delighted in reciting it to each other , thus : Tell me , gentle Hobdehoy , Art thou Girl or art thou Boy ? There was also the Ugly Club , whose Members were suppos 'd to he the most loathsome-featur 'd in all of England ; and the Lyingp242Club , whose Members were mostly Lawyers ; and the Divan Club , whose Members fancied Turkish Dress , Turkish Tobacco , Hashish , and Revels in the Turkish Style . But the Clubs that concern 'd Melinda ( and the other three Wenches ) were those formerly known by the name of Hell-Fire Clubs , and regarding these , great Secrecy and Discretion were requir 'd , for just a little over three Years previously , a Royal Proclamation had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since that Time , the Hell-Fire Clubs had all changed their Names and conducted their " Amorological Rites , " their " Corybantic Orgies , " their " Tahitian Fertility Rites , " most privily . No longer did they meet at the notorious Rose Tavern nor at well-known scandalous Bagnios , nor e'en at Chocolate and Coffee Houses , but instead conspir 'd to find more sequester 'd Quarters , usually at some small Distance from the Metropolis . One such Club , said she , had initiated her into Membership , but she could tell me no more about it . Only if I were an Initiate myself and sworn to Secrecy could I learn of it , whereupon I would be committed to its Rules for Life . Did I wish to take on such a heavy Oath , she askt ; for were I e'er to break it , Satan himself should come to fetch my Soul . " Do they worship the Devil , then , Melinda ? " I askt her . " Aye , Fanny , and ' t is on Penalty of Banishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreo'er , once you are initiated you must serve that Club and that alone ; you may see no Swains within the Brothel here . " " Would you take me with you ? " I askt . " Fanny , do you dare ? " she said in her Child-like Cadences . " Pray think o n't . For there are Times I wish I ne'er had seen that cursed Club . " I thought of my Friends the Witches and all I 'd learnt from them of Witchcraft . Could a Club of London Fops be more terrifyingthan what I 'd witness 'd upon Stonehenge Down ? Why , it seem 'd hardly likely ! Besides , these Private Parties paid far more than all of Coxtart 's Swains together . Since the Babe I carried would start to show ere long , I 'd better make my Fortune whilst I might ! " I dare and dare again , " said I , as brazen as you please . SomehowI was certain that ' t was all the sheerest Twattle , and now that I 'd determin 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whate'er I wisht ; i'faith , I felt invincible . Mother Coxtart , presenting no Obstacle to our Plans , ( indeedp243she encouraged us in ' em , owing to the Fact that she herself stood to gain more by my new Occupation ) , sent Word to the Founder of the Mysterious Club , that a new " Young Nun " was to be " prepar 'd for Vestalship , " and fixt my Initiation for that very Week . When the appointed Ev'ning arriv 'd , Melinda came into my Chamber carrying my " Holy Vestments , " Iockt the door behind her , and show 'd me how to dress myself like a Nun of that " Sacred Order . " She brought with her two Habits , all in white and made of the finest , thinnest Wool . These loose Garments ( which , indeed , conceal'dour Forms ) we were to wear with no Undergarments whatsoe'er . Our white silk Stockings we would roll above the Knee and fasten with red Garters ( one of which I possess 'd already ) ; but we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sort . Ne'ertheless , chain 'd ' round our naked Waists , we were to wear invertediron Crucifixes upon iron Chains . Our Headdresses were made to look like Nuns ' , but with the Addition of white silk Masks , which cover 'd nearly the entire Face ; and our Hair was also tuckt away so that we could in no wise be recogniz 'd by its Colour . O'er all this Costume , we wore black velvet Cloaks with ample Hoods so that our Nuns ' Costumes could not be seen at all by curious Passersby ; and in these Disguises we had just attir 'd ourselves when a Footman came to say that a Chariot awaited us without . ' T was Twilight in the London Street when we stepp 'd into the waiting Coach , drawn by four white Horses . The Carriage Door was bare of Markings ; no Coat of Arms reveal 'd the Owner to our View . But within was our Guide , a Maskt Man in a black velvet Cloak , made like ours , ( and ' neath that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good Ev'ning , Ladies , " said he , welcoming us , with great Formality , and presently we were off across the London Streets , with our Guide saying not a Word to us all the while . When we reach 'd Oxford Street he produced two scarlet silk Handkerchiefs and , with great Solicitude , bade us blindfold ourselves ; for ' t was one of the Rules of the Club that female Acolytes must not know its Meeting Place . I began , then , to grow wary ; for there is nought quite so unsettlingas rattling along in a Coach without knowing the Direction of one 's Journey , and there is , withal , a Sense of Helplessness owing to the Fact that one can not see one 's Way to escape , should Escape prove necessary . I remember 'd my blindfolded Journey with Lance/lot and grew e'er more untranquil . But I reminded myself that I had bargain 'd for just such an Adventure , so I strove to quiet my own Fears . We drove for a Time ; just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Effects of the Blindfold upon my Senses , but after a while , I could readily feel the pav 'd Road turn to an earthen one and the Coach go slower and yet begin to rattle still more than before . I could smell that we were in the Country . The sweet Odour of mown Hay ascended my Nose and I heard the Sounds of ev'ning Birds communicating in the Dusk . I laps 'd into a Sort of Reverie , owing to the Motion of the Coach and the Effects of the Blindfold , and I sought to imagine what my Life would be like after I bore my Babe , and ran away to the Forest with Lancelot and the Merry Men . I essay 'd to picture the Face and Features of the tiny Life I carried so hidden within me ; but i'faith , I could not . This Babe was as mysterious to me as God  --  a Presence that determin 'd all my Fate , yet which I could not see . We must have ridden longer than I reckon 'd , for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop and our Guide bade us remove our Blindfolds . We had stopp 'd before a ruin 'd Church curiously cut into a Hillside , surmounted with evil-looking Yews , and a full Moon caught upon one of their Points like a Head upon a Pike . The Facade of the Church was inlaid with strange Stones and Pebbles , curiously workt in what seem 'd a Runick Design , and , indeed , it appear 'd more pagan than Christian . Here we dismounted , and our Guide nodded towards the Entranceof the Church . A Shiver shook my Shoulders , for the Church seem 'd the very Image of Evil , but I had come too far to give in to idle Fears , so instead I clasp 'd Melinda 's Hand , and we advanced to the Portal . " Are you afear 'd , Fanny ? " askt she , her infantile Voice quaveringdespite all her Efforts to control it . " No , " said I , lying as much as she . We walkt , following our Guide , into a low vaulted Passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stone , in which the Marks of Pick-Axes could still be seen . The Caves were damp and dark , illuminated here and there by single Tapers , stuck in Sconces , mounted along the rustick Walls , but these gave pitifully small Illumination . Our Footsteps echo 'd upon damp Stone ; and we heard as well the continual Sound of running Water , dripping from the stony Eaves . At Times our Feet falter 'd , but our Guide urged us e'er onward , saying , " Come , Ladies , there 's nothing here to fear . "  |p245'Twas  cold Comfort to us , for as we proceeded deeper into the Bowels of the Earth , we grew more terrified . We seem 'd to pass dark little Alcoves cut into the Stone , whence came the low Sounds of Masculine Laughter and the higher Sounds of Feminine Laughter . At one Turning , I nearly dy 'd of Fright , for there , carv 'd above an Archway , and illuminated by half a dozen Candles , was an Image of the Devil as ravenous and open-mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointed Teeth was a Woman 's white silk Stocking  --  as if indeed the Foul Fiend had eaten her alive ! Beyond this Archway , we advanced timidly to a Place where the Walls were honey-comb 'd with tiny Chambers , within which I seem 'd to hear Stirring ; but these Chambers were so dark , i'faith , that I could see nothing more than shadowy Forms . We continu 'd onward o'er a Bridge that cross 'd a Black River , and on the opposite side took a sharp Turn to the Left thro ' the narrowest of Passages , where suddenly we saw before us , all illumin 'd by Candles set within Skulls , a Pagan Catacomb . Candlelight flicker 'd in hollow Eye-Sockets , so that the empty Skulls seem 'd to have a sort of ghastly Life within ' em . In a trice , one of these Skulls began to speak : " Welcome Sisters , " came a thund'ring Voice , follow 'd by a Gale of devilish Laughter that near knockt me off my Feet with Terror . Our Guide led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I would ne'er emerge again , and I was all but ready to kiss my Immortal Soul goodbye . I curst my restless Nature , my foolish Adventurousness , my Willingness to risque Life and Limb for mere Curiosity . Just as I was ready to shout , " No more ! " and turn upon my Heel and flee  --  no matter what the Consequences  --  we were usher 'd into a Great Hall , hollow 'd deep inside the Hill , with a central Banquetting Table illumin 'd by a great Oil Lamp of curious Design , and surrounded by Statues of unclad Nymphs and Venuses and prancing Satyrs , which stood in shallow Niches ' round the Perimeter of the Room . Seated at this Banquet Table ( which was , by the by , set for Thirteen with pewter Plates , and Goblets fashion 'd from Skulls ) were five " Monks , " dress 'd all in brown Robes , and maskt like ourselves ( but in brown Masks ) ; and five " Nuns " in Attire preciselylike our own . Our Guide led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood to take our Wraps , and then we were seated , whereupon our Wine Goblets were fill 'd with Claret . The " Monk " who sat at the Head of the Table then lifted his Skull-shap 'd Goblet and propos 'd the Toast :  | " Here in the gloomy Caves of Endless Night , We Stalwart Sons of Satan pledge to fight ' Gainst all the False Morality of FearAnd Dedicate our Lives to endless Chear ! " To which the Brothers responded " Hear ! hear ! " and rais 'd their Goblets to drink . I peer 'd into the Depths of my Skull-Goblet with considerable Suspicion , but then drank , at the Urging of the Brothers . Now a Feast was set before us , and the Brother who sat at the Table 's Head solemnly nam 'd each Dish for the assembly 'd Multitude . First we were serv 'd " Holy Ghost Pye " ( which seem 'd a sort of Kidney Pye to me ) , then " Devil 's Loins " ( a Leg o ' Mutton , to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being nought but two Pullets , set Breasts upwards and garnish 'd with Cherryes for Nipples ) . When each Dish was nam 'd , the Maskt Brothers chear 'd and made various witless , lewd Remarks , which scarcely bore repeating ( could I , in any case , remember ' em  --  which indeed I can not ) . The Drinking continu 'd fiercely thro'out Supper , the Ladies growing quite as drunk as the Men . Now my Fears were quieted again , for this devilish Club seem 'd nothing more than a Group of hor 'd Rakes pursuing their usual Pleasures of Wine , Women , and Gluttony , albeit in monastick Garb and deep within the Bowels of the Earth . What a silly Goose Melinda was , I thought , to be so terrified ! If these foolish Pranks could conjure the Devil , then surely the Devil was no more than a Fop that strutted in the Mall , or lounged at White 's or the Cocoa Tree , showing off his new Paris-made Suit , his French Valet , and his Smatt'ring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Plates had been clear 'd away , the head Monk stood , rais 'd his Goblet again , and demanded that we all make a Solemn Oath ne'er to report what had transpir 'd in these Stygian Caves . " For whosoe'er will break the Devil 's Oath , " says he , " the Devil himself will fetch him straight to Hell ! " The assembly 'd Company swore the Oath readily enough , whereupon the head Monk , with all due Ceremony , nodded to the Nun on his right , help 'd her climb upon the Table , threw her Habit upwards so that it quite cover 'd her Face , and ravish 'd her there within Sight of all . " In the Name of Satan , I anoint thee ! " said he as the crucial Fit of Lust was upon him . And then he fell , heaving with Passion ,  |p247u|pon  the chosen Bride of Christ , whilst the other Monks toasted his amatory Skills with their Skull-shap 'd Goblets . What idiotick Entertainment ! thought I. What uninspir 'd Loving . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table before one 's Friends was the sort of Play one would expect of Boys of Fourteen , not of grown Men ! But the Nun seem 'd to enjoy it ; indeed , she seem 'd to enjoy it still more when the next Monk , in his Turn , climb 'd upon the Table and also anointed her " in the Name of Satan . " Surely I hop 'd all the Women were not to be accorded like Treatment , for now it appear 'd that a third Monk was beginning his Ministrations to the Nun , but this Monk was hardly so inept a Lover , and he made certain to kiss and fondle her for a Time before he began ( whilst his brother Monks made lewd , encouraging Noises as if they were Footmen at a Play ) . I sat transfixt , for there was something uncannily familiar about the Motions this Monk made . ' T was almost as if I knew him  --  despite his Disguise , but i'faith , I could not place him . Then , slowly , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she began to moan and writhe with Pleasure , whereupon he lifted the Skirts of his Monk 's attire , brandish 'd a fine brown Cock of ample Proportions , thrust it into her eager Cunnikin , and cried aloud , " In the Name of Satan I anoint thee ! " ' T was Lord Bellars ' own Voice . Upon hearing it , I grew cold as Ice and my Heart began to beat so loudly I fear 'd all the Monks should hear it as well . ' T was unmistakable that those resonant Cadences belong 'd to Lord Bellars . His Face might I forget in Heaven or Hell , but his Voice ne'er ! Hearing it , I e'en felt Passion for him again , and then Loathing for myself for feeling Passion towards one who had us 'd me so scurvily . Had my Heart no Pride ? ( But then , hath any Heart Pride ? Pride is a Possession of the Brain , not the Heart ; and the Heart will triumph o'er the Brain in any Contest . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rest of the foul Ceremony , each Monk in turn climbing upon the Table , ravishing the Nun , with greater or lesser Skill , and climbing down to the Chears and Huzzahs of his Brothers . I watch 'd , but my Eyes saw nothing . I listen 'd but my Ears heard nothing . In the Cave of my Skull , there echo 'd only the Ghost of Lord Bellars ' Voice , saying again and again , " In the Name of Satan I anoint thee ! " ' T was a Dream , I thought  --  this doltish Merriment , this childishDebauch . Thro ' it all , I sat still as a Statue , terrified lest Bellars recognize me ( yet , how could he , in my Disguise ? ) and terrifiedp248lest I be askt to lye upon the Table in my Turn , whereupon I would have to submit to his splendid Love-making . Surely then all would be lost ! My fine Resolve to hate him would vanish into the Ether if he so much as touch 'd me ! ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no longer young and virile , and they had eaten and drunk to Satiety . One Debauch apiece was all most of ' em desir 'd . Indeed , most of ' em could hardly rise to that Occasion . As the last weary Fop roger 'd the still-willing Nun , the head Monk declar 'd : " Now are we all most truly join 'd in Soul , For we are Brothers of the self-same Hole ! " Whereupon ( and quite as if this were the most ordinary of Soirees ) the Ladies withdrew , leaving the Gentlemen to piss , drink , and smoke their Pipes . The Nun whose Cunnikin had been the Site of the quaint , fraternal Ceremony was help 'd down from the Table  --  seeming not much the worse for Wear  --  and all the other Nuns usher 'd her out . " How was it ? " one Nun whisp'red to her when we were out of the Monks ' Range of Hearing . " Dull as always , " says she , " except for the third one . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the third ? " " Ah , " sighs she with remember 'd Pleasure . " He 's the only lively Fellow in the Bunch . The others are half dead . " Now this Piece of News was scarce soothing to my Ears ; it but inflam 'd my senseless Passion more . How could I still desire a Man who had us 'd me so cruelly ? ' T was past all Reasoning  --  and yet , and yet , I did . Melinda now came up beside me . " Were you terrified , Fanny ? " she whisper 'd in my Ear . " Utterly , " said I. " I fear the Devil , Fanny , " said Melinda . " And so do I , " said I. And yet the Devil that I fear 'd was my own Step-Father , Lord Bellars . Both his Touch and his Voice held greater Terrors for me than the scaly Embrace of the Foul Fiend himself . I'faith , I was beginning to wonder whether the Foul Fiend was n't more Chimera than Reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witches had been murder 'd by Mortal Men ; and I had been undone by one Young Man who claim 'd to love me as a Daughter . What need was there for Devil more than this ? " I fear the Devil , too , " I said to Melinda , clutching her Hand.  |p249And  she squeez 'd my Hand warmly  --  for she was a True Friend , despite her Foolishness . Now the Nuns retied to their Robing Room  --  another Chamber dug from sheerest Stone  --  where Chamber-Potts were provided for their Use , as well as Scents of various sorts . Some of the Ladies unmaskt merely to cool themselves ; most did not . Some avail 'd themselves of the Chamber-Potts and Scents , daubing the Perfumes under their Habits , as if indeed they hop 'd to be " anointed " next . I was still so shaken by the unexpected Presence of Lord Bellars at this Revel that I was almost unaware of the Chatter of the Ladies , but by and by my Ears became attun 'd to a Conversation betwixt two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you know him , Madam ? " says one Nun to another . " Know him ! Aye , as well as the Beggar knows his Dish . We have been Lovers these five Years past ! " " And doth it not raise Jealousy in your Heart to see him swive another ? " " No , Madam ; Jealousy is the basest of Emotions  --  suitable for the commonest of Folk . Noble Hearts ne'er feel Jealousy . Why , we tell each other of our Liaisons  --  ' t is Capital Sport ! " The Words rang Bells in my Brain ! Capital Sport ! The very Phrase Lord Bellars had us 'd in that foul Letter to his Mistress in which he describ 'd his Seduction of me ! Could the Voice I was hearing belong to my loathed Rival ? " Madam , " said I , addressing the Nun who had spoken . " You speak of Lord Bellars , do you not ? " " ' Faith , you are an impertinent Strumpet , " says the Lady . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Begging your Pardon , Madam , " I said , " but he sounds so like my own Lover that I could not but break in . Forgive me . " " What ? Your own Lover ? And who , pray tell , are you ? " " Madam , " I continu 'd , smiling ' neath my Mask , " I would say my Name most willingly , but you have just reminded me quite rightly that we are not to use proper Names here  --  so I dare not . " And with that Retort I turn 'd and began applying Attar of Roses to my Breasts and Thighs . I laugh 'd a little to myself . 0 I knew ' t was a small Triumph , but a Triumph nonetheless . I would plot a greater Revenge upon this haughty Lady yet ! Revenge was the unworthiest of Actions  --  that I knew . Revenge belong 'd to God , not Man . And yet my Hatred of this Lady was so great , that it gave me sheerest Pleasure to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Footman came to summon the assembly 'd Company ofp250Ladies and bade them follow him to a Place he call 'd the Labyrinth . We were to disperse there , said he , each find a Hiding Place , and when the Monks discover 'd us by and by , we should lead ' em a Merry Chase until one Brother should catch us . This Labyrinth was more dimly lit than the Rest of the Caves and ' t was replete with blind Alleys and false Turnings , empty Niches , and thro'out , the Sound of Water dripping upon cold Stone . I shudder 'd somewhatwith the Cold and Damp ; but presently the Monks were heard in Pursuit , and I had to be nimble on my Feet despite the Darkness of the Caves and the Unevenness of the Floors . One fat Monk came after me , but I quickly eluded him by ducking into a Niche whither his surpassing Corpulence prevented him from following me . Soon I heard the Voice of another Monk calling in the Darkness : " I seek a Sister who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here I am ! "  --  but I ran quickly by him , and when he reach 'd out his Arms to catch me , I escap 'd . Now I thought myself safe , but , alas , I presently ran headlong in the Darkness into another Monk . He clasp 'd me firmly about the Waist , pusht me into a Niche despite my Cries , whereupon he fell to his Knees , imprison 'd my Legs with his strong Arms , duckt his Head under my Habit , and began to feast upon that Jam-Pott which Nature , in her curious Wisdom , hath placed betwixt the Thighs of the Fair Sex . Now this Sort of Love-making nearly always undoes me  --  no matter how loathsome the Swain who performs it ( for I can close my Eyes and forget his Person ) , but the Licking and Teazing was so sweet withal that I near fainted away with Rapture . " Ah what a ready , willing Nun , " says he , emerging from ' neath my Skirts , whereupon I am brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Bellars ' own Voice ! Suddenly I feel as if cold Water hath been pour 'd upon my Passion , and all my melting Lust turns to a steely Desire for Mastery ! I disengage myself from his Clutches , fall to my Knees , and begin making love to him the self-same Way in return , but , just as the crucial Fit is on him , I stop with deliberate Abruptness and run away ! " Ah , cruel Sister ! " he declares , pursuing me . But I say nothing  --  both to prevent him from recognizing my Voice and to elude him better . Still he catches me and kisses me passionately and moistly upon my not altogether unwilling Lips , asking , " Why art thou so cruel , my Love ? " I do not answer , but flee again , whereupon he pursues again , with greater Frenzy still  --  but now I hide in a Niche and slow e'enp251my Breath so that he will not discover me . I hear him running to and fro begging for his " Cruel Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady answers his Call and falls into his Arms sighing most willingly . " Excuse me , Madam , " says he , eluding her Embrace , and feelingalong the damp Stone Walls for me. 0 this is a pleasant Turn of Events ! His Longing for me is almost palpable . " Where are you , my Love ? " he calls to me . " Where are you , my Love ? " he sings again . But only the echoing Grots and Tunnels make the slightest Reply . Suddenly , I dart from my Hiding Place , find him , embrace him fleetingly , then run away again . Now he pursues me thro ' the Caves and I lead him a Merry Chase ' round and about the Labyrinth ( for , by this Time , my Eyes have grown accustom 'd to the Stygian Gloom ) . Beyond the Labyrinth , deeper into the Bowels of the Earth , there flows a River , black as the Styx itself , which is cross 'd by a small wooden foot Bridge . I flee across ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , I dart at once into a Cavelet , laughing to myself in Triumph . Now I fancy myself safe from him , hidden in the dark Recesses of my chosen Grotto . I crouch there for a few Minutes , holding my Breath , praying for Mercy to the Goddess , to spare me the Temptation of being found and ravish 'd by Lord Bellars . Alas , my Pray'rs are all in vain , for he gropes his Way into the little Cave and strokes its moist Walls until he finds me ! " Now I have caught you , my Beauty , " says Bellars , seizing me and pressing me to him with such Passion that I fear my very Habit shall melt away as if ' t were Butter instead of Wool . He clasps me to himself like Life itself and he a Dying Man . Ne'er have I felt such Need , such Desire . Whereupon he seeks to lay me on the Ground and make love to me there and then . My Intellect rebels , but 0 my Heart and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Kisses , fondles my Breasts ' neath the loose Nun 's Attire , and soon has his Way with me , sweeping away all my Resistance in a Flood of Passion more intense than any I have known. 0 I have been swiv 'd and roger 'd in the Brothel and felt little but sweet Triumph or base resentful Submission o'er Man 's Foolishness , but here some Essence of my Soul is touch 'd , and I must curse the Author of that Touch , because whosoe'er can make me sigh like this , can make me weep as well . When the Act is done , I am undone , bereft . All the SelfEsteemand sweet Control of my Destiny I have nurtur 'd , to thesep252last few Weeks , is gone ! I scramble to my Feet , e'en as he seeks to fondle me and cover me with Kisses of Gratitude . " Ne'er have I known a Cunnikin as sweet as yours , " says he . " Ne'er ? " say I , disguising my Voice . " Once only , and that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? And the Maid not dead yet ? " said I. " Only her Maidenhead dy 'd , " said Bellars , " but I hope the sweet Maid is alive yet , tho ' surely I have lost her . " " Sir , " said I , " I assure you I am no Maid , and have not been for some Time past . And now I 'll take my Leave . " " Please stay , " says he . " That I can not , " say I. " Where may I find you again ? " says he . " Nowhere , " say I. " I am a Phantom , a mere Chimera . In Daylight , I disappear . " " I beg of you , " he pleads . " Now will I vanish into thinnest Air , " say I. " I beg of you on bended Knee , " says he . " Then send for Madam Hackabout-Jones in care of Mother Coxtart , " say I , thinking myself daft to reveal my Whereabouts . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villain , Lover , Devil ; and e'en as I flee , I promise my sullied Soul and punish 'd Pride that I shall have the Upper Hand ere long and one Day be his Master !  |p253Of  Love and Lust , Pan and Satan , Longing and Loyalty , and other such lofty ( or low ) Matters ; together with our Heroine 's Adventures at the notorious George &; Vulture Inn , and how ( with the Aid of some of the surviving Merry Men ) she resolv 'd the Dilemma of her Destiny . IN THE COACH returning to Coxtart 's Brothel , thro ' the Wee Hours of the Morning , I drows 'd in my Blindfold , and sought to reflect upon the curious Doings of that fateful Night . I thought myself mad for giving Bellars a Way to seek me out , for I knew that my Passion for him had been but newly kindl 'd and that now I should live in Dread of his summoning me . But the Words had flown from my Lips against my Will . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again ! 0 what a vain and useless Thing was Passion ! Lancelot I lov 'd like a Brother , but Bellars , like the Devil , had stolen my Soul . Lancelot I would give my Soul to save from Death , but Bellars had my Body ! And who is the Wit that says : " He that possesses a Woman 's Body possesses her Soul " ? I was torn betwixt two Loves  --  one Golden Pan and one Oliveskinn'dSatan ! I wanted both  --  and both on my own Terms . I could give up neither  --  neither the Passion I knew with Bellars nor the fraternal Loyalty I knew with Lancelot . Were all Women so torn ? Was Love a two-faced Beast ( or two-faced God ) that ne'er could be united in one Man ? What would I do when Bellars sent for me as I knew he must ? What would I do with the curious Triumph of making him fall in Love with me when he knew not my true Identity ? I wisht , above all , to disown my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd me . But how could I disown it now when ' t was ripe with Life and craving the Father of that Life more than e'er before ? These and other Questions perplext me during my Blindfoldedp254Ride back to Coxtart 's House . I turn 'd ' em ' round and ' round in my Brain like Wheels that had no Beginning and no Ending , until at length I grew weary and full of Despair and I resolv 'd upon Sleep as the only Cure for my Perplexity . " Sleep that knits up the ravell 'd Sleeve of Care , " as Shakespeare hath writ . I would sleep , I promis 'd myself , and the Answer would come to me in a Dream . But , alas , no Dreams attended me . When I return 'd to Coxtart 's , I sank into the dreamless Sleep of the Dead . Morpheus sent no Messages ; nought but Blankness came , blessed , useless Blankness . I awaken 'd late to hear a persistent Rapping at my Chamber Door . ' T was Mother Coxtart herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once been arrogant ( for , since I was lately bringing her Establishment a handsome Profit , she could not do enough for me , it seem 'd , but would fore'er be grovelling , cringing , and scrapingto do my Bidding ) . How fickle was Fate ! What a Lottery was Life ! Two Months before she 'd scorn 'd me as a Beggar ; now she grovell 'd to me as to a Duchess . But , alas , knowing of her Fickleness , her Grovelling was of as little Use to me as her earlier Scorn . " Madam Fanny , " says she , " an ' beggin ' your Pardon for this rude Awak'ning , but there are Letters for you  --  or should I rather say , Billets Doux . " I could not bear to see her fawning Face  --  so I bade her slide the Letters ' neath my Door , whereupon I tiptoed out of Bed to fetch ' ern . Indeed , there were two , one seal 'd quite unmistakably with Bellars ' Seal , the other scrawl 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mud of the Kennels and bore no Seal at all . When I saw these two Missives ( and especially the one bearing Bellars ' Seal ) , my Hands began to shake like Leaves upon a great Autumnal Oak . I sav 'd the Bellars Missive for later , fancying that ' t would cause me the greatest Inquietude , and open 'd the one that was splotch 'd with Mud . I read the Scribblings of a hasty Hand : My Dearest Fanny : Robin Hood bids me inform you that all is in Readiness for the Greatest Triumph of his Career . Go at once to Horatio at The George &; Vulture in Cornhill , St. Michael 's Alley , and he will make all known to you . I beg of you , do not tarry . Horatio awaits . Dubious as I remain of this Enterprise , I am Sworn to do Robin 's Bidding , as are you . I trust your Noble Heart will ne'er let you forget . God Bless You . Yr . Affectionate Friend , Littlehat.  |p255The  News that Horatio had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for his Great Rebellion gave me less Apprehension , oddly , than Bellars ' Letter , which now I tore open with trembling , icy Hands : Adorable Creature , I know not what to say  --  my Mind is in greater Turmoil than a Bedlamite 's . Since we parted in those Stygian Caves last Ev'ning , I have slept not a Wink , being toss 'd upon a Sea of Doubts and Fears , the like of which I have ne'er known . I feel that my Heart is a leaky Boat , tormented upon Storm-cross 'd Seas , that should I fail to see you again , I am little better than a Crusoe without his Friday . A dreadful Cloud seems to hang o'er my Heart when I consider that you and I may be parted fore'er more . I ask you to search your Soul for whate'er Humanity and Compassion you possess and grant your Humble Suitor but one further Audience . If I can not then convince you that I have Pow'rs to make you the Happiest of Women , I shall withdraw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently with your Answer in order to assuage the intolerable Torment that afflicts the Heart of your most Faithful , Bellars . P.S. If you are still loath to reveal your Identity , I shall gladly meet you at a Masquerade . But I must meet you again ! Adieu . Reading this , my Mind suffer 'd as great a Tumult as Bellars had described in his own . What Answer should I make ? Should I meet him in Disguise and seek to wreak my Vengeance upon him ? Or would Vengeance melt into Submission the Moment my Eyes beheld him ? Moreo'er , if Bellars was so determin 'd to see me , why did he not accost me at the Brothel and seek to hire me as a common Whore  --  tho ' ' t was against the Hell-Fire Rules . E'en as I wonder 'd this , I knew the Answer . A common Whore would not be to his Taste  --  he who told his Lover of his Liaisons ! No , he must have Intrigue and Masks and Masquerades ; he must make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swive me as a Lady or a Nun , ne'er a Strumpet ! For a Man of Lord Bellars ' Parts pleasures and disdains " mere " Strumpets and must win , at all costs , more than a Cunnikin : he must win a Heart . Yet I could not ponder long my Response to this Dilemma with Lord Bellars , for I was bound to meet Horatio at The George &; Vulture and learn of Lancelot 's Rebellion , wherefore I hastily sent Answer to My Lord that I should seek him in the Costume of ap256Spanish Nun  --  for our Hell-Fire Nuns ' Robes were forbidden ev'rywherebut in the Club itself  --  whilst he should seek me in the Garb of Satan , at the next Costume Ridotto to be held at The King 's Theatre . Having sent such Reply , via Coxtart herself ( who prov 'd quite willing to play the Go-Between for me ) , I hastily dress 'd and took a Chair for The George &; Vulture . Now , The George &; Vulture had , of all London Inns , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resort for Ghosts , Goblins , and all Manner of Demons  --  a Reputation which the sinister Landlord not only did little to discourage , but in fact encouraged owing to his Belief that it brought more Custom to his Housetho ' indeed a strange kind of Custom . The Inn was notorious for being the Meeting Ground of Mountebanks , Thieves , Astrologers , and Fortune Tellers . This was the sort of Place where I was to meet Horatio ; and indeed , it liv 'd up to its Ill-Fame , for hanging o'er the Portal was a creaking wooden Sign whereon was painted the Image of a dreadfulVulture , preparing to swoop down upon its Prey . Within the Innyard itself sat the living Likeness of this Bird , a terrible Creature who regarded all Corners with the clearest , coldest Eye . The Landlord welcom 'd me . He was a Man nearly as terrible as his Bird , with a similar Beak , Eyes , and Mien . ' T is said that Men grow to resemble their loving Dogs ; but I can also attest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such Pets ! The Interior of the Inn was dark , tho ' ' t was little past Noon , for the Windows were kept shutter 'd ' gainst prying Eyes . A Fire burn 'd in the Grate , and sitting near it , at a Table in the Corner of the Room , was Horatio himself flankt by Francis Bacon and Puck Goodfellow ! Horatio 's Skin glow 'd chocolate brown in the flickering Firelight , whilst the Sword-shap 'd Scar upon Puck 's Visage seem 'd more ominous than e'er before . Sir Francis Bacon rose and greeted me first , saying , " What a fine Beauty you 're growin ' into , Fanny ! " And then Horatio embraced me with his usual Lust ; and after him , the tall and fearful-featur 'd Puck Goodfellow . " Pray , be seated , Sweetheart , " says Horatio , " and Welcome ! Let 's drink a Toast to this unexpected Reunion . " Whereupon theLandlord , who had hover 'd about us all the while , fetch 'd a roundof Claret , and we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if you 're not more beautiful than e'er before , myFannikins , " says Horatio , " but , in the sacred Name of Friendship ,  |p257I  'll refrain from doing Nature 's Bidding  --  tho ' such , I vow , is ne'er the Path of Wisdom . For doth not Juvenal himself say : ' Nunquam aliud Natura , aliud Sapientia dixit ' ? . . . Or , for you ignorant Prigs , " says he , glancing at Bacon and Puck , " Ne'er does Nature say one Thing and Wisdom another ' ! " " ' T is good to see you , Horatio , " say I , " and hear the Latin Syllables roll from your Tongue , but pray , what News have you from Lancelot ? " " He 's mad as e'er he was , " says Horatio , " but now he hath a new Plan which surpasses all his other Plans in Daring . And , if I may say so , in Stupidity .... " " Not Stupidity ! " cries Bacon , always ready to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Horatio , " for he means to lead the Prisoners out of Newgate and to the London Docks or e'en as far as Southampton or the Isle of Wight , where he plans to commandeer a Ship to take ' em to the New World . There he hopes to build a new Eden in the Wilderness  --  a True Deocracy of Christian Souls , ' or so he calls it . " " Where will he get the Ship ? And why the New World ? I thought Lancelot hated all Mention of the Colonies and thought America a Land of Savages ! " " And so ' t is , Fanny , so ' t is . Dare I , with my Skin my very Brand  --  e'en if I had no Brand  --  set Foot upon that savage Soil ? Why , here in England I may starve , and yet I 'm free , but in the Colonies , I 'm nought but a hunted Slave ! " " An ' yet you are not free in Law , " says Bacon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horatio , " but in Britannia we are not mere Lambs to slaughter , whilst in the Colonies the Fate that awaits a Runaway is harsh indeed . " " But Lancelot means to sail to Boston Harbour or Providence , " says Puck , " not to the Sugar Isles or to Virginia or the Carolinas . " " You are as much a Fool as Lancelot ! " shouts Horatio . " Do you think that the sanctimonious Puritans are any less brutal to the Black Man than the Plantation Owners ? Sure , they keep only a few domestick Slaves themselves  --  but the Wealth of all the Ship Owners in New England is built on Slaving ! Boston Harbour runs sticky with Rum and Blood ! Do you know my Worth in New England , Puck , my Friend ? ' T is a hundred and fifteen Gallons of Rum  --  no more , no less ! I 'd have a better Chance as a Cimmarone in Cuba or upon a Quilombo in Brazil than as a Black Man in saintly Boston or sanctimonious Providence ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what indeedp258Quilombos ? They sound like Things to eat ! " said I , hoping to add some Levity to this distressing Conversation . " The Cimmarones are the Outlaw Blacks that live in all the Sugar Isles as Fugitives  --  but most particularly in Cuba , where they build Stockades they call Palenques and defend their Freedom from the Rancheadores  --  the Evil Slave-Hunters . The Quilombos in Brazil are much the same  --  Settlements of Runaways who hide in the Bush and make their Raids upon the White Planters . I'faith , they oft ' have Plantations themselves , and live in Harmony with the Indians , plotting the Day when they may make a great Rebellion and have their own Nation . There I might survive  --  but in the Colonies I 'm sworn to prove myself a Freed Man on Pain of being sold into Slavery again . And how can I prove such ? I 'm wanted by a Master in Barbadoes and by another in Bath ! " " But Lancelot speaks of settling perhaps in Massachusetts , perhaps in the Hudson Valley of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true Democracy and take all Fugitives who come , whether Indentur 'd Servants , Debtors , Blacks , or Indians . " " They keep Slaves in the Colony of New York , too , my Friend . Why , since the last Slave Insurrection , the whole Metropolis of New York is so inflam 'd with Fear that no Black Man may walk upon the Streets at Night ! Bah  --  Lancelot claims to be a Christian Saint , but he knows not how ' t is with me  --  I wear my Destiny upon my Skin ! And there 's the Diff'rence betwixt him and me ! " I lookt at Horatio solemnly , knowing his Fate as akin to my own . Only when I walkt the World en Homme was I safe from Rape ; a Woman 's Fate was not much diff'rent from a Black 's . I could wear Breeches and Peruke , but how could he disguise his very Skin ? " Then shall you not sail with Lancelot ? " I askt . " Truly , Fanny , I am torn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I love the Merry Band  --  like my own Family . But where can I be safe but with the Pyrates or the Fugitives ? E'en so , I must defend my Freedom Day by Day . It doth not drop from Heaven as the Rain . " " May Lancelot not lead the Pyrate Life ? " said I. " Sure , on the Sea , you 're free . " " So I 've proposed , " said Horatio , " but he is daft to build this Eden of his , this Sacred Deocracy ' he calls it , upon God 's Soil . He longs to found this Second Eden , this New Jerusalem , this Prig 's Utopia ! He doth not know that Eden is nought but an Oasis in the midst of Hell and that Hell threatens to encroach upon it by the Hour ! E'en the Eden of the Bible was surrounded by Hades  --  andp259the Serpent penetrated soon enough . I'faith , Eden is like nought so much as a Maidenhead  --  a passing Fancy , the most temporary of Conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the Great Bard , Virgil  --  by which he means : Alas for Goodness , alas for Old-World Honour ! ' But there 's the Rub , for e'en in the Old World , Honour did not exist , and ne'er was Goodness so invincible that Evil could not penetrate her Heart  --  or shall I say  --  looking at my beauteous Fanny  --  her Divine Pudendum , her Sacred Slit , her God-like Gash ! " " Blasphemy ! " cries Bacon . " Is it Blasphemy to honour the most God-like Eden we know upon this Earth ? I mean the Female Garden , the Bow'r of Earthly Bliss ! " asks Horatio . " And perhaps heavenly as well , " says Puck . " For all we know , Heaven itself is nought but a Great Cunnicle on High ! " And here he bow 'd his Head as if in Pray'r . " Deliver me soon , 0 Lord , " says he , winking at me . " Come , you Rogues , " I say , " stop your infernal Jesting and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Fannikins , my Sweet , " Horatio declares , " you are our only Hope of making him see Reason . If you will pledge to join us and essay to convince him to found his bloody Eden aboard a Pyrate Ship , instead of the bloody New England Soil , I 'll risque my Freedomand come , too . But if you stay behind , I shall not sail with Lancelot ! There 's the Long and the Short of it . " " And what convinces you I have such Pow'r with Lancelot ? " I askt . I was trembling now , for I knew I must make my Mind up and be quick about it . " Fannikins , my Love , " says Horatio , " can you not know that Lancelot adores you ? He struggles in his Heart betwixt the Love of Men and the Love of you , but sure he loves Men with nought but Lust , yet you have all his Heart . " " Is this true , Francis ? " I askt . " Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heads solemnly . " ' T is true as the Gospels , Madam Fanny , " said Francis . " ' T is true as my Lust for you , and also Horatio 's , " said Puck . I paus 'd awhile in Thought , as the intent Faces of the Merry Men studied my own . What would I do ? ' T was now September and I was three Months gone with Child . An Atlantick Crossing might take two Months in mild Weather , but if we waited till the Winter was upon us ' t would be perilous indeed and longer still . And yet if I departed now with Lancelot , I would ne'er see Bellars again . O how my Heart was sunder 'd by that Thought ! Yet my Longing for Bellars was nought but Lust  --  and was Lust a worthy enoughp260Emotion on which to build one 's Destiny ? Certainly not ! Lust but toppl 'd the House that Friendship built ; Lust but sunder 'd the worthiest Alliances . Let Bellars seek me in vain at the next Costume Ridotto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Virgins of the Sun , the Popes and Pantaloons , the Devils and the Jesters , the May-Day Sweeps and the Corsican Brigands . Let him whisper in the Ear of ev'ry Nun he sees , and find me not at all . ' T would pay him back for all his Villainies to me ! And to the Whole of the Fair Sex as well ! " Very well , then , " said I , " I 'll join our Robin Hood and sail the Seas . " " Bravo ! " cried Horatio . " Praise the Lord ! " said Puck . " Thank Heavens , " said Francis Bacon with a deep-fetch 'd Sigh . " But how doth Lancelot plan to make this Great Rebellion a Reality ? " I askt . " For I am sure that there is Peril in his Plan . " " Peril indeed is Lancelot 's Meat , " says Puck , " but he hath contriv 'd to win the Fealty of certain of the Guards , and he hath brib 'd the Turnkey with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his Cause , he can convert to the Great Cause of Cash ! At this very Moment , i'faith , he has a Following of Debtors and Felons so great that they can easily o'erpow'r the Guards . Verily , the Debtors love Lancelot for preaching that there is no such Thing as Debt . They would follow him to the Ends of the Earth ! " " Or Seas , " says Horatio . " But fear not , Madam Fanny , " says Bacon , " for you need not join us at Newgate in the midst of the Rebellion . Littlehat will send a Coach to carry you to our Ship , an ' there you 'll wait for Lancelot an ' the Men . " " When shall we sail ? " I askt . " That hath not been decided yet , nor indeed have we determin 'd whether we shall sail from Southampton or the Isle of Wight , " says Horatio , " but soon you shall know all . You must be ready daily to depart and wait for Word from Littlehat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea ? " " Praise God ! Are you with Child ? " askt Bacon . " Did Lancelot not tell you ? " I askt . " Lancelot is so daft with Plans for his glorious Rebellion that he hardly remembers to eat a Bite of Food or sleep a Wink at Night , " Horatio declar 'd . " But this is shocking News . Who , pray , is the Father ? I wish ' t were myself . " " And so I wish , too , good Horatio , " said I. " For I was seduced by my own Step-Father before I met the Merry Men and this isp261the Issue of it . I ran away , ne'er dreaming I might be with Child and only when I was a Captive in Coxtart 's House did I discover it . " " And you are sure ' t was your Step-Father ? " Horatio askt . " It could be no other . I was a Virgin until he seduced me . " " And there were no other Swains ? " Horatio askt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night at the Inn with Tunewell , and my Sapphick Scenes with Coxtart . But no ; such am'rous play could not bear Human Fruit . Bellars was the only Man to pierce my Virginity before I learnt I was Enceinte . " No others , " said I. " By the Time I began my Brothel Life , I knew I was with Child . " " Praise God , " says Puck , " Lancelot shall deliver it himself , for he is train 'd in all the Healing Arts . " " And I doubt not but he shall put some religious Interpretation to it as well . A Virgin Birth , i'faith ! " says Horatio , mockingly . " Another young Disciple for his Deocracy ! Ye Gads , your Child shall be a very Proving Ground for all his Theories ! " " So I fear , " said I , " but a Child could have a worse God-Father than Lancelot ! " " I'faith , your Son shall have all the Merry Men as God-Fathers ! " said Horatio warmly . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what if ' t is a Daughter ? " I then askt . " Is she still blest ? " Horatio , Puck , and Francis lookt at me quizzically as if the Birth of a Daughter were more miraculous and impossible than the Birth of a new Jesus . " It can not be a Daughter , " said Horatio . " Certainly not , " said Puck . " Impossible , " said Francis . " And why impossible ? " said I. " Because if ' t is a Daughter , how can we call him Lancelot the Second ? " " Indeed , " said I , smiling mischievously ( in part at their MasculineVanity and in part with the sheer Pleasure of being back amidst the Merry Men again ) , " now I understand your Logick. "  |p262Containing  a most curious Exchange of Letters thro ' which our Fanny learns more concerning the Capriciousnessof Destiny than all her Adventures have taught her until now ; after which she is summon 'd by her one True Love , as the Reader of this most stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I had promis 'd , for Word from Littlehat , wond'ring when I should be summon 'd to join Lancelot 's great Sailing and feeling considerable Anxiety for Lancelot 's Fate and the Fate of his Historick Rebellion . Tho ' the Merry Men would scarce speak to me of it , ' t was clear enough that the Rebellion might misfire and Lancelot might swing once more at Tyburn . This Time , the cursed Beam could well dispatch his Soul with Speed , and ne'er again would Lancelot 's lovely Form and Face be seen upon this Globe ! In the Days that follow 'd my Meeting with Horatio , Puck , and Francis Bacon , I was nervous as a Cat , awaiting Letters . The other Girls went about their Business , ne'er noticing my Condition , but Kate , with an Enemy 's Attentiveness to all my Griefs ( as well as Envy of my Joys ) watch 'd me most closely . She perceiv 'd that I waited for the Post as if ' t were for an Annunciation from an Angel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came for me . Many Letters came , i'faith , but all from Bellars , not Littlehat nor Lancelot . Indeed , Bellars sent me sev'ral Letters each Day  --  one more pitiful and pleading than the next . It took all my Courage to ignore ' em since they touch 'd me to the Core . But Kate , for her part , still had not been summon 'd by her mysterious Tradesman , so she conceiv 'd a Fear that I would leave the Brothel before her ( tho ' , in truth , I 'd been there so little Time compar 'd to her ) and this Apprehension made her most grievously envious . Oft ' she herself would snatch a Letter from Coxtart 's Hands , and carry it up the Stair , then wait at the Door slyly , hoping Ip263would open it in her Presence . I ne'er did so , but her Slyness caus 'd me Grief . I worried lest she steal the fateful Letter and I miss Lancelot 's Sailing . But no ; she was too much a Coward to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Door than take Fate into her own Hands . Tho ' harden 'd by Life in the Brothel , still she was a cowardly Enemy  --  more inclin 'd to hope for Ill-Fortune to claim me , than to be the Author of my Ill-Fortune herself . " Another Billet Doux , Fanny , " says she , handing me a Letter with Lord Bellars ' Seal . " What a curious Post-Boy you are , Kate , " says I. " Pray , have you nothing better to do with your Time than deliver my Letters ? " " ' T is the least Service I can perform for me dearest Friend , " says she , mockingly ; whereupon she gives me the Letter and flounces away . I lockt the Door of my Chamber and sat down upon the Bed to read : Adorable Creature , Pledged as I am to await the next Costume Ridotto at The King 's Theatre , ne'ertheless , my Passion for you bids me nourish the perhaps Vain Hope that you will hear my Plea and grant me an Audience sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break , and I can no more contain it than Nature can contain a Flood once the Waters have begun to rise . Pray send to me presently that I may call upon you , and you will assuage the Torment that afflicts the Heart of your most devoted , Bellars . I took this pathetick Missive to the Escritoire ( which , by the by , already contain 'd a Box full of similarly pleading Missives ) and forthwith penn 'd my Answer . My Lord , My Word is unbreakable , nor can I be mov 'd by Entreaties , howe'er honey 'd . If your Lordship continues to plead with me to break my Word , I shall have no Choyce but to put our next Meetingstill farther into the Future . Do not tempt me to such stern Expedients . Yours , " Sister " Hackabout-Jones . I laugh 'd a little to myself as I penn 'd this harsh Epistle , thinkinghow far I had come since that Day at Lymeworth when I read Lord Bellars ' Letter to his Mistress and wept . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : namely , Sternness . What I had sought to win by Kindness , Trust , and Innocent Love  --  his Heart , in short  --  I should win instead by Disdain . Ah Cruel Irony !  |p264Bellars  despis 'd Love that was freely given , but grew mad as a rabid Dog for Love denied , niggardly Love , Love that was not e'en Love but only Coquetry . He was the Living Proof of the Maxims of La Rochefoucauld , who said , upon one Occasion , that ' t was harder to be faithful to a Woman when all went well than when she was unkind . As long as I remain 'd unkind I should secure Bellars ' Heart , for ' t was the Chase itself he favour 'd and not the Companionship of a Loving Heart . But damn him ! By the Time the next Costume Ball came due , I should be at Sea with Lancelot , and Bellars should sigh in vain for his moist-thigh 'd Spanish Nun ! How consistent with his low Character that he should interpret my forbidding Missive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next Letter to arrive from Bellars contain 'd a gold Bracelet emblazon'dwith Diamonds and a Plea to allow him to be my Keeper under any Terms I might propose : Queen of my Heart , The Unkindness of your last Missive hath lacerated my Heart to its very beating Centre . Know that I enclose this small Memento as but a Token of my fiery Passion for you , and also as but a modest Harbinger of the Riches that may be yours , if you will agree to let me care for you as befits your Splendour in the Arts of Love . Cupid himself will look down and smile to see you ensconced in the fine House I will build for you in St. James ' , and Venus herself will laugh and sing to see the Jewels I will heap about your delicious Neck , entwine ' round your delicate Wrists , and slide upon your slender Fingers . A Life of Luxury and Ease awaits you , if you will but relent in your Cruelty to your most anguish 'd and tormented , Bellars . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , Do you think that because I have been driven , like manyanother impoverish 'd Lass , to make my Living as a sometime Whore , that I am totally insensible to the Pleasures of Freedom and wouldso readily abandon ' em for Jewels and fine Houses ? Your Lordship'sJewels , I perceive as nought but Manacles ; your Lordship 's fineHouse as nought but a Prison ; and your Lordship 's Words of Loveas nought but Treachery . You mistake me , My Lord , for anothersort of Woman if you think I may be as easily brib 'd as a WhigMinister ! I return your Jewels herewith with my strictest Warningnot to further try the Patience of your most insulted and outraged , " Sister " Hackabout-Jones . O this indeed was Capital Sport ! Was I becoming as corrupt as Lord Bellars from the Pleasure I took in this Game ? Had I lostp265my Innocence entirely ? Had I forgotten the Wisdom of the Grandmasterof the Coven , who herself confirm 'd that Vengeance belong 'd to the Goddess alone ? But the Delights of this Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing . Indeed , I lookt forward to seeing the Letter Bellars would send when he saw his Bauble return 'd . His Answer came upon the Morrow , and sure enough , nosy Kate fetch 'd it for me . ' T was a larger Packet upon this Occasion  --  a Fact which was duly noted by Kate , who sneer 'd and said : " Methinksme Fanny hath an Admirer . " " What gives you that Idea ? " I askt , taking the Packet and swiftly locking the Door to my Chamber . The Letter was wrapp 'd about a small mahogany Casket , lin 'd in red Velvet and fill 'd with loose Jewels which sparkl 'd with all the Colours of the Rainbow . I gasp 'd to see such an Array of Rubies , Emeralds , Diamonds , and other Gems , for not only were they costly beyond Reckoning , but , loose in the Hand , they seem 'd like Gifts from Faery Land , not from the World of Mortals . These would I have dearly lov 'd to keep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Beloved Creature , Keeper of my Heart , Most Honoured Madam , I am contrite . My whole Heart contracts into a shiv'ring Ball for fear I have offended you . Heaven Forbid that I should misconstrueyour Honour and your Purity and lead you to believe I value you as nought but a Common Strumpet . Perhaps the Bracelet that I sent was too ornate for the Purity and Simplicity of your Tastes and therefore offended you . For that , I ask a thousand Pardons ! Please accept these modest Jewels as a small Token of my Grief o'er having insulted you . If you will be good enough to visit my Jeweller , Mr. Crickle , in the Royal Exchange , he will set these Stones for you in whatsoe'er Manner you choose and bill them to the Account of your most devoted , contrite , and humble , Bellars . P.S. I will no longer press you , but will count the Minutes until we meet at The King 's Theatre . Adieu . I hope my Heart will not break into a thousand Pieces e'er then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taste in Bracelets  --  theFool ! I ran to the Escritoire and wrote : My Lord , ' T is not your Lordship 's Taste in Jewels that is wanting , but rather your Lordship 's lack of Delicacy in understanding the Heartsp266of Women . I would rather accept six Pomegranate Seeds from the King of Hell and risque Imprisonment for half the Year than accept these Jewels , for they are nought but Bribes to relinquish all I hold most dear in this World  --  namely , my Liberty . My Heart is not to be so lightly won . Riches alone ne'er sway 'd my Soul to Love . Think on your past Behaviour and purify your Heart . Then perhaps I shall learn to love one who has so little Esteem for the Souls of the Fair Sex . I return your Lordship 's Jewels herewith . Yrs. , " Sister " Hackabout-Jones . Ye Gads ! I thought , sealing the Packet , perhaps I 've gone too far this Time and I will ne'er hear from Bellars again . But I was much too taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gambler , my Fever grew as the Stakes rose higher , and Danger of Loss kindl 'd Passions that Safety and Security ne'er knew ! Perhaps Bellars was a Gambler , too , for upon the following Day I receiv 'd this surprizing Missive : Empress of my Heart , I have search 'd my Soul to understand the Import of your last Letter , and , after much Anguish and Consternation , have determin 'd that you must , in some wise , be alluding to the Entanglements I have nurtur 'd lo these last five Years , with a certain well-known Lady of the Town . Know then , that immediately upon Receipt of your Letter of Yesterday , I terminated all Entanglements with this Lady and gave her to understand that I could not see her e'er again . Before we meet at The King 's Theatre , I will study to purify my Heart so that I may , by the Grace of God , be worthy of your rare and divine Love . What a Fool I was to dream that a Heart as pure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will essay to present you with the Jewel of my Fidelity to you and you alone . Most Respectfully , Your Contrite , Bellars . Now this was cunning Vengeance indeed ! The Lady with whom Bellars had broken my Heart had now been cast out by him ! Had Revenge been my whole Intent , I could have ne'er contriv 'd such sweet Vengeance ! ' T was only when I idly toy 'd with Fate , instead of fretting and anguishing o'er it , that Fate dropp 'd all her most glitt'ring Jewels in my Lap . Was Destiny no more than a Game in which Merit was seldom rewarded and Vice was punish'dp267capriciously , if at all ? Was the Great Goddess a Merry Prankster rather than a Dispenser of Solemn Justice ? So it seem 'd ! What a Lesson this was ! Ne'er had I truly seen Life as a Game of Chance before . 0 I long 'd for a Friend with whom to share this Wisdom . I wisht for someone I could trust with this curious Tale ! ' T was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand all this , tho ' Joan might not . Dear Isobel , I thought , Peace be with your Soul . But Isobel and the Witches were gone , and the Wenches at the Brothel were none of ' em true enough Friends to tell . But where was Littlehat 's Letter ? I grew impatient awaiting his Call . This Game with Bellars was diverting for the nonce , but I had seen enough of his Contradictory Character by now to fix my Heart in its Resolve to flee with Lancelot . Bellars was passionate in Pursuit , yet I doubted not that he should grow bor 'd and jaded once he had me in his Keeping . And I was bitterly aware that ' t was not me myself he lov 'd , but merely a mysterious Maskt Lady who had teaz 'd him mercilessly in the Hell-Fire Caves . Should he discover me to be nought but his simple innocent Step-Child , all his ardent Adoration would blow away like Clouds o'er the Sea upon a windy Day . No , I could not risque putting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must choose Friendship instead and sail with Lancelot ! Upon this , my Mind was firmly fixt . At last , after what seem 'd an interminable Wait , I receiv 'd the long'd-for Letter . Kate , my avid Post-Girl , carried it upstairs , but upon this Occasion , I was so eager to read it that I tore the Paper open without bothering to lock the Chamber Door . I read with trembling Hand as she lurkt in the Corner watching ( with the avid Eyes of Envy ) my own eager Orbs flicker o'er the Page . My Beloved Fanny , I risque this Missive only upon the Assurance of Littlehat that you will not fail to burn it as soon as you have committed its Contents to Memory . All is in Readiness here for the Embarkation for Eden . I have secur 'd  --  I can not tell you how  --  a two-masted Brig , the Hazard , which is anchor 'd off the Isle of Wight . She 's a fine Ship , about 30 Ton , square-rigg 'd on the Foremast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Staysails . She 'll sail with as little as a Crew of Twelve , as well as Captain , Mate , Cook , and Carpenter . The Captain is myself , Horatio the Mate , whilst the other Crew may easily be supplied from amongst our worthy Followers here . I shall send Littlehat to fetch you upon horseback on the Morrow to carry you to our Rallying Ground , which I can not yetp268disclose . Take as few Possessions as you can , but do not fail to bring any Valuables which may easily be barter 'd , and dress en Homme , as you were when first we met . Fear not but you will be as well car 'd for as if you were our own Daughter , Sister , Mother , Wife . My Heart is heavy as a Hangman 's Noose about the Throat of an innocent Man when I consider how I us 'd you at the Start of our Acquaintance ; but having search 'd my Soul I know that you and you alone are the Woman who can share my curious Destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some for the Appeasement of their jaded Lusts . For mine own part , I have turn 'd to beauteous Boys because ne'er before did I meet a Woman whose Wit and Learning could challenge my own Understanding and cause me to reach for Truths unguess 'd before . I fear 'd you not only for your Beauty , but also for your Wit , for I was wholly unaccustom 'd to finding Wit so enclos 'd in such a beauteous Form ; and the Presence of two such rare Qualities in one Woman fill 'd me with Dread of the Unknown . Most Men fear Learning and Wit in Women , for they suppose that all a Woman 's Wit will be put to the Service of ensnaring them and making them Slaves for Life . But I have found in you another Quality more rare than e'en your Beauty or your Understanding , namely your Sweetness and Loyalty  --  Traits said not to exist in Womankind . Ne'er have I seen you stoop to Coquetry e'en when Coquetry had serv 'd you better than your own Native Honesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and require your Wisdom and Wit , as well as your Companionship and Chear , in establishing my great new Nation of Free Souls . In it , Women shall have no less Authority than Men , and Blacks shall equal Whites , for we are all nought but Souls in the Sight of God , and Souls have neither Sex nor Colour . Truly , we shall build a New Jerusalem , a Second Eden , far from the Fears that trouble this hellish Isle , where Liberty is nought but a Word and Men are imprison 'd merely for seeking to survive rather than perish of Hunger . Come with me and I shall prove to you not only that I can show you most enduring Love , but that we can build a World where neither Sex nor Poverty nor Colour may be a Bar to perfect Happiness and Liberty ! My Heart flies to you until I may but clasp you to my Breast fore'er more ! Yr . Most Devoted , R. Hood . I gasp 'd to read this Letter , which represented the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been to fix my Heart upon Lancelot 's Lofty Friendship rather than Bellars '  |p269Scurvy  Lust ! Here was Love conjoin 'd with High Ideals , Love which did not seek to bribe with Jewels nor play the gaudy Games of Coquetry , but Love which sought to join two Souls in pure Service to the Great Goal of Liberty ! How could I burn such a Letter upon the Instant ? I must read and re-read it until I knew its Contents by Heart ! And so I tuckt it in my Bosom , promising myself that I should burn it ere long  --  but only after I had savour 'd its stirring Text , not merely one more Time but sev'ral . So engross 'd was I in the Letter that I quite forgot the Presence of Kate , who still stood in the Corner , surveying me with her envious Eyes . " That must be quite some Letter , Fanny me Girl , " says she , bringing me back to my Senses with a Jolt . " Kate , you take too much Notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " say I. " ' T is me own Affair an ' Coxtart 's , too , if ye mean to fly the Coop , Fanny . D'ye catch me Drift ? " " And what of your own sweet Man , Kate ? Will he not make an Honest Woman of you as he promis 'd ? " " An ' that 's none o ' yer Business neither , I reckon , " says Kate , turning bright red . Suddenly I know I have done ill to touch this sore Nerve , so I quickly seek to make amends , to soothe rather than pique mine Enemy . " Kate , can I help you somehow to flee this Place ? For I will plight my Troth to you in Friendship and help you all I can .... " " An ' who needs yer bloody Help , ye Baggage ! Me Man will come fer me . I need no poxt Strumpet to befriend me ! " Whereupon she hastens to leave the Chamber . " Kate , " I call after her , " there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Time to Time . " But Kate only turn 'd ' round to sneer , then clatter 'd down the Stair . 0 she was one of those who mistake Friendship for Pity and can accept no Help for fear of seeming Weak . Her Frailties , more than my own , I fear 'd , might be my Downfall . For ' t is oft ' the Case , in this imperfect World , that the Strong are fell 'd by the Weak , that the Robust are brought low by the Envy of the Frail ; and many a mighty Fortress , which Cannon could not tumble , hath been undone by the tiniest of Termites , doing their steady , destructive Work unseen ! I fear 'd Kate 's Enmity now as much as I had formerly fear 'd Lord Bellars ' Satanick Lust ( and the corresponding Lust it rais 'd inp270me ) . But I could not long dwell upon Kate and her Jealousies , for I must now make Preparations for Littlehat 's Arrival ; and then I must lock the Door to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letter until I had burnt its fateful Contents into my Heart.  |p271Containing  an Incident of a more tragick than comedick Kind , the Import of which may not be Reveal 'd for many Years , but which nonetheless alters our Heroine 's Destiny most profoundly . UPON THE MORROW I awoke with all in Readiness for my Departure with Littlehat . My Clothes were laid out upon a Chair , my few Valuables stuff 'd in my Pockets ; my Hat , my Riding Wig , my Boots  --  all were prepar 'd . I bolted out of Bed and ran to the Window . ' T was a grey and rainy Day in London , near as cold in September as it might be at Christmastime , an autumn London Day that chills one to the very Marrow of one 's Bones . I stood watching the Rain make Rivers of Garbage in the Street below  --  Rivers which carried all Manner of Offal from Orange Peels to Human Excrement , from drown 'd Kittens to Shards of broken Glass . Since knowing myself with Child , my Feelings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , so that whene'er I saw a drown 'd Kitten , or a starv 'd Dog , my Heart seem 'd to lurch in my Chest , and my Eyes wept with Pity for all the Animals in this World . ' T was thus with an aching Heart that I watch 'd the Gutter-Spouts drench the unwaryPedestrians who ran along , hugging the Wall , or , if they were jostl 'd away from it , cov'ring their Heads as best they could with their Cloaks , for in those Days no Man would use an oil 'd Umbrella for Fear of being thought Mollyish . Sooner be drench 'd than that ! What a miserable Day to make our Escape upon horseback ! But surely with a Plan this great , mere Weather would not foil it . I reach 'd into my Bosom again to extract Lancelot 's Letter and read it just once more ( for I had slept with it safe in my Shift )  --  but lo ! the Letter was gone ! Panick then reign 'd in my Breast . I ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' neath the Quilts , e'en ' neath the Mattress , butp272there was no Trace of the Letter . I had fallen asleep with it still about my Person and the Door to my Chamber lockt , but now ' t was lost ! What Villain had snatch 'd it ? And what Use might be made of it to detain or betray my Lancelot ? 0 I had underestimated Kate 's Evil ! I had thought her too cowardly to act against me , but ' t was clear I had been wrong . Why had I not burnt the Letter at once as Lancelot directed ? Would my Longing to keep a mere Love Letter deprive me of the Love of Lancelot himself ? 0 Cruel Irony ! I reach 'd for the Key to my Chamber Door ( which hung , these Days , on a Chain about my Neck ) , but , to my Astonishment , the Key , too , had vanish 'd and the Door was securely lockt from the other side . I struggl 'd with it , half in Disbelief , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senses in this Predicament . Could I be held Prisoner upon this Fateful Day ? I pounded my Fists against the Door in Fury and Rage , but I doubted that anyone should come to my Rescue . The Deed had been too well done for it to be undone now by mere Pounding . I ran to the Windows facing upon the Street . I could escape thro ' the Windows if not thro ' the Door , but the Windows were  --  I now remember 'd  --  painted shut ! Many Times had I told myself to have ' em scrap 'd , but always procrastinated , and now all my Effortsto force ' em open avail 'd nought ! Come , Fanny , thought I , how should you let mere Prison Walls detain you when now your Mind is fixt upon your Destiny with Lancelot ? Whereupon I held myself in check and I sat down upon the Bed to think . Be still , I counsel 'd my beating Heart . Be Serene , I counsel 'd my disorder 'd Mind . Panick ne'er broke down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my Thoughts came all in a Rush ! I thought of Lancelot 's Brig , anchor 'd off the Isle of Wight , riding the Seas , Flags flying , waiting to take me to my Destiny . I thought of the Witches ' Prophecy  --  " Your Daughter will fly across the Seas "  --  which seem 'd to portend my Escape now , despite all Odds . I thought of Bellars ' Jewels and Promises , of the tragick Deaths of Isobel and Joan , and finally of Horatio 's utter Faith that I and I alone might convince Lancelot to shun the Colonies where poor Horatio should always be in Peril as a Runaway . What dire Opinion would Horatio have of me , if I fail 'd to appear as I had promis 'd ? And would Lancelot believe I had rejectedhis Love ? Why had I fail 'd to burn the Letter ? Was there a Worm in my Heart gnawing away with Lust for Bellars ? Was there yet a Part of me that could not sail across the Seas withoutp273setting Eyes upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Honour , betwixt fiery Lust and fond Friendship ? Or was I merely still too innocent of Evil and had I taken too little Care to guard against Kate 's Envy ? These were the furious Thoughts that battl 'd in my Brain as I sat upon my Bed , wond'ring when Littlehat should come to fetch me and how I should communicate to him my Imprisonment , my Love for Lancelot , my Willingness to flee with him and keep my Word to all the Merry Men ? I rose and dress 'd myself in Man 's Attire , refusing to believe that I should not find some Way out of this foul , unfair Gaol . But , once dress 'd , I could do nought but gaze at the Raindrops chasing each other down the Window Panes and wonder when my good Friend Littlehat should come . ' T was deathly still and quiet in the House . I heard no Sounds of Coxtart or the other Wenches stirring . ' T was strange ; ' t was very strange indeed . Where might they have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impound me without Hope , for I doubted not but she was the Culprit , the Author of this hellish Plan , the Serpent in this rotten Garden of Evil . I struggl 'd again with the Window , but ' t would not budge an Inch . I ran to the Bell Pull and yankt upon it with both Hands , but lo ! it came loose as I did so ! The entire Chamber had been prepar'dto thwart my Plans ! 0 Villainy ! 0 misplaced Innocence ! I press 'd my Nose to the Rain-streakt Glass , determining that I should position myself there and wait for Littlehat to appear , then make such Noises that he could not fail to hear me , despite the Din of Traffick in the Rain-soakt Street . Whilst waiting , I should find a Means to open the Window , I vow 'd to myself . And so I station 'd myself there , in Readiness for my Journey , whilst the Rain pour 'd down and the Pedestrians , Chairs , Carts , and Coaches in the Street below sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very Echo of my Distress . How long I waited I can not say . Time lost all Meaning as I struggl 'd with the Window , then stopp 'd to rest , then struggl 'd and stopp 'd again . I watch 'd the Pedestrians below with a Wary Eye . Whene'er I saw a short , fat Man or one with a black Beard , my Heart seem 'd to cease beating in my Breast . ' T was very like a mad Infatuation ; I long 'd for Littlehat 's squat Form and comical Face as if he , not Lancelot , had been my Lover ! The Rain grew heavier , then abated a little , then grew heavier once again . The Damp penetrated my Chamber , where no Fire burnt in the Grate upon this chill and miserable Day . I rubb 'd myp274Hands together with the Cold . I press 'd my cold Nose to the Panes . Many Times I began to weep for my Plight , but held myself in check with the stern Admonition that losing Hope was the greatest Defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith in my eventual Salvation , then Salvation should somehow come to me . At last , I saw a short , squat Figure in a green Surtout hurry along the Street , leading a fine Ebony Arabian Mare . The GnomelikeFigure walkt with lower 'd Head , and , his Hat being uncockt , I could not see his Features ; but from his Gait and Manner , I was certain ' t was Littlehat . Then the Rebellion had been a Success ! For if Littlehat had left the Confines of the Prison Walls , perhaps ' t was safe to assume that Lancelot and the others had done so , too . At this very Moment , they were doubtless speeding towards our RallyingGround . My Heart leapt in my Bosom with Joy and I wanted to shout " Hail Littlehat ! Hail Lancelot ! Hail Horatio ! " For the nonce , I near forgot I was a Prisoner myself . Now Littlehat approach 'd the Door to Coxtart 's House , lookingbehind him , to ascertain whether he was being follow 'd . Now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gate . Now he stepp 'd back again , waiting ; and now a female Figure in a Cloak came out to speak with him . She must have been waiting there all along , for she walkt with him into the Street , instead of calling him within . 0 Treachery !  --  ' t was Kate ! At first , both were turn 'd with their Backs towards me , but then they slowly turn 'd ' round . Now I could see Littlehat 's Face . As he glanced up at the House , I beat with furious Fists upon the Window , but , alas , he could neither hear nor see me . Now Kate whisper 'd something in his Ear , and now suddenly he wore a troubl 'd Mien , his Moustache seem 'd to droop , his Mouth quiver 'd as if he should begin to cry . Quickly , I ran to the Bed , tore off the Linens , and began knotting ' em together in the Hope of making a sort of Ladder for my Escape . Why had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Window where I could see Littlehat was just now sadly walking away . With a Burst of Fury at Kate , and profoundest Anguish o'er Littlehat 's Melancholick Tears , I smasht my Fist thro ' the Window , breaking one Pane , but also cutting my Wrist so severely that it bled the brightest , reddest Blood . " Littlehat ! Littlehat ! " I shouted , but he could not hear me . With my left Hand , I smasht another Window Pane , calling to him and screaming all the while  --  tho ' to no avail , and still the Opening in the Window was too small for me to crawl thro ' . O I was in a Rage of Tears and Madness ! Paying no Attention to the spurting Blood , nor to the Pain in my Hands , I smasht at thep275Window with both Fists whilst calling to Littlehat , who , e'en now , was moving farther and farther away . I ran to the Bedstand and found a brass Candlestick , and with this I batter 'd at the Window Panes until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more difficult Task of breaking the wood Frames so as to make an Opening for myself . But how to secure the Sheet so that I would not fall and dispatch myself to Heaven forthwith ? I had not reckon 'd with this Problem . Should I forget the Sheet , crawl out upon the Window Ledge , and hope that Littlehatwould heed me then ? ' T was a long Fall to the Ground , yet if I could slide a little Way upon the Sheet , I might jump the Resttho ' a Fall from here might indeed be fatal . Just then I spy 'd a Hoisting Hook , a good two Feet above the outer Window Frame . If I could climb out upon the wet Window Ledge and afix my linen Rope to this , I might lower myself a bit and be within close enough Reach of the Street to leap the Rest of the Way . Carefully , praying to the Goddess above , I stepp 'd out onto the slippery Ledge . With my bleeding Hand I grasp 'd the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look down ) whilst with my good Hand I sought to attach the Linen to the Hook . ' T was a Job that requir 'd two Hands , but the Ledge was slick as Glass and I dar 'd not let go . Still , what was Death compar'dwith losing Lancelot ? I let go my Hold upon the Frame , and carefully reach 'd up and ty 'd the utmost Corner of the Bed-Linen to the Hook . Then , begging the Goddess that the Hook should bear my Weight , I grasp 'd the linen Ladder with both Hands and slid down it to Liberty ! 0 the Rope held for the nonce , yet ' t was far too short , and I had a long Way left to jump . But what other Choyce had I , dangling so precariously in Air ? I took my Courage in my Mouth and leapt . Whereupon I fell upon the Street , trying to roll to break my Fall  --  but coming down , alas , so heavily upon one Foot that I bruis 'd it horribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving at all . Ne'ertheless , I soon scrambl 'd to my Feet and began to limp in the Direction Littlehat had gone . I dragg 'd myself along thro ' sheer Will and Stubbornness , for my Hand was bleeding more than e'er before and my Foot had now begun to swell within my Boot , making the Pain nearly unendurable . How I endued it , stumbling headlong in the Rain , I can not say . I only know that I thought of Lancelot waiting , and of Horatio 's Distress when he should find himself betray 'd , and of the Sadness of my Friend Littlehat , which had been so clear upon his loving Face . I must have been in true Delirium by then , for I rememberp276nought but shouting " Littlehat ! Littlehat ! " just before I stumbl 'd in a Mud Hole and chanced to hit my Head against a Post . What next transpir 'd I also do not know , since I was dumber to the World than that Post upon which I 'd dasht my Brains . I dreamt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Isle of Wight , and I was dress 'd all in a Pyrate 's Garb , with multicolour 'd patchwork velvet Breeches , a velvet Coat and Waistcoat , and a gorgeous gleaming Cutlass , which I wielded ' gainst the Foe as ably as any Man . I climb 'd the Rigging like an expert Sailor , then I stood in the Crow's-Nest , high above the Water , watching the Seas glitter with Jewels of Sunlight whilst the Men upon the Deck below appear'dfor all the World like Children 's Mannikins made of Lead . Now Lancelot was beside me , kissing me upon the Face and Neck and thanking me for having Faith in him and promising that it should not be long before we found safe Haven for our new Jerusalem . In the Dream , all was Peace , Joy , and Tranquillity . My Heart was flooded with Sunshine and I knew that all would be well with me thereafter . ' T was one of those Dreams we have when our Fortunes reach their lowest Ebb , and we wish to reassure ourselvesthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do our Dreams create ! For when I awaken 'd , ' t was in my familiar Bed in Coxtart 's House , with Coxtart'sawful Face , not Lancelot 's lovely one , watching o'er me , and my whole World seem 'd suddenly black as Hell . I wept and whimper 'd in Coxtart 's Arms . Ne'er did any Wench have such a strange Nurse , such a curious Mother ! " Come now , Fanny mine , " says she . " Why weep when ye have charm 'd a fine Admirer ? Why , Lord Bellars himself hath call 'd here a dozen Times if he hath call 'd here once  --  and just in these three Days ! My Word , you 've hardly cause to weep when a Gentleman of Lord Bellars ' Rank hath been so daft with Worry o'er yer own fine Self ! " " Lancelot ! Lancelot ! " I cried amidst Gales of Tears . " Pray , who is Lancelot ? Is my Lord Bellars ' Christian Name Lancelot ? I doubt it , for I have heard he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer Pet Name for him abed ! " O I wept bitter Tears both at Coxtart 's Misunderstanding of my Plight , and the dread News that three whole Days had pass 'd , and here it was too late to reach the Isle of Wight ! . " Fanny , " Coxtart says , " I owe ye a great Debt of Gratitude for all yer valiant Efforts to arrest Kate 's Escape . For the Baggage hath elop 'd , and I doubt not but all yer Struggles with the Windowp277were nought but the most valiant Essays to stop the Wench . For truly she hath deceiv 'd us all . She spirited away the other Girls with the News of a great Auction in the Royal Exchange , which prov 'd a Lye . And when I return 'd from Market , I found the Baggagegone  --  with all my Plate as well !  --  and you bleeding in the Street where you had fallen in yer Loyalty to me ! 0 there was a Young Fellow who came here enquiring after you upon that Night of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough Country Squire who clairn 'd to be the Heir to a Great Estate . I would have sent him packing , but Kate insisted she herself would entertainhim  --  the Strumpet  --  and I reckon ' t is with him she hath elop 'd ! But fear not , we 'll see the Strumpet hang 'd , I warrant . 0 what Satisfaction ' twill be to hear the Snap of her foolish Neck and see her swing at Tyburn . " I only moan 'd and wail 'd for Lancelot and did not answer , but in my Mind many Visions rose and fell . Could it be Daniel who had come in search of me , and had he then been set upon by Kate ? Impossible , I thought ; Coxtart must be mad . Kate had doubtless stolen the Silver and then fled , or perhaps her mysterious Tradesmanhad come for her at last . Still , what did I care for Kate 's Affairs , with Lancelot gone ! Oblivious of my Distress , Coxtart chatter 'd on : " And mark my Words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath known since the Royal Entry of King George . Why , a Rebellion hath taken place in Newgate Prison and well o'er twenty Rogues and forty Debtors o'erpower 'd the Guards and made away on horseback . ' T was said they had Confederates without the Prison Walls who brought ' em Horses on which to escape  --  Stolen Horses , I 'll warrant  --  and the whole Town hath talkt of nothing else lo these three Days past ! " This News brought me suddenly to my Senses . " And what became of the Mutineers ? " I askt , my Voice hoarse with not having spoken a Word except to rave in three whole Days . " See here , " says Coxtart , " I 've The Daily Courant somewhere about . " And she lookt for it upon the Escritoire  --  but finding it not , she said : " No , no  --  ' t is not here , but I 'll fetch it from the Parlour . " Whereupon she hasten 'd towards the Door . " Pray , Mother Coxtart , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bones ? Will I be lame fore'er more ? " " I fear 'd that , too , " says she , " for my beloved , dearest Fanny , but ' t was nothing more than a twisted Ankle , tho ' yer Leg swell 'd so , we had to cut the Boot off . Clever Girl to pursue that Strumpet ,  |p278Kate  , in Man 's Disguise  --  but have no Fear , we 'll see her swing yet . Sure , Fanny , had ye not hit yer Head and knockt yer Brains to Heaven , that Ankle would have stopp 'd ye  --  not to mention all the Blood ye lost from yer Wrist . Why , had ye wisht to suicide , ye could have done no better ! Now then , I 'll fetch yer Tea and The Daily Courant . I 'll warrant there 'll be Love Letters as well from yer Fine Admirer .... " Coxtart bustl 'd out the Door , full of counterfeit Love for me now that she saw still more Profits to be made off Lord Bellars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anguish . I remember'dmy Dream of Peace and Happiness and how I had awaken 'd from it to this Nightmare . I curst my Fate which had orphan 'd me fore'er more . Would I always be an Outcast , wand'ring the World , seeking my own Native Tribe , and finding it briefly only to be cast out again ? I moan 'd more with the Ache in my Heart than with the Pains in my Foot and Wrist . 0 why was I not dead if not with Lancelot ? I wept until I soakt the Linens with my briny Tears . Coxtart soon return 'd , full of Chear and Bustle , placed a Tray before me set with Dishes of Tea and all Manner of Muffins , Buns , warm Breads , Butter , and Cheese . " Come now , Fanny , dry yer Eyes . Lord Bellars will pay a Visit to ye anon , " whereupon the sly old Fox smil 'd like a Tom Cat that tortures a Canary . This News alarm 'd me . Now , more than e'er before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew I were his Step-Child , he would grow tired of me ere long . " Pray , Mother Coxtart , you must keep Lord Bellars away from here until I am recover 'd . I will not have him see me in this distress'dCondition . Why , Coquetry and Prudence alone dictate that he must ne'er see me in this Condition ! I have sent Word to him already to await the next Costume Ridotto at The King 's Theatre and I 'll ne'er see him ere then . Do you think I have gain 'd the passionate Loyalty of such a notorious Rake by letting him come to me at any Hour ? Nay , Mother Coxtart , he will pay better for my Services if he is forced to wait ! " " Clever Wench ! " says Coxtart , her Eyes glitt'ring with Greed . " Very well , then , I 'll keep the Wolf at bay . But mark ye  --  there are Letters here , " whereupon she hands me no less than four Letters with Lord Bellars ' Seal . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her Apron , sets it before me , and with many counterfeit Kisses and Fondlings ( which near cause me to be sick upon the Bed ) , she takes her Leave of me.  |p279I  put the Love Letters aside without the slightest Hesitation and turn hungrily to The Daily Courant before I e'en taste my Tea . There I read these stirring Words upon the Page : London , September 24 . We have receiv 'd Information of a major Tumult Yesterday at Newgate Prison . The Turnkey , perceiving the Prisoners going into a Riot , sent Guards for a File of Musqueteers to prevent it , and a Tumult arose , in which there were seven Men kill 'd and a like Number of Soldiers wounded , despite which Occurrence , well o'er Forty Prisoners escap 'd upon horseback , doubtless with the Aid of Confederates without the Walls . A Committee of Council hath been form 'd to look into this Disorder and the Warden hath been directed to take more effectual Care for the Future . So the Rebellion had not fail 'd ! Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst them ? And did they truly escape and reach the Isle of Wight ? Upon this the News-Sheet was anguishinglysilent . Was there no further Report , no News at all but this ? Alas , the Paper was far more prolix upon the Subjects of lost Dogs , erring Wives , and facial Washes . For in the self-same Sheet I also read : Lost September 24 , 1724 , betwixt St. James ' Sq . and the Old PalaceYard , a little Cross-shap 'd Dog , of the Lurcher kind , of a yellowbrownColour . ' T was taken up by an ill-lookt Fellow , a Notorious Dog-Stealer , and led by a blue String towards York Building . He answers to the Name of Bugg , and leaps o'er a Stick . Whoe'er brings him next door to the Great House in Dean 's Yard , shall have Two Shillings Reward . N.B. He will ne'er be worth a George to those who have him , his Marks being known . ' T was clear that lost Dogs merited a far more Precise Account than Prison Rebellions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Wife of Sir James Penny of York Place in the County of Surrey , Bart. , and Daughter of Samuel Snellgrove , late of Deptford in the County of Kent , Shipwright ) , aged 23 years , or thereabouts , hath elop 'd from her said Husband without any Cause , and endeavours to run him in Debt , by taking up Goods from Tradesmen and otherwise . The said Husband , with an honest Intent , that Tradesmen and others should not be impos 'd on : Doth hereby give Notice of the said Elopement , and that he will not pay any Debts she shall contract . This Notice is further to Forewarn all Persons not to trust her ; and to the End no Person may be impos 'd upon by her under any False Names in the Future , all Persons are inform 'd that she is a little Woman , light brown Hair , full grey Eyes , large Eyebrows , round Visage , pale Corn/plexion , with a small Moon-shap 'd Scar in the Middle of her Forehead , and hath a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hath e'er set a higher Value upon Dogs than upon Wives ! I doubted not but Eliza Penny had good cause to leave her " said Husband , " and in my Heart I wisht her God 's Speed . Likewise Lancelot , tho ' I knew not whether he was alive or dead . 0 curse the foolish News-Sheet which had more Space for Notices of Aids to Beauty than for Notices of Rebellions in Newgate Prison ! For now I glanced down the Page , where , in my Distress and Anguish , I allow 'd my Eye to linger o'er the trivial Notices of Beauty Aids , many of which I already had employ 'd : The famous Bavarian Red Liquor ; Which gives such a delightful blushing Colour to the Cheaks of those that are White or Pale , that it is not to be distinguish 'd from a natural fine Complexion , nor perceiv 'd to be artificial by the nearest Friend . Is nothing of Paint , or in the least hurtful , but good in many Cases to be taken inwardly . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to be rubb 'd off like Paint , therefore can not be discover 'd by the nearest Friend . It is certainly the best Beautifier in the World ; is sold only at Mr. Payn 's Toy-Shop , at The Angel and Crown in St. Paul 's Churchyard near Cheapside , at 3s. 6d. a Bottle , with Directions . Would I now , having lost Lancelot , and all my Dreams of Liberty , devote myself entirely to being a Painted Whore , and fill my Life , like so many Women , with these Trifles ? Then I had best read carefully , for this News-Sheet foretold my entire Destiny : The true Royal Chymical Wash-Ball for the beautifying of the Hands and Face , as it is from the first Author , without Mercury or anything prejudicial , largely experienced and highly recommended by all that use them , and that for making the Skin so delicately soft and smooth , as not to be parallel 'd by either Wash , Powder , or Cosmetick ; and it being indeed a real Beautifier of the Skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Morphew , Sunburn , Scurff , Pimples , Pits , or Redness of the Small Pox , keeping it of a lasting and extream Whiteness . It soon alters red or rough Hands and is admirable in shaving the Head , which not only gives an exquisite Sharpness to the Razor , but so comforts the Brain and Nerves , as to prevent catching Cold , and is of a grateful and pleasant Scent ; which has been sold above this twenty Years at the Corner of Pope's-Head Alley in Cornhill , over against the Royal Exchange , and is still continu 'd to be sold at the same Place byp281Mr . Lambert , Glove-Seller , and at Mrs. King 's Toy-Shop in Westminster Hall . Price one Shilling each , and Allowance by the dozen . Beware of Counterfeits which may prove very prejudicial . Beware , indeed , of Counterfeits ! Would a Bavarian Red Liquor cure a pallid aching Heart and make it robust and red again ? Would a Royal Chymical Wash-Ball cleanse Deformities from the Soul ? 0 the News-Sheet did not answer this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfume for Wigs ! The Royal Essence for the Hair of the Head and Perriwigs , being the most delicate and charming Perfume in Nature , and the greatest Preserver of Hair in the World , for it keeps that of Perriwigs ( a much longer Time than usual ) in the Curl , and fair Hair from fading or changing Colour , makes the Hair of the Head grow thick , strengthens and confirms its Roots , and effectually prevents it from falling off or splitting at the Ends , makes the Powder continue in all Hair longer than it possibly will , by the use of any other Thing ; by its incomparable Odour and Fragrancy it strengthens the Brain , revives the Spirits , quickens the Memory , and makes the Heart chearful , never raises the Vapours in Ladies , &; c. , being wholly free from ( and abundantly more delightful and pleasant than ) Musk , Civet , &; c. , ' t is indeed an unparallel 'd fine Scent for the Pocket , and perfumes Handkerchiefs , &; c. excellently . To be had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluecoat Boy by Pope's-Head Alley against The Royal Exchange , Cornhill , seal 'd up , at 2S. 6d. a Bottle with Directions . O Mr. Allcraft , sure I could use some of your Craft ! For ne'er did my Brain need so much strengthening , nor my Memory so much quickening , nor my Spirits so much reviving , nor my Heart so much chearing ! 0 I must go to Mr. Allcraft 's Toy-Shop presently ! I must have this Royal Essence to revive my Spirits ! I must cover my aching Heart with Paints and Patches , my aching Brain with perfum 'd Powder for a Wig , my sadden 'd Soul with Petticoats and Panniers , my sunder 'd Spirit with silver Lace or gold . Alas , Belinda , we read the News-Sheets for News of Life and Death , Survival of our Souls in Worlds to Come , Reunion with our Loves and Lovers  --  and we find nought but Notices for Toys and Toy-Shops , Beauty Aids and Scents ! The Printing-Press may have a certain Pow'r , but it doth nought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when we read the News for Comfort and Consolation  --  Cosmeticksare all we get ! My Tea was now cold as Ice , likewise my Breads and Muffins ; and , putting ' em all aside , I crumpl 'd the accursed News-Sheet intop282a Ball and fell to weeping again as if I must discharge the stor 'd Tears of an entire Lifetime . 0 that my briny Tears were the briny Sea and I were aboard the Hazard with Lancelot ! But ' t was not to be . The Fates had other Jests in Store.  |p283Containing  a most Edifying Comparison betwixt Life and a Masquerade , as well as our Heroine 's Meditations upon Maternity and the curious Bargain she struck with the Devil to ensure the safe Arrival upon this Earth of her unborn Babe . WHEN THE TIME CAME for the next Costume Ridotto at The King 's Theatre , I was near recover 'd of my Strength , tho ' the Condition of my Spirits was , to say the Truth , not much better than upon the Day I sought , all fruitlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a sort of fatal Resignation about the Loss of Lancelot , and I knew I must now apply myself to Thoughts of providing for my Babe , since before long , my Condition would begin to show ; there was not a Minute to spare . Already , I was beginning to notice a slight Thickening in my Waist . 0 ' t was nothing the World could see  --  especially when I wore my Corset drawn as tight as was the Fashion then  --  but ' t was a Warning to me . No longer could I tarry in Regret and Indecision ; I must determine how to make the best of my Destiny . Truly , I languish 'd with the Loss of Lancelot and the Merry Men , but I was quite distraught as well about my foolish Innocence in trusting Kate . For in the Days that pass 'd after her Elopement , I found that she had stolen various Articles from me  --  small Things in the main : a painted Fan , a Patch Box , a pair of red-heel 'd Slippers of green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Hat of Butter-colour 'd Straw with pale pink Ribbands . I curst myself for being so unwary of her  --  for had I taken better Care , I might now be aboard that dashing Brig , the Hazard , with my beloved Lancelot . But I had underestimated the twin Pow'rs of Envy and Hatred . Since Envy was not my Ruling Passion , I fail 'd to understand it , quite , in others . Sure , I had felt Stabs of Envy ( as any other Mortal Soul bath done ) , but always I seem 'd to know that all the divers Destinies ofp284Humankind have their own Pains as well as their own Pleasures , and e'en the Greatest Lord who suffers no pecuniary Want , may be tormented with the Gout , or Devastation at the Loss of Love , and feel his Suff'rings as keenly as the poor Gin-soakt Beggar . 0 Lancelotwas right : there was too little Equality betwixt the Debtor and the Lord , the Woman and the Man , the Black and the White . But truly ' t was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw these Inequities quite clearly , still I knew that ev'ry Station in Life had its own peculiar Miseries , and so I did not fancy that by changing Places with another Soul , I would be free of Pain . I had oft ' wisht to be born a Man ; ' t was clear as Crystal that a Man 's Lot was easier than a Woman 's . Yet I felt a certain grand Defiance , too , in having been born in Woman 's Form , and making my Way despite all the Impediments that Man had placed for me to stumble o'er ! But Kate was sour and scheming , evil and envious , hungry and heartsick . She fancied that by taking Things from me , she would improve her own Lot . Perhaps her Tradesman Lover had disappointedher after all , and she essay 'd to assuage her own Pain , by preventing me from going to my Love . For how was she to know that ' t was the Outlaw Lancelot whom I long 'd to see , whilst Bellars ' Jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , with a Babe to care for , and no Lancelot nor Merry Men , I could not now afford to spurn Lord Bellars ' tawdry Jewels . Instead , I must study Ways to compel Lord Bellars to pay his Debt to his own Child , and yet without revealing my true Face . ' T was a Dilemma , a Dilemma indeed . When the Day of the Costume Ball came ' round , I sent Coxtart to White 's Chocolate House to purchase my Ticket , and I directed her as well to procure me the most fetching Spanish Nun 's Attire that could be found in all of London . Truth to tell , the Brothel had as fine a Collection of Masquerade Costumes as any Dressmakeror Milliner in the Town . For , oft ' ' t was a Swain 's Desire to enjoy his Trollop in some curious Disguise which conjur 'd voluptuousFancies in his Brain . Consequently , the Costume I sought was to be found right in Coxtart 's Emporium  --  and a fetching one ' t was . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deliberate Modesty of Nuns ' Attire may conjure more lascivious Visions in the Brain than the sheerest Nakedness ! Coxtart assisted me in my Preparations , sent for a fine gilt Coach and Four , with liveried Attendants , for she dreamt that my Good Fortune thro ' Lord Bellars would also be hers , and she meant to prepare me well for these Revels . No mere Chair and Link Boy would convey me , but a golden Coach . What a Contrastp285'twas with that first Day when she had insisted that we share one Chair ! And so the golden Coach bore me to the King 's Theatre in the Haymarket , where I , a Nun , sought Satan ! But 0 I had scarce anticipated that there would be so many Satans ! For well-nigh ev'ry other Swain I saw fancied himself the very King of Hell ! Some wore Breeches of Flame-colour 'd Velvet , with Flame-colour 'd Tails ; and some were Black Devils , and some were radiant in white Satten as Milton 's Lucifer before he fell . Ne'er would I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had not I seen this Masquerade ! I mingl 'd in the Crowd amidst the Faery Queens and Quakers , the Dominoes and Dandies , the Harlequins and Columbines , the Chimney Sweeps and Scotsmen . There were curious Double-Masks , as well as single ones . A Lady who lookt Elizabethan from the Front , turn 'd around , and lo ! was quite the current Mode from the back . There was yet another Lady who seem 'd a Venetian Courtesan from the rear , and a Turkish Pasha from the front . The Courtesan had Hair of Titian red , which hung in long Ringlets , whilst the Pasha wore a Ruby Velvet Turban , encrusted with Jewels ; and indeed the whole Headdress was so cleverly arranged that the Folds of the Pasha 's Turban serv 'd also as the Venetian Lady 's Coronet ! As this Mask turn 'd from front to back , from back to front , it changed its Sex , its Nationality , its Rank , its all ! What a Lesson ' t was in Fortune 's Fickleness ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then Modern Belles ; Angels , then Devils ; Nuns , then Rakes ! The Wheel of Fortune spins , the Dice of Destiny are cast , and we do not choose our Costumes as for a Masquerade , but they are fitted for us by the Fates . No wonder those Ladies are seen as Sempstresses . They sew the Clothing of our Lives ; they outfit us as for a Grand Ridotto and then they set us whirling on the Floor to find our proper Partners  --  or our improperones ! I wander 'd in the Crowd in search of that Satan who of all Satans was my Special One . I pass 'd divers Parties of Friends , bedecktfor the Masquerade in specially-dress 'd Groups . There was an Indian Chief surrounded by his Squaws , another Turkish Pasha with his Harem , a Captain of the Guards with all his Men . Sev'ral Masks approach 'd me , bow 'd , and begg 'd a Dance with me ; but I demurr 'd , looking only for Lord Bellars , my Mind set upon my Task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intrigue and determin 'd upon Practicality for my Child 's Sake above all . At first , I thought I should ne'er find Lord Bellars again ; where/said : upon , in a trice , I felt a Tap upon my Shoulder , and a low Voice " Sister ? Sister Hackabout ? I seek nothing less than thy Body and thy Soul . " To which I replied , Voice low with Irony , and speaking quite as Quakerishly as he had spoken to me : " And didst thou not , thou wouldst not be my Satan . " " Capital ! " says he , taking my Hand . 0 this Biblical Speech piqued his Lust  --  especially as he was Satan and I a Nun ! Behind our Masks , we danced the Age-old Dance of Lovers ere they go to Bed . Whether we trod the Minuet or Rigadoon , or let fly our Feet in Jigs or Country Dances , each Step brought us closer to the inevitable Encounter betwixt the Bed-Clothes ; each sweet Note of Musick carried us closer to the Ev'ning 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine for thee , " Lord Bellars said , leading me in a stately Minuet . " Milord , I am no Man 's Plaything , " said I. " That much is clear , Sister . " We danced some Minutes longer ; then he said : " Alas , if neither Jewels nor Love Letters can move thee , what shall melt thy frigid Heart ? " " Sir , ' t is perfect Fealty I seek . " " And how , pray , shall that Fealty be prov 'd ? I have already forsworn an old Love for thee , Sister , and wouldst fain e'en marry thee , were I not so pledged already  --  what more of Love can I prove ? " I shudder 'd slightly at the Mention of Marriage , for at that Moment there danced into my melancholy Brain a Vision of Lady Bellars , my dear Step-Mother , amidst her Animals at Lymeworth ; but I made haste to banish it most sternly . How dare I talk of Fealty when I had betray 'd my own sweet Foster-Mother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sake , if not my own . Alas , is it e'er the Fate of Woman to excuse all human Betrayals for the Sake of that next Generation which we carry ' neath our Hearts ? Charged as we are with the awesome Task of keeping the Race alive , we Women give nothing less than the Gift of Life itself . Without us , no Coronations of German Kings , nor Whig Ministers doing their Briberies and Spyings . Without us , no Comedies , Tragedies , Epicks , nor Histories . Without us , no stern , bewigg 'd Physicians debating Diseases , no starry-eyed Astronomers debating Stars , no greedy Astrologers predicting Fates for Gold , no Soldiers marching , no Dancers dancing , no Singers singing out their Lungs , no Paintersp287painting out their Hearts , no Actors and Actresses making the Footmenhowl in the Pit . We are at the Root of all Society 's Triumphs and Disasters , at the Root of all Knowledge and all Ignorance , all Health and all Disease , all Art and all Nature  --  for without us , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether maskt or unmaskt , fall dead in their Places ne'er to stir again ! How , therefore , could I not excuse my own Treachery ' gainst Lady Bellars now that I bore this Child ' neath my Breast ? The Call of Life is stronger than the Call of Custom ; the Howl of an Infant drowns out the husht Voice of Piety and the low Murmur of filial Duty . Henceforth my Care must be for Belinda , above all ( tho ' , in truth , I neither knew her as Belinda yet , nor felt her as a Personage at all . She was only a Sense of Vulnerability about the Heart , a Desire to protect , at all costs , someone I scarce knew ) . " Sir , " said I to Lord Bellars , " thou mayst prove thy Love in a most curious Way  --  and yet I fear to tell thee how , for perchance thou wilt but laugh at me . " " Sister , that wouldst I ne'er do . For I am so far gone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terms thou mayst propose . " " Very well , then , listen to my Plan . " " I am all Ears , " says he , dancing quite as perfectly as any Dancing Master despite my Words . " I would be kept in a fine House with one loyal Servant to attend me .... " " Sister  --  that is simple , nothing could be simpler  --  " " Pray , Lord Bellars , hear me out .... " " I tremble on each Word , my sweetest Love .... " " Thou shalt come to me but once a Week and only on the Night I say .... " " But certainly , my Love  --  " " Hear me , Milord . . . . And always I shall be maskt from thee  --  until I say thou mayst unmask me , which , I warn you , I may ne'er say . " " 0 that is hard , my Love , yet can I swear to do thy Bidding e'en so . " " And thou shalt ne'er question me about my Past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor seek to spy on me in any Way . . . . But on that one Night each Week I shall do all for Love of thee and pleasure thee in ev'ry Way  --  save that I shall not unmask , howe'er thou begst . And if thou seekst to force me , or seekst to unmask me whilst I sleep , I swear I shall ne'er see thee again . "  | " My Love , I think I can submit myself to these hard Rules .. . for I have pin 'd for thee so during these Days past , that I would rather see thee once each Week than risque thy Wrath again . " " Art thou sure thou canst comply with these hard Rules ? For if I e'er discover that thou spyst on me in any Way , or tell any Member of thy Family or e'en of thine Acquaintance of mine Existence , I will surely banish thee again . " O what rough Words for such a soft-hearted Wench ! Ah , Fanny , thought I , you astonish e'en yourself ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Divine Light of Reason , and the Pow'r of the Supreme Being ; by Jove and Cupid , by Venus and Apollo ; by all that I hold dear and sacred ! " " Very well , then , " said I , " we have struck our Bargain . Now , shall we seal it with a Kiss ? " Lord Bellars took me in his Arms amidst the whirling Masks and kiss 'd my Lips and murmur 'd in my Ear . " I promise thee , I promise thee , I promise thee . And may the Great God above strike me quite dead if e'er I break my Word or Bond to thee . " Our Lips melted together in a Sweetness which banish 'd Visions of Lady Bellars , the Merry Men , e'en Lancelot . And as we kiss 'd , I had to ask myself if I was truly doing this for my unborn Child , or for my own wretched Longing and Lust which held me in their Thrall quite as surely as my Womb held the Stirrings of a Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer 'd up my Body and my Soul.  |p289How  our Heroine spent her Confinement ; a short Descriptionof her loyal Servant , Susannah ; some philosophicalMeditations upon the Phases of Childbirth , after which your Author enters into the Controversy ( which raged thro'out the Age ) betwixt Midwives and Accoucheurs , and thereafter gratefully ends the Chapter.  |p291LORD  BELLARS KEPT HIS WORD as faithfully as e'er he had sworn it . He found me a fine House in Hanover Square , plentifully brib 'd Coxtart for my Freedom , furnish 'd me with all the most splendid Plate , Porcelain , and Linens ; had my Walls decorated ( ere I could protest ) by some Monkey of an Italian Painter my good Friend Hogarth would have mockt ; had my Pier-Glasses carv 'd with gilt Eagles ' Heads and Garlands by James Moore and John Gumley ; my Bureaux and Tables veneer 'd in Walnut ; my walnut Chairs beautifully can 'd and gorgeously gilt ; and the Seats of my walnut Settees plushly upholster 'd in Emerald Green cut Genoa Velvet . My Cellar he kept fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manner of elegant Provisions . My Neck he hung with Jewels , my Pockets stuff 'd with Guineas . He paid my Dressmaker 's Bills , my Tea Merchant 's and Vintner 's Accountings almost ere they came due  --  and in return for all this Plenty , he askt only that I entertain him but one Night a Week , maskt from his prying Eyes both by Darkness and by the curious silken Masks I had design 'd expressly for the Purpose . They were finely workt in divers Colours to match my divers Clothes ; and some were embroider 'd with Silver , and some with Gold , and some were shap 'd like Butterflies and some like the Wings of Birds . 0 they gave my open , trusting Face a sinister Look ( which perhaps increas 'd its Allure  --  at least for a Rake like Lord Bellars ) . My Face could I disguise , yet I could not disguise my Belly from my Patient Lover ( for since he could not feast upon my Face ,  |p292he  must , at least , be allow 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plainly growing . My Breasts were growing , too , and my pink Nipples had turn 'd the Colour of sweet Chocolate . A pale , thin Ribband of amber Flesh ascended from my Mount of Venus to just below my Navel ; in short , ' t was plain I was with Child . But Lord Bellars , like most Men , was no canny Mathematician regarding the Natural Cycles of the Fair Sex ( and howe'er many Babes he may have begotten  --  both as Rake and Husband  --  the very Process still seem 'd as obscure to him as those curious Heavens of the Mahometans and Hebrews ) . Thus , when I swore upon a Pile of Bibles that the Babe was his , both his Ignorance of Female Things , and his native Masculine Vanity led him to grant me Credence ( with only the smallest Amount of Jesting about his Fears that perhaps some other Swain had got me with Child afore him ) . And yet , Belinda , as you know , the Child was indeed his ! ( And the Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lymeworth , not London ; at the Eden of my Childhood Home , not the Hades of the Hell-Fire Caves ! Nor would I have ly 'd to any Man concerning such a weighty Matter as his Paternity. 0 I might fiddle with the Months a bit ; all 's fair in Love and War . But the plain Fact remain 'd that he and he alone was " the only Begetter , " as our great Bard Shakespeare hath term 'd it . How , you may indeed wonder , did I entertain Lord Bellars for so many Months without his e'er guessing me to be his orphan 'd Fanny ? I can but reply that I took the most careful Precautions to have him come to me only by Candlelight ; to have him led upstairs to my Bedchamber by my faithful Servant only after blackest Nightfall , and rouz 'd again always before Daybreak and quickly led away . My Voice I attempted to Disguise e'en in Fits of Passion , but e'en had I fail 'd to do so , I believe that he would scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lymeworth and the experienced Whore who entertain 'd him in London . For most Men , as I have said , see Women either as Angels or Devils , Marys or Liliths , Virgins or Whores , Saints or Sinners . ' T is incomprehensible to them that the self-same Wench may be halfAngeland half-Devil , Innocence itself at first , and later the very Embodiment of Experience . We Women know that both Innocenceand Experience are fluctuating States , not Absolutes ; that they depend as much upon flickering Circumstances as upon fixt Morality ; that Virtue is , in fact , a Luxury of the Rich , whilst Sin is oft ' the only Means to Survival of the Poor ; but Men do not know thisp293unless they are Geniuses of Mr. Hogarth 's Rank  --  and Lord Bellars , I grant , was no Genius . Yet he was no Monster either ; he was no more than a Spoilt Rake whose Selfishness had always gone uncheckt . The Age had granted him Pleasures unabated , had indulged his ev'ry Whim  --  whether lustful or pecuniary ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moderation of his Passions . Married young to a timid Heiress who could not raise her Voice to him , school 'd in Scandal amidst Whores and Rakes , how could he practise that Humility which manifests itself in Kindness ? I fervently believe that the Rules I impos 'd upon his Impulsive Nature did his Soul more good , i'faith , than his whole willful , Pleasure-seeking Life before he found me in the Hell-Fire Caves ! My curious Rules of Secrecy also prevented Boredom  --  that greatest Enemy of Lovers  --  from blunting the Point of Passion . 0 had I lov 'd Lord Bellars in my own plain Face , he would have tired of me in two Months ' Time . But maskt , I could be all Things to him ; all Women : French Courtesan or Turkish Harem Slave , Venetian Lady or Provencal Peasant , Spanish Nun or English Trollop . Indeed , I kept him guessing Week by Week , and this piqued his Passion as a Cordial before Dinner piques the most jaded Appetite . Alas , ' t was true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Keeping , that Daniel and Kate were now join 'd in their evil Purposeslike a two-headed Dragon of Old . When Lord Bellars was not making love to me , he was sighing o'er his Son 's sad Fate : to wit , Daniel had fallen into the Scheming Hands of a Trollop from Mother Coxtart 's Brothel . " Unlike your own Sweet Self , " said Laurence Bellars , " this Wench is bent upon our Family 's Ruin , and will stop at nothing to disgrace my Son and bring him to his Knees . " 0 with what divided Mind I heard this Tale ! For tho ' I could admit to knowing Kate , I could not admit to knowing Daniel ; and tho ' I could verify Kate 's Evil , I could say nothing of what I knew of Daniel 's Character , lest I betray myself as the Fanny of the Past . But ' t was ironical that Kate should have snar 'd Daniel on the selfsameNight I met his Father in the Hell-Fire Caves ( for that I 'd glean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I askt Lord Bellars , " why is it wrong for your Son to have a Mistress when you yourself have one ? Doth he not follow in your Footsteps ? " Laurence Bellars laugh 'd most derisively . " If you knew myp294scurvy Son , you 'd ne'er say that ! " he burst out . " Compar 'd to this Kate , you are an Angel , and compar 'd to Daniel , I fear I am Virtue 's very Self . " I long 'd to enquire further what transpir 'd with Kate and Daniel  --  but I fear 'd I could not without giving myself away , and I fear 'd myself always on the Brink of Peril in any case . So I held my Tongue for your Sweet Sake , Belinda ( and for my own ) , and not until many Months had pass 'd was I to know the Issue of this other History , and so shall you before my Tale is done . In my Establishment in Hanover Square , I had a Servant nam 'd Susannah , a freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest Secrecy about my True Identity . She had a Gap betwixt her Teeth as large as her Gen'rous Heart and Skin the Colour of Coffee mixt with Clotted Cream . She was barely older than myself , but wise beyond her tender Years , and she swore she knew all about Newborn Babes ; indeed , ' t was why I hir 'd her . Moreo'er , she was my constant Companion during my Confinement , playing ev'ry Role from Friend to Mother Confessor to Physician . How did I pass those Months awaiting your Birth , my own Belinda ? Lord Bellars occupied but one single Night a Week , and I had , as well , dropp 'd from Sight of all the Brothel Swains . ( Nor did I wish to see ' em  --  e'en those who 'd been my Friends  --  for I was done with Whoredom and Good Riddance ! Whate'er the Glitter of it may seem to the foolish Wench who languishes of Boredom at some Country Seat and dreams of London Life , the true Facts of a Whore 's Existence are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Men for all Eternity ! ) 0 I was happy for my six-day Chastity ! I read the Classicks and all current Literature . I studied Homer , Virgil , Horace , Boileau , and La Rochefoucauld . And 0 my Belinda how I wrote ! With you in my Belly ' t was as if I had the very Muse inside me ! My Quill flew o'er the Pages as if propell 'd by Angels ' Wings , or , i'faith , as if Pegasus himself had seiz 'd it and gallop 'd away amidst the Stars ! I wrote Tragedies in Verse and Noble Epicks , Romances in the French Style and Maxims modell 'd upon La Rochefoucauld 's . I wrote Satyres and Sonnets , Odes and Pastorals , Eclogues and Epistles . But nothing satisfied my most exalted Standards ( which had been bred upon the Classicks ) , and at length I committed all my Efforts to the Fire . I wrote and burnt and wrote and burnt ! I would pen a Pastoral thro'out three sleepless Nights only to commit it to the Flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ev'ry budding Poet , I discover 'd , must spend a thousand Words forp295ev'ry one he saves , and Words are hardly wasted if , thro ' one 's Profligacy with ' em , one learns true Wit and true Expression of it . Lord Bellars no doubt wonder 'd how I spent his Money , but the Truth was that most of my Guineas went for Books and Foolscap , Quills and Inkstands  --  all the humble Tools of the Writer 's Trade . The Smell of Ink pleas 'd me more than that of the costliest Perfumes ; the Touch of fine Paper thrill 'd my Fingertips more than the thinnest India Silk . I was besotted with my Craft and all its Tools ; I vow 'd to write and write until perchance I wrote one Poem worth preserving . ' T is said by some that bearing Babes is all a Woman 's Fire and Inspiration ; that as her Womb fills , her Head empties ; that the Act of Bearing substitutes for all Acts of the Imagination . But I swear that ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my Head teem 'd as well with Fancies . As my Belly grew , so did the Children of my Brain ! The Bearing of a Babe puts a Woman thro ' as many Metamorphosesof Mood as the pale Moon hath Phases ; and in each of these Phases I wrote  --  tho ' to say the Truth , I ne'er wrote of Womanhood or bearing Babes . No , I wrote of Imaginary Kingdoms , Grecian Shepherds , Roman Warriors , and Persian Pashas . Who , I wonder 'd , would wish to know of bearing Babes ? Why , no one ! Did Mr. Alexander Pope write of bearing Babes ? Did Dean Swift ? Or Mr. Addison , or Mr. Steele ? Did Boileau or La Rochefoucauld ? Did Virgil or Horace ? Nay , nay a thousand Times nay ! Why then the very Act must be neither a fitting nor correct Subject for my Quill ; for if Mr. Pope found it not correct , and if Mr. Addison found it not correct , how should it be Literature at all ? I observ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but wrote of ' em not , in order that I might spend my Ink upon more fitting Lit'ry subjects ) . At that Time of my Life , I ne'er question 'd the Justness of such Judgement . Forgotten was my Great Epick upon Woman 's Lot , begun at that Coaching Inn , The Dumb Bell , and abandon 'd to the Siren Song of Lust ! Yet now I ask : what could be more curious and strange than the Cycle of Child-bearing , the Phases of Pregnancy ? There is , for instance , the First Phase , when one wishes to quite undo the Babe , because one feels its Presence as an Invasion at one 's very Centre ; then the Second , when one feels the first delicate Stirrings of Life within ( as if the Tail of a tiny Mermaid had brusht against one 's Heart and all one 's Inner Being were a gentle Sea with small Waves lapping ) ; then the Third , when the Child grows bigger and ' t is very like a Puppy wiggling , tickling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows the Size of a great Melon and causes one to make Water four Times an Hour , and indeed wakes up just when one lyes down to sleep , and falls to sleep just when one walks or rides or goes abroad ; then the Fifth Phase , when the Child becomes a true Burden , heavier under the Heart than Lead and yet , for all its cumbrous Weight , more lov 'd as well ( for now it seems real rather than fanciful to the Mother and so she can better bear the Discomfort of its Heaviness ) ; and then the Sixth Phase , when the Mother begins to grow immobile , fearful of Death in Childbed , ( with Nights full of Dreams of Monsters , and Days full of Dreams of Childbirth Horrors ) ; then the Seventh , when the Pregnancy grows long as the longest Day of Summer and the Mother forgets she hath e'er been slender of Form or will e'er be again , and ev'ry Step is an Effort not to make Water by Chance in the Street , and ev'ry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn as she will this way and that , the Child can not be accommodated whilst it kicks her Lungs and butts its bony Head against her Bowels ) ; and then the Eighth Phase , the Phase of Immense Impatienceand Weariness , when she believes the Child will ne'er be born ( and she is glad , for then she may not dye but only endure Pregnancy for all Eternity ! ) ; and then the Ninth Phase , when the Moon is full as a Bladder of pale Wine , and the Sea glows with its rotund Reflection and the Mother fears Death more than e'er before ; and then , at last , the Tenth Phase , when the Waters break and the Pains begin , slowly at first , and then tumultuous ; and she knows she has no Choyce now , but must give birth or burst ; for she can not turn back , can not take another Road thro ' the Forest , another Canal to the Sea , and she , like her Babe , is pusht headlong into the Dance of Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and whether she shall live or dye she does not know , but the Pain grows so terrible at the Last that , i'faith , she does not e'en care ! 0 what a curious Cycle of Life the Goddess hath devis 'd for the Race to perpetuate its Kind ! Many of the Agonies fall upon the Female of the Species , yet also many of the Joys . Who but a Woman can speak of pressing her Cheak to the tender pink Cheak of her own Child and her Breasts running with Milk at its very Touch , squirting fine Streams heavenward like the sprinkl 'd Stars of the Milky Way ? Who but a Woman knows the joy of Feasting her Eyes upon Eyes that can not focus , of clasping tiny Fingers that can only grasp without knowing what they touch , of kissing tiny Toes that can not walk and know not whither they shall go or whence they have come ? 0 no Matter how lackingp297in Reason the Newborn Babe seems to the Masculine Philosopher , ' t is Reason itself to its Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a Woman could love a Creature that cries all Night when she would sleep , who wakes up ravenous to eat only when a Plate is set before its Mother and she would eat , who partakes of no Polite Conversation but only pushes its Tongue in and out of its Mouth like a very stupid Puppy , and drools and pukes and shits all the livelong Day and Night ! How , indeed , bath our Race surviv 'd but thro ' the Love of Women for their Newborn Babes ? Common it may be , and yet ' t is also nothing less than a Miracle ! For despite the Times when one would toss the Babe into a Dustbin to stop its Crying , the Passion to protect , preserve , and shelter is so much stronger than the Passion to destroy , that truly , most Babes have nothing to fear from their Mothers ! I fervently believe that if a Man had known as much Pain from a Creature as a Mother knows with the Birth of her Child , he would hate it e'erlastingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Sex that we bear the Pain with no enduring Grudge and if we begrudge any Creature , ' t is not the Child , but the Man who got the Child ( because of the Injustice of our Lot : the greater Weight of Responsibility we bear , yet the lesser Credit which the World accords us for it ! ) . But I race ahead with my History . Shortly , I will tell of my Lying-in and of the curious Things that came to pass as you , my Belinda , enter 'd this World of much Woe and occasional Joy . Yet first , I must tell more of my Servant , Susannah , who shar 'd this curious Time with me ; for next to Lord Bellars and my Goose Quills and Foolscap , she was my most inseparable and beloved Friend during these amazing Months . Susannah , I have said , was light brown of Skin , gap-tooth 'd , gen'rous-hearted , garrulous . She spoke the Argot of the Islands , but which of the Sugar Isles she came from was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a Shipwreck in her fourth Year which washt her to Shore , a tiny Coffee-colour 'd Girl , quite near the chalky Cliffs of Dover . She had been sold into an English Family , she recall 'd , as a Playmate for their only Daughter ; but when the entire Family perish 'd at Sea , she alone was sav 'd upon a floating Spar , weeping piteously for her Black Mama in the Islands , and having just watch 'd her little White Mistress perish in the briny Deep . Her Fate , thereafter , was harsher and more hackt-about than mine . She was befriended first by a Fine Gentleman who , ' twasp298later prov 'd , lusted after little Girls ( and who , when she was but five Years of Age , practis 'd his perverse Diversions of the Flesh upon her ) . Running away from him at length , she was apprenticed to a Quaker Sempstress of cruel Temper ( who us 'd her as a sort of human Pin Cushion and curst the Colour of her Skin as the Devil 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time to London , where she join 'd a Pack of Street Urchins who stole Watches and all Mannerof golden Baubles for the notorious Mr. Jonathan Wild ; but seeing one of her small Friends hang 'd at Tyburn ( tho ' the Lass was but ten Years of Age ) , she quit the Life of Crime , dress 'd as a Boy , and took up Chimney-sweeping . When she came to me , her Lungs , I fear , were still as black as Coal , and oft ' she would give herself o'er to Fits of coughing which made me fear for her very Soul . And yet I hir 'd her as my most intimate Companion , for something in her Manner made me quite love her at first Sight . She was kindly without being obsequious , willing to please without seeming slavish , and she saw the Humour in her Fate as well as the undeserv 'd Woe . She also swore her Quaker Mistress had entrusted her with Newborn Babes ; thus I dar 'd to hope that she would be a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd for near six Months together : Susannah , me , my growing Belly , my Quills and Foolscap , my Epicks ( which were written for the Flames ) , and Lord Bellars coming but on Wednesday Nights . Much of that Time , I blush to say , I spent in fear of my Lyingin . I say I blush , because , of all the foolish Fears of Humankind , Fear of the Future is by far the most foolish . We can not control the Future by fearing it , howe'er much we may believe we do so . Anticipation and Worry are , in fact , quite as useless to affect our Fates as a Fortune Teller 's Predictions ; but , alas , that doth not prevent our Indulgence in ' em . Being a bookish sort , I fill 'd some of my fearful Hours with reading Books upon Midwifery , which recounted the Terrors of Childbirth . In particular , I must mention Van Deventer 's The Art of Midwifery Improv 'd , with its terrifying Pictures of poor Infants attempting to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also the French Doctor Mauriceau 's learned Book concerning Diseases of Women with Child and in Childbirth as translated by the notorious Dr. Hugh Chamberlen . These two Books alone were enough to excite all my Fears ; for not only did they speak of Women whose Bones were too small to accommodatep299their Infants ' Passage , but also of Extracting Hooks and other terrifying Devices ; of Mothers who offer 'd up their Bodies to be split asunder upon the Altar of Childbirth ; of Labours lasting Days long ; of learned Accoucheurs who knew no better Physick than to sacrifice the Mother 's Life to the Child 's ; and of Midwives who , despairing of both the Mother 's Life and the Child 's , were directed to baptise the Child in Utero , lest its Infant Soul go straight to Hell if it dy 'd unbaptis'd. 0 I quite terrified myself with reading Books ! Meanwhile , an Argument raged betwixt Lord Bellars and Susannah , my loyal Servant , regarding who should attend my Lying-in . Lord Bellars , for his part , maintain 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern Times , attended by Women-Midwives ; but that e'en the Royal Mistresses of France call 'd forth male Midwives , or Accoucheurs , to deliver ' em . Susannahfor her part declar 'd that more Women were kill 'd by the Ignoranceof Men attempting to deliver ' em than by the very Plague itself ; that male Physicians , for the Sake of Modesty , deliver 'd witha Sheet ty 'd about their Necks and their Hands groping blindly ' neath it so as not to see the Lady 's Privy Parts ; and that e'en were there no Sheet at all , Man 's Ignorance of Women 's Privities was so great as to render the male Physician entirely unfit for the Noble Task of assisting the Fair Sex in Labour . Imagine then , Belinda , your own dear Mother , maskt in embroider'dSilk with her swollen Belly beginning quite to loom beneath her Smock , listening by flickering Candlelight , to the diff'ring Arguments of her two would-be Protectors .

LORD B. Sweet Susannah , trust my Love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stay within your own Province of Kitchen and Chamber ... . S. I would bid ye , Sirrah , to stay within yer own Province o ' Gamin ' Tables an ' Race Meetin 's , an ' not meddle with the Mysteries o ' Midwifery an ' Childbed that are better done by Women ! LORD B. Out  --  impertinent Wench ! Or I 'll box thine impertinent Ears ! S. I go , Sirrah , yet not all the Threats in Hell can banish my Solicitude fer me Mistress . Whereupon Susannah makes a Curtsey ( which seems to me more impudent than polite ) and leaves the Bedchamber , thus ending the first Scene in our Comedy . What were my own Sentiments regarding this Dispute ? 0 I was in the gravest of Quandaries . Lord Bellars swore he sought the best Care for me , and what could be better than the Care receiv 'd by Queens and Royal Mistresses ? Yet I also remember 'd my Friends , the Witches , part of whose Teaching was that Women were better Practitioners of Physick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gain and Profit ) . 0 the List of Queens who had dy 'd in Childbed was long indeed  --  aswas the List of Royal Mistresses , and , i'faith , Royal Infants . Not one of Queen Anne 's Children liv 'd to claim his rightful Throne ; and how many other Noble Ladies had dy 'd under the Hands of Generations of Chamberlens , or other Quacks ( whilst the Physician , for his Pains , receiv 'd a hundred Guineas and the Lady receiv 'd nought but a Shroud ! ) . Thro'out my Confinement I wonder 'd and worried whom to call when the Waters broke and my Child began his laborious Journey into this Planet of Pain . Susannah said she knew of a Midwifeof exceptional Reputation , lately come to London , whilst Lord Bellars insisted upon Dr. Smellie , whose very Name , i'faith , seem 'd so comical to me that I should surely commence laughing the Momenthe came to attend me . As a budding Poet and Playwright , I had indeed noticed that the Names of real People were oft ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personae . Which Brazen Grub Street Writer , i'faith , would dare to name a Man-Midwife , or Accoucheur , Dr. Smellie ? Why ' t is a Name from a Comedy by Mr. Fielding  --  a Name quite on the Order of the Princess Huncamunca , or the Queen Dollallolla , or those Maids of Honour , Cleora and Mustacha , in love with those Courtiers , Noodle and Doodle ! Be that as it may , I could not decide , thro'out all the six remainingMonths of my Confinement , whether to have Susannah fetch the Midwife of whom she spoke , or whether to accede to Lord Bellars ' Wish that I be deliver 'd by the great Dr. Smellie . Lord Bellars ' Masculine Pride , coupl 'd with my foolish Wish to have the most modern Physick known , finally prevail 'd upon me to accept Dr. Smellie  --  tho ' Susannah 's Opposition continu 'd unabatedto the End . Alas ! I should have listen 'd to that Wench !  |p303Containing  better Reasons than any which have yet appear 'd for the happy Delivery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Introduction of the newest Character in our Historio-Comical Epick , who , tho ' small , proves more Trouble to her Author in her Entrance upon the Scene than any Personage of more prodigious Size . ' T WAS THE MONTH OF MARCH and the Sun was in Aries when my Confinement came to its grateful End . It had rain 'd in London for well-nigh three Weeks and the Skies were as heavy as my Great Belly . 0 my Face seem 'd young and fresh thro'out my Confinement , as if , indeed , I had discover 'd the Fountain of Youth , but at the End of my Pregnancy I was as Melon-bellied as a Woman with Twins ( and , i'faith , I fear 'd I might give birth to two instead of one ! ) . Still , I 'd heard no Word from Lancelot or the Merry Men in six long Months and knew not whether they were alive or dead . I wonder 'd e'en whether I had not dreamt ' em all  --  so remote did my Travels with ' em seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a Time when I was without my Great Belly  --  for it seem 'd as much a Part of me as my red Hair or my brown Eyes . My Belly was so large , i'faith , that ' t was almost impossible for me to fulfill my weekly Obligations to Lord Bellars  --  for I could scarce clasp him ' round the Waist , much less allow him to lye with me in any but the most bestial of Postures , and e'en that one grew unwieldy in Time . Ne'ertheless , he was by then so thoroughly in Love with me , that I swear he came to me as much for Love of my Soul as of my Body , since he scarce complain 'd of this Disability. 0 the Ways of Destiny are strange , indeed ; for I had , by dint of my Stratagems of Masks and Disguises , my Limitations of our Trysts to but once a Week , almost reform 'd his selfish Nature . Lord Bellars also seem 'd to look forward to the Birth of this Childp304as he had ne'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Daughter . This Child he saw as a Love Child , begotten more in Passion than in Duty and therefore he lov 'd it e'en in the Womb and was , indeed , more wary of hurting it than I was myself . How tenderly he touch 'd me as we drew nearer the Close of my Confinement ! A Man might walk upon a Carpet of Hens ' Eggs with greater Force ! He strok 'd my Body  --  particularly my Belly  --  as if ' t were some infinitely delicate Thing , containing all the Seeds of his Past and Future . For my own part , I found that my Lust for Lord Bellarsindeedfor any Man whatsoe'er  --  decreas 'd as my Lying-in approach 'd . The Child within made me wholly self-sufficient , as if I were both Earth and Sky , both Sea and Land , and less and less did I require any sort of physical Union with the former Begetter of all my most lustful Passions . No , on the Contrary , I wisht nothing more than to lye abed Mornings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to sit at my Writing Bureau penning Metaphors which I would then commit to the Flames , or , by Ev'ning to sit before the Grate with Susannah , watching the Flames leap in their constantly changing Patterns , reminding me of the mysterious Dance of Destiny , the Vanity of Human Wishes , and the Difficulty of knowing the Meaning of Life or the Great Purpose for which the Goddess placed us all here upon the Earth . Bearing a Child made me , i'faith , more philosophical than e'er before ( and I was always of a philosophical Bent ) ; for what can be more mysterious and strange than to be one Person for all one 's Life and then suddenly become two ! To be doubl 'd , then halv 'd ; to be one , then two , then one again ! ' T is the Destiny of but one-half of the Human Species , and the Possibility of explaining it to the other half is remote indeed . Alas , we can scarce explain it to ourselves ! And yet I believe , tho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we Women are truly blest in this Capacity of Child-bearing . Perilous it may be ( just how perilous you will see anon ) and yet it tempers the Spirit e'en as it does the Body . ' T is very like walking thro ' a Wall of Flame , which few survive , but those who do , are stronger for it their whole Lives long . ' T was the third Week in March when , the Heavens having been open and streaming most of the Month , my own Waters broke and you , my Belinda , began your Storrn-toss 'd Voyage into the World . I shall ne'er forget that I was reading a Romance by Mrs. Haywood ( Idalia , perhaps , or The Fatal Secret ) and thinking to myself that I could do as well and perhaps should try my Hand at one ,  |p305when  I discover 'd that my Smock was wet beneath me , as indeed was the Seat of my Chair , and this I believ 'd was the tell-tale Sign of the Beginning of Travail . Quickly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at whose London Apartments the Great Accoucheur , Dr. Smellie , was to be arriving that very Day . After dispatching Susannah , and whilst waiting for my Pains to become strong and regular , I remember that , quite unaccountably , I sat down at my Writing Bureau and then and there began a Romance in the Manner of Mrs. Haywood . I was fill 'd with such Energy and creative Fire that it seem 'd I could compleat an entire Book that very Ev'ning , so I took Quills and Foolscap in Hand and began , in a Frenzy , to write . Dimly , I recollected that Women at the Start of Travail are said to be seiz 'd with great Vigour , that some compleat entire Tapestries , and others sew Christening Gowns , with intricate Embroideries , whilst others are seiz 'd with a Passion to sweep Floors , clean Grates , bake dozens of Pyes , and roast Legs o ' Mutton ! But the Vigour is at best a passing Fancy , o'erwhelm 'd quite soon by the Pains of Travail ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Star-cross 'd Lovers  --  Clotilda and Philidoreandpenn 'd an appropriately obsequious Epistle Dedicatory ( with Blanks for the Name of whiche'er Noble Lord should be most worth my Flatteries when the Romance was done ) , than the Pains of Travail became strong indeed , and I dropp 'd my Quill to the Paper ( where the Inkblot oddly form 'd the Profile of a curious Horn 'd Creature ) and I held my Belly and pray 'd to the Goddess above for my own Life and the Life of my Child . Then , ' t was all I could do to walk to my Bed , lye upon it in my Smock , breathe as calmly as I could to bear the Pains , and await the Return of Susannah. 0 the Pains were bearable at first , but in an Hour or so they grew stronger . My entire Belly would rise in a tight Knot , causing me to grit my Teeth , to blank out the World by shutting my Eyes , and to enter , as if I were a Traveller to a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot my very Surroundings , tho ' , indeed , the Walls of my Chamber were cover 'd with painted Clouds , painted Cherubim , and painted Goddesses reclining upon rosy Clouds , and I would attempt to stare at ' em to distract myself from my Distress . ' T was impossible ; I was driven inward by the Tumult taking place inside me , and ' t was all I could do to keep myself from moaning , much less to concentrate upon the painted Cherubim , that were a Man 's Idea of Paradise.  |p306Time  lost all Meaning as I dwelt in the e'er briefer and briefer Spaces betwixt the Pains . Thus when Dr. Smellie came to attend me , I was in no great Condition to observe his Form and Figure with a Poet 's Eye . And yet I recollect his great unwieldy Hands  --  more like a Farrier 's than a Midwife 's  --  and more for holding Horses ' Hooves than the tender Skulls of Babes . He had put off his Peruke and capp 'd his Head with a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver Ribbands . Likewise , he wore a great loose Gown of flower 'd Calico in which he lookt a sort of curious Pasha , his Eyes blazing in his Head and his wide Mouth set in a determin 'd Posture . He sent Susannah for hot Water , clean Sheets , a fresh Shift for me ; then he began to question me as to the Onset of my Travail . " Sir , " said I , betwixt the pains , " ' t was about Eight o ' the Clock when the Pains began  --  but I know not what Time it might be now . " " This Babe will be born ere Midnight if I have my Way , " said he , pressing upon my swelling Belly ( causing me still greater Grief ) . " Pray what Time is it now ? " I askt , nearly breathless from the great Waves that engulf 'd me . " Why , half past Nine , Lass . " My Heart leapt in my Bosom to believe that this great Accoucheurpossess 'd Magick that might so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like a Shield against my Woe ) , I vow 'd I would endure any Terrors the Goddess might send . 0 I still wore my Magick Garter for Occasions such as this ; and tho ' ' t was fray 'd and tatter 'd , I dar 'd to hope that ' t would shield me from all Harm . Lord Bellars , I was told , waited without my Chamber for the happy Conclusion of my Lying-in . Susannah brought hot Water and Sheets as she was bid . She ty 'd one of these ' round the Neck of Dr. Smellie , stretching its nether Ends o'er me , so that my Privy Parts were duly cover 'd ( as Modesty requir 'd ) , whereupon the Great Doctor bade me spread my Legs , and with his enormous Hands he prob 'd the Inmost Centre of my Being , causing me more than once to catch my Breath and almost wail with Pain . Yet I did not . I bit my Lips ; I held my Breath ; I shut my Eyes until num'rous salty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wail would I not , howsoe'er the Pain demanded it . I'faith , I felt a sort of Pride in being a Warrior Woman , a Mythick Amazonof Old , and thus enduring the Distress without a Cry . Dr. Smellie withdrew his Hands , with the Verdict that my Womb was opening quickly and ' t would be no Time at all before the Babe emerged , whereupon he strode from my Chamber to re/port to Lord Bellars in the Ante-Chamber , leaving me alone with Susannah. 0 we could hear ' em talking and laughing without , as if the Birth of a Babe were no more to ' em than an Ev'ning at a CoffeeHouse , and , Truth to tell , it griev 'd me deeply to hear their mirthful Chatter ( o'er Jests I could not share ) whilst I was labouring to bring the next Generation into this World . " Mrs. Fanny , " said Susannah , whisp'ring in my Ear , " I would have yer Leave to call the Midwife .... " " ' Twill all be o'er soon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said so . " " I have me Doubts , " said Susannah ; but I was too far gone by then to answer her . " I will do what I will do , " Susannah mutter 'd ' neath her Breath , whereupon she departed the Chamber ( most privily , thro ' a Door that led only to the Back-Stair ) and left me to my Griefs . Now , I would fain describe the Hours of Travail that follow 'd but a curious Fog hath misted ' em , like Clouds snagg 'd upon a Mountaintop ; and try as I may , I have only the haziest Recollection . You will say , Belinda , that this is because so many Years have pass 'd since your Birth ; but ' t is not so . I swear that when you were but five Weeks old , I tried in vain to recollect the Pains of Travail and e'en then could scarce succeed . 0 I remember that the Cramps grew terrible at length and that it seem 'd both my Back and my Belly should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatter 'd and my whole Body shook and my Feet grew cold as Ice ; but for the Life of me I can not recollect the Pains themselves , nor e'en their Duration . I have since question 'd many Women concerning this curious Phenomenon , and ' t is common as the Dust we come from and the Dust to which we return . Pain , you will say , is ne'er memorable ; but I swear I can better recollect the Pains I suffer 'd in my Foot and Hands when I tried to escape from Coxtart 's Brothel to join Lancelot'sSailing than I can the Pains of Travail . I'faith , ' t is almost as if I were not fully present at your Birth ( tho ' indeed I am your Natural Mother ) . What can be the Cause of this strange Phenomenon ? I have meditated long and hard upon it . Perhaps ' t is part of Nature 's mighty Plan for the Continuation of the Race of Humankind ; for if Women truly could recollect the Pains of Travail , they would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nunnery , and ne'er lye with a Man again their whole Lives long ! Perchance this curious Forgetfulness of Birth hath anotherp308Significance as well . Maybe it reminds us that we are not so much the Mothers of our Babes as Nature is ; that we are but Conduits for the Great Goddess ; that Babes derive from and belong to Her and we must possess our Children but lightly , for they are lent to us , not given . If ev'ry Mother recollected her Travail too strongly , she would be inclin 'd to cling to her Child more desperately when she should send it forth into the World to seek its own Fortune . In this wise are we all Orphans of Destiny , whether we know our Natural Parents or not . How many Hours I labour 'd , I can not say . Dim Figures came and went in the Chamber 's Gloom . Susannah 's anxious Face loom 'd above my own ; Susannah 's gentle Hands mopp 'd my fever 'd Brow . Dr. Smellie strode in and out from Time to Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd me roughly , grunted unintelligible Words , and strode out again . Susannah sat beside me , now holding my Hand , now placing her Hand ' neath my Back to ease the Pain , now encouragingme , now mutt'ring that she would give the Doctor but one Hour more . When ' t was already past Midnight ( or so I gather 'd from the Doctor 's Consternation ) , Smellie examin 'd me again , declar 'd that the Babe was obstinate and would not turn its Head , and withdrew to fetch his Secret Instruments . Then the Nightmare began in earnest , for the Doctor return 'd , hiding bulky Instruments ' neath his Smock , and now I cried out in Terror lest they be the dread Extracting Hooks that spell 'd the Death of my Unborn Babe ! " Nonsense , Child , " said Dr. Smellie to my Fears . " This Secret Invention will but ease your Pain and bring your Babe to birth alive . " Whereupon he thrust his Hands again ' neath the Sheet , bade me spread wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumultuous Pains ) , and quite suddenly inserted cold Metal into the Interior of my Being . I felt at once like a Prisoner of the Inquisition , or a Felon being put to the Peine Forte et Dure , for e'en as my Pains came in Waves , this other Force of cold Metal insinuated itself into my very Bowels , jabbing and twisting ; ' t was groping , it seem 'd , for the Head of the Babe , that refus 'd , in its Obstinacy , to turn . I'faith , Smellie seem 'd to be in a Battle with the unborn Babe , angry that it did not yield to his Secret Implements , for he mutter 'd and snarl 'd ' neath his Breath e'en as he prob 'd me , and he curst the Babe that would make a Mockery of all his Reputation and make him seem a Liar in his Predictions that ' t would be born ere Midnight.  |p309Des|pite  my awful Anguish , I sens 'd this Battle betwixt the Babe ( who had its Life to sustain ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not entirely insensible of my Pains , but truly he seem 'd more to wish for the Vindication of his own Success , than for the Happy Conclusion of my Travail . And so he prob 'd and grunted and prob 'd , until at last , he withdrew the Metal Instrumentof Torture ( to which I gave a grateful Sigh ) , secreted it again ' neath his Calico Gown , wip 'd one huge Hand across his resolute Brow , and said : " I fear I can no longer spare the Babe . " These dread Words gave me Energy and Determination where I fear 'd none were left , and suddenly , I was seiz 'd with the Convictionthat I could bear the Pains of Travail for all Eternity rather than sacrifice my Child . " Leave me in Peace , " I mutter 'd , " and let Nature take her Course . " Smellie lookt at me with his great goggling Eyes . " My Dear , " said he , " I know what 's best for you . Pray , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' T is the only Way , I fear . " O now I recall 'd from all my Reading , dreadful Drawings of Extracting Hooks and Babes remov 'd in Pieces from their Mothers ' Wombs , and I scream 'd at the learned Doctor with all my Might : " Leave me in Peace ! Let Nature take her Course ! " " I have sworn to Lord Bellars that I would spare your Life , my Dear . Come , let us baptise this doom 'd Child , and save the Mother 's Life at least . " Whereupon , to my own Amazement , I rose up out of my Bed of Anguish , and kickt the Great Doctor with all my Might , screaming at the top of my Lungs : " I 'll see you roast in Hell before I see you kill my Babe ! " Susannah fairly chear 'd to behold this new and surprizing Turn of Events , and somehow , betwixt us two , we shov 'd the astonish 'd Accoucheur out the Chamber Door and lockt it from within . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Floor moaning in great Grief and near fainted away . Then I lay for a Time upon the Floor , writhing in Agony , whilst Dr. Smellie and Lord Bellars beat with angry Fists against the Door , screaming to be admitted ; but I could no more rise to unlock it than I could fly to the Isle of Wight to join Lancelot ( who , in my Delirium , I fancied still to be awaiting me there ) . I lay upon the Floorboards , listening to the beating Fists like Thunder in a Storm . I knew not where I lay nor why , but I vow 'd , somewhere in the Recesses of my Heart , ne'er to let my Infantp310dye ere ' t was born , or if Matters came to that , to dye along with it , and ascend to Heaven with my own pink Babe in my Arms ! 0 I must have been quite gone in Delirium , for I rav 'd of Angels and Devils , saw Visions of enormous Sunflow'rs growing quite up to the Clouds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later ) : " The Man accosts the Sunflow'rs . " But what that means , I know not . At length , I was in my own Bed again ( but how or by whom transported , I can not tell ) and Susannah was whisp'ring in my Ear : " Mistress Fanny , ye ' ave suffer 'd enough . I'faith , fer the Love o ' God , let me fetch the Midwife , " whereupon ( without awaiting any Reply from me  --  indeed I was perhaps beyond Reply ) she again left the Chamber by the Back-Stairs Door , which was unknown to Lord Bellars . Next I recall blue Eyes looking down at me from ' neath a low white Wimple and a soft Voice saying , " My Child , ' t is true , you have suffer 'd too long already . " Then Susannah and the Midwife undrap 'd me , open 'd my whole Belly to their View , and , with utmost Gentleness , the Midwife laid her tender Hands upon my Belly , feeling for the Position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could discover ' neath it , as in an Anatomist 's Drawing , the true Outlines of the Child . My Pains continu 'd tumultuous as e'er before , yet the Midwife 's Tenderness brought me new Hope . Perhaps we would yet save the Babe . How curious , I thought , I had once sought to do away with this Creature , and now I felt I would do anything to spare its buddingLife . ' T is odd indeed that once we are truly caught up in the Dance of Life , we follow the Steps as diligently as we have been taught . The Musick swells ; our Feet and Hearts obey ; and we are whirl 'd into the Centre of the Ball . " The Babe 's Head , " said the Midwife , " is lockt within the Bony Pelvis , yet ' t is too high , I fear , for Dr. Smellie 's dread Extractorto be of any Use whate'er . Alas , how Men love their Machines better than Life itself ! Our Hands are good enough Machines for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Dear , I would fain feel the Child 's Head from within . " I tried , in my Anguish , to do her Bidding , but I was so far gone in Shiv'ring and Chatt'ring that ' t was hard , indeed , to obey . Susannah and the Midwife rais 'd my Knees and spread my Legs apart . Whereupon the Midwife prob 'd me with one delicate Hand , pressing the other upon my Belly . " I feel the Babe 's Head , " says she . " ' T is turn 'd to one side ,  |p311thus  with ev'ry Pain it throbs against your Back . If I can turn the Head by deft Massage , then truly I can spare both Mother and Child . " She left me for a Time , whilst my Teeth continu 'd to chatter almost in Tune with the Thunder of Fists upon the Chamber Door . " Begone ye Butchers ! Ye Murderers ! " Susannah shouted more than once , yet the Pounding continu 'd . " I go  --  and leave the Ingrate to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rejection of him . Lord Bellars must have pleaded that he stay , since still we heard the Thund'ring Fists for quite some Time to come . " Her Death 's not on my Head ! " Smellie scream 'd , loud enough for God Himself to hear ; and then , at length , the Pummeling ceas 'd , and Susannah whisper 'd , " Perhaps the Murderers have gone .... " But I wonder 'd if Bellars himself were not there , awaiting the Verdict of the Fates , for from Time to Time , I heard a timid Scratching on the Door , as if a Kitten sought Admittance , but dar 'd not scratch too hard for fear some large Dog lurkt within . The Midwife presently return 'd , bearing Jars of Salve , Herbs , and all the Potions of her Trade . " I bid you drink this for your Pain , " said she , off'ring me a Cup of some unknown Liquid . ' T was bitter , but I drank since my Fear of being Poison 'd was less , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not how many Hours I had been in Travail , yet could I see the Dawn rising in the London Sky , and I was so weary and so weak that I welcom 'd any Opiate I might have . The Fluid workt remarkably quick ; and Truth to tell , I did not lose my Cramps , but I ceas 'd fretting o'er ' em . ' T was curious : I knew myself to be in Pain , and my Spirit floated o'er my labouring Body , with little Concern for its Anguish . ' T was indeed as if I were two Women : one a Ghost or Wraith , and the other a moaning Lump of Flesh . The Wraith knew perfect Confidence and Peace , whilst the Flesh anguish 'd and begg 'd for Mercy . Yet the Mercy had , i'faith , been granted ; for this Division betwixt Ghost and Flesh was Mercy 's very Self . I knew that I was lost in deep Travail , but for the Life of me I did not care . The Midwife greas 'd my Belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well ; whereupon she began a sort of Rhythmick Dance o'er my Belly with her gentle Hands , which was design 'd , she said , to turn the Infant 's Head , that it might pass out of my Body still alive.  |p312I  felt her Hands upon my Flesh , both within and without ; and yet that Flesh did not belong to me . First I was at Sea with Lancelot ; and then at Lymeworth with my Step-Mother , walking thro ' the Topiary Gardens , as they had been before they began to be " improv 'd " by Mr. Pope 's new modern Schemes . Hours must have pass 'd , for when I open 'd up my Eyes again , the Sun was high against my Window Panes and they were glitt'ring as if alchemically transform 'd to Gold . I heard the Midwife say , her Voice echoing as in a Great Cathedral : " I fear we can not turn the Head this Way . " Susannah began to weep ; but I myself was still so far away , that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t was my own Life and my own Babe of which they spoke . " Pray , try the Ergot , then , " Susannah begg 'd . " I fear ' twill cause her too much Pain , " the Midwife said ; " she is worn out already . " The Midwife shook me then to bring me back to Earth . " What would you , Fanny ? Spare the Child by all Means , howe'er painful ? I would know your Wishes . " " The Sunflow'rs , the Sunflow'rs , " I rav'd. 0 I was too far gone by then to answer rationally . " Pray , try , " Susannah said . " I know me Mistress well . She is Life 's Advocate ' gainst the Jaws o ' Death . She would always see Life triumph despite Pain ! " The Midwife sigh 'd . " Alas I fear ' t is true . And yet it hurts me to the very Quick to see her suffer so . " Next she administer 'd another Cordial to me , but this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long it banish 'd all my Dreams and brought me back inside my howling Pain . Now were the Knots that twisted up my Belly tumultuous and strong indeed  --  so strong at last that I cried out loud for Mercy and swore I 'd rather dye than bear ' em longer . " For Pity 's Sake , " I scream 'd , " take my Life , for ' t is not wortha Farthing to me . But spare the Child if e'er you can .... " Susannah and the Midwife whisper 'd then , in most sober and solemn Counsel . " I 'll try one last Expedient , " the Midwife said , " although the Risque is great . And the Risque of Discovery of it is greater still  --  for should any Person learn of this , and if our Fanny doth survive , we three shall surely be call 'd Witches . " " The Stake , the Pyre , is nothing to this Pain ! " I rav 'd ; whereupon the Midwife gave me Laudanum in such a Dose that I was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planet I inhabited.  | " Bless you , " said I as the Opiate took me and I sail 'd off to Sea with Lancelot again . Next , I remember the Gleam of Razors and the Clatter of iron Potts ; but so separated was my Spirit from my Flesh that I car 'd not what Brutalities were practis 'd upon my Form . I rockt upon the Waves with Lancelot , and at the self-same Time I felt cold Metal shave my Belly and a Razor 's Edge penetrate my Skin . Blood flow 'd like the Ocean 's Currents ; the Razor cut deeper , and deeper still . Yet so outside my Body was I that tho ' I felt the Pain , I did not care ; and tho ' I saw the Blood , it no more belong 'd to me than the Blood of a butcher 'd Lamb belongs to the Hearty Trenchermen who dine upon its Flesh . Susannah gasp 'd to see this horrifick Sight ; but I had reach 'd a Stage of Resignation beyond the Rage to live . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life with all my Being , and yet the Opiate took me so far away from Passions of the Flesh that e'en the Lust for Life now hung suspended . Blood How 'd ; the Sheets themselves turn 'd red . My Innards gap 'd ; a practis 'd Hand reach 'd in to pluck a Child from my very Bowels . So raving mad was I that , i'faith , I thought ' t was my beatingHeart they pluckt and not my Child . A bloody Creature snatch 'd by its tiny Feet ; held upside down , smackt until it howls ! I heard its lusty Cry and wept and wept . " ' T is a beauteous little Girl ! Blessed be ! " the Midwife said . " Hath she five Fingers on each Hand ? Hath she ten Toes ? " was all I might collect myself to ask . " She hath ! She hath ! And red Hair , too ! " the Midwife said . Whereupon she wrapp 'd the tiny Creature ( still bloody with our mingl 'd Blood ) in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I marvell 'd then at the tiny turn'd-up Nose ( crusted with the Blood of the Womb ) , at the tiny Hands groping for they knew not what Hands to hold , at the tiny Mouth sucking blindly for it knew not what Breasts , at the tiny Feet that knew not what Paths they would walk in what Continents yet to be discover 'd , in what Countries yet to be born . " Welcome , little Stranger , " I said betwixt my Tears . " Welcome , welcome , " and then the salty Sea of my Tears o'ertook me and I wept in great Tidal Waves of Brine . 0 I cried until my Tears themselves washt a Portion of the cak 'd Blood from the Infant'sCheaks and show 'd me her translucent Skin , the Colour of Summer Dawn . But what was that stitching , stitching going on below ? Thep314Midwife held a Taylor 's Needle o'er a Candle , perhaps to staunch my Blood or cauterise my Wounds , and with the finest , whitest Silk she stitch 'd my Belly back together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laudanum made me numb to Pain . I feasted my bleary Eyes upon my Daughter 's Face and cried for her unearthly Beauty. 0 what a Miracle is a Newborn Babe ! Snatch 'd from the Void , barely alive nine Months , yet it arrives with its Fingers and Toes fully form 'd , its Lips tender as the Petals of the Rose , its Eyes unfathomably blue as the Sea ( and almost as blind ) , its Tongue pinker than the inside of a Shell , and curling and squirming like a garden Worm in sodden Spring . Almost three Decades have pass 'd since I first beheld you , my own Belinda , but I will ne'er forget my Feelings as I feasted my bleary Eyes upon your fresh-hatch 'd Face . The Pains of Travail may fade ( ah , fade they do ! ) but the Wonder of that Miracle  --  that most ordinary Miracle  --  of the Newborn Babe is a Tale told and told again where'er the Race of Womankind survives ! Then I slept . Morpheus , who softens so many Blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving Arms ' and I was lost in Sleep . How long I slept , I know not , but when I woke ' t was darkest Night and only one Candle burnt in my Chamber . Susannah herself kept watch . I arose , groaning of the Pain in my Belly , and she came to me with a Potion to relieve it . " Laudanum ? " I askt . " Yes , " said she . " Then wait a little . I would see my Child before you take the World away again . " " I 'll call the Midwife fer ye , " said Susannah . " The Child is well and lusty , have no Fear . " She withdrew by the secret Back-Stairs Door ; and in a little while , the Midwife came in her Stead . She approach 'd my Bed by that single Candle 's Light ; a smallish Figure all in white , with a Back curiously hump 'd , and a low white Wimple covering her Forehead . She carried a red and wrinkl 'd Babe , swaddl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bed , she presentedthe wond'rous Creature to my View . ' T was the tiny Bud of a Human Being , as tightly folded as a Rose in early June . Two pink Eyelids curl 'd upon two pink Cheaks ; and the merest Suggestionof Eyelashes were just beginning to sprout . The Eyelids were , i'faith , so transparent that the Network of diminutive Veins glow 'd ' neath ' em , blue and purple as Creatures of the deepest Seas.  |p315The  Eyes were tightly shut against the World . ( 0 soon enough would they behold its Cruelties ! ) . And the Mouth was a sleeping Worm in a Springtime Rain . The Nose turn 'd Heavenward at its tiny Tip ; and the Fingers were fashion 'd from some Book wherein the Cherubim are writ . I marvell 'd  --  that much is true  --  and yet , tho ' I had seen the Babe pluckt from my own Belly , I was not certain she belong 'd to me . ' T was not I fear 'd a Changeling  --  no , not at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet somehow I did not feel myself to be your Mother , but only a sort of Passage for your Birth . Such Things are common in the first Hours after Childbirth . Being a Mother is learnt , not inborn . We Human Creatures learn so much and know so little ! And still I lov 'd you from the Moment I beheld you  --  1ov 'd you with purest Love , not mere Possession , lov 'd you for your astounding Beauty , all the Beauties of the Human Race join 'd in one Babe . The Midwife knelt before the Bed , placed the Child inside my waiting Arms , and bow 'd her Head in silent Pray'r . Then , looking at me with her bright blue Eyes , she pusht the Wimple from her Brow , and , lo ! blazon 'd in her Flesh was a Cross , carv 'd out of tortur 'd Skin and still pucker 'd crimson as a new Wound . " Isobel ! " I cried . " Fanny , my Dearest , my Daughter ! " says she.  |p316In  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of ' em here , lest the Muse of Historio-Comical Epick Writing be very cross with us and flee our House forthwith . I LOOKT AT ISOBEL  --  the Hump upon her Back , the Cross cut in her Forehead , the Eyes like bluest Jewels  --  and I was sure that I was still lost in Dreams under the potent Influence of Laudanum . " It can not be ! " I rav 'd , " for you were kill 'd . I saw you murder 'd upon Stonehenge Down ! " " I am no Ghost , my Love , " said Isobel , " tho ' I was almost one , ' t is true . Ravish 'd I was ; blooded I was  --  ' t is plain to see the Cross cut in my Forehead ; and yet , tho ' I was stabb 'd , I did survive . " " How can that be ? " I askt , now almost forgetting the horrid Pain in my Belly and the Stitches that pull 'd with ev'ry Breath I drew . " The Goddess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I might spare you and your Babe as well . There are Greater Plans in Heaven than we mere Mortals see ! " " But how did you survive ? " I askt , incredulous . " Those Blackguards were so frenzied in their Bloodlust that when they came to me , their Force was nearly spent . The Pig-faced Ruffian ravish 'd me and carv 'd this horrid Cross upon my Brow , but when he came to stab me thro ' the Heart , he was no longer puissant as he thought . He wounded but my Flesh and miss 'd my Heart , and yet I moan 'd and fell like one quite dead ; thus he deduced he had dispatch 'd my Soul . Then I lay very still  --  as I have learnt to do thro ' Hours of Meditation  --  and I impersonated Death-like Sleep . I quieted my Breath , near stopp 'd my Heart , until the Ruffians all departed . My Wounds were such I could prevent Gangrene by Means of Herbs I knew  --  the same Herbs I shall use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save our Friends , thep317Witches , for they were too far gone . The very Stones of Stonehenge drink their Blood . And e'en beloved Joan 's . . . . ' T would be a Sacrifice to the Goddess if she desir 'd such . " " Who is this Goddess , Isobel ? Doth she , in truth , exist ? " " Ah , Fanny , Fanny , how can you ask when you still live and I still live and this beauteous Babe doth live ? Dr. Smellie 's Forceps  --  for that is what his Secret Instruments most surely are  --  did you no good . Had I not cut into your swollen Belly , ' t would sure have burst , and burst your Life as well . The Operation I perform 'd is old as History itself , and venerable as Ancient Greece or Rome . I'faith , it goes back to the Dawn of Time , yet ' t is forbidden as if ' t were Witchcraft . Since the accursed Accoucheurs have ne'er perform 'd it upon a Woman who liv 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Babe and Dam ! Yet we Wise Women have known this Art for Centuries and pass 'd it on in secret to our Daughters . The Mother 's Life is spar 'd when we defeat the Gangrene with our special Herbs . Thus I have given you Moulds and Mosses , which , mixt with Laudanum to kill the Pain , shall prevent the Festering of your Wound . 0 Scars shall you have , but what are Scars beside the Gift of Life ? You shall wear your Scar as the proud Badge of your Life-giving Pow'rs . I'faith , you shall wear it ' neath your Boddice  --  unlike mine . " She pointed sadly to the Cross she bore , still red and angry as the Ruffians who incis 'd it . I listen 'd with what mixt Emotions I can not e'en say . " You must understand , my Girl , " Isobel went on , " that we are all rising from a buried Past . They speak of Reason and Enlightenment , of Nature 's Mighty Plan in this Best of all Possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dark as Darkest Night  --  quite unlike the Ancient Days when Woman was worshipp 'd as the Sun , not obscur 'd as a pale and misty Moon . We are only beginning now to rise , to throw back the Dust from our Graves , to unearth our own Faces . My Face , like ev'ry Woman 's Face , is an Image of the Face of the Goddess . They have cut their Cross into it as a Symbol of Masculine Pow'r . They think that thus they may subdue the Goddess  --  but she is not to be subdu 'd with Knives alone . " I lookt at Isobel in stark amazement , but her Eyes shone with other-worldly Fire and as she spoke , she sway 'd and rockt as I had seen poor slaughter 'd Joan do , so many Months ago . " We are the Bringers and Givers of Life , " she said . " That they can not take from us . Tho ' they may try to degrade these Mysteries , to make them our Downfall and not our Glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Joy you felt the Moment you beheld the Babe is a Glimpse of your Divinity within . ' T is also the vast Pow'r of the Goddess . The Accoucheurs and all their Kind may wish to make you think Travail and Birth are Agonies , not Blessings , but e'en within their Pains , you have glimps 'd their Joys . " The Cross , the Hanging Tree , the Bars of Prisons  --  all these are Symbols of the Madnesses of Men . They would e'er put Pow'r before Life itself . But the Symbol of the Woman is a Circle  --  the Infant 's Head emerging betwixt the Legs of the Goddess , the Circles of the Nipples , the Navel , the Gravid Belly . ' T is the Sun , all Radiance , Circles that have no Beginnings , and no Endings , whilst Uprights , Crossbeams , Crucifixes , and Hanging Trees are nought but Testaments to Man 's Worship of Death . " I held my Child , lookt up at Isobel , and struggl 'd to understand her Meaning . My Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to be upon the Brink of a Great Revelation , and yet I could not grasp it . " Ah , Fanny , you are tired , " said Isobel . " I 'll fetch your SleepingPotion and your Cures . All this Talk can wait until another Time . " She took the Babe and brought my Sleeping Draught , which I drank thirstily , knowing now that I would live to wake again , and strangely sooth 'd by all she 'd said . Then I drifted into a curious Visionary Sleep in which the Things she 'd said and what I had perceiv 'd in these last Hours were strangely intermixt . I dreamt I had a silken Gown given me by my own Natural Mother . ' T was beauteous , a Thing of rosy Silk , and yet I cut a gaping Hole in it to accommodate my swollen Belly . Then I was fill 'd with the bitterest Remorse , for the silk Threads unravell 'd and I knew I could not sew ' em back together . I wept most inconsolably for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China toil fer ye , " Susannah said , her Skin transform 'd to white , her Hair to red . 0 in this Dream , Susannah was my Daughter , and as I watch 'd , I saw her Body shrink back , back , back to Infant 's Size ! I rockt her in my Arms , she suckt my Breasts , and all my Being o'erflow 'd with Passion such as no mere Man had e'er rais 'd in me . In making love to her , I made love also to myself , for our two Essences were so intermingl 'd that ' t was impossible to say where one began and the other ended. 0 what strange Dreams the Laudanum sent ! Did Isobel still live or did I dream that , too ? And was there a Newborn Babe ? Indeed , on this first Day after your Birth , I knew no Distinction betwixt Dreams and Waking , betwixt Life and Death.  |p319One  Candle burnt in the darken 'd Chamber . A Door creakt open on its Hinges and Footsteps approach 'd my Bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reply was given . " Isobel ? " I askt again . The Footsteps drew nearer . I struggl 'd to raise myself upon the Pillows , and as I did so , I saw in the Gloom the astonish 'd Face of Lord Bellars . " Fanny ! " he cried , seeing my Face unmaskt for the first Time since Lymeworth ; whereupon he fell to his Knees at my Bedside , pleading Forgiveness . " Had I but known , " he sobb 'd , " had I but known . " " What would you have done ? " came another Voice in the Darkness . ' T was Isobel , her Voice suffus 'd with Bitterness such as I had ne'er heard  --  e'en from her . Lord Bellars lookt up suddenly . " Isobel ? " he askt uncertainly . " ' T is I , " she said. " 0 no  --  not you , too ! " he cried . " 0 God ! What have I done to deserve such a Fate ! " " What have you not done ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in Hell , Laurence Bellars ! " " Then you two know each other ? " I askt . " Fanny  --  you should know  --  " Lord Bellars began , but Isobel swiftly interrupted him . " Not now , " said she , " the Lass hath been thro ' enough Hardshipthese past Days . " Whereupon she seiz 'd Lord Bellars by the Arm and dragg 'd him to the Corner of the Chamber . I could neither see nor properly hear what transpir 'd betwixt ' em , but from the Gasps and Moans Lord Bellars made as Isobel whisper 'd in his Ear , I deduced that the Matter was not pleasant . At length , after many Exclamations of Grief on his part , I heard him again fall upon bended Knee and exclaim : " What have I done to win the Love of such good Women when I am so base myself ! " Then again I heard Footsteps , fleeing the Chamber and clatt'ring down the Stair , and presently Isobel came to me . " What have you told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaim ? " " That you shall know in all good Time , " said Isobel , " when you are quite recover 'd of your Pains . Now you must sleep again and we shall talk together when you are better . " " But where doth he go ? " I askt . " He goes to atone for his Sins , " said Isobel . " We need no Men here . This is Women 's Work . Sleep , my Fanny , sleep . " All these most strange Events occurr 'd betwixt Sleep and Waking under the puissant Influence of Laudanum , in that curiousp320Twilight State that follows upon Childbirth . E'en had I no Opiate to cloud my Brain , I should have been half mad , at least , after my Ordeal . 0 Angels and Demons attend Women in Childbed ! E'en without Isobel to prompt my Rage , the Severity of the Pain I had known should have stirr 'd my Anger ' gainst the Whole Race of Mankind who but employ Women as Brood Mares and steal not only Life from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For who can glory in bearing a Daughter in a World where Women have so few Prospects and are us 'd so ill ? I remember how I wept o'er your tiny Form , my own pink Belinda , vowing that your Fate should be better than mine , that you should ne'er be seduced as your Mother had been before you , that you should have as much Education as any Lad , that you should learn to ride and fence and shoot , so that howe'er many cruel Hands Fate should deal you , you should prove able to defend yourself against ' em all . I remember how I sat and rockt you ( both of us still in the Drowse that follows Birth ) and marvell 'd at your Face , your Cherub 's Hands , the Impenetrable Blue of your Infant 's Eyes , and the Dawn Pink of your newborn Skin . How did we , who were so recently one Being , become two ? I marvell 'd most at this , for still I felt you ' neath my Heart and I wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ending with Death . ' T was great Good Fortune to have Isobel there , for I felt almost like a Babe myself . When I curl 'd up in Sleep I imagin 'd myself a pink Infant , with a Mouth drooling Slime  --  as if a tiny Snail had cross 'd the Bed  --  and small Hands clutching and unclutching at the Air . " What shall we name her ? " Isobel askt , sitting by my Bedside , looking down with Eyes of sweetest Love upon the Babe . " Belinda , " said I , all unthinking , for I still lov 'd " The Rape of the Lock " tho ' I could not love its Author anymore . 0 might my Belinda know no greater Rapes than to be shorn of one small Lock of Hair whilst playing Cards ! " The Goddess guides your Words , " Isobel said , " for Belinda means Serpent-like ' and the Serpent is the Ancient Symbol of Wisdom and also of the Goddess . " " Are you quite sure ? " I askt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Satan 's Name , for doth not the Snake signify the Devil ? " Isobel lookt at me most patiently , but her Eyes flasht with Anger.  | " If I had rear 'd you , you would know , " said she . " The Serpent was the Symbol of the Goddess , and when her Holy Temples were o'erthrown and Priests replaced the Priestesses of Old , the Serpent was made to seem the Devil . ' T is always thus : the new Cult names the Gods of Old as Devils . But that whole Eden Story is nought but Lyes ! Name her Belinda then , ' twill please the Goddess . " Just then , the Door open 'd and Susannah rusht in , her Face full of Fear . " Quick ! Run an ' hide yerself , Mistress Isobel ! ' T is the AccoucheurDr . Smellie an ' his Cohorts . They murmur o ' Witchcraft an ' press to see the Midwife . 0 I beg ye , run an ' hide ! " Isobel pull 'd her Wimple down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself upon her Knees , begg 'd Mercy of the Goddess , and murmur 'd other Pray'rs I did not hear . " Isobel , " I said , " there are so many Questions I would ask of you concerning Lord Bellars , the Goddess , all your Lore .... " She ran to me and kiss 'd me tenderly , then kiss 'd the rosy Babe . " This Meeting was more than I dar 'd hope . 0 if I must dye now , I have done my part in saving you and also blest Belinda . Keep her safe . Our Paths will cross again if the Goddess desires it . Blessings on you both and all your Daughters ! 0 blessed , blessed , blessed be ! " Whereupon she ran from the Room by the Back-Stairs Door . " Isobel , " I cried , distraught to lose her again after having so recently found her . " Isobel ! " Dr. Smellie then burst in , accompanied by two younger-looking Cronies . Their Perukes were askew , their Faces flusht with Hurry and Anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who dares call herself a Midwife ? " " There is no Witch , " said I , " unless ' t is I myself . For I deliver 'd the Babe myself . " I said this as brazenly as you please , but my Hands trembl 'd as I held my Child . " You lye ! " Smellie accus 'd . " ' T was impossible to deliver that Child alive thro ' Nature 's Gate . By Rights you should be dead . I swear upon the Ghost of Dead Hippocrates that Witchcraft hath been us 'd . By Jove  --  I would see the Wound , for I am sure there is one ! " " Modesty forbid ! " said I. " At your Peril , Sirrah , you undrape my Body ! " Smellie stopp 'd in his Tracks . He dar 'd not undrape me for fear of being condemn 'd in his Profession : for if an **32;7169;TOOLONG with them : the game was more and more interrupted , a glass lifted to someone 's lips by itself and wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost breath rippled Samuel 's hair playfully . There were heavy indentations in chair cushions , the impress of someone 's generous buttocks . The mirror grew cloudy and indistinct . Diamond-shaped crystals on one of the chandeliers began to rattle . There was an odor of flesh  --  not altogether clean  --  and yet not altogether unpleasant : the odor of perspiration that has dried , mixed with the odor of soil , sunshine , vegetation , unlaundered clothes . Most distressing , however , was the undercurrent of voices , lifting now and then into laughter of a somewhat jeering type . And though Samuel insisted , now rather boisterously , that his friends were imagining everything  --  they were silly as young girls , routed by spooks and imps !  --  what fools !  --  what cowards  --  one by one the young men made their excuses , feebly and nervously , and went home . When the last of his friends rose to leave , swaying unsteadily , Samuel seized what remained of the deck of cards and threw it petulantly down , cursing him ; he staggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his arms crossed and his shoulders hunched in an attitude of childish fury , and when he raised his eyes he found that he was facing the mirror , staring into the mirror , and that , beyond the filmy glass surface , his friend was not reflected  --  theroom itself was only dimly reflected  --  and his own image was transparent as a jellyfish 's . He turned , and his friend was still there , chattering , his hand extendedfor Samuel to shake . If the young man caught in that instant Samuel 's own astonishment he gave no indication : quite simply he was escaping , and there was nothing Samuel could do to restrain him . So he left , and Samuel remained in the room , at first angered by  --  by whatever it was  --  by the queer bodiless agitation of air  --  by the murmurousvoices  --  and the laughter that rose in jagged little peaks  --  and the odor . He drank from a wine bottle , staggering about the room . Why did n't they show themselves , were they afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card game , to interfere  --  who were they to trespass in BellefleurManor ? He saw , reflected in the mirror , a dark figure pass close behind him ; but when he turned no one was there . Coward , he whispered . The gold minute hand on the alabaster clock above the mantel began to move backward . Samuel stared at it , the bottle lifted to his lips . He was angry , he was n't frightened , quite deliberately he swallowed a few large mouthfuls as he watched the clock hand , though the wine had begun to dribble down his chin . Then he threw the bottle from him and rushed to the clock and stopped the hand , and moved it forward again . There was a slight resistance but he overcame it ; and in his zeal moved the hand round and round and round , so that he lost track of the time .... Two in the morning , perhaps . Two-thirty . No more than three . Now when he turned lie saw in the mirror a mist-shrouded group of people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , with a peculiar airy gra ( e  --  prculiat because it was so solid  --  was the figure of ap201woman . Samuel stared , standing motionless . In his distraction he began to dig at the tartar on his front teeth , a habit he believed he had cured himself of years before . A black woman  --  a Negress  --  but not a slave  --  evidently not a slave  --  with wide thick grape-colored lips  --  tobacco-colored skin  --  a broad , somewhat flat nose , with prominent nostrils  --  hair that frizzed with static electricity  --  strong shoulders  --  muscular shoulders  --  a thick but long neck  --  long-lashed eyes  --  very dark eyes  --  eyes that fixed him in a mockingstare . He stood immobile , waiting for her to speak  --  what if she called him by name , what if she claimed him !  --  his thumbnail now jammed between two of his lower teeth . A Negress , an African  --  with what defiantly , hideously African features ! Samuel stared and stared , for he had never seen a black woman before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror was cloudy , and the outlines of the woman 's body bled away into the shadows , she was somehow enlarged , magnified , and subtly distorted , as if she were an image detaching itself from its surface and covering Samuel 's eye  --  a dream-image adhering to the surface of his amazed unresisting eye . But she was so ugly ! She was ugly , despite her beauty . A mature woman , ten or more years older than Samuel , with heavy breasts that appeared to be hanging loose inside a shapeless sweat-stained garment , and tense cords in her neck , and stained teeth . One of her lower teeth was even missing . . . . Ugly , obscene . Still she held him with that bold stare , as if his expression of alarm and disgust amused her . She was ugly , she was obscene , he wanted only to turn and run from her , and slam the door behind him , and lock it . . . . But instead he remained immobile , a strand of wavy hair fallen over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his vest wine-stained , his legs slightly bent at the knee as if their strength were draining from them ; and the thumb pressed against his teeth . But you have no right to be here , he whispered . From that night onward Samuel Bellefleur was not himself  --  it was said of him , repeatedly , even by persons who had not previously known him well , that he " was n't himself . " Seated at dinner he smiled vacantly , and pushed food about his plate , and replied when spoken to so languidly , so indifferently , that Violet burst into tears more than once , and had to be escorted from the room . He was not discourteous : he made a show of being courteous : but his every word , his every gesture , even the most subtle movement of his brow , communicated a perverse and possibly even malicious contempt . They could smell the woman on him  --  they could sense his erotic gravity  --  a sensuousness so powerful , so heavy , that it held down his soul like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float to the surface of of din:u v discourse . Raphael was embai tasse  --  d , and then angry ; and then baffled ( f rr how could his son be indulging in a wicked liaison , when he no longer left thep202manor ? ) ; and , in the end , frightened . He had not expected his son to be celibate , he certainly knew of slightly scandalous doings among the officersof the Light Guard , and so long as Violet did not know  --  or did not acknowledge that she knew  --  it hardly mattered . But he had not expected anything so rankly obvious as this : and there was , at all times , even in the breakfast room , that incontestable rich ripe overripe fairly reeking odor that emanated from Samuel , stirred by his every movement , wafted about in the most innocent of atmospheres . And yet the boy bathed  --  certainly he bathed  --  he bathed at least once a day . Samuel stayed away from the family for longer and longer periods of time , and though Raphael was grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolute life on one of the gambling boats , or piling up debts in the Falls like other young men in his circle  --  the boy was , after all , sequesteredaway in the Turquoise Room with the two or three newspapers Raphael subscribed to , and the almanac for the year , and even the Holy Bible !  --  still he could not refuse to acknowledge his son 's increasing estrangement , and the fact that what stared coldly at him out of Samuel 's eyes was no longer exactly his son . " Are you not feeling well , Samuel , " Raphael murmured , touching the boy 's arm , and after a space of several seconds the boy would draw away , slowly , and smile that haughty indifferentsmile , and say in a husky voice , " I am feeling exceptionally well , Fa-ther . " His linen was changed less often . His collars were unbuttoned . He declined to come downstairs when his friends called , and gave as an excuse for missing drill , and for missing the sessions with Herod that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumble about feeling " sluggish . " After weeping in Raphael 's arms Violet suddenly grew angry , and spoke in a rapid low voice of the " slut " who was ruining her boy : it was n't anyone on the household staff , she was certain , she was certain , she did n't think it could be one of the female laborers , for how could he smuggle the creature up to the third floor day after day ?  --  but he did have a woman , of course he had a woman , a filthy wicked slattern who wanted only to destroy Raphael 's heir ! ( Violet 's frenzy , as well as the remarkable words she used , embarrassed her husband to the point of stupeaction : he had never imagined his wife knew such words , let alone of the reality they indicated . ) There were times when , emerging from the Turquoise Room , Samuelactually staggered , and his handsome face  --  more handsome than ever , it seemed  --  was oily with sweat . His skin might be feverish to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , untrimmed , bristled all directions , and must have tickled ; Violet once picked a tiny kinky hair off his lip  --  and thereby incurred her son 's startled displeasure . " Do n't touch me , Mother , " he said , recoiling . But at least , at that moment , he looked her fully in the face . Of course they investigated the room in his absence , at least in the first weeks when he allowed them in , but they found nothing  --  only thep203scattered newspapers , a cushion out of place , finger smears on the mirror , the minute hand of the clock slightly bent , and the clock no longer ticking . The odor of unwashed flesh , the odor  --  hardly more subtle  --  of fleshly delirium was sometimes faint , sometimes overpoweringly strong , so that Violet , hardly able to breathe , commanded the servants to throw open all the windows . How hideous , that smell ! How obscene ! And yet there was nothing to attach it to : the Turquoise Room was as extraordinarily beautiful as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalty . The only time Samuel showed much interest in his parents ' increasingalarm-and then the interest was rather mild  --  was when Raphael pointed out that he 'd been hidden away in the room for eleven hours straight ; and Samuel , opening his blood-threaded eyes wide , said that that could n't be the case  --  he 'd been in there only an hour or so  --  was n't it still morning ? Raphael explained , trembling , that it was by no means morning . Samuel had been in that room all day , and did he intend to sleep in there again tonight ... ? What was he doing in that room ! Samuel began to gnaw at his thumbnail . He frowned , looked through his father , seemed to be making rapid calculations . Finally he said with a wry shrug of his shoulders that " time was different there . " He was absent for longer periods of time , for days at a stretch , and when he did appear at the dinner table he yawned , ran his hand lazily through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ate so little , he should have been wasting away : but in fact he was as solid as ever , and there was even the beginning of a slight paunch high above his belt . When Violet demanded to know what he was doing in the Turquoise Room he blinked at her as if not knowing what she meant , and said in a hollow , husky voice , " Just reading , Mother , what do you . . . what do you think ? " and his slack lips drooped into a negligent smile . He disappeared for three days , and then for four ; when they forced open the lock to the Turquoise Room he was nowhere to be seen . But then he appeared downstairs that very evening , and showed surprise once again that he 'd been away so long . According to his calculations he 'd gone upstairs to read the newspapers and had been there about two hours , but according to their calculations he had been gone for four days . " I think I understand , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Time is clocks , not a clock . Not your clock . You ca n't do anything more with time than try to contain it , like carrying water in a sieve .... And so , finally , he disappeared into the Turquoise Room . He enteredit one evening after dinner , and never came out ; he simply disappeared . The windows were not only closed but locked from the inside . There were secret passageways out of two or three other rooms in the castle ( one of them Raphael 's study ) but there was no secret passageway out of the " Turquoise Room . The boy had simply disappeared . He no longer existed . " There was no trace , no farewell note , there had been no significant final remark : Samuel Bellefleur had simply ceased to exist.  |p204One  night some months later , Raphael , still grieving for his son , cut short his meeting with a group of Republicans in a city five hundred miles away , and returned to the castle , and ran upstairs to the Turquoise Room ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted ) , and , with his gold-knobbed cane , smashed the enormous mirror . Shards of glass flew everywhere , shards of all sizes , icicle-shaped , pebble-shaped , some small as needles , driving themselves into Raphael 's flesh . He continued to strike the mirror , however , again and again , gripping his cane with both hands , sobbing and shouting unintelligibly . They had taken his son ! They had taken his beloved son from him ! When he was finished only a few slivers of mirror remained on the wall . What faced him  --  held up , still , by the exquisite Italian columns  --  was nothing more than the mirror 's plain oak backing , mere wood , twodimensional , reflecting nothing , containing no beauty , badly hacked by the spasmodic blows of his cane.  |p205On  her many travels  --  to Nautauga Falls , to the state capital , to Port Oriskany , to faraway Vanderpoel  --  Leah always took Germaine , no matter that the little girl would have preferred to remain at home , playing in the walled garden with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon objected . " I ca n't travel without her , " Leah said . " She 's my heart  --  my soul . I ca n't leave her behind . " " Then stay home yourself , " Gideon said . And Leah stared at him , stared him down . " You do n't need to make these trips , " Gideon said , faltering . " It 's just something you are deluding yourself with . . . . We do n't need you to make these appeals for us . " Leah , knowing how the falsity of his words must strike him , knowing that he could n't fail to hear , for all his hypocrisy , their tinniness , saw no reason to reply . She simply rang for one of the servants , to help her pack . There was the matter of Jean-Pierre II unjustly imprisoned in Powhatassie , and Leah 's initial petitions denied ; there was the matter of locating a partner ( one with , as Hiram expressed it , " unlimited resources " ) for certain mining operations east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges in the pine forests had fallen through ( and though Leah never explicitly spoke of the brothers ' ignoble failure with Meldrom neither Gideon nor Ewan was allowed to forget it : Leah would say only " Now we must shift our plan of attack , " " Now we must begin again at zero " ) ; there was the need to check up on Bellefleur property , much of it operating at a loss , or with very slender profits ; there was the matter of keeping up social contacts ( which Leah , like Cornelia , called " thinking of our friends " )  --  for the day was n't distant when the many Bellefleur girls ( 1'olamle , Vida , Morna , even ( : hristabcl , and now even Lattle Goldie ) would be of marriageable age : and lot a while , though she ould n't have been situ ere about it , there was the matter of findingp206a suitable husband for poor Garnet Hecht ( who had surprised everyone , or nearly everyone , by having a baby : a darling little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't at this point any name , since Garnet was too listless to name her , yet too weakly stubborn to acquiesce in one of the names Leah suggested ) . So Leah was busy , marvelously busy , no sooner back at Bellefleur Manor and soaking in a hot bath than she was planning another trip , another mode of attack . Attorneys were hired , and then dismissed , for being incapable of " understanding what I say , when I do n't say it , " as Leah explained ; there were brokers , bank officials , bookkeepers , accountants , tax lawyers , men whose names turned up like mica in a spaded garden as Leah talked excitedly at the dinner table of her plans , and then were covered over again and forgotten ; there were of course Bellefleurs in other cities , frequently with other names ( Zundert , Sandusky , Medick , Cinquefoil , Filaree ) , who should  --  or should not  --  be cultivated , depending on their usefulness ; there were so many politicians  --  fromGovernor Grounsel and his Lieutenant-Governor Horehounddown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their claim of knowing what really went on  --  that no one in the family , not even Hiram , could keep them straight . What this promiscuous assortment of men had in common was Leah : she believed they might be useful , or might at least put her in contact with others who would be useful . Early on , Leah had won over grandfather Noel and uncle Hiram : they were clearly besotted with her , and thought it quite reasonable  --  even " pragmatic , " in Hiram 's words  --  that the old Bellefleur estate of 1780 might be regained , by judicious maneuverings . It would take time , it would require ingenuity and cunning , and secrecy ( for if Bellefleur enemiessuspected the family 's plan they would leap in and buy up the land simply out of spite ) ; it would certainly require diligence and tact ( and unfortunately the Bellefleurs had a reputation , generations old , of tactlessness ) ; and charm . So if anyone objected to Leah 's schemes Noel and Hiram defended them , and great-grandmother Elvira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundredth birthday , she was visited with increasingly apocalyptic dreams : floods , fires , lightning storms that illuminated the heavens : premonitions that something extraordinary was to happen to the family ) ; and even Cornelia , who customarily opposed her daughterin-lawas a matter of principle , appeared to see some merit in certain aspects of the plan ... for the grandchildren would be of marriageable age soon , the boys as well as the girls , and she hoped . . . ah , how fervently she hoped ... that the new generation would choose more discreetly than the old . Gideon quarreled with Leah in the privacy of their suite , and maintained a sullen courtesy elsewhere , and Ewan sometimes vigorously challenged her ( he was especially antipathetic to the scheme of securing a retrial or an outright pardon for Jean-Pierre II : Why not let the old boy spend the rest of his days in peace at I'owhatassie , by now he 's adjusted , he must have a circle of comrades , ltc retrives a monthly allowance fromp207Father for little treats and niceties , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not stir up trouble again ? ) ; but when he helped see her off , climbing into the old Packard touring car that fairly sagged beneath the weight of her luggage , turning to wave a goodbye kiss at whoever was assembled on the marble steps , Leah in her smart magenta traveling cloak with the matching kid shoes , her white gloves buttoned at the wrist , the filmy white aigrette bobbing on her slope-brimmed cream-colored hat , her rich glowing exultant face turned to him ( and now , nearly a year after Germaine 's birth , she had lost the extra weight she 'd carried , and even the tiny pinch of flesh beneath her chin , so like Germaine 's baby fat , had disappeared )  --  why , he could not stop himself from grinning , she was so handsome a woman , of course she would succeed ! If any Bellefleur succeeded in this century , it would be Leah . Through a helpful acquaintance in the attorney-general 's office Leah met a charming middle-aged man named Vervain , a furrier , who showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Bellefleurs , though he knew nothing about mining ; but it soon developed that Vervain had n't the sort of capital Leah required . ( And he was too well protected by his female relatives , as a rich widower , to be a possibility for poor Garnet , who might have appealed to him . . . a husbandless spiritless frail little mutt of a girl , halfway attractive if glimpsed in the right light , who somehow  --  no one knew how  --  no one could guess how  --  had had a darling little baby a few weeks ago . ) But it was in the company of Vervain , who escorted both Leah and Germaine to the World 's Exposition at Vanderpoel , that Leah met P. T. Tirpitz , the banker and philanthropist , renowned throughout the state for his charitable donations of parks , lakes , renovated mansions , and immense sums of cash to worthwhile institutions ( among them the Church of Christ , Scientist , to which he may have belonged ) . Long ago , it was thought , Tirpitz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellefleur , but Leah did n't know if the transaction had taken place before the worst period of Raphael 's career  --  in short , she did n't know if it had been fully repaid . It was a measure of Tirpitz 's gallantry that he made no allusion to past dealings with the Bellefleurs , and affected only a dim but flattering notion of their grandeur , and their significance in what he called " the magnificent historyof our nation . " Though he must have been an elderly man at this time  --  smallish , bald , with odd planes and layers of bone in his skull that made Leah think of her mother , and a tooth chipped in an inverted V , which gave him a boyish puckish disingenuous look  --  he appeared as robust as a man in his mid-fifties , or even younger . On one of their strolls through the Expositiongrounds he insisted upon carrying Germaine , who had gotten tired , and it quite impressed Leah  --  who was , all her life , to be impressed by such obvious demonstrations of strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them , clearly , as nothing more than sentimental vestiges of a too-lively girlhood  --  remember , for instance ,  |p208the  daring midnight climb of her cousin Gideon into her bedroom where he fought and murdered Love ! it impressed her just the same , that the man 's legendary wealth , and the rumors of his association with a church she thought nothing if not comical , had not weakened him . His muscles were small but hard , and he staggered only a little under the hefty child 's weight . " You really do n't need to carry Germaine , Mr. Tirpitz , " Leah said , her smile gracious behind the filmy gauze of her veil . " I need to do nothing , " Tirpitz replied . But he winked at Leah to soften the effect of his words . ( She was to learn later that Tirpitz , for the past fifty years , had exercised every morning : sit-ups , push-ups , barbells , leg weights . " The body is an instrument by which we can approach God , " Tirpitz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took her to dinner , and arranged for one of his most trusted servants to stay at Leah 's hotel with Germaine ( even so , Leah worried : she had become , since the birth of this extraordinary child , an almost fussy mother who felt vaguely that something was missing from her own body , an arm or a leg or at least a finger , when her child was out of the room : and then Germaine seemed to aid her so , simply by gazing at her and smiling ) ; he took her to the sailboat races on the Eden River , and to the opera , and to the private reception that followed the presentation of a medal to the visiting Emperor of Trapopogonia by Governor Grounsel on the third night of the Exposition ( the emperor , whose kingdom was east of Afghanistan , disappointed Leah by resembling Hiram , and by speaking an almost accentless English  --  though she was naturally flatteredby his warmly appreciative remarks to her ) ; he arranged for the three of them to explore the Exposition early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing out exhibits that were of more than ordinary interest ( engines ; rockets ; calculating machines ; the City of the Future with its moving sidewalks and robot-servants and controlled temperaturesand handsome manikin-people ; the Hospital of the Future where blood , sperm , tissues , bones , and every organ  --  including the brain  --  would be stored , and would be available for patients ) , and ending the tour with the Tirpitz Pavilion , which was of course his own , and which both Leah and Germaine loved best : a five-acre jumble of marvels that included painted and bejeweled baby elephants ; a white marble fountain with hundreds of tiers that sent out spray in a dizzying variety of forms ; a killer whale named Beppo in a green-tinted transparent tank ; a small mountain of orchids of the most extraordinary subtlety and beauty ; Egyptianand Mesopotamian statuary ; the Zodiac , in diamonds , fixed to a , black velvet covering ; a life-sized and amazingly lifelike Abraham Lincoln who intoned , in a grave , gentle , but forceful voice " The Emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Amazon region that , with their yard-wide petals and the steel-spring trap of their jaws , ate and digested not only insects but mice and birds fed to them by attendants . . . . And there wits snore , much mote . so : nu ( h snore thatp209Leah 's head swam , and she felt the drunkenness of euphoria without having tasted ( for it was n't yet noon ) a single drop of alcohol . " Mr. Tirpitz , " Leah said , laying her white-gloved hand on his arm , " what is the theme of your pavilion ?  --  what is the connection between all these wonderful things ? " " Ca n't you guess , Mrs. Bellefleur ? " " Guess ! Ca n't I guess ! Oh , I 'm no good at guessing , Mr. Tirpitz , my children are far sharper , if only Bromwell were here  --  you 'd adore Bromwell , I think  --  I 'm no good at guessing . What is the connection ? " " But , Mrs. Bellefleur , " Tirpitz said , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " surely you can guess . " Yet she could not . So Tirpitz turned to Germaine , and squatted before her , and asked if she could guess ; and the child  --  hardly more than a baby , with the baby fat still plumping out her cheeks  --  stared at the old man with her tawny green-bronze eyes , as if gazing into his very soul , and said in a small , shy , but unfaltering voice : " Yes . I can . " Tirpitz laughed . He straightened , with some awkwardness ( for the small of his back ached ) , and at once changed the subject , grasping both Leah and Germaine by the hand , leading them on , for now it was nearly time for the Exposition to open to the public , and they must escape before the hordes descended . " I find it very hard to breathe in the air of crowds , do n't you , " he said . The evening before Leah was scheduled to return to Bellefleur Manor she was invited to Tirpitz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , Tirpitz promised , they would discuss the Bellefleurs ' financial situation . Quite by accident  --  it really was an accident , he insisted  --  he knew a little about the geology of the Chautauqua region , and the iron ore and titanium deposits east of Contracoeur ( titanium !  --  Leah had never heard the word before ) , and would like very much to discuss the plans for several mining operations Leah had mentioned . Leah had been almost girlishly pleased by his tone , and did not mind his flirtatiousness ( " Ah , but I dread to ask how much money you and this charming daughter of yours want ! " he said , and Leah said quickly , " Not what we want but what we need , Mr. Tirpitz , " and he said , " For the maintenance of that enormous estate in the mountains , and to finance your husband 's expensive tastes in horses ? " and Leah said , " He 's sold all his horses , and the estate maintains itself  --  it almost maintains itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that , dear Mrs. Bellefleur ! " ) and his paternal habit of seizing her hand and rubbing it briskly between his own . ( As if Leah 's strong , blunt-fingered , overheated hand needed warming ! ) She ( lid not mind , even , the old man 's swell  --  an indefinable odor , crisply at orbit as the ail of an atilt whin h pigeons have befouled for det ; ides , and then again ( It ) and tough as old par ( tanu  --  nt ; and then again ( when he firstp210greeted her , when he had just left his rooms ) oily-sweet from the French cologne he dabbed liberally on himself . So she prepared to meet him in his suite on the nineteenth floor of the Vanderpoel , dressing herself in her most charming outfit ( which Tirpitz had already seen once , but Leah could n't help that )  --  an oatmealcoloredsilk dress with a many-layered skirt , a black velvet hat upon whose fashionably sloped brim three blood-red multifoliate roses bobbed , long black gloves with simulated black pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-size too small ( for she was vain about her large hands and feet , and took no comfort from Gideon 's insistence , in the early days of their marriage , that a woman of her statuesque proportions would look peculiar with smaller hands and feet ) ; and she carried her silk parasol , which matched the dress . It upset her , even so , to leave the baby behind  --  though Mr. Tirpitz had sent over the same servant , a middle-aged Scots woman with a happy disposition and a special love , as she said , for baby girls ; she halfway wondered if Mr. Tirpitz would mind if she brought Germaine with her . . . . Odd , it was odd , Leah thought , kissing Germaine goodnight , how much she depended upon this child : how little she concerned herself with the others ( she had to make an effort to recall , precisely , the twins  --  though Christabeland Bromwell were hardly twins now ) , as if , when gazing at Germaine , she forgot the others entirely . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bellefleurs . She seemed to draw energy from the baby , much as the baby had drawn energy from her , sucking the warm rich sweet milk from her breasts with a sensual rapacity that had been rather wonderful while it lasted ... . " Goodnight ! Be good , dear , and go to sleep at once ! Oh , I love you , " Leah whispered , hugging the baby , and not minding that in her excitementthe baby grabbed at the cloth roses , and nearly tore one off the hat . " I 'll be back by midnight . " Germaine kicked , and fussed , and threatened to cry ; but Leah wasfirm . " Go to sleep at once . " On her way out Leah heard Germaine starting to cry , but she paid no attention , and took the stairs down to the street floor , being too impatient for an elevator , and walked the several blocks to the Vanderpoel . There , a silent black man in uniform took her up in a cagelike elevator to Mr. Tirpitz 's suite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth floor ) , and another servant , also in livery , but Oriental rather than black , let Leah into the parlor . She exclaimed aloud  --  there were orchids everywhere  --  vases and vases of orchids  --  white orchids , lavender orchids , orchids of a subtle creamy-blue shade  --  she had never seen anything so beautiful . She was seated in a comfortably overstuffed chair , and the young Oriental man brought her a drink on a silver tray , which he put down on a table before her . Lcah snatched up the drink at once and took a sip . Bourbon , so far as she could tell it was good bourbon , though she wasn'tp211a connoisseur like most of the Bellefleurs ; but it was precisely what her nerves required . The servant disappeared . She was left to herself . She waited , gazing at the orchids , wondering if Mr. Tirpitz owned an orchid plantation  --  but surely he did  --  surely he owned a great many things . Not long ago uncle Hiram had spoken of Tirpitz , had mentioned the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she could not recall exactly . How amazed Hiram and the others would be when she returned with Tirpitz 's support for the Contracoeur mines !  --  how amazed and envious and jealous Gideon would be ( Gideon . But she would not think of Gideon . She rarely thought of Gideon , and never when she hoped to enjoy herself . ) She sat , and drank the bourbon , and waited , and after some fifteen minutes of waiting she began to get restless , and happened to see  --  but had the Oriental boy mentioned it , in his shy cold murmur ?  --  an envelope on the silver tray . Mrs. Bellefleur was scrawled in red ink on its front . She snatched it up at once and tore it open . And read these words , which had been scrawled in the same dark red ink , in the same loose hand : Leah dearest , we are one of a Kind are nt we , I know you inside-out &; know you know me , if you step into the next room I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sear certianly you will make me very happy &; will return I promise to the barbarian Bellefleurs in great TRIUMPH ! ! ! ! ! Leah let the card slip through her fingers , whimpering with the surprise  --  the shock  --  the distress of it . She got to her feet , and fumbled to set down the glass ; and then brought it up to her lips again and swallowed a large mouthful of bourbon . Her face flamed . She finished the drink . Let the glass fall . Started for the door , almost tripping in her long skirt . Paused . You filthy old son of a bitch , she whispered , you buzzard , I could pick you clean , I could suck the marrow from your bones . . . . She set her hat straight on her head . Stood there , gazing into a mirror , wondering at the red-faced angry woman she saw there . The bastard , she whispered . I will tell Gideon . She thought of Jean-Pierre imprisoned , for a crime  --  for crimes  --  he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw the magnificentwilderness kingdom taken from her family , piece by piece , tract by tract , over the centuries . If Germaine were here . . . If Germaine were here it would be so simple to hug the child to her , to weep into the child 's neck . Where have you come from , who are you , why were you sent , what must I do .... " There were times when , embracing Germaine , and gazing into her eyes , Leah saw , somehow saw  --  as if it were a dream of the previous night she was able , only now , to summon to consciousness  --  what must be done.  |p212The  hotel room was empty except for the overstuffed furniture and the orchids . Everything was silent ; street noises did not rise so high . There was Jean-Pierre , now an elderly man , pining away in a prison cell ... there was the hideous massacre at Bushkill 's Ferry . . . the humiliation of the public auction when Noel and Hiram were boys . . . the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle parts , over the years . How real that was , all of that ! And how unreal Leah Pym suddenly felt . She paused , halfway to the door . Looked back to the glass lying on the carpet , and the card , that rectangular piece of white cardboard , lying beside it . Swallowed , pressed both hands against her burning cheeks , stared . If I could see into the future , she thought in dismay , I would know exactly what I must do ... .  |p213The  day Yolande ran away from home , never to return  --  never to return to Bellefleur Manor  --  was also the day of Germaine 's first birthday . But was there any connection between the two events . . . ? On that dry , warm , relentlessly sunny August day , when no breeze blew across Lake Noir , or down from the mountains , there was to be a large birthday party in the late afternoon , to which Leah had impulsively invited all the young children in the area , and their mothers  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( And she invited the Renauds , whom she rarely saw now , and the Steadmans and the Burnsides , and even wrote out an invitation to the Fuhrs which , when she reread it , struck her as humiliatingly meek : so she discarded it . ) In her enthusiasm over seeking out financial and political support for the family Leah had quite neglected people close to home ; she had not even thought of them for months . Please come to help us celebrate the first birthday of our darling Germaine , she wrote gaily . At teatime there would be a huge square chocolate cake with pink frosting and GERMAINE 1 YEAR OLD in creamy vanilla letters , and an entire table and a stone bench heaped with presents , out back on the terrace ; there would be paper hats and noisemakers and surprise treats for the younger children , and champagne for everyone else , and even musical entertainment ( Vernon planned to play his flute , while Yolande and Vida danced , costumed in long dresses and veils and feather boas dragged out of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to lead his young Irish setter through the complicated tricks he had taught the dog over the sunttne r hope to have a marvelous tnne and we hope yott rent join uc ! But l'olande and Christahel planned a sn-.tllet Ihit thday t eleln anon , in one of the children 's Ircrct ulaces on the bank of Mink Creek ( thep214Bellefleur children , in every generation , had " secret " places  --  in passageways , in nooks and crannies and cupboards and cubbyholes , in haylofts , beneath the floorboards of abandoned barns , behind evergreens , behind boulders , up trees , on roofs , in ice-tunnels ( in winter ) , in manor towers whose floors were strewn with the skeletons of birds and bats and mice , in the old " Roman bath " their elders presumed was safely boarded up ) ; they had nagged Edna into allowing them to bake and frost some cupcakes , and they had stolen from the kitchen larder ' a half-dozen ripe peaches and some sweet black cherries and a pound of rum-flavored chocolates from Holland . Yolande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a box of kitchen matches from Edna 's stove . What a lark it would be , with no adults  --  with no Leah  --  hovering near ! So at midmorning they took Germaine out to play in the garden as usual , but they soon crept away through the gate at the rear , each of them holding her by the hand . They would hurry to Mink Creek , to a pretty little cove a short distance from the lake , where the creek emptied into the lake , and there  --  seated on pine logs , protected from the sun by low-hanging willow branches  --  they would have their own private birthdaycelebration , and no one would know . ( A noisy gang of boys  --  Garth and Albert and Jasper and Louis , and a visiting cousin from Derby , Dave Cinquefoil  --  were swimming off the Bellefleur dock , but they could n't see the girls ; and Leah and Lily and Aveline and grandmother Cornelia were being fitted for their fall clothes , by a dressmaker and her assistant from the Falls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a special day , Germaine , " Yolande said , stooping to kiss the child . " It 's your first birthday and it will never come again . . . . Do you know , a year ago you were n't born yet ! And when you were born you were just a baby , a helpless little baby , nothing like you are now ! " Germaine had grown into a sturdy toddler , large for her age  --  very pretty  --  with red-brown curls and a small snubbed nose and those amazinggreen-bronze eyes , whose fabled luminosity varied : in the candlelit shadows of Leah 's bedchamber they frequently glowed with a discomfortingintensity , but in the ordinary glare of midmorning sun they appeared no more striking than Yolande 's and Christabel 's eyes ( for Yolande and Christabel were also extremely attractive ) . Germaine was a baby , still , and yet more than a baby . She was intermittently and unpredictably precocious : she knew many words , but would not always say them . Then again she could be a terrible infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking and thrashing about . It was observed widely that she behaved well when Leah was not present , but no one dared tell Leah that . Yolande was of the opinion that she could be Germaine 's mother , and that Germainewould be far better off . ( " Your mother is always fussing over Germaine , she 's always kissing and hugging and talking to her , talking some kind of private baby talk , she 's always looking at her  --  that would drive me wild ! " Yolande told Christabel . She does n't look at me , " Christabelsaid weakly. )  |p215ness  "  --  when her gaze deepened but seemed unfocused , and her baby 's face shifted into impassivity . At such times there was a stubborn Bellefleurset to her pursed lips ; she would not respond to kisses , queries , love pinches , or even little slaps . She disturbed the servants by coming up silently behind them . She discomforted one of the dogs by staring into his eyes . Sometimes she left off playing , and was to be seen perched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , in the garden , with her elbow on the table and her chin in her hand , her expression still and sad and prematurely melancholy . In the nursery one morning she astonished Irene by babbling excitedly , " Bird  --  bird  --  Bird  --  " and pointing to the window , not five seconds before a small bird  --  it must have been a warbler  --  slammed into it and fell , its neck broken , down into the shrubbery . Once Garth hitched up the old pony cart to the last pony on the estate , a gentle , rather lazy Shetland with faded brown markings , and watched over Germaine and Little Goldie as they rode squealing with delight around the weedy track ; and he claimed that the baby put her hands to her ears and shut her eyes tight a few seconds before the pony trotted over a rock that flew up into the cart 's axle and nearly overturned it . . . . ( On the eve of her birthday Germaine was reluctant to be put to bed , and behaved quite disgracefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to shake the child and cry , No , you do n't , no , you 're bad , you 're deliberately and shamelessly bad and you know better and I wo n't tolerate it !  --  and bundle her off , still kicking , to bed . She thrashed about , she threw her pillow out of the crib , she wailed , and held her breath , and choked and sputtered and spat , and threw a tantrum lying down , as Leah watched , biting her lip , but making no move to interfere  --  for she would n't be manipulated  --  and then finally , after an interminable period , Germainegrew tired , and the wails were sobs , and the sobs faint petulant gasps , and suddenly her eyes were closed , and she slept . But within an hour she was awake again , screaming more violently than ever , and when Leah rushed to her she was sitting up in bed , her skin clammy , her pajamas soaked with sweat , babbling about fire  --  she clutched at Leah and fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire  --  in a voice so terror-stricken that Leah 's heart nearly failed . She comforted the baby , and changed her , and brought her to bed in the big bed ( for Gideon was away on business that night , he hoped to return by teatime the following day ) , and after Germaine fell asleep Leah put on a dressing gown and wandered about the manor , too frightened to sleep , convinced that there might be a fire  --  there had been fires enough in the old days  --  and that Germaine had smelled the smoke or in some way seen the fire  --  or had foreseen it  --  But of course there was nothing . And when Leah returned to her bed at 4:00 A.M. she found her daughter sleeping deeply and plat idly as any one-year-old . The girls were in their secret cove only a half-hour when they were joined by twin ginger kittens , about seven weeks old , but unusually long-bodied ,  |p216delight  : the kittens were petted , hugged , kissed , fed cupcake crumbs , and allowed to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , how they tickle ! Are n't they silly ! Just look  --  the way they knead their paws and shut their eyes and purr , sucking at nothing at all ! " she cried ) , and finally to drop off to sleep in Yolande 's and Christabel 's laps . And then the boy appeared . No , first he threw a rock  --  a large rock that splashed in the creek only a few feet from where Christabel sat . The girls screamed , and then Yolande shouted , " Damn you , go to hell ! " thinking it was one of the Bellefleur boys . But it was a stranger : the boy in overalls with the cloth cap on his head : and he had the same jeering moronic grin as he came splashing along the creek , bringing his feet down with exaggerated force . He jumped up on the bank , and seized one of the kittens . Holding it against his chest he petted it roughly , and puckered his lips , and said Kitty , nice kitty , kitty-kitty-kitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You put that kitten down ! That 's our kitten ! " Yolande said . The boy ignored her . His expression was flaccid and self-contained , as if he were alone . " Do n't you scare that kitten , " Yolande said faintly . Christabel had scrambled farther up the bank , hugging herself ; Germainewas sitting in the grass , a messy half-eaten peach in her hand . Yolande got slowly to her feet , staring at the boy . She was very frightened . But angry too . " You do n't have any right to be here , " she whispered . The boy looked at her for the first time . His eyes were small , mudbrown , moist . On his forehead were premature lines , which deepened with mock concern . " You got no right to be here , " he said . He reached up to tug the cap down more tightly on his forehead , still holding the kitten against his chest . It had begun to struggle wildly . Then Christabel asked nervously if he 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  would he like some candies  --  and the boy turned from Yolande to Christabel , his expression still impassive . " Candies , " he said , approaching Christabel , his mouth opening , his ugly tongue protrudinglike a dog 's , so that she understood he wanted the chocolates put in his mouth . Which she did , with a thin little giggle . The boy chewed two candies , frowning , then spat them out  --  spat them into the creek without bothering to lean over , so that the mess dribbled on his trouser legs. " . . . kinda shit is that . . . trying to poison me . . . " he muttered . " Those are good candies ! Those are from Holland ! " Yolande cried . He took hold of Christabel by the hair and pulled her to the creek bank and pushed her off , and she fell splashing in two or three feet of water . " You want to come swimming too ? " he asked Yolande . " You and the baby ? Eh ? Take oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you dare come near nte , " Yolande said.  |p217He  stared at her , and smiled slowly , revealing his tobacco-stained teeth . Yolande saw that he was Garth 's age but that something was wrong , something was terribly wrong with him . " You want to take off your clothes , eh ? And get in the creek with me ? All of us , eh ? Come on ! Hurry up ! I know your name , missy , " he said softly . " It 's Yolande . " " Go home , " Yolande said , her voice shaking . " You should n't be here , you 'll get into trouble . If you go home now we wo n't tell ... " " You get out of here , " the boy said to Christabel , who was trying not to cry , " and take the baby with you . Go on  --  get ! I do n't want no crowd here . " " Please , " Yolande said , " leave us alone .... " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off our clothes and go swimming ! " Germaine had begun to make faint sounds , whimpering , gasping , as she pushed herself backward on the grass . The boy , peering at her , stood very still for a long moment , the kitten crushed against his chest , and then said , " Get her out of here ! I do n't want no baby here ! I do n't want no bawling baby here ! " Yolande picked Germaine up to comfort her , and Christabel hurried to crouch behind them . Her bare legs streamed water and her teeth had begun to chatter . " D' you hear what I said , you ! you there ! " the boy said to Christabel . " Take that baby and get the hell out of here ! I do n't want no goddamn bawling baby here ! Or I 'm going to do this to all of you , " he said , making a sudden gesture as if he were twisting the kitten 's head off . When the girls screamed he grinned at them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gesture again , his hand cupped about its head  --  and again the girls screamed , and Germaine began to shriek . He laughed at their distress , but a moment later was irritated by it , and said , raising his voice to be heard over the baby 's terrified wails , " You 're making me mad ! You do n't want to make me mad ! Yolande Bellefleur , you do n't want to make Johnny mad ' cause I know your name and I know how to get you  --  Yolande Bellefleur , Yolande Bellefleur -- you want something nice to stuff your pussy with ? Better shut up that baby  --  " But the baby continued to cry . And Christabel , crouched behind Yolande , had to press her hand against her mouth to keep from sobbing . " I ca n't stand no bawling , " the boy said . " Y'want me to do this to you all  --  " Again he made the twisting gesture ; but this time he did twist the kitten 's head . It made a single hideous ear-piercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he swore , and threw it out into the creek as lightly as he might have thrown a stone : it sank into the swiftflowingcurrent in the center , a small hurtling scrap of orange , sinking immediately from sight . It had all taken place so quickly the girls could not grasp what had happened . This terrible boy had wrung the kitten 's neck , he had thrown it into the c t ( ' ek .... And what was he saying about the baby , taking the baby away , what did he want with Yolande ....  | " We could go swimming . Or we could go over there , " the boy said , indicating with a jerk of his head an abandoned barn on a rise nearby . " Just you and me , Yolande . I do n't want none of them others . . . . Y'want me to twist all your heads off ? Eh ? Better stop bawling ! " Clearly he too was frightened . His young voice rose and fell with anguish , with daring , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stomping , bringing the heel of his boot down hard near the girls ' feet , as if he were teasing a dog . He touched Yolande 's hair . His fingers closed in her hair . A kind of radiance broke across his face  --  his ugly smile faded  --  he simply stared at her . After a long moment he said , in a low , broken voice : " . . . that barn over there . . . just you and me ... just for a few minutes . . . . Yolande . . . . Yolande Bellefleur . . . . Just for a few minutes .... " " Barn ! What barn ! Where is there a barn . . . " Yolande whispered . The boy pointed . She laughed , turning , shading her eyes . There was a barn nearby . One of the old hop-curing barns . It was badly rotted now , on the brink of collapse : moss of a bright lurid green grew on the sagging roof ; even a few tiny maples nested there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yolande said . He tugged at her hair . Hard . Then a little harder . He did his angry dance-step again , nudging Yolande 's foot . And nudging her with his knee . Like a puppet she did not resist : she did not even cry out when his fingers yanked her hair . " Y'want me to come back here sometime , at night , I could come back at night , and wring all your heads off , all the goddamn fucking Bellefleur heads , wring ' em off and throw ' em in the creek , " the boy said softly , bumping against Yolande . " Y'want me to ... " " No , " said Yolande . " No . It 's all right . I 'll go with you . " " You 'll go with me ? " " Christabel , " said Yolande , in an unnaturally high voice , " take the baby home . Take the baby home and stay there . It 's all right . I 'll go with him . It 's all right .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , doing what he says . Then everything will be all right . Do you understand ? " She understood . She seemed to understand . Though Germaine was clearly too heavy for her , she even tried to carry her for a few yards ; then she lowered the baby to the ground and walked her along . Smiling , her face wet with tears , Christabel waved goodbye to Yolande and the boy . And Yolande waved back . The boy was standing close beside her , his fist still closed in her hair . He was very tall . He had pulled the cap down so tightly on his forehead that his head looked too small for his body .. Christabel was to remember that cap  --  it was gray , with a faded initial  --  black , or deep red  --  and its visor was frayed . She was to remember the boy 's queer twitching grin and his moist eyes and the agitation of the air about them , as if they were standing on a violently rocking surface . And Yolande 's posture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible  --  her calmness ! Jaws set rigid so that her teeth would not chatter , eyes opened wide in a doll 's paralyzed stare " Goodbye ! I 'll be along in a while ! Take care of Germaine ! Stop her crying ! It 's all right ! It 's all right ! " Yolande shouted . Of course Christabel ran for help , dragging the baby along . She ran to the lake , where the boys had been swimming ; now most of them were on the dock , partly dressed . Garth was the first to hear her screaming . It seemed that someone had hurt Yolande  --  or was with her now  --  trying to throw her in the creek ?  --  drown her ? Or were they in one of the barns  --  ? The boys ran along the creek , found no one at the cove , climbed the hill to the barn , and discovered , there , Yolande and the boy  --  Yolande 's dress was ripped from her shoulders , her small white breasts were exposed , her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Help me ! She pushed her way free of the boy , who cowered back , his face sagging with astonishment : he stared at Garth and Albert and Jasper and the others as if he could not believe what he saw . Garth recognized him as one of the Doans  --  the son of one of the Bellefleurs ' tenant farmers  --  and stooped at once to pick up a sizable rock . Do n't let him out ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Yolande was screaming . Though Garth would not have required her help she seized his arm , tore at him , pushed him forward , even struck his shoulder with her fist . Oh , kill him ! she screamed , her snarled hair in her face , Do n't let him live ! Which is what happened . Within ten minutes the barn was in flames . One of the boys tossed a lighted match , and the barn exploded in flames . ( But which of the boys did it ? Jasper claimed to have seen his brother Louis strike a match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Garth was certain he 'd seen Dave , but Dave , turning his pockets inside out , claimed that he never carried matches in his trouser pockets , only his shirt pocket , and his shirt was back on the dock : he halfway thought he 'd seen Albert throw the match . ) They bombarded the Doan boy with rocks , yelling and hooting , two of them at the doorway of the barn , the others at the windows , pelting him with rocks ( some of them so heavy they could barely be thrown ) and stones and pebbles and chunks of dried mud and cow manure , and even branches , and old rusted parts from farm machinery , anything they could get their hands on , anything that might have weight enough to give pain . Yolande , in a frenzy , the bodice of her dress still hanging torn about her hips , ran from window to window , throwing rocks , screaming in a voice no one had ever heard before . Oh , kill him ! The filthy thing ! The filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the forehead and cheek , whimpering , the Doan boy instinctively ran to a corner , and crouched there , his hands protecting hisp220neck , his entire body shaking ; but Garth , leaning in a window , was able to bring something down on his back directly  --  something rusty and pointed  --  and a stream of blood leapt out and soaked through his coveralls . And then , within seconds , the barn was in flames . It was odd , it was very odd , afterward a number of the boys considered how odd it was , that they had n't run into the barn after him  --  for some reason they had stayed outside  --  they had contented themselves with attacking him at a distance  --  as if they had known it might be dangerous to follow him into the barn . The boy tried to escape from the burning barn , on his hands and knees , in the very doorway of the barn he crawled , and they pelted him with rocks , jeering and hooting , and he fell back , disappeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very air crackled with heat ; and from out of nowhere ( unless the creature had been sleeping up in the loft , and had hidden there during the stoning ) there appeared , again in the doorway , a skinny yellow hound , maddened with terror , its fur licked with flames , a mutt none of the boys had ever seen before , obviously a stray , and quite spontaneously they stoned it , and drove it back , and they could see it bounding , in flames , from side to side , and they could hear its pain-crazed cries for some minutes  --  until at last it was silent . They backed away from the burning barn , suddenly exhausted . " That dog , " said Yolande tonelessly . " Where did that dog come from ... The fire burnt noisily , great billowing clouds of smoke rose into the air , and the orangish flames towered above the tallest of the trees . " I did n't see any dog , " one of the boys said . " There was a dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I saw a dog . I do n't know where the hell it came from . " They backed away , panting , wiping their faces . In all the vast landscapethere was nothing so mesmerizing , so eerily beautiful , as the flaming barn . " The stupid dog , to be in there with him , " one of the boys muttered . " . . . deserved it . " " I did n't see any dog , " another boy said . " Oh , he was in there , all right , " another said . " He 's still in there . "  |p223In  that twelve-foot-high granite tower three storeys above the garden ( which , in the autumn , was noisy with the labor of workers ) Bromwell chattered absentmindedly to his baby sister , not showing the queer half-painful excitement he felt when she so avidly , so eagerly , aped his words and even his gestures ( as if , at the age of fourteen months , she were already greedy for knowledge  --  for his knowledge  --  and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years later as he rose from his seat , unconsciously pressing his somewhat bent wirerimmedglasses against the bridge of his nose , hearing enumerated , in an English quaintly and brusquely accented , the dimensions of his " prodigious " ( an adjective from the popular press , one Bromwell would have scorned had he even known of it ) achievements in the young field of molecular astronomy , he was to see again , and to hear again , for a fraction of a fraction of a wondrous second , the night sky cold as a knife blade above Bellefleur Manor , and his own high-pitched rambling voice . Cassiopeia , Canis Major , Andromeda . And there is Sirius . ( And the baby would repeat , almost accurately , Sirius . ) But only in our language , Germaine . And only in our galaxy . And only from this position in our galaxy . Do you understand ? Yes ? No ? Of course you do n't understand because no one does . And here : Ursa Major . ( Ursa Major , said the child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that crude tower above the garden ( whose stained , crumbling statuary was being hauled away , heaped in the back of a truck , at last  --  what an eyesore that crowd was , Leah exclaimed , what a graveyard ) Bromwell , surprisingly , " watched " his baby sister ; and competed with Christabelfor the opportunity . " Ittt Ire 's no fun , he does n't play with her , he never takes her outside , even , " ( : hristabel said angrily ; " it 's always that damn old telescope of his , and those skeletons , and butterflies , andp224twaddle he 's fished out of books  --  do you even know what it smells like up there , Mamma ? Why do n't you go and investigate ! " Leah , of course , had no time for such things . And since the day when Jasper and Louis broke into Bromwell 's laboratory to release the muskrats , mourning doves , grasshoppers , frogs , and garter snakes he 'd been keeping there for experimental purposes ( his old laboratory on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bromwell made certain , through an elaboratesystem of locks , wires , and levers , and a secret " eye " in the steelboundoak door , that no one could intrude , whether to vandalize or merely investigate . " Your son is growing increasingly eccentric , " aunt Aveline told her brother Gideon , of whom she had once been extremely fond . " Do n't you and Leah care that he hides himself away from everyone , that he 's experimenting on live creatures , and mixing chemicals , and looking through that microscope all hours of the night ? " Gideon , who had taken to ignoring most of his family now , with the exception of his brother Ewan , shrugged one shoulder in passing and said , " Telescope . Not microscope . You half-literate bitch . " Though Bromwell was ill at ease in the presence of the other children , he chattered away companionably with Germaine , despite  --  or perhaps because of  --  the difference in their ages . He enjoyed bringing her up to the third floor , to the tower on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him weatherproof with strips of old asbestos siding they had found in an untidy heap in one of the barns ; he enjoyed watching her walk in her quick , halting , thought-absorbed manner , her pudgy arms extended like a sleepwalker 's , her eyes glittering with that peculiar ravenous yearning , as if she knew ( as Bromwell surely did ) that the visible universe was filled with wonders greatly nourishing to the soul  --  if only the soul opens itself , unresisting . The mystery of the world , one of Bromwell 's early masters said , is its comprehensibility . So Bromwell puttered about , sketching in pencil the trajectories of certain planets and carnets and runaway stars ; making notations in his neat , rigorous , spidery little hand ; describing flagelliform orbits that crossed and recrossed the familiar solar system with a whimsicality of their own . ( From which Bromwell learned , as the years slowly passed , audacity as well as humility . ) Though Germaine was hardly more than a baby , and certainly too young to understand , he was buoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her listening , and spoke aloud any number of things as they came to mind : How can the rest of them remain satisfied with what the eye can seize , unmagnified ! How can they live so crudely ! Never asking the most obvious questions , Are the past and the future contained in the sky , is there a " single moment " throughout all the galaxies , will it be possible someday to measure God ( when the proper instruments are available ) , why does God delight in motion , is God contained not only in the ( Universe as it exists at this moment , but in its past and /inure as well . . . ? Never asking , 117iere does the ( ' nivene end , when did it begin , f it 's an Island what surroundsp225if it began 20 billion years ago what preceded those 20 billion years , is it dead or is it alive , is it alive and pulsing , do its components mate with one another , can I contain them all in my mind . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and revealed to Bromwell 's astonished eye a miniature galaxy , diamond-faceted . It might have been the glittering eye of a fly , magnified innumerable times ; or the great sun itself , diminished . At such times he began to breathe lightly and shallowly , and his frail body quaked . ( Indeed , throughout childhood Bromwell was subject to shivering fits , even when the temperature was mild . Your son is too high-strung , he 's too easily excited , members of the family told Leah and Gideon , disapprovingly ; he is n't much of a boy , is he . ) He was hardly three years old before it became evident that his eyes were weak and he needed glasses , rather to his parents ' shame . ( For they , of course , had perfect vision . Their handsome eyes would never require corrective lenses . ) One winter , he and his somewhat older cousin Raphael traded a cold back and forth , like pups or kittens in a single litter , greatly worrying their mothers ( for what if , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was snowbound a month or more every winter , one of the children came down suddenly with pneumonia ? )  --  for both had the look of children fated to die young , without protest . Gideon said roughly of his son that he 'd outlive all of them ; there was no need for the women to fuss . " He just wants answers to his questions , " Gideon said . " Give him answers to his questions and he wo n't need any medicine . " But there was n't a Bellefleur , unfortunately , not even cousin Vernon , who could give Bromwell the answers he required . ( In secret , in his tower , fastidiously polishing the lens of his telescope as he talked to Germaine , Bromwell pushed to the very periphery of his mind the subject of family . The subject of Bellefleur . His imagination simply went dead , his prim little mouth settled into an ironic twist . Family and blood and family feeling and pride . And responsibility , and obligations , and honor . And history . Bellefleur history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the 1770 's , when your **34;7203;TOOLONG , Jean-Pierre , settled in the north country . ... How impatient Bromwell was with such palaver , even as a small child ! He wriggled with embarrassment , hearing grandfather Noel drunkenly reminisce , listening to great-grandmother Elvira recall Christmas celebrations , horse-drawn sleigh races on Lake Noir , weddings ( at which memorable things invariably happened ) between people long dead , of whom no one had heard for decades , about whom no one cared . Even more embarrassing were his own mother 's strident claims : Bellefleur this , Bellejleur that , where 's your ambition , where 's your sense of loyalty , where 's your pride ? Bromwell once fidgeted so in her presence that she took hold of hint by the shoulders of his jacket to give him a little shake , and he shook himself free , wily and graceful as one of the cats , by wrigglingout of the jacket and bounding away , leaving Leah with the bodilessp226jacket in her hands .... Why , Bromwell , what are you doing , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you disobeying me ? His embarrassment shaded gradually into contempt , and his contemptinto a profound , listless melancholy , for he could not escape Bellefleurwithout escaping history itself ; he might belong , then , to a world , but he could never belong to a nation . And then again Bellefleur was passion : passions of all kinds . He had no need to spy on his parents to comprehend the nature of the bond between them . ( For did n't he observe , frequently enough , in nature , such " bonds "  --  male and female mating , and mating , and again mating , their striving bodies locked mechanicallytogether , one usually mounted upon another 's rear ?  --  did n't he hear , all too often , smutty tales of stud horses , bulls , hogs , roosters ?  --  and he had been oddly disturbed by the men 's overloud laughter when someone told of a Steadman ram that had broken into a penned-off flock of ewes and impregnated , within five or six hours , more than one hundred of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other boys it was a rather chilling subject to Bromwell , who approached it as he would approach all things , clinically and fastidiously , with the aid of books acquired through the mail . What was sex ? What were the sexes ? What did " sexual attraction " mean ? He read of certain creatures  --  quahogs , whatever they were  --  who begin life as males , and who turn into females in order to mate ; he puzzled over other creatures who had the ability to change sex within a matter of minutes , male to female to male again , in order to mate ; and then there were the hermaphrodites who , possessing both male and female organs , might mate at any time . . . and in some cases continuously , for the life of the organism . There was a microscopic creature , at home in the warmth of human blood , in which the female lived encased within the male , in perpetual copulation : if Nature held no resistance , , the extraordinary thing  --  it was a fluke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual eccentricities of oysters and sea hares and fish in general were not really eccentric , nor was it a matter of alarm that so much sperm was " wasted "  --  over one hundred million sperms in the ejaculation of the human male , fifty times more in the stallion , eighty-five billion in a single ejaculation of a boar !  --  for each of these evidently wished to populate the world with its own kind . When Bromwell stumbledupon his uncle Ewan straining and heaving and grunting with one of the laundresses in a closed-off downstairs room , or when he happened to see , quite by accident , through his telescope , his own father cupping a young woman 's head in his hand , and bringing it roughly to his bigporedface ( this on a hill above the lake , a mile away ) , or when his cousins showed him the pronged bone of a raccoon 's penis ( they had trapped the - creature down by the creek and castrated it ) , asking him if he had any books that would explain such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , normal ?  --  Bromwell told himself once again that the details of sex were of no significance , for was n't life on this planet clearly a matter of a metabolic current , unstoppable , a fluid , indefinable energy flowing vio/lently through all things from the sea worm to the stallion to Gideon Bellefleur ? Why , then , take Bellefleur as central in nature ? He much preferred the stars . ) I began by hiding in Nature , Bromwell was to write in his memoir , decades later , but Nature is a river that carries you swiftly along . . . . Soon your world is everywhere , and there 's no need to hide , and you ca n't even remember what you were fleeing . Alone among the Bellefleurs his baby sister intrigued him . Leah had forbidden him to experiment with Germaine , but in private he did exactly as he wished . He examined her thoroughly , taking note ( though he had no theory to explain it ) of the curious scar tissue on her upper abdomen , an irregular oval of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and was sadly pleased to discover that it was far , far keener than his own ) ; he tested her hearing , weighed her , made pencil diagrams of her hands and feet , kept a fastidious record of her growth ( which he seemed to know beforehand would be prodigious  --  as his assuredlywas not ) ; spoke with her as he might have spoken to an intelligent adult , enunciating his words carefully , giving her time to repeat them after him , moon , sun , star , constellation , Cassiopeia , Canis Major , Andromeda , Sirius , Ursa Major , Milky Way , galaxy , universe , God .... " You learn fast , do n't you , " he said in satisfaction . " Not like the rest of them . " He was pious and methodical in his experiments , and there was always an air of reverence about him  --  a child who appeared to be , at least at a distance , a somewhat undersized ten , in a knee-length white laboratorycoat , his hair cropped short and shaved up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose as if he 'd been born with them  --  even when what he did was illicit , and would have enraged his mother . Forbiddento dissect animals he nevertheless continued to dissect them , though his interest in biology was quickly ebbing , as his interest in the stars blossomed ; forbidden to experiment with what he called his sister 's " powers " he nevertheless experimented with them , sometimes allowing into his tower , as a control , sweet Little Goldie ( who represented , to Bromwell , the " average " intelligence ) and even the hoydenish , rapidly growing Christabel ( subdued for weeks after the curious and unexplained incident of the barn fire out by Mink Creek , but naturally somewhat restless , and impatient , and likely to taunt her twin if he surrendered , even for a moment , the natural power his superior intelligence allowed him : but Bromwell needed her since she represented the " slightly above average " intelligence ) since she had been born of the same parents as Germaine , and presumably shared genetic inclinations . He oversaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldie thought it ridiculous , to be playing cards with a baby !  --  and noted how frequently Germaine won , or would have won had she known how best to play the ( ads she recrived . Ile had Little Goldin sit across the room and stare without blinking at full-color illustrations in his Elements ofp228Biology , and he queried Germaine , patiently , about what she " saw " Little Goldie seeing ; or he instructed Little Goldie to run somewhere and stare for five full minutes at a distinctive , sizable object ( a water tower , a tree , one of the new cars ) while Germaine , in the tower , twitched and whimpered ( and frequently soiled her diapers ) and tried to say what Little Goldie saw . Her fists paddled , her chin was wet with baby spit , she stammered , and squirmed , and caused the very floor of the room to vibrate with the intensity of her emotion  --  and much of the time ( according to Bromwell 's calculations 87 percent of the time ) she really did " see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed excitedly , one morning , at an empty beaker on a windowsill , not more than five seconds before the beaker was blown off and shattered on the floor , Bromwell instructed her to push off the sill , by her own " powers , " a similar beaker  --  and would have kept the poor child there for hours ( for he had the reptilian patience of an adult to whom time possesses no value except in proportion to what it might reveal , what meager nugget of truth it might suddenly cast up ) had not she reverted , after the first hour , to infanthood , and began screaming and thrashing about so violently that he feared the entire household would rush up his private stairs and break open the locks to his private tower . And then Germaine , whom he needed , upon whom he was so curiously dependent , would be taken from him forever . ... And of course he would be soundly whipped by one or the other or both of his parents . " Do n't cry ! It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embarrassed . It was one of his schemes that , by leading Germaine through a labyrinth of possibilities , reading off the names of villages and towns and cities and rivers and mountains , perhaps even moving her hand about on a large map spread across the floor , perhaps even blindfolding her , he might discover the whereabouts of his missing cousin Yolande ( missing now for several weeks ) . . . and what a coup that would be , how seriously , then , the family must take him , after the failure of numerous search parties and the family 's private detectives ! But at the very sound of the word Yolande Germaine became agitated and would not cooperate . " Maybe you should limit yourself to experimenting with your mice and birds , " Christabel said , looking about the messy tower with her hands on her hips . " Cutting up that poor puppy . . . I remember that poor puppy . . . . Maybe you should let me take Germaine downstairs . She 'd rather play with me , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , " Bromwell said quietly . " It was the runt of the litter , it was born dead , it would only have been buried , I did , not inflict pain upon it , I did not cause its death .... " " Then you should have buried it , you should n't have picked around in its poor little chest , " Christabel said . " Come on , Germaine , honey ! It 's too noisy in the garden , they 're bulldozing in the garden , maybe we could go down to the lake . . . . Or do you want to stay with him ? Ile is n't tormenting you ? "  |p229Germaine  stared up at her , wordless . Christabel was now more than a head taller than Bromwell , and much more solidly built . Her face was tanned and strong-boned ; her breasts had begun to develop ; her legs were lengthening . She carried into the tower an airy flyaway slapdash good humor that exasperated her brother . " Oh , do you really want to stay with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overturned Bromwell 's cardboard map of the solar system , as poor Bromwell reached weakly forward . "  --  what good does it do ? " Might there be , Bromwell wondered aloud , staring deeply into his baby sister 's eyes , fairly drowning in that tawny-green fathomless gaze , a universesimultaneous with this universe in which a world like ours is propelledabout its orbit , now at the aphelion , now at the perihelion , and again at the aphelion , century after century , a shadow-world , a mirrorworld , in which , even now , I stand with my hands pressed between my knees , bending over a child said to be my sister , gazing into her eyes , wondering aloud .... Might there be , there , exact replicas of everything we have here , and would never see , here , without the reality of that other universe , the lead backing of our mirror . . . ? And then of course why would there be merely one universe simultaneous with this ? Why not a dozen , three hundred , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now flying away from one another , flying faster at every moment , each identical with the others ; linked by the identity of material ( dust , sand , crystals , organic compounds of all kinds ) and " life " itself . ... And might there not be , granted the identity of these innumerable worlds , a way of slipping from one to another ... . Germaine held his gaze . She gave him no affirmation , she did not rebuke him . Bromwell woke from his mild trance to hear a horn sounding nearby . Bellefleur noise , Bellefleur " emergencies "  --  a day could not pass without the excitement of a laborer 's injuries , or good news from Leah ( back from one of her trips ) , or a fight among the children , or a visit from friends or business associates or relatives ; or perhaps it was simply someone tapping at the horn of the new Stutz-Bearcat , for the pleasure of making noise . " Ah , well , " Bromwell sighed . " Our universe began with an explosion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human species to rest , so to speak , in violence . . . that is to say , in motion . "  |p230The  **27;7239;TOOLONG clavichord Raphael had ordered built for his wife , Violet , with its walnut keys and ivory , gold , and jet ornamentation : an instrument of astounding beauty which no one ( not even Yolande , who had taken several years of piano ) could play . It was not that the keys stuck , or failed to sound ; or even that the clavichord was out of tune . But anyone who sat before it to play was disturbed by its quivering air of hostility : for it did not want to be played , it did not want to make music . Or perhaps it was simply the Bellefleurs it detested . " We should sell this thing , or give it away , or at least store it in another part of the house , " Leah once said , in the days when she tried to play the musical instruments she found in the manor . " It sounds so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother-in-law merely closed the keyboard , and said : " Leah , dear , this is Violet 's clavichord . It 's too beautiful to move out of this room . " And so it was , and so it remained . Damp mischievous kisses floating in the air , planted firmly against lips at unpredictable times : once as Lamentations of Jeremiah was drifting off to sleep in the rolled-up featherbed Elvira had allowed him ( she had shoved him out of their bed , insisted he sleep on the floor , forbade him to seek out another room since the rest of the family would know they had quarreled ) , so that , startled , wildly elated , he erroneously believed his wife had forgiven him , and was inviting him back not only to her warm bed but to her warm embrace ; another time as the thirty-year-old Cornelia , locked in Raphael 's gloomy library with her stepbrother from Oneida , who was a Presbyterian minister , spread out before her on a desk the scribbled notes she 'd taken , usually late at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence , married into  --  of unspeakable insults and lapses of ' taste and crudenesses not to bep231believed : not a single kiss but many , grinding and sucking playfully all about her face and shoulders and bosom , so that the poor distraught woman went into hysterics and fainted ; still another time as Vernon , walking on the promontory above the lake , in a lovesick trance , his arms crossed behind his back , his head bowed , tried out impassioned singsong lines 0 Lara my love , 0 Lara my soul , how can you wallow in another 's arms , how can you d e n y m y spirit 's chaste love ... and would have fallen into the lake fifty feet below , had not the kisses , angry and hissing and stinging as bees ( and at first poor Vernon believed they were bees ) awakened him .

And there was the matter of Whitenose , young Noel 's bay gelding ( whom Noel had acquired from a stud farm with all the cash he 'd saved from birthdays and Christmases , and had broken  --  with great courage and stubbornness  --  himself ) , who so very clearly saw and shied away from and occasionally reared back from invisible creatures of a menacing nature , that Noel could not reasonably discipline him ; the inexplicable soughing noises in certain rooms of the manor , as if winds were blowing through invisible cornfields ; an odor of fish , rank and irremovable , on the fifteenth-century French embroidered altar frontal Raphael had acquired on one of his rare trips to Europe , and considered  --  for had n't it cost a great deal , at auction in London ?  --  exquisitely beautiful ; and of course there was the matter ( which , outside the family , became the inspiration for many a cruel , spirited gibe in opposition newspapers throughout the state ) of the " phantom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calla , and Juniper counties who had turned out in the hundreds to defeat ( by a narrow margin ) Raphael Bellefleur 's third and last bid for political office ... .

( Which he was to feel well into his 101st year . ) And Louis 's wife Germaine , miles away , down in Bushkill 's Ferry , was susceptible to annoying ticklish dreams that had dimly to do with her brother-in-law ( whom she had n't seen for many years , and whom she did not really remember ) , and which caused her , one night , to unwisely call out Jedediah.

You talk of haunted things , Jeremiah had said sadly , but what of those of us who know themselves haunted things  --  haunted things in human form ?

And just to spite me ! And it 's obvious she is still alive !

But that was hardly a blessing , since the storm was to bring with it a worse problem . And there were , of course , innumerable other vexing things , more and less mysterious , haunted closets and baths and mirrors and drawers , and even a corner of Aveline 's boudoir , and the dust-coated drum made of Raphael 's skin that sometimes made light tapping sounds as if invisible fingers were drumming on it restlessly , and the lavender silk parasol , badly faded and frayed , said to have belonged to Violet , that rolled of its own accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how seriously were they to be taken ? For , after all , as Hiram frequently said , with his bemused skeptical smile , These absurd spirits batten on our credulity . If we stopped believing in them , if , together , unified for once , the entire family stopped believing . . . why , then , they would be powerless !  |p233One  chilly sunny day in early November Leah acquired another baby  --  another girl of questionable parentage  --  for the Bellefleurs . It was a long , ambitious day , which began with a visit to the Gromwell property on the far side of Silver Lake . Though Leah had of course seen the property before , and claimed to have made a thorough study of its financial situation ( which was quite poor  --  the quarry had been losing money steadily for the past six years ) , she insisted on being driven over in the new Rolls-Royce limousine , accompanied by Germaine and Hiram , and a young woman just hired to help with Germaine ( her name was Lissa : she had been hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace Lettie ) . It was a gusty day , and despite Hiram 's disapproval ( he was always fussing and clucking and disapproving of Leah 's whims , like an aging husband ) Leah had bundled her little girl up for winter and taken her along . The child loved rides , she loved to perch atop her mother 's lap and point and chatter and ask questions , which Leah answeredpatiently . It was very important , Leah believed , for a child to learn as much as possible  --  to see as much as possible  --  even at a very early age . " And the important thing is , Germaine , " Leah said , as they were driven through the gate , " that we own this . All this . This is a sandstone quarry  --  I ' 11 have to ask Bromwell to explain to us , exactly what sandstone is  --  and it takes in sixty-five acres , all the way to the Sulphur Springs Road , and we own it now . The papers were signed just last Friday and now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along rutted lanes , for nearly hall an hour ; at one paint I , eah insisted upon getting out and c limbing hallway clown into a pit , poor Hiram , stumbling beneath Gerniaine'sp234weight , in tow . " . . . not much to look at , " Hiram said irritably . " You 'll have a hard time explaining this purchase to Mr. T. " " Nothing I do calls for an explanation , " Leah said sharply , turning her fur collar up . " I 'm not a child . " She unlocked the manager 's office and went inside , bringing Germainewith her . The place was not so dirty as she had feared . An old pulltop desk , its pigeonholes crammed with yellowed papers , a tackeddownstrip of linoleum tile , an army cot , pillowless , with a soiled blanket tossed over it ... . " Well , Germaine , " she said heartily , " here we are ! You wanted this . " Germaine did no more than glance at her . " The Cromwell Quarry . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now  --  ? Well , Germaine , are you pleased ? Did I do well ? " Germaine began to chatter , as if she were a small child , and Leah , not knowing whether to be vexed or amused , waved her away . She ran and leapt and stumbled about the room , greatly excited , while Leah contemplated the situation . It had cost far more than she had anticipated , but the Cromwell Quarry was now theirs ; and soon they would acquire another tract of land , adjacent to this ; and then another ; and another ; until the original holdings were united once again . Perhaps it would take most of her lifetime , Leah thought , and Germaine herself would have to complete the task . Then again , perhaps it would only take a few years , with her luck . There was no doubt about it , Leah had " luck " ; she was possessed by it ; she could make no mistakes . Germaine had clambered on top of the desk , rowdy and naughty as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps would have jumped , had Lissa not hurried into the room to grab her . " Oh , silly Lissa ! " Leah said , laughing . " You behave as if Germaine might hurt herself ! But you should know , my girl , that this child is blessed . " On the way back to Bellefleur Manor they stopped at Della 's house , since Leah had not seen her mother for some time , and both she and Hiram felt an obligation to look in upon poor Jonathan Hecht ( who was , unfortunately , asleep or in a kind of coma during their visit , so that he had n't any awareness of Leah and Hiram peeking in at him : how ill and jaundicedhe looked , and how shrunken his eyes had become !  --  it 's remarkable , Leah whispered to Hiram , that he has lived so long ) ; and she was curious , too , about Garnet Hecht 's baby girl . " But what a strange name , Cassandra , " Leah said , poking a finger at the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling happily , if rather cross-sightedly , " however did poor Garnet hit upon that ? " " The name was my choice , " Della said . " But was n't it some barbarian princess or someone , " Leah laughed , keeping her voice low so that Garnet ( who was in and out of ' the littlep235nursery , flushed , muttering to herself , all in a flurry over Leah 's and Hiram 's unannounced visit ) , " someone who was mute , or was she murdered  --  orboth ? Or did she foretell the future , and no one would listen , and she was murdered anyway ? " " The odd bits and pieces of things you remember from La Tour , " Della said contemptuously . " It might have been better , as I thought all along , for you to have stayed home . Since you did end up someone 's wife , after all . And what good has that expensive education done you ? " " Now , Della , " Hiram said quickly , " you did n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance . " " And you 've never let me forget it , have you ! You and Noel , " Della said , waving rather rudely at her brother . So the visit began awkwardly , and Leah was forced to make cheerful conversation , speaking of anything that flew into her head . Despite her mother 's sour mood , and the faint stench that wafted across the width of the house from Jonathan Hecht 's sickroom , and Garnet 's annoying flutterymanner ( the silly creature was too distracted to do anything more than mumble Thank you , Mrs. Bellefteur when Leah handed her a gift for the baby , she set it down on a cabinet without opening it , a darling crocheted sweater Germaine had outgrown so quickly it was good as new ) , and despite the chill she 'd had out at the quarry , Leah was in excellent spirits . Cassandra was a beautiful if somewhat undersized baby ( and were her eyes crossed , or was Leah imagining it ? ) , and there was nothing so delightful as leaning over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls ! That damp little smile ! Delightful too was the way Germaine was talking to the baby , cooing and burbling in baby language . " Cassandra is a handsome baby , " Leah said , " and she seems to be very healthy , Garnet , are n't you pleased . . . ? She was a few weeks premature , was n't she ? " " I do n't know , I really do n't remember , " Garnet said , blushing painfully . " I . . . I was n't well . . . . Afterward , for a while , I had a fever . ... My memory of that time is n't very good . " " It was an ordeal , a baby so premature , " Della said . " Of course you had a difficult time . But you 're fine now , and so is Cassandra . " " Do you think so , Mrs. Pym ? " Garnet said uncertainly . " Oh , of course , " Leah said , taking both her hands . ( Such tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wonder , Leah thought , the girl could n't find a husband . ) " You 've always been rather thin , you know , I do n't think you look much different than before , and your hair is lovely , if maybe you did something with it up here , on your forehead , otherwise it tends to fall in your eyes ... and your eyes are lovely , Garnet , you should n't hide them ... you should n't always be looking down . But you feel well ? You 've recovered ? " " I ... I think so , Mrs. Bellefleur , " Garnet said slowly . And then she was off again , imagining she heard the teakettle . She put Leah in mind of nothing so much as a startled rabbit . " Why in Christ'sp236name is she always running , " Leah whispered to Della . " It must make you nervous , you always claimed I made you nervous .... " " Garnet is a good girl , " Della said stiffly . " She has suffered . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She checked to see that Germaine was not hurting Cassandra  --  she was leaning over the crib trying to " kiss " her  --  and went to a nearby mirror to remove her hat . " . . . but I 've been negligent , you know , I seem to have forgotten all about Garnet , " she said , " and the poor thing obviously needs help . Since the father of the baby is nowhere to be found . . . . She would make some man an excellent wife , do n't you think ? We should have married her off before this . What a pity ! And what a surprise ! Sweet little Garnet Hecht , getting herself pregnant like that , and so skinny she did n't even show until the seventh month . . . is n't she sly , really . . . . Of course it was just one time , I 'm sure : some farmboy who took advantage of her : or maybe someone from the village . Has she told you , yet , who it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . As if we were going to interrogate her ! " " No one is going to interrogate her , " Della said . " Certainly no one is going to interrogate her , " Leah said , removing the last of her hatpins . " Her tragic little love affair is her own business entirely . And it is n't as if she were a Bellefleur . . . . Of course she 's a cousin of mine , a distant cousin . . . she is , is n't she ? . . . But then everyone is related to everyone else around here , and it means very little . I wish she would trust me , though . She never looks me in the eye , she never seems to be listening , exactly . It 's always been like that between us and I ca n't imagine why . " Leah was amused to see in the mirror , as she turned , her mother and Hiram exchanging an enigmatic glance . " She is a very brave young woman , " Della @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture that maddened Leah , it was so falsely meek , so hypocritically subservient . " I doubt that you 're capable of comprehendingall that Garnet has gone through . " " My pregnancy with Germaine was far worse , " Leah said . " Ten months  --  more than ten months ! And her baby was born early  --  " " It is a very sweet baby , " Hiram said , clearing his throat . " Now do n't you hurt it , Germaine . You do n't want to play so rough  --  " " Germaine , stop that , come over here , " Leah said . " You 're not a little baby any longer and you ca n't climb into that crib  --  why , you 'd crush the poor thing ! She is n't an it , Uncle Hiram , she 's a she . You ought to know better , " she said , nudging him in the ribs . " Yes , yes , of course , a she , the baby is . . . the baby is a she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He moved a few feet away , to stare gloomily into Della 's meager fire , where damp birch logs were burning with an acrid eye-stinging stench . He was a ruddy-faced portly man , handsome in profile , with waxed mustaches that gave off a synthetic odor , and one somewhat clouded eye . Always fastidiously dressed , with his gold watch chain across his vest , and his gold-and-ivory cuff links , he lookedp237how uneasy Della and Hiram  --  sister and brother  --  were in each other 's company . The curse of the Bellefleurs , she thought , was either to be uncommonly close ( though that was a rarity these days ) or estranged for life . The silence between them grew embarrassing , so Leah chattered : about the Gromwell Quarry , about their plans for buying Chautauqua Fruits to join with Valley Products , about the mining operations at Contracoeur .. . " Contracoeur ! " Della said . " I did n't realize we owned land there . " " We 've owned mineral rights there since 1873 , " Leah said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean , Mamma , what sort  --  ? " Leah laughed . " Mineral rights are mineral rights . It 's a highly complicated operation , however , and we need mining engineers , in fact Gideon is meeting with someone in Port Oriskany right now . He 's been working very hard on this , has n't he , Uncle Hiram ? He 's been trying very hard . " " Is he alone ? " Della asked . " No , Ewan is with him . And Jasper . It 's remarkable how quickly Jasper is learning , " Leah said , fumbling in her purse . " I wish Bromwell would take an interest in such things . . . . But of course he 's still quite young , there 's still time , I do n't intend to push any of my children into anything . Do n't you think that 's wise , Mamma ? " Leah may have meant this ironically  --  for certainly Della had wanted to push her years ago , at least away from the Bellefleurs  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how is Gideon , Leah ? " " How is Gideon ? Why , he 's perfectly fine as always , he never changes , " Leah said , shaking a cigarillo out of a package . It was the first time she had smoked one of these things in her mother 's presence , and it rather pleased her  --  pleased and excited her  --  that Della was staring in undisguised alarm . But Leah chose to take no notice of her mother , and went on chattering in a bright amiable voice about the mining engineeringfirm in Port Oriskany , and the alterations she was planning in the house , and the renovations in the garden . " Of course we must move along slowly . There 's the expense , for one thing , and Grandmother Elvirais naturally upset , and it is disorienting . But you 'll be pleased to learn , Mamma , that I 've had most of those ugly old statues hauled away . And was n't it peculiar , Uncle Hiram , how parts of statues were found back in the woods  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods , or down to the lake , evidently by wild animals ! The children kept finding parts for weeks , the younger children were always being fright-ened .... " " Gideon 's well , you say ? And he 's in Port Oriskany right now ? " Della asked . " Mamma , I just now told vou ,  --   --  Leah laughed , picking a bit of tob:uo 011 het t-uKue  --  . " My husband is in supt. ' h health as alnays , and asks to be t ( 'tt Vmbere  --  d to you . Ile 's been working very hard lately .... "  |p238way  ; but Garnet was not yet in sight . " Occasionally we hear rumors . In Bushkill 's Ferry . " " Yes , " Leah said , " Bushkill 's Ferry always did hear rumors about Bellefleur . " " But as long as Gideon is well , and working hard ... " " Of course he 's well , " Leah said irritably. . . and then rumors have to be discounted , " Della said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did you hear about Yolande ? Was that one of the things people were gossiping about ? " " One of the things , yes . " " Ewan and Lily have about given up on her , " Leah said with a sigh . " It 's obvious that she has run away and wants to stay away .... There was a fire in one of the barns , did you know ? And she ran away that night . According to Lily all she took was a change of clothing and some jewelry and twenty dollars in cash , and  --  and this is touching , Mamma  --  a lock of Germaine 's hair . She actually crept into the nursery and cut off a curl , just a tiny one . . . . Poor Yolande , I ca n't imagine why she ran away , why she hates her family so , can you ? There was a fire in one of the barns , one of the unused barns , but I do n't imagine Yolande had anything to do with it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . Bromwell had n't anything to do with it , of course , but I think Christabel did ; but she wo n't talk about it . Imagine  --  a child Christabel 's age , having secrets from her own mother ! " " Does that surprise you , Leah , really ? " Della asked with a dry little twist of a smile . " Oh , Mamma , " Leah said , walking away . She wandered into the sitting room , where the heavy velvet drapes were kept drawn ; she felt quite agitated suddenly . There was something she wanted but she did n't know what it was . Something she wanted badly , and would have . But how would she acquire it ? . . . She found herself staring at the old horsehair sofa with its scalloped back . And the matching chair in which her young cousin Gideon had sat . Staring at her . Staring at her and at Love , perched vigilantly on her shoulder . A wave of nostalgia swept over Leah and she felt , for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office building at the quarry she had been halfdreamingon her feet , but she could n't recall the nature of her dream . How odd it was , how very odd , and unlike her . . . . As her body lost all interest in sexual feeling her mind labored to take it up , frequently out of a sense of obscure obligation , as a distracted Catholic might run his rosary beads through his fingers , and even move his lips in blank prayers , while his mind was empty . So Leah imagined illicit lovers in that smelly little building , lying on that inadequate cot , gasping and clutching at each other . 0 Love . flow I love you .... And then Germaine had nearly toppled to the floor , and Leah had awakened from her trance.  |p239She  woke from her trance now and put all thoughts of Gideon and that beautiful spider Love out of her mind ( for had n't Love been killed long ago , reduced to black glutinous pulp no larger than her fist ? ) , and strode back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve tea . Seeing Leah she stepped backward , her thin foolish face stretched in a hopeful smile . " Mrs. Bellefleur . . . ? " she said , blinking . " Would you care for some ... " Leah bent over the cradle , and picked up Cassandra with such care , the baby hardly gurgled . A thick red-brown coil of hair had come loose on the back of her neck . " I think I 'd like to bring Cassandra back with me to the manor , " Leah said . " She 'd have better care , you know . There would be more children to keep her company . " Garnet stared at her , speechless . All the poor thing could do was nervously pleat her apron in her fingers ! " I said , " Leah murmured , her face flushed , " that I 'd like to bring Cassandra back with me . At least for a while . You do n't object  --  ? " " Leah  --  " Della said . " Garnet , you do n't object ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck dumb . It was as much as Leah could do to brush her gaze across the skinny little thing without bursting into angry laughter . " She 'd have much better treatment with me , " Leah said . " You know that . " No one spoke . The fire blazed up fitfully , then died away . Perhaps the flue was n't completely open  --  the room was filling with damp eyesearingsmoke . Leah hummed into the baby 's joyous face , but Garnet and Della and Hiram stood mute . And then Germaine began chattering : something about baby , baby , something about home , coming home : and Leah glanced briefly up at Garnet ( still pleating her apron in her bony fingers ) and knew that she had won . And was not at all surprised.  |p240Though  Germaine 's great-uncle Jean-Pierre Bellefleur II enjoyed the dubious honor of having his likeness sketched many more times than any other Bellefleur ( even his grandfather Raphael , the surly butt of so many newspaper caricatures ) , and reproduced not only throughout the state but throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellefleur cousin discovered to his horror and chagrin when , opening the Times as he breakfasted in a Mayfair hotel , his eye snagged upon an ugly little headline that had to do with " mass murder " in the States  --  and saw , above the headline , an incongruously detailed , and even rather handsome , pencil sketch of the thirty-two-year-old " Innisfail Butcher " ) in England and France as well , and though the less vicious of these likenesses were actually kept , for a while , by the Bellefleur who was always most fond of Jean-Pierre , his aunt Veronica , in a scrapbook bound in white kid , the only representations of Jean-Pierre that were eventually allowed to remain in the manor were the charming pencil sketch on the nursery wall , and a pencil-and-charcoal sketch , equally charming , but perhaps even more romantic , made of young Jean-Pierre just before his embarkation for Europe at the age of twenty-four , for his abbreviated Grand Tour . ( His mother was later to blame his father , most unfairly , for the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young gentleman forced to return home before his education in culture was complete : He would not have drifted into a life of cardplaying and other forms of idleness , he would not have succumbed to the blandishments of his false friend from Missouri , he would not have been in the notorious Innisfail House on that fateful night , and would not subsequently have suffered his tragic fate , had Jeremiah been more judicious in his managementof the farm , had he been more clear-sighted about the market for wheat ... ! The situ of the falhen , Elvira raged in her grief , are tuned uponp241The sketch on the nursery wall , preserved nicely in a tortoiseshell frame , and rarely subjected to more than an idle glance on the part of the children , showed a sweet-faced child of indeterminate age ( the artist must have been unevenly skilled , for all the children 's lips looked alike , being feminine and rather bee-stung , while their Bellefleur noses varied , and their eyes  --  touched up with tiny white dots  --  looked in some cases preternaturallyadult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the coarse-grained paper ) : he might have been five , or seven , or eight : captured in prayer , his cheekbones prominent , his small but strikingeyes cast upward above his fervently clasped hands and a near-imperceptible ( or did Leah imagine it , having studied the drawing for so long ) smirk . Hung for decades between a square jawed Matilde and a fairly dour Noel , Jean-Pierre II most resembled his nephew Raoul ; the only Bellefleur of either sex who was arguably more " beautiful " than JeanPierrewas Gideon . The second drawing , taken down from the wall by one Bellefleur , hung again by another , taken down again and again hung , in different parts of the manor , at different stages of the luckless man 's career in court  --  and kept , finally , when Germaine was a child , in Leah 's boudoir  --  showed a handsome , rather foppish young gentleman with curled mustachesand hooklike curls on either side of his narrow forehead , his eyes fixed upon the viewer in an expression of tenderness , sincerity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed  --  ! One could not fail to be moved by the sweet set of his mouth , or the nobility of his slightly uplifted chin . This was the young man who was welcome in the finest drawing rooms and clubs in Manhattan , during the period when the Bellefleurs maintained a modest but attractive town house just off Washington Square ; it was said of him by one Manhattan heiress ( admittedly , her father 's fortune was not immense ) that she had never heard any young man of her acquaintance speak so sensitively about music . And during that single season when Veronica Bellefleur took her favorite nephew to the theater , and to the races , and to her friends ' homes in the city and out on Long Island , when it had seemed not only probable but inevitable that he would make a " brilliant " match , he had behaved , according to all witnesses , with exquisite tact , modesty , grace , and charm at all times . If he had a temper , if he occasionally drank too much ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free man , Jean-Pierre seemed incapable of calculating the effect of alcohol on his brain , though he had a great deal of practice ) , or flew into a tantrum over a creased collar or a mislaid cuff link or butter served too hard to spread , no one knew except the Bellefleurs and their servants . The only public trait about him that might be characterized as somewhat odd , which his Manhattan acquaintances remarked upon years later , at the time of the trial , was that he frequently joked about the " doom " of his name .

It was not true that Jean-Pierre had not begun his career of cardplayingbefore the European trip , as Elvira liked to claim ; but his activities at that time , as a young man in his early twenties , with aristocratic habits and pretensions , were fairly innocuous , undistinguished from those of most of his contemporaries among the well-to-do landowners in the Valley . He became a serious cardplayer in Europe when , marooned in a Swiss inn during a week of torrential rains , he acquired certain skills  --  they were not quite tricks  --  from a fellow tourist , a grandfatherly Englishman from Warwickshire , grandmother Violet 's home . ( But Jean-Pierre 's friend claimed never to have heard of the Odlins . ) Before that Jean-Pierre had gamely traveled about from country to country , with oscillating enthusiasm , and varying degrees of head and chest colds , being taken by train , or carriage through Belgium , Holland , the Rhineland , Northern Italy , Baden-Baden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algarve , Athens , Southern Italy , Luxembourg ( a dizzying jumble whose names he could not keep straight , though he made every effort to record them in his diary , and to send postal cards back home giving his impressions  --  usually quite brief  --  of each place , and its art treasures , and " natives " ) , alone for the most part , and humbly dependent upon English-speaking hotel people and guides ; but he was fortunate enough to make a few acquaintances , all of them Americans , and one of them a somewhat older San Franciscoan with whom he rode about on the delightful Brussels streetcars most of one day , in a kind of boyish bliss , shamelessly indulging in his nostalgia for their native land . ( Jean-Pierre spent several days in the company of Mr. Newman , who had Made a fortune in leather back home , and who was courteous enough to murmur that , yes , indeed yes , he had heard of the Bellefleur family by way of his associates in New York City . They had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture or a painting struck them at once , or it never did ; they were bored with madonnas , and religious subjects in general ; the notion of patina alternately amused and bewildered them .

One fine October day they spent an hour or more admiring , from different angles , the impressive Gothic tower of the Hotel de Ville , and wondered if it might be possible to duplicate it back in the States : Mr. Newman knew exactly the place for it , on a Nob Hill avenue ; Jean-Pierre argued for the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan . Their somewhat forced intimacy came to an abrupt end when , in all innocence , Jean-Pierre suggested that the two of them visit a sumptuous brothel not far from their lodgings , and Mr. Newman drew away in silent consternation , clearly too shocked even to protest . ( But how peculiar , Jean-Pierre thought , the man admitted to being thirty-six years old , a bachelor , in every respects " normal " enoughl ) )  |p243After  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were invariably disappointing , guides were clearly out to cheat him , " art treasures " began to repeat themselves ( or had he , poor Jean-Pierre wondered , made a fatal error and reversed his journey , so that he was traversingthe very countries he had imagined he was finished with forever ? ) . Trains were delayed , or did not arrive at all . Bridges were washed out . There was a typhoid scare , and an influenza scare . ( Jean-Pierre himself experienced a gonorrhea scare of fourteen hours , which left him shaken and chaste for many days . ) While waiting out an incessant rain that everyone connected with the inn in which Jean-Pierre was trapped claimed was most unusual , he at least learned , from a similarly disenchantedEnglishman named Fairlie , how to be extremely clever at poker , and even at bridge  --  a talent that was to serve him well in the Powhatassie State Correctional Facility . And then his itinerary was cut short when an expected bank draft did not arrive , and an unexpected telegram of craven apology from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more relief than he showed ( he made it a point of showing , to his family , extreme indignation  --  hinting that he had been invited to dine at one of the " oldest houses in Europe " just when the fateful telegram was delivered ) ; and he settled in to apply himself to learning how to manage the complicated Bellefleur estate ... though it was of course too complicated to be learned by anyone other than a financial wizard ( Jean-Pierre 's idea of a financial wizard was his brother Hiram , who had failed to be admitted to law school  --  who had , in fact , left Princeton without his bachelor 's degree ) . . . and what good did it do , he queried often , to know what course to take when the market fell or soared according to its own whims , and there were unscrupulous men manipulating it , and a man 's fortune had little to do with his intelligence , or his moral worth ? ( For certainly no one was a finer , more tediously " moral " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley had failed , in recent years , so ignominiously as Lamentations of Jeremiah with his " fox farm . " Even the Varrell trash could laugh at them now , Elvira said . ) Jean-Pierre made sporadic journeys to Port Oriskany and Vanderpool , sometimes not even giving as an excuse the matter of " family affairs " ; he made infrequent trips to New York ( for the tall narrow town house at Washington Square South had been sold years before ) ; he began to make a great many trips to Nautauga Falls , Fort Hanna , and other rather rough river towns , and Innisfail  --  Innisfail , some eighteen miles from Bellefleur Manor as the crow flies , but considerably longer ( at least thirty-five miles ) if one took the usual route , the Innisfail and the Old Military roads , and then the unpaved Bellefleur Road up to the lake , as anyone but an Indian or a madman ( so Jean-Pierre 's attorney was tohim , foolishly ) would do . And as Or riding a horse through the pitchhlacknight , along an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and even fearful of horses .. . The night of the nurltiplc murders at Innisfail House , the largest andp244probably the most disreputable of the taverns in the area , Jean-Pierre claimed to have shared a carriage with several passengers , including his new acquaintance from Missouri , Wolfe Quincy , on the trip from Nautauga Falls to Innisfail . He claimed to have gotten a ride back  --  back , that is , to the village of Bellefleur  --  with a peddler whose mule-drawn wagon was heaped with all sorts of goods , but who specialized in barbed wire . ( The peddler was never found , unfortunately . The driver of the carriage claimed not to remember Jean-Pierre on that particular trip , though he 'd seen him previously , on other trips ; nor did the other passengersremember him . But Jean-Pierre 's fervent story was never to waver . ) What precisely happened at Innisfail House between the hours of midnight and two-thirty Jean-Pierre Bellefleur simply did not know . He simply did not know . Eleven men were murdered , one after another . Several were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their throats viciously slashed ; two who died of bullet wounds were also subjected to throatslashings . How it happened  --  how a single murderer was able to do so much , so superhumanly much  --  no one knew . There must have been time for a number of the men to defend themselves , yet it seemed that they did not defend themselves ; even Wolfe Quincy died without putting up much of a struggle . ( That it was unlikely Jean-Pierre was responsible for the killings was underscored by the fact that his friend Quincy was among the victims . Jean-Pierre was extremely fond of Quincy , and dependent upon him as well , for Quincy could hold his liquor far better than JeanPierre , and when they were involved in ambitious all-night games he watched over Jean-Pierre with an almost maternal solicitude . He was a broad-bellied , good-natured man of about forty , originally from Massachusetts , lately from Missouri , an excellent drinking and gambling companionwhose only fault was a tendency toward boasting of his exploits in the War : how many men he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many bullets he had survived ( and judging from the scars he proudly showed the squeamish Jean-Pierre , there were at least half a dozen ) . Quincy was the last man , the last human being on earth , Jean-Pierre 's attorneyclaimed , Jean-Pierre would want dead . ) Which sounded , in the antiquated courtroom with its faint dry echo , not quite right . Jean-Pierre was found guilty of murder in the first degree , despite his innocence , and sentenced by Judge Phineas Petrie to life plus ninety-nine years . . . plus ninety-nine years repeated ten times . Evidence was no more than circumstantial ; the only witness  --  the tavern-keeper 's malicious wife  --  admitted that she was nearly fainting with terror when she saw , from an upstairs window , a single rider galloping away into the night , along a narrow trail leading into the foothills . She could not see the figure , could not of course identify the murderer , but she claimed that ' ' of ' course " it was Jean-Pierre Bellefleur who had , within her hearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had to be ejected from the tavern more than once , because of his wicked temper . All this was slanderous , of course . And Jean-Pierre protested . He had left Innisfail House before midnight and was home by three in the morning . Because he was so exhausted he had slept in a hayloft . . . he had n't wanted to disturb his family . . . perhaps he was somewhat drunk . . . the events of the night were badly confused . He knew only one thing : that he was innocent of the heinous charge brought against him . And that the " Innisfail Butcher "  --  how quickly the newspapers had hit upon that vile epithet , and how widely Jean-Pierre 's lean , anxious , hawkish face was known throughout the state !  --  remained a free man , given license to murder again , while he , Jean-Pierre , a victim of grotesque circumstances , was condemned . The tavern-keeper 's wife simply repeated her imbecilic story . The rider on the horse headed in the direction of Lake Noir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three white stockings and a close-cropped mane and tail ; Jean-Pierre Bellefleur 's belligerence and general rowdiness . He was like a child , the woman said , wiping at her eyes . A child pretending to be an adult man , and fooling people into accepting him as such . . . . But also like the Devil . When he drank , he was like the Devil . He just went wild , he had to be dragged out onto the veranda by his friend from Missouri , slapped around and maybe splashed with cold water ; and even then he was n't always all right . ( But when Jean-Pierre 's attorney , cross-examining the woman , asked her with a droll twist of his mouth why she and her husband allowed such a " devil " into their establishment , she could only stammer : " But  --  you see  --  so many of them are  --  so many of the men  --  They 're all like that more or less  --  " A ripple of laughter ran through the packed courtroom . ) Nevertheless , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at first , to be just and upright and unprejudiced men . ( Though of course no one in the Valley could be " unprejudiced " about a Bellefleur . ) It is said that jurors , filing back into court with a verdict of Guilty , do not look at the defendant ; but the jurors at Jean-Pierre 's trial certainly looked at him . They eyed him , studied him , stared quite frankly at him as if they were in the presence of a venomous but fascinating insect . ... And how do you find the defendant ? ... We find the defendant Guilty as charged . Guilty ! Guilty as charged ! When of course he was innocent , and could do nothing more than scream and tear at the sheriff 's men who were restraining him . No ! You ca n't ! I wo n't let you ! I 'm innocent ! The murderer is at large ! The fur ( lever is among you ! I am not the murderer ! If only the tavern-keeper 's spiteful wife had been killed along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the pan-1c nionium the woman was overlooked . If only . .  |p246For  a while he could not be certain he had heard correctly . What did the words mean , Guilty as charged . . . ? Perhaps when the prosecuting attorney had queried him about the old feud of the 1820 's  --  whether he felt any " ill-will , " whether he had ever craved " revenge "  --  he should have answered more carefully , more thoughtfully , instead of uttering , through tight pursed lips : " No . " ( For there were , among the eleven dead , two Varrell men . One in his mid-fifties , the other about Jean-Pierre 's age . It was his claim that he had n't known they were Varrells , which was somewhat unlikely ; for , as the tavern-keeper 's slanderous wife pointed out , everyone knew everyone else in the Valley . And Bellefleurs and Varrells always knew one another . ) He could only repeat his story : leaving the tavern early , getting a ride with the peddler , sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family . ( His father Jeremiah suffered from insomnia , his mother Elvira suffered from " nerves . " ) When the sheriff and his men came to arrest him at dawn , dragging him out of the barn and knocking him about until his nose bled onto his filthy , already bloodied shirt , he could n't imagine why they were there ; he could n't make sense of anything they.said . They must have had a warrant for his arrest but he did n't remember seeing any warrant . Ah , if he had stayed a companion to Mr. Newman , if they had followedthrough on their scheme to duplicate the tower of the Hotel de Ville in the States ! How profoundly and beautifully innocent their partnershipwould have been ! But through an excess of boyish enthusiasm he had irrevocably offended the older man , and now his life was ruined . He was only thirtytwoyears old and his life was ruined . The Lake Noir district had been notorious in the past for lynchings , murders , arson , and theft , and continualharassment of Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " Innisfail Butcher " with his handsome , boyish , aggrieved face . He was in all the newspapers , out to the West Coast , the " Innisfail Butcher " who had murdered eleven men and claimed not to remember anything , claimed to be innocent , absolutely innocent : and how certain he was ! The newspapers naturally resurrected old stories about the Bellefleur-Varrellfeud though Jean-Pierre had made clear , in open court , repeatedly , that he had n't even been aware that two Varrell men were in the tavern that night . . . . But no one believed him , and his young life was ruined . For a stunned moment he could not believe the sentence old Judge Petrie had passed . Life plus ninety-nine years plus ninety-nine years plus ... Individuals in the courtroom burst into applause . ( For it was felt throughout the community that a death by hanging  --  a death that would involve , at the most , ten minutes of agony  --  was far too merciful for Jean-Pierre . ) " But I am innocent , Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff 's men tugged at him he began to shout : " I tell you I am innocent ! The murderer is still at large ! The murderer is among you ! "  |p247So  Jean-Pierre Bellefleur II , the grandson of the millionaire Raphael Bellefleur ( who came so close  --  so heartbreakingly close  --  to political prominence ) , was incarcerated in the infamous state penitentiary at Powhatassie , there to serve a sentence of life plus 990 years . He fainted at the sight of its massive walls  --  fainted and had to be slapped back into consciousness  --  whimpering , still , that he was innocent , he was innocent of the charges brought against him , a terrible mistake had been made  --  Yes , yes , the guards chuckled , that 's what you all say . The Powhatassie State Correctional Facility housed , at the time of **25;7268;TOOLONG , about 1,500 men , in a space originally designed for 900 . Prisoners customarily fainted or screamed at the sight of its great stone walls , which were slightly over thirty feet high and stretched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals by six-sided turrets topped with Gothic cupolas , in which guards armed with carbines and rifles spent their days . The prison , modeled after medieval French prison-castles that had exerted a curious spell , for some reason , on the architect hired by the state to design the facility , was built on a rugged promontory overlooking the dour Powhatassie River , at the very spot at which , according to legend , the water had run red with the blood of Bay Colony pioneers who had ventured too far west and were massacred by Mohawk Indians . Built in the late 1700 's , the prison was in visible decline ( everywhere walls were crumbling , exposing rusted iron rods ) , but possessed , still , the ugly nobility of a medieval fortress ; and its huge dining hall , with columns , arches , and heavy wrought-iron grillwork on its windows , reminded poor Jean-Pierre of nothing so much as his grandfather 's pretensions . There was a curious religious aura to the horrific place . He seemed to know beforehand that his appeals  --  made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed , for he sank almostimmediately into a state of apathy , and maintained a Bellefleur detachment from his surroundings that infuriated , at first , his fellow inmates , and certain of the guards . That his first cell was five feet by eight , that the " toilet " was a hole , uncovered , that the food was inedible ( in-. deed , it was indefinable ) , that he was issued unlaundered clothes several sizes too big for his graceful frame , that his mattress was filthy and infested with bedbugs , and the single cotton blanket issued to him stiff with filth and dried blood  --  that there were cockroaches and footlong rats everywhere  --  and the majority of his fellow prisoners were evidently ill , physically or mentally , and sat on their cots or the floor , or walked about , with the spirit of zombies  --  that since a riot five or six years ago in which seven guards were killed and twelve inmates " committed suicide " the guards were exceptionally cruel : none of this stirred him . For some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame that he had been the cause of his family 's fresh humiliation  --  that it would be many , many years before the 43ellefleurs regained their dignity . ( As hisp248brother Noel said , weeping with exasperation , the fact that he was innocentsomehow made it all the more intolerable . . . . When Harlan was arrested , after all , he had been guilty , and very publicly guilty , of several murders , and every word of his , every gesture , must have been enhanced by the noble melancholy of his predicament . He had killed , he had exactedrevenge as , indeed , he was forced to  --  and then he had died . In every respect he had acted heroically . By contrast poor wretched JeanPierre , who was innocent , was ignominious as a trapped muskrat : his fate was merely outrageous . ) To anyone who would listen , to guards who greeted him with a routine , unmotivated elbow in the chest , Jean-Pierre spoke quietly of his innocence . His manner was courteous and reasonable . He had long given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitence , he said , and if an innocent man is wrongly incarcerated , how can he do penance . . . ? Is n't the very foundation of the penitentiary undermined by such injustice . . . ? The considerable sums of money Jean-Pierre received each month ( which he was later to increase through poker and bridge games in which , occasionally , guards would participate ) allowed him to purchase cigarettes , candy , sugar ( no sugar was provided by the institution , and cold oatmeal , alternately watery and glutinous  --  and sometimes dotted with the remains of weevils  --  was served every morning , every single morning ) , and other small favors , and naturally he tipped his guards , as he would tip any servant not in his own hire , so the rough treatment gradually stopped ; but it was to be some time  --  in fact , years  --  before Jean-Pierre would acquire a more spacious cell , for him and his **25;7295;TOOLONG was to be a series of such young men over the decades , some fifteen or twenty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor , another husky young ambitious prisoner eager to serve Jean-Pierre Bellefleur II ) . But it took time for Jean-Pierre to acquire this sort of power , especially because his manner was so subdued , his voice so hollow and seemingly apathetic , and his insistence upon his innocence  --  which , as the guards remarked , was universal  --  detracted from his naturaldistinction . So when he reiterated his plea , his listless comical logic , If a penitentiary is a place of penance , and if an innocent man is wrongly incarcerated ... more than one guard burst into rude laughter , and butted him all the more cruelly in the chest . ( Later , a friendly prisoner warned Jean-Pierre against " talking crazy . " Because if he talked crazy , no matter how quietly , how politely , he might be diagnosed as crazy . And if he was diagnosed as crazy  --  by a state psychiatrist who visited the prison on alternate Thursdays , in the afternoon , and made judgments and prescribed medicine from his office , going by scribbled reports handed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard to the Sheeler Ward ; and that would he the end of him . The Sheeler Ward ! Jean-Pierre had heard of ' it : it was named for I ) r . Wystan Sheeler , a physician who had taken interest in the mentally ill in the last quarter of the nineteenth century , and had prescribed a radical ,  |p249and  sometimes successful , method of dealing with " madness " through sympathetic immersion in the patient 's delusions . Family gossip had it that Dr. Sheeler had attended Raphael Bellefleur for a while , and even lived at the castle . . . . But the Sheeler Ward , which comprised an entire building made of concrete blocks , was simply the hole into which troublesomeprisoners  --  whether " sane " or " insane "  --  were thrown , and once committed to the ward there was little likelihood that a man would get out . Some years ago a gang of prisoners there had seized a guard , and one of them had torn out his throat with his teeth ; and though the prisoners involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by guards , there was still a tradition of punishment in that ward . There was no sanitation , individual cells were no longer used , everyone was kept in a single dormitory room , a vast warehouse of a room , which was unheated , and said to be littered with unspeakable filth . Since the uprising no guard would venture down onto the floor : from time to time they patrolled the ward from a catwalk , and it was from this catwalk that cafeteria workers ( gagging , their faces averted , their eyes shut ) dumped food once a day , for the men to scramble for . There were men in that ward , Jean-Pierre was told , who were in the tertiary stages of syphilis , quite literally rotting ; there was every kind of sickness ; and when a man died  --  which was of course frequent , since the other prisoners were quite vicious  --  it might be several days before prison officials hauled away the corpse . So , Jean-Pierre 's companion said quietly , you do n't want them to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family has given up on this man , " Leah said . " I ca n't believe you 've done so little . " They tried to explain to her about the appeals , and the many thousandsof dollars spent ; one or two attempted bribes  --  that is , gifts  --  which were unfortunately offered to the wrong officials ; and of course other family difficulties ; and Jean-Pierre 's apathetic manner . He had , for instance , never applied for parole . Not once in thirty-three years . While at first he seemed mildly happy to see visitors he soon changed , and frequentlyrefused to enter the visiting room ; once , while Noel presented an earnest , enthusiastic case for the probability of his verdict being overturnedby the Supreme Court , he leaned forward slowly and spat against the glass partition that separated them . Never in his life , Noel said afterward , had he been so thunderstruck . " The poor man must have fallen into despair , " Leah said . " EverythingI 've heard about Powhatassie has been vile , incredibly degrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings .... Perhaps he 's ill ? Does anyone know ? Cornelia says he has never answered his mail , and he 's never answered my letters ; but then of course he does n't know me . I do n't suppose he even knows Gideon . Does he remember any of you ? When is the last time anyone has visited hint ? " They could not remember , exactly . Noel believed he had visitedp250Jean-Pierre for the last time some thirty-two years ago ( the Sunday of the spitting incident , in fact ) ; Hiram believed he had tried to see him more recently  --  perhaps twenty-five years ago  --  but was n't certain whether Jean-Pierre had condescended to appear in the visitors ' room . ( A hideous place , all concrete and wire mesh and armed guards , and such a din !  --  for the prisoners and their visitors had to shout at one another , and there were usually upward of fifty people in the room , all shouting helplessly at the same time . And , Hiram said with an angry flushed face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit her husband , sentenced to Powhatassie for life : the pathetic woman was weeping and moaning , and had no more shame than to unbutton her dress to show her lardy , sagging breasts to her husband . ) Their mother had visited him for the last time approximately twenty years ago ; when she returned home she went at once to her bedchamber , where she remained , weeping , for several days . Aunt Veronica had never gone , since she left her rooms only after sundown , and visiting hours were from two to five ; Della had gone once or twice , and Matilde only a few times . ( It was thought that Matilde 's reclusivenessbegan at the time of Jean-Pierre 's trial . She turned away all suitors , frequently dressed in men 's clothing ( but not nice men 's clothing , Cornelia said ; farmhand sort of clothing ) , spent more and more time out at the old camp , and finally moved there permanently , pretending that a life of raising hens , growing vegetables , and making quilts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carvings was any sort of life for a Bellefleur . ) Lamentations of Jeremiah had visited his son as often as Jean-Pierre would allow , which was n't often because , to perpetrate Elvira'smyth , he liked to claim that the telegram summoning him home had ruined his life  --  he had been nearly engaged to an Italian marchesa whose family dated back to the twelfth century , and Jeremiah 's latest financial debacle had brought the whole house of cards tumbling down . And then of course Jeremiah had died in the Great Flood of twenty years back . So Jean-Pierre had n't had a visitor from the outside world in twenty years . " I will visit him , " Leah said . " My little girl and I will visit him . " " Oh , but you could n't take a child , " Cornelia cried . And Hiram said , twisting the ends of his mustache nervously , " The one thing , dear , you know , that 's been a kind of stumbling block . . . or perhaps there are two . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be frank : his story about the peddler , a peddler allegedly driving a mule-drawn wagon along the Innisfail Road at night . . . in the pitch-black ... a peddler never glimpsed before or since . . . the story is , is n't it ? . . . somewhat strained . And there was the matter of Folderol covered with sweaty scum , and her ankles badly scratched , and her hooves all muddy .... " " Folderol  --  ? " Leah cried , staring at him . " What in heaven 's name are you talking about , Uncle ? " " Folderol was the name of  --  " " But you just do n't want to help him , do your Leah said , pressing her hands to her cheeks as if they were burning . " You think that thep251ignominy has been lived down simply because people have forgotten . But they have n't forgotten  --  not really ! Suppose Christabel , for instance , fell in love with a  --  a Schaff , or a Horehound  --  or one of those old Vanderpoelfamilies  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think they would countenance a match with a Bellefleur , as things stand ? " We must think ahead , " Leah said , shaking a cigarillo out of a package . " Did n't Raphael once say  --  it is n't possible to think too far ahead  --  " " Christabel is maturing rapidly , " Cornelia murmured . Noel threw up his hands in angry despair . " But if you visit my brother , dear , what precisely will you talk about ? It is n't as if you know him , after all . I doubt that I would recognize him myself . We tried so often to press him into applying for parole , and in the end he was really quite abusive ; in fact I had the distinct impression that he 'd settled in , at Powhatassie , as he never had out here . The men are allowed to play cards , you know , and according to the warden ( at that time  --  I 'm afraid I do n't know the current warden ) there was always a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , and Jean-Pierre had taught the other men a dozen kinds of poker , and gin rummy , and casino , and euchre , and even bridge  --  We had hoped he might at least apply for parole , despite Judge Petrie 's admonition to the state , but he never did ; perhaps he did n't want to risk another humiliation , then again perhaps he did n't want to risk being freed . " " I do n't want a parole , " Leah said impatiently . " I want a pardon . " " A pardon ? " " From the governor . A pardon . Exoneration . " " A pardon ? For Jean-Pierre ? " At that very moment Germaine ran into the room and clambered up on Leah 's lap . She had something very exciting to tell her mother  --  something about one of the cats being treed by a Minorca rooster  --  but Leah quieted her , and brushed her hair back from her overheated forehead . Perhaps to give the older Bellefleurs time to recover ( for Leah , despite her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned her attentions to her daughter , wetting a forefinger to wipe away some dirt , kissing the child 's flushed cheek . " Are n't you a pretty girl , " Leah whispered . " Are n't you blessed . " And finally , after a long silence , Cornelia said weakly : " But at least do n't take Germaine , dear . "  |p252One  fine autumn morning when the last of the leaves  --  the golden maples  --  were blazing with light , and the sky was so coldly pellucid a turquoise-blue that it resembled stained glass , Garth and Little Goldie ran off together , in Garth 's new Buick , leaving behind only a scribbled note ( in Little Goldie 's childlike hand ) slipped under Ewan 's and Lily 's door : Gone to get marri 'd . They sped southward , crossing the borders of several states , until , breathless , they arrived in one that would marry them within three days ; and so they were married . Because of the circumstances of their surprise elopement they had time to heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Little Goldie 's dresses ( she had so many  --  for her new-adopted family was very generous with new things as well as cast-off but still perfectly wearable things  --  it would have been impossible to choose : so she and Garth merely grabbed an armful out of the closet ) , the single suit of Garth 's he found tolerable to wear , for brief periods ( it was made of brown mohair-and-cotton , with a modest lapel and many brass buttons ; its trousers were too short but in other respects attractive ) , and the old Swiss music box from the nursery . They had also taken a half-dozen items from the Great Hall whose value they could n't have guessed ; instinct guided them as blindly toward a rare sixteenthcenturyGerman bell metal mortar and pestle as toward a crystal knickknackfrom Victoria 's England , or a " snowstorm " paperweight of undeterminedorigin . Raiding a few rooms during the very early hours of the night , whispering and giggling , on tiptoe , barefoot , they accumulated " about $2,300 in loose cash taken , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackets , from out of drawers , from between the pages of books ( in Raphael 's library they found a great deal , though some of it was in currency that " looked funny "  --  so they left it behind ) , and evenp253from piggy banks , that the money was never to be missed . And of course Garth had some money of his own . The previous day , something very peculiar had happened between Garth and his uncle Gideon , which was never to be satisfactorily explained . It seemed that several of the children  --  Little Goldie , Christabel , Morna  --  were in the old garden room , playing with the twin ginger kittens everyone adored ( though they were not kittens any longer , really , being about five months old now , with long slender bodies and very white whiskers , and unusually large feet ) , when Mahalaleel , the kittens ' father , appeared suddenly at one of the windows , mewing to be let inside . In an uncannily human gesture he brought one paw slowly down against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , startled . ( For Mahalaleel had been gone from the manor for nearly two weeks , and Leah had about given up on him . ) So the children let him inside , and were delighted at his interest in the kittens , whom he began to groom with all the assiduity of a mother cat . In the posture of a sphinx he reclined before them , gripping them both between his front legs , washing now one , now the other , with his rough pink tongue , his eyes half-shut with pleasure . And the kittens ( who did appear to be kittens again , suddenly diminished beside their magnificentfluffy-haired father ) pressed against him , purring loudly . Little Goldiehad not seen Mahalaleel close up . She knelt to watch him wash the kittens , her brown eyes fixed upon him with a curious intensity . How beautiful Mahalaleel was , though tiny cockleburrs were sticking to his fur  --  how silky , how luxurious , with the roseate highlights of his thick coat , and the pattern , so intricate as to be almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and orange-and-bronze and frosted black ! And his pale green eyes with their black , somewhat dilated centers . ... Little Goldie murmured that she had never seen a cat like Mahalaleel . She leaned closer , staring . Her long hair fell slowly forward , framing her small face . " Do you think I could pet him ? " she said . " Oh , no , I would n't  --  he does n't know you yet , " Christabel said . " Oh , go ahead , he 's friendly , " impish Morna said . So Little Goldie quite innocently reached out to touch Mahalaleel . And whether because the creature was genuinely startled by the movement of her hand , or whether because he imagined she meant harm to the kittens  --  or whether he was simply outraged that a stranger should presume to stroke his head  --  he snarled and lashed out at her . And in that single instant he scratched the poor child 's forearm quite badly  --  the tender inside of the arm , near the elbow . Blood sprang out from four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the floor . " Oh ! ( ) h , look what he did. ! " Little ( : oldie  --  cried in astonishment . She was nio : a %tu prised than frightened , but the other girls screamedp254for help ( Christabel in particular , since the sight of blood terrified her ) , and they were fortunate enough to attract the attention of one of the adults  --  Gideon  --  who was just passing by . He hurried inside , saw what had happened , clapped his hands angrily to frighten the hissing Mahalaleelaway  --  Mahalaleel and the kittens as well  --  and dropped to his knees to examine Little Goldie 's wound . " Now do n't cry , you 'll be all right , " he murmured , wrapping a handkerchief around her arm , soaking up the bright blood . " You should n't have gotten near that bastard of a cat . But you 'll be all right : these are only scratches . " It must have been the case that Garth was also nearby , perhaps dawdling in the corridor ; because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room less than a minute after his uncle . He came to a stop abruptly , staring at Gideon and Little Goldie , who were both kneeling on the tessellated floor . The girls told him what had happened  --  how naughty Mahalaleel had been  --  but he did not seem to hear . " What happened , " he asked in a queer strangled voice , " what happened to her  --  " Gideon glanced around at him , and said , " Go get Lissa , will you , and say there 's been a little accident  --  one of the cats has scratched Little Goldie  --  we need bandages , and some disinfectant  --  " " What happened , what are you doing , " Garth said . He towered above them , six feet tall , his jaw suddenly slack , his long thick arms hanging loose . Gideon repeated what he had said , but Garth heard nothing ; he was simply staring at them . " For Christ 's sake , Garth  --  " Gideon began : but Garth suddenly seized him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of him , shouting incoherently . His fists rose and fell , he kneed his uncle in the chest , tried to close his fingers around his throat . It all happened so quickly that the girls stared in amazement , too surprised even to call for help for several seconds . What was happening ! Had Garth suddenly gone mad ! The two men rolled over and over , colliding with the legs of a chair , knocking the chair against the wall . Someone ran to the doorway . There were shouts and more screams . Gideon shoved Garth away with his knee , but Garth , his face a bright hideous red , managed to throw himself down again , his fingers outstretched . He was babbling that he would kill his uncle  --  that nothing was going to stop him . Somehow they struggled to their feet . Gideon 's nose was bleeding freely , there was blood  --  his , or Garth 's  --  smeared on Garth 's face and shirt ; their chests rose and fell convulsively . Though people were yelling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at each other , circling each other . Garth 's mother hurried into the room , with grandmotherCornelia close behind . " Oh , what are you doing ! " the women screamed . " Oh , stop ! Garth ! Stop ! " Garth rushed his uncle , who caught him in his arms , and , grunting like animals , the two of them staggered backward , crashing through the French doors ( so that glass flew and there were more terrified screams ) .  |p255Then  both fell backward against a low balcony railing ; and over the railing , and into the rose garden six feet below . The fall did not appear to hurt either of them  --  perhaps they did not notice it  --  for their struggle increased in intensity . Noel came limping over , in his work clothes , shouting for them to stop . He carried a hoe and was accompanied by the farm overseer , and several hired hands , who gaped stupidly at Garth and Gideon . But the fighting men ( for Garth was a man , nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon was on top , slamming his fist into Garth 's face ; now Garth was on top , shrieking , trying again to close his fingers ( which were bleeding ) around his uncle 's throat . They rolled over and over in the desiccated rosebushes , unheedful of the thorns and the innumerable scratches on their faces and hands that had begun to bleed . From an upstairs window aunt Aveline shrieked : " Turn the fire extinguishers on them ! Quickly ! Quickly before one of them is murdered ! " Vernon appeared , his straggly beard blowing , and made the mistake of approaching them  --  and suddenly he was propelled violently backward , the book he was carrying thrown out of his hand . ( He fell in one of the open trenches , where a new pipe was in the process of being laid , and badly sprained his ankle . But in the excitement no one noticed . ) Several Bellefleur dogs ran over , barking hysterically . " Oh , where is Ewan , " Lily cried , leaning over the railing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can stop them  --  " But Ewan was nowhere to be found . ( He had taken one of the pick-up trucks into the village . ) Nor was Leah home : she and Germaine were in Vanderpoel for the weekend . Hiram appeared , shaking his cane , shouting for order ; order , or he would call the sheriff ; but naturally the men paid no attention , and would even have knocked him to the ground as they rolled in his direction , had he not danced quickly aside . " Help me , you idiots , " Noel cried to his workers , and though he boldly seized Gideon by the hair they did not dare come near : and he soon lost his grip on his son . He was panting convulsively : he stumbled backward , his hand pressed against his chest . ( So Cornelia cried , " You , down there , take care of that foolish old man ! Do n't let him near those two ! " ) The dogs barked and yipped and whined , circling the men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shattered glass , Little Goldie stared at the struggling men , her small fist pressed against her mouth . Her pale arched eyebrows were brought sharply together , in a look of horror ; her skin had gone white , so that her innumerable pale freckles appeared to darken ; her blond hair was all atangle . It might have been noted , from the rose garden especially , that she was , in that stance , particularly beautiful  --  aprevnatutely adult young girl , with small , hard breasts , a tiny waist , slender hips and legs . " Oh no oh no oh no , " she whimpered ; but the men took no heed of her either ,  |p256Garth  lay back , panting , and Gideon stumbled to his feet , dripping blood from his nose . For five or six seconds they rested : and then Gideon ran at his nephew , and the two of them again scuffled , and the women screamed . Albert appeared . And young Jasper . Hiram was trying to break up the fight by prodding the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were oblivious of his timid blows . Jasper and Albert tried to grab hold of Garth , futilely ; Noel tried again to seize his son by the hair , but one of Garth 's wild fists caught him in the mouth . ( And cracked the poor man 's dentures . ) A shoe flew loose  --  it was Gideon 's  --  and shreds of Garth 's shirt  --  and skeins of blood . " Stop ! You must stop ! I command you to stop ! " Grandmother Corneliashouted , her wig askew . In the end , however , they stopped only because  --  instinctively , unconsciously  --  theyfelt it was time to stop . Garth crawled away , sobbing ; Gideon remained on his side , propped up by one elbow . It might have been the case , since Garth was the one to crawl away , that he had been defeated ( and so most of the witnesses argued ) , but Gideon 's bloodstreakedface showed no triumph . But what was the fight about ?  --  what on earth had happened ? Garth hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon , though looking a bloody wreck , and so exhausted he could hardly walk , staggered to his Aston-Martin and drove away , ignoring the shouts of incredulity that were raised behind him . How did it begin ?  --  were n't Garth and his uncle usually on good terms ?  --  did n't they like each other ?  --  what had gone wrong ?  --  why did they suddenly want to kill each other ? So the family asked ; but no answers were forthcoming.  |p257On  the day before great-grandmother Elvira 's hundredth birthday , in honor of which a large celebration had been planned by the family , it was observed by Leah and others that Germaine was uncommonlynervous , and even rather cranky  --  the usually happy little girl refused to be drawn into the others ' excitement ( most of the children , and many of the adults , were in a near-frenzy of excitement over the party  --  for not since Raphael Bellefleur 's time had so ambitious a social event been planned at Bellefleur Manor ) ; she kept to herself in the nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet 's drawing room , staring anxiously out the window , with a concentration that seemed adult , at the November sky ( which was perfectly cloudless ) ; she was so distracted that a footstep behind her or a gentle " Germaine . . . ? " or one of her favorite kittens , flying across the floor , was enough to frighten her into a little scream . Leah sought her out and knelt before her , framing her face , gazing into her evasive eyes . " What is wrong , dear ? Do n't you feel well ? " she asked . But the little girl answered disjointedly , squirming out of her mother 's embrace . The sky tasted muddy , she said . Muddy-black . There were eels in it . The cellar smelled : rubber and skunk and something burnt on the stove . Tiny spiders were crawling up her legs and stinging ... . " She must be coming down with something , " grandmother Cornelia said , approaching the child but not touching her . " Just look at her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug her , " there certainly are n't spiders crawling up your legs ! You know better ! Those are just goosehumps , you 're cold , you ca n't seem to stop shivering , can you ... ? Are you getting sick ? Is it your stomach ? Please tell me , dear . " But she pushed Leah away and an to the window , pressing her cheek against the pane so that she could peer up , anxiously , Her forehead wasp258furrowed and her lips , which were unusually pale , were drawn back from her baby teeth in an ugly grimace . " She 's such a strange child , " , Cornelia whispered , shuddering . " ... Are you coming down with a cold , Germaine ? Please tell me . At least look at me . There 's nothing up there to look at ! " Leah cried . She caught hold of Germaine again , and again framed her face , this time holding it rather roughly between her hands . " I do n't want you to babble such nonsense . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in front of anyone else . And certainly not tomorrow when our guests arrive . Eels in the sky , skunks in the cellar , spiders , what nonsense ! " " You 'll be frightening her , Leah , " Cornelia said . But Leah paid no attention to her mother-in-law . She was staring into her daughter 's face , holding her squirming head still . The eyes were dilated , the skin was pale and clammy , there was an aura of  --  of what ?  --  something dank , wet , sour , brackish about the child . After a long moment Leah said , " Something is going to go wrong , is n't it . Something is going to go wrong after all my work . . . . " But then , with a little cry of disgust , " But you do n't always know . You do n't always know . " She pushed Germaine away and straightened , and said to her mother-in-lawin a vexed , tearful voice , " She does n't always know , does she ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been , at first , a family party : and then Leah hit upon the idea of inviting Bellefleurs from other regions , and even other states ( Cornelia and Aveline were drawn into her enthusiasm , each supplying lists of names , in some cases of Bellefleurs no one had seen for decades , in such distant places as New Mexico , British Columbia , and Alaska , and even Brazil ) : and then Hiram hit upon the idea of inviting people from outside the family , since it had been so long since the manor had been open to a number of important , influential guests : and naturally Leah responded to his suggestion with zeal . Meldroms . . . Zunderts . . . Schaffs . . . Medicks ... Sanduskys . . . Faines . . . Scroons ... Dodders . . . Pyes . . . Fiddlenecks ... Bonesets ... Walpoles ... Cinquefoils ... Filarees ... Crockets . . . Mobbs ... Pikes . . . Braggs ... Hallecks . . . Whipples . . . Pepperells . . . Cokers ... Yarrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course they probably would not even acknowledge the invitation ) ... Vervains ... Rudbecks ... Governor Grounsel and his family . . . Lieutenant-Governor Horehound and his family ... Attorney General Sloan and his family .. Senator Tucke . . . Congressman Sledge ... the Caswells and the Abbots and the Ritchies and . . . and perhaps even Mr. Tirpitz ( though it was unlikely that he would come ) ... . Leah hired a male calligrapher to write out the invitations , which were sent out on oyster-white cards with the Bellefleur coat of arms embossed in silver on them ; if the celebration is to be held , she declared , everything should be done perfectly . A Vanderpoel caterer was retained . More domestic help was hired . Since guests . were coming from so far away they would have to spend the night , or even several nights : so the castle'sp259innumerable guest chambers would have to be aired and cleaned and polished and perhaps even repainted and in some cases fumigated . Furniturewould have to be reupholstered . Rugs would have to be cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and new varnish applied . More china must be bought ; and more crystal ; and silverware . Paintings , statues , frescoes , tapestries , and other ornamental objects would have to be cleaned and switched around from room to room . ( How odd , how very odd , Leah thought , studying for the first time certain of the things RaphaelBellefleur had acquired , presumably by way of dealers and buyers in Europe . She wondered if he had actually looked at them before he had them hung : for what could one possibly make of these copies of Tintoretto , Veronese , Caravaggio , Bosch , Michelangelo , Botticelli , Rosso ... ? There were enormous cracked oils and ten-by-fifteen faded tapestriesand frescoes and altarpieces of The Rape of Europa , The Triumph of Bacchus , The Triumph of Silenus , Venus and Adonis , Venus and Mars , Deucalion and Pyrrha , Danae , The Marriage of the Virgin , The Annunciation , Cupid Carving His Bow , Diana and Acteon , Jupiter and lo , Susannah and the Elders , there were Olympian feasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thick-buttocked " graces " clutched wisps of diaphanous clothing comically inadequate to cover their nakedness , and gods with ludicrously tiny phalluses were being stripped by putti who were really dwarves with comically foreshortened legs and bulging foreheads . . . . On one wall of Leah 's and Gideon 's own bedchamber was an immense time-darkened oil depicting Leda and the Swan , in which Leda was an obscenely plump maiden with a dazed expression , reclining upon a much-rumpled couch , and staving off , with a feeble arm , a stunted but ferocious swan with a phallic neck so meticulously rendered it must have been a joke . . . . Leah stared at these things , shining a flashlight on them , feeling lightheaded , and occasionally even nauseous , wondering if she was imagining their satirical bizarrerie ; wondering if Raphael had intended to purchase such grotesque art , or whether the poor man , for all his money , had been hoodwinked . They would have to come down someday . But there was no time , now , to replace them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . ) She even wanted to open the Turquoise Room , about . which she had heard so much , but was dissuaded , not by the other Bellefleurs ' pleas , but by the extraordinary sensation that coursed through her when she laid her hand upon the doorknob .... ( But someone had nailed the door shut , in addition to locking it . Nailed it shut with six-inch spikes . " A pretty sight , in the corridor for any guest to see ! " she said . ) A week before Elvira 's birthday Leah realized that the estate must smell . It was a farm , there were farm animals , how could it not smell ? So , over Noel 's weak protests , she arranged for an entire herd of Holsteins , what remained of the horses , and a number of hogs and sheep to he shifted by truck to other parts of ' the estate . ( The family had just acquired , at rather a bargain , some seven hundred acres of ' fairly good land alongp260the Nautauga River , adjacent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the tenant farmer Doan and his idle family . ) " I do n't see any reason to advertise the fact that we are farmers , " Leah said . " And anyway we are n't , really  --  most of our income comes from other sources . " Domestic help began to arrive , and were housed in the old coachman'slodge : cooks , butlers , maids , groundsmen , even a lampman , even several page boys ( who were Hiram 's idea : he remembered liveried page boys from his youth , or claimed he did , and had always associated them with the aristocracy ) . Three seamstresses ; two hairdressers ; a " floral artist " ; a Hungarian gypsy band from Port Oriskany ; a string quartet specializing in nineteenth-century Romantic music . A team of electricians came to arrange strings of brightly burning electric lights indoors and out , strung along the battlements and from tower to tower , so that they would be visible for many miles , across the entire width of Lake Noir . " How lovely , " Leah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Two truckloads of flowers were delivered : roses , gloxinias , lilies of the valley , carnations , orchids . Leah and Cornelia and Aveline helped arrange them , in every part of the house ; a great basket of orchids was brought to Elvira 's suite where the old woman , wearing a wrinkled floor-length houserobe , and pretending to be somewhat peeved by all the attention , claimed there was no logical place for them . " Cut flowers are a shameful waste , " she said . " We have more flowers than we know what to do with in the summer . " " But this is n't summer , Mother Elvira ! " Cornelia said lightly . " I 'm not even certain it is my birthday , this week . " " Of course it 's your birthday ! " . . or that really the age you say , " the old woman murmured , shivering in her gown . " Bellefleurs always exaggerate . " A pity , Leah thought , gazing at great-grandmother Elvira , that her husband was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had survived . How lonely it must be , to have outlived everyone . . . . Elvira was said to have been an extremely beautiful young woman when she became betrothedto the luckless Lamentations of Jeremiah , more than eight decades previously ; and with her fine white hair , her unusually soft complexion , and her slender , almost girlish frame she was still an attractive woman . She might have been sixty-five years old , or seventy . Hardly more than eighty . Ah , but one hundred . . . ! It seemed impossible . She , Leah , would never grow so old . " Why are you staring at me , miss ? " Elvira said sharply . Leah blushed . She realized that the old woman had forgotten her name . " I was thinking  --  I was thinking  --  " " Yes ? " " That this will be a birthday for us all to remember , and to cherish , " Leah said weakly . " Yes , I do n't doubt that . " Great-grandmother Elvira laughed.  |p261Leah  spent a sleepless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many guests had accepted invitations . . . . So much food had been delivered . . . . ( Several truckloads of choice beef and lamb ; Cornish game hens ; red snapper , sole , salmon , and sea bass ; crabmeat and lobster . ) There was a hideous tapestry in one of the third-floor guest rooms that she must take down , after all : it showed a naked potbellied drunken Silenus on a swaybacked ass , being led in a riotous procession of nymphs , satyrs , and fat little cupids . Quite possibly the ugliest thing she had ever seen . ... And what if Germaine were ill , in the morning ? And what if Gideon disappeared as he had threatened ? ( But he would n't dare betray the family . ) And suppose old Elvira stubbornly refused to come downstairs , to open her presents ... . Near dawn Leah had a confused waking dream . She was back at the Powhatassie penitentiary ( which she had visited twelve days earlier ) , being led once again through the five locked gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and her black silk shantung suit . She tried not to notice the high granite walls , the crumbling concrete , the stench . ... In the high-vaulted visitors ' room she was led to an elderly man said to be her uncle Jean-Pierre Bellefleur II . Silvery-haired , diminutive , with small rheumy colorless eyes ; his skin dry and flaking , and dead-white ; thin lips stretched in a mock-courteous smile ; a hump , small but prominent , between his shoulders . As she approached he raised his eyes to her and his gaze pierced her like a blade : for it was obvious that he was a Bellefleur . Even in his ill-fitting gray-blue prison uniform he was a Bellefleur , one of her people ... . " Uncle Jean-Pierre ! At last ! Oh , at last ! I 'm so grateful to be allowed to see you ! " she cried . The courtly old man ( who looked far older than Noel or Hiram ) acknowledged her words with a slight nod of his head . She sat on the very edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so much to say ! So much to explain ! She was Leah Pym , his sister Della 's daughter ; she was his nephew Gideon 's wife ; she had come to bring him hope . After so many years , after so many years of the vilest injustice ... . As she talked , more and more rapidly , the silver-haired old gentlemanmerely gazed at her . From time to time he nodded , but without conviction . He had been falsely accused and falsely found guilty , but his case had not been forgotten , and she and her attorneys were in the process of reviewing it , and soon , very soon , they might have encouraging news ... . Around them , other visitors and prisoners were shouting at one another . ' There was a considerable di --  . A heavyset young woman beside Leah merely stared at her husband , through the scratched glass partition , and the two of them wept . Ah , Leah thought with a thrill of ' terror , howThe skit of her uncle 's lace was like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck her as very beautiful . We have n't forgotten you , we have n't betrayed you , Leah said , speaking more and more quickly , her own eyes filling with tears . It amazed her , that she should be facing , after so long , her uncle Jean-Pierre : that after having refused to see her for so many months , he should suddenly have relented . His expression was slightly mocking ; yet wise ; kind ; good . She could see that he had suffered . She could see that he half-pitied her , for her idealism . He thought she was a fool  --  perhaps . A silly goose of a girl . But she would show him ! She would n't give up so easily as the others had . Because I know you are innocent , she whispered . His lips twitched in a smile . He raised one liver-spotted hand , and drew it slowly beneath his nose . ... I know , I know you are innocent , she said . The visitors ' room was a great concrete cavern lurid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain pelted against windows . But the windows were opaque . Leah , squinting , could not see the sky  --  could not see where the angry rain struck . " The Innisfail Butcher ! " This gentle broken-spirited old man with the kindly pitying eyes and the dry wrinkled skin that seemed to lie against his bones in layers , like the skin of an onion ... . Leah talked and talked . Perhaps he heard . Perhaps he understood . At any rate he did not try to dissuade her . He said only two things during the course of their ninety-minute visit , and Leah , though straining , could not hear them precisely . The first sounded like If old Raphael gets in office I think he might pardon me . Leah , surprised , managed to smile faintly , and to explain that there was a man named Grounsel in the governor 's office  --  and that she and her attorneys had already begun petitioning him . The second remark of Jean-Pierre 's was made in response to Leah 's spirited statement , that she wished  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free man by the time of his mother 's birthday ; it would be , he must know , his poor mother 's hundredth birthday . The old man , gazing at her with his mild rheumy eyes , frowned for a moment , and said what sounded like My mother  --  do I have a motherThe rain interrupted them , slamming against the windows . And Leah awoke , her heart pounding  --  and it was raining  --  the morning of the birthday celebration , and pouring rain  --  vicious pouring rain . Toward 9:00 AM. the rain stopped , and the sky appeared to open . But how queer , how alarming it looked  --  as if , Leah thought , one were gazing into a bottomless chasm . But the rain had stopped . The Bellefleur women hurried about the house , giving orders to the help , frequently contradicting one another . Leah wanted The Triumph of Silenus taken down at once from the guest room reserved for W. D. Meldrom , but Cornelia insisted that it remain : was n't it one of the treasuresof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted mostp263of the furniture in the main drawing room moved about , so that the atmosphere was less casual ; she preferred , she said , the original formality of the house , before Leah had gone changing everything around . Della , who had been pressed into a visit , who had , as she said , far more important things to do at home , found fault with the gloxinia plants . They were already dying : sent up from the Falls at such absurd expense , and already dying . . . ! Lily followed the maids about , uncharacteristically critical , stooping to sniff at cushions ( she was convinced  --  it had become one of her obsessions , since the party was planned  --  that the manor 's many kittens had fouled these wonderful old pieces of furniture ) , ordering floors repolished , sighting strands of cobweb floating from the high , shadowy , vaulted ceilings . It was imperative , she kept saying , that they not make fools of themselves . The sky continued to lighten , though it was not exactly clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared through vast caverns of cloud : ah , how very hot the manor was ! The windows must be opened . It was mid-November , there had already been a considerable snowfall , but it had melted , and now the temperature was rising as if it were midsummer : 50  --  , 53  --  , 57  --  , 59  --  .. . Leah burst into tears when she saw that one of the children , evidently accompanied by a dog , had tracked mud onto a silk-and-wool carpet that had just been cleaned . And what time was it ? The first of the guests  --  on the specially reserved Bellefleur coach on the train from downstate  --  would be arriving in about six hours . The sky darkened suddenly . And suddenly there was a tremendous wind , which blew up out of nowhere . Running to the windows , the Bellefleurssaw to their astonishment that the sky had turned boiling-black : and , in the distance , Mount Chattaroy and Mount Blanc were ringed with clouds that appeared to be on fire . Then there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thunder so loud that several of the children screamed in terror , and the dogs set up a howl . Lightning ! Lightning must have struck ! They ran about shutting windows . But in some cases it was already too late  --  the wind was too strong , torrents of rain had soaked everything , one could hardly push the windows closed ; and there was the danger of lightning . ( It had struck nearby  --  fortunately only a giant oak in the park , which had been struck many times in the past . ) So the Great Storm began : which was to rival in violence and damage the Great Storm of twenty years previously : when all of the low-lying areas were flooded , and so many people lost their lives , and even the dead were washed out of their graves . The winds were of hurricane force . Sometimes the air was sulfurous and warm  --  sometimes it was quite cold , bringing walls of ice that struck the windows like bullets , and in many cases cracked them . ' frees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dries , turningthem to mud . In his tower Bromwell observed , through a telescope ,  |p264how  Mink Creek had already risen : and its waters had turned an **27;7322;TOOLONG . " Our guests  --  our party  --  Grandmother Elvira 's birthday  --  " " But this can not happen  --  " " Why is the sun so bright  --  " " Is it a hurricane ? Is it the end of the world ? " " Get one of the men to stop that water coming in under the door  --  " " Ah , look at Mount Chattaroy ! " " Is it a volcano ? Is that fire ? " " What will happen to our wonderful party ! " The sky shifted from side to side as if it were alive . A sickly greenish orange . And then a livid magenta . Clotted clouds raced from horizon to horizon . The rain lightened ; and then suddenly increased ; again it fell in sheets , with such malevolence the entire house trembled . There had never been anything like it ! The Great Flood of twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist , so that one could n't actually see what was happening . No , there had never been anything like this ... . The winds continued to blow , and the rain continued to fall , hour upon hour . Power lines to the manor were blown down , and though it was midday candles had to be lit ; but even the candles were in danger of being blown out by capricious fingers of air . Devilish spirits raced up and down the curving staircases , loosed by the storm , frenzied as hysterical children . And the children  --  the children were hysterical : some of them were so frightened they had run away to hide , others were leaning out of windows and shouting ( " Come on , come on , what are you waiting for , come on , you ca n't get us , come on and try ! " feverish Christabel screamed from out a nursery window ) . Leah huddled in a corner of the kitchen with Germaine , trying to comfort her ( though it was really herself she was comforting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , infuriated , she jumped to her feet and ran out to see  --  to see  --  if perhaps the storm was n't lessening ?  --  and the party might be salvaged after all ? " I could curse God for this ! For this vile trick ! " she shouted . Hiram , who had dressed that morning for the party , and was wearing an elegantly tailored suit of the finest lightweight wool , with a very white and very starched shirt , and gold-and-ivory cuff links , and his usual gold watch chain , turned sharply to her , and raised his voice to be heard over the drumlike tolling of the wind : " Leah . How can you . If one of the children heard you  --  ! Such superstitious rot , you know very well there is n't any God , and if there is the poor thing is too feeble to have managed this . " Nevertheless Leah ran about like a madwoman , peering out one window and then another , as if she believed the storm might ale. , from one angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen , " It 's a trick . A vile trick . Because were Belletleurs . Because they want to stop us  --  Ile wants to stop us  --  and Ile is n't going to ! " Ewan and Gideon came in ( for they had been -- incredibly  --  out in thep265storm ) to report that the Nautauga River was rising a foot an hour ; and that most of the roads were washed out ; the Fort Hanna bridge was said to be washed out ; there had been a train derailment at Kincardine . And already three people were reported missing ... . " You 're pleased about this , are n't you ! " Leah screamed . " The two of you ! Are n't you ! " ... and Garth and Little Goldie , who had planned to return from their honeymoon in time for the party , must be caught in the storm somewhere to the south ... . " Oh , I hate you all ! I hate this ! I wo n't stand for this ! It was Elvira 's hundredth birthday and it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weeks of work  --  my guests  --  I wo n't stand for this , do you hear ! " poor Leah screamed . In her frenzy she ran to Gideon and began poundinghis chest and face , but he caught her wrists , and calmed her , and led her back into the kitchen ( which was the only warm place in the drafty old house ) where he instructed Edna to make a rum toddy for her . And he stayed with her until her sobbing quieted , and she pressed her tear-lashed face against his neck , and fell into a kind of stupor , murmuring I wanted only to do well , I wanted only to help , God has been cruel , I will never forgive Him .... In the end the storm was to be somewhat less severe than the Great Flood of twenty years previously ; but it was still a hellish thing , and took away the lives of some twenty-three people in the Lake Noir area alone , and caused damage of upward of several million dollars . The roads were washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains were derailedand train beds torn away ; Lake Noir and the Nautauga River and Mink Creek and innumerable nameless creeks and runs and ditches flooded , propelling debris along : baby buggies , chairs , laundry that had been hung out to dry , lampshades , parts of automobiles , loose boards , doors , window frames , the corpses of chickens , cows , horses , snakes , muskrats , raccoons , and parts of these corpses ; and parts of what were evidently human corpses ( for the cemeteries once again flooded , and relief workers were to be astonished and sickened by the sight of badly decomposed corpses dangling from roofs , from trees , jammed against . silos and corncribs and abandoned cars , washed up against the foundationsof homes , in various stages of decay : some aged and leathery , some fresh , soggy , pale ; and all of them pathetically naked ) ; and spiders  --  some of them gigantic , with bristling black hairs  --  ran about everywhere , washed out of ' their hiding places and frantic with terror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on somewhat higher ground . But even there the fruit orchards and gardens stood in a foot of muddy water , and the handsome pink gravel of the walks and drives was washed into the lawn , and the newly slanted tiers and shrubs i --  Leah 's walled garden were uprooted ; and it was . t terrible sight , the drowned creatures everywhere  --  not only wild animals hut some of the household cats and dogs , and many of the gamep266fowl , and a pet black goat belonging to one of the boys . A number of Bellefleur workers had to evacuate their cottages and the low barrackstypebuilding at the edge of the swamp ; they were moved by truck to temporary quarters in the village , at the Bellefleurs ' expense , and of course the Bellefleurs volunteered to pay for their food and clothing , and to reimburse them for their losses in the flood . Elsewhere , on other Bellefleur-owned property , there was considerable damage , the most grievous being the loss of an entire herd of Holsteins , drowned when a creek overflowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on low ground . At the castle the cellar was flooded ( the cellar was always flooded , even in minor rainstorms ) ; many windows were broken ; slate was torn from the roof and flung for hundreds of yards . Every chimney was damaged , every ceiling was water-stained . When the Bellefleurs , at the height of the storm , at last remembered great-grandmother Elvira , and hurried up to her room , they found the poor old woman in her rocking chair , in a virtual rain that fell from the ceiling . She had pulled her black cashmere shawl up over her head , and though she was shivering , she did not seem especially pleased to see them . She 'd sent her maid away hours ago , she said , because she wanted to enjoy the storm in private ; and so she had enjoyed it , despite the dripping ceiling and the terrible cold . She had particularly liked , she said , the lightning flashes over the lake . She seemed to have forgotten , or perhaps did not care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that a great celebration had been planned : which of course would not now take place . So the storm passed by , leaving damage and heartbreak in its wake , and next morning the Bellefleurs looked out to see a transformed world : ponds everywhere , great puddles of water that , reflecting the sky , looked like glassy lead , fallen trees , small mountains of debris that would have to be cleared away . The men  --  Gideon , Ewan , even Vernon , even grandfatherNoel  --  made their way by foot down to the village , to help with the flood relief ; Cornelia talked of " opening the castle doors " to the homeless . In the end , however , the only flood victim who was taken in was an elderly man discovered by one of the boys over in the barnyard jammed against the stone foundation of the stable . At first , the boy said , he naturally thought it was a corpse : but it was n't a corpse : the poor old man was alive ! So they brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted to walk , and Dr. Jensen was summoned , and he was laid , half-unconscious , in one of the downstairs maids ' rooms . A very elderly man  --  with a livid . scar on his forehead  --  toothless  --  his cheeks sunken  --  his skin cancellate , as if it had been soaked for some time  --  his ragged clothing in shreds  --  his arms and legs hardly more than sticks , he was so thin . Though his pulse beat was weak it was a pulse heat , and he was able , with difficulty , and with much dribbling , to drink some broth Cornelia gave him . Ah ,  |p267how  pathetic ! He spoke incoherently  --  did not seem to know his name , or where he had come from  --  or what had happened  --  that there had been a terrible storm , and that he had been caught in it . You are safe now , they told him . Try to sleep . We 've called a doctor . Nothing can happen to you now . When the men returned they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against pillows , blinking dazedly at them , his toothless mouth shifting into a hesitant smile . A miracle , they said , that he had n't been drowned . ( And he was such a very old man , and so very frail . ) But he was safe now . And he could stay with them as long as he needed . " This is Bellefleur Manor , " Noel said , standing at his bedside . " You 're welcome to stay here as long as you like , until your people come to claim you . You do n't remember your name . . . ? " The old man blinked and shook his head no , uncertainly . His cheekboneswere so sharp they seemed about to push through his veined skin . In the late afternoon great-grandmother Elvira came downstairs to see him , followed by her cat , a white-and-bluish-gray female , and when she came to the foot of his bed she fumbled in her pocket , and took out her spectacles . She peered at the old man through her glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doze , and he peered at her , smiling his uncertain smile . The cat leapt up onto the bed , making a querulous mewing sound ; it began to knead its paws against the old man 's thigh . For some minutes great-grandmother Elvira and the elderly man stared at each other . And then Elvira took off her spectacles , and thrust them back in her pocket , and mumbled , " . . . old fool . " And she gathered up Minerva and left the room without another word.  |p268In  the mountains , in those days , there was always music . A music composed of many voices . High above the mist-shrouded river . In the thin cold many-faceted light . Ice , was it ?  --  or sunshine ? Or the teasing mountain spirits ( which must have to do with God , since they live on the Holy Mountain where the Devil dare not appear ) ? Many voices , plaintive and alluring and combative and taunting and lovely , achingly lovely , so very very lovely one 's soul is drawn out .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . fine , thin , about to break ... . God ? Jedediah cried in his ecstasy . Is this God ? But not God , for God remained hidden . In the mountains , in those days , there was always music . Catching at one 's soul . Seductive , yearning , frail as girls ' voices in the distance . . . . But not God . For God remained hidden . Coy and stubborn and hidden . Oblivious of Jedediah 's impassioned plea . Make haste , 0 God , to deliver me ; make haste to help me , 0 Lord . Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul : let them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt . ( For his father 's spies prowled the Holy Mountain , despite the danger of God 's wrath . Defiling the clear bright cold sky , the snowcap easing downward , downward , one day soon to swallow up the entire world in its frigid cleansing purity . . . . He saw them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their mocking voices , " echoing " his most secret , most silent prayers . ) God 's blessing is not always to be distinguished from His wrath . ConsequentlyJedediah did not know  --  should he fall to his knees in gratitudep269to God , that he could hear ( and sometimes even feel ) the presence of his enemies ?  --  or should he beg God to diminish the power ( now grown extraordinary , and frequently painful ) of his senses , particularly his sense of hearing ? 0 give thanks unto the Lord ,  --  call upon His name : make known His deeds among the people . Sing unto Him , sing psalms unto Him : talk ye of all His wondrous works . Seek the Lord , and His strength : seek His face evermore . In those days there was always music but perhaps it was not always God 's music . The voices , for instance . Quarreling and chattering and teasing . God wo n't show His face , whyever should He !  --  to a comical wretch like you ! ( So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot of rabbit stew and flinging it against the wall . And why ? Just for meanness . For deviltry . ) Keep not thou silence , 0 God : hold not thy peace , and be not still , 0 God . A voice , lightly jeering : Keep not thou silence , 0 God : hold not thy peace . . . . But with a false , wicked emphasis : Keep not thou silence , 0 God : hold not thy peace , and be not still , 0 God . . . . ( As if the spirits were mocking someone of very limited intelligence . Halfwitted or retarded . Brain-damaged . Senile . ) In the mountains , in those days , the gigantic white bird with the naked red-skinned head appeared frequently , as if in response to a thoughtless utterance of Jedediah 's . ( For just as he could hear so keenly , so could other creatures hear keenly . If he stepped on a twig all of the mountain was alerted . If one of his monstrous coughing attacks overcame him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . Its shadow , deceptivelylight , scudding across the stony ground . And then , suddenly overhead , its hideous shrieking : so that Jedediah 's heart nearly leapt out of his chest : and it was all he could do , to beat the creature away with the hardwood cudgel he carried with him everywhere . Pray God , beg God , plead with God , Louis 's wife teased , pinching at his ribs , and what sails along but that nasty old bird . The bird gave off a terrible stench  --  it must have been its breath , fetid as if its very bowels were rotten . Behold the fowls of the air . Seek ye first the kingdom of God . The spirits brushed near , nearer than the bird dared , and pretended to take his side . God is n't listening , God is busy down in the flatland , God has betrayed you . Throw that silly old Bible down into the river ! ( Ah , but it was one of ' the surprises of Jedediah 's life , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff .... He could not believe it but there it was : someone had thrown it there : and it took him the better part of a morning , and cost him many cruel welts and scratches , to retrieve it . Even so , several pages were ripped away , and - nany pages were damaged . His bowels writhed with disgust and anger , and could he have laid hands on that bright-eyed spirit , what : night he have done top270her ! I would show no mercy , he whispered , weeping , because you deserve no mercy . ) But the outrageous incident had the effect , at least , of loosening his bowels . For poor Jedediah , though he prayed God for relief , suffered cruelly from constipation . In the winter especially . In the winter , certainly . He had built a crude little outhouse in a thicket some distance from the cabin , hidden from the cabin . Bodily functions had always disquieted him . Not-to-be-thought-of , so he commonly silenced certain thoughts . Except when the pain overtook him deep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the spirits , aghast , fled his torment . The outhouse , of skinned pine ; and a sturdier chimney ; and a pretty little piece of stained glass , about a foot square , in a window facing east ( sent up by way of Henofer , along with other unwanted things  --  a bright turquoiseblue with beige and red lines  --  silly , vain , breakable  --  but undeniablypretty  --  and , he supposed , harmless : a gift from his brother 's wife down below ) ; a shallow well halfway down the mountain into which spring water ran for several months of the year . " You 're going to stay here forever , are you ? " Henofer laughed , rubbing his cracked hands briskly and looking about . lust like me ! just like me ! " Henofer and his letters , supplies , gossip , news of the War . ( To which Jedediah only vaguely listened . For what did God care of the paltry doings of men  --  their lust for territory , for goods , for dominion over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke passionately of the surrender of Fort Mackinaw . An allied force of British and Indians had captured it . And there was Fort Dearborn : captured by Indians : and most of the garrison including women and children had been slaughtered . By a general order issued from the War Department the state militia were arranged in two divisions and eight brigades , and thousands of men would soon see battle . The war was necessary ; at the same time Henofer did not quite understand its background ; nor did he ( and naturally Jedediahdid not ask , being too courteous ) intend to enlist . He was supplying hides to Alexander Macomb and doing quite well . Quite well . Did Jedediahknow who Alexander Macomb was ? Formerly a partner of John Jacob Astor who was worth ( so rumor had it ) $10,000,000 ; could Jedediahcomprehend what $10,000,000 was ? No ? Yes ? Of course Macomb was not as wealthy but he was a rich man and perhaps it would interest Jedediah to know that his father Jean-Pierre had had some dealings with Macomb not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of Macomb 's trading posts , out near Kittery , had been burnt to the ground . " Lightning was the cause , " Henofer said , laughing , wiping his eyes . But then some months later the Innisfail Lodge , which Jean-Pierre had owned , was burnt to the ground as well . However . . . the Innisfail Lodge was said to have been substantially insured . But of course Jedediah knewp271So he chattered , pulling his filthy woollen cap down low on his forehead . He chewed tobacco and spat onto Jedediah 's hearth . Edgy , restless , he could hardly remain seated on the stump before the fire , but kept pulling at his cap and his beard , and looking around the cabin  --  staring and assessing and memorizing  --  in preparation for his report to the Bellefleurs down below . For of course he was a paid spy . And of course he knew that Jedediah must have known . Nevertheless Jedediah remained courteous , for God dwelled with him ; or at any rate the promise , the hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , humble and soft-spoken and willing to turn the other cheek if necessary . He could not be stirred to anger by Henofer 's slovenly presence , or even by the obscene anecdotes he rattled off ( a half-breed Mohawk woman raped by a small gang of Bushkill 's Ferry men , out by the lumber mill , and turned loose in the snow , naked and bleeding and out of her mind : the Varrells had their fun there , Henofer said , wiping his eyes ) , or boisterous farfetched tales of the war , which were sometimes meant to inspire mirth and sometimes patriotism . In Sackett 's Harbor , it seemed , five British ships with eighty-two guns began an assault against the Oneida . ... After two hours of firing it was found that most of the shots on both sides had fallen short . Finally a thirty-two-pound ball was fired by the British , and struck the earth harmlessly , ploughing a deep furrow ; and a sergeant picked it up and ran to his captain saying , " I 've been playing ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again . " And the ball was fitted into the American cannon , and fired back at the enemy , with such force that it struck the stern of the flagship of the attacking squadron , raking her completely , and sending splinters high into the air .... Fourteen men were killed outright and eighteen were wounded . And so the enemy retreated while a band on shore played , " Yankee Doodle . " What , Henofer asked passionately , did Jedediah think of that ? Henofer would not be seeing Jedediah again until the following April . Which was a very long time away . Yet it came quickly : all too quickly . And Henofer returned , cheerful and garrulous as always , with more war news to which Jedediah did not listen . Or perhaps it was n't the following April but the very next week . Or the previous April . At any rate there was his halloo in the clearing , and his grizzled pitted face with the gap-toothed grin . ( No matter that he must have known Jedediah was sabotaging his traps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead or dying or grievously wounded creatures to throw them down into the oblivion of the river . ) It might have been the previous April , the April before the pane of stained glass was brought to Jedediah . Time pleated and rippled . Since God dwelt above time , Jedediah took no heed of time . When he glanced back at his life  --  his life as Jedediah Amos l rllefle  --  ur  --  he saw how minute that life was , how quickly the mountains with their thousands of lakes swallowed it up. lenoler disappeared , grumbling at Jedediah 's silence . He took his re/notes . As a prank he left a wolf 's skull behind  --  hardly more than the jawbone , really  --  on Jedediah 's granite ledge , facing the Holy Mountain . Why he had done it Jedediah would never know . Perhaps God had used Henofer to send a message . . . ? Jedediah contemplated the thing , which was bleached white , and oddly beautiful . He saw himself snatch it up and throw it off the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the stone hearth before his fireplace . Are you testing me ? Jedediah whispered . Outside the cabin spirits hummed in their nervous high-pitched manner . Jedediah was able to ignore them , as he ignored the girl 's fingers poking and prodding inside his trousers . God ? Are you testing me ? Are you watching ? he called aloud . The jaws , the clean white-bleached jaws . Ravenous appetite : God 's . Jedediah woke , startled . He had been dreaming of an angry man , a man shouting and waving his fists at God . But the man was himself : he had been shouting . To do penance he slept outside for several nights , naked , on the granite ledge . Beneath the freezing winking stars . He brought the jawbonewith him because it was a sign , it had to do with his sinfulness , though he did not understand it . Why am I here , what have I done , how have I displeased You ? he pleaded . But there was no reply . The jawbone was silent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay upon day , and the sun but feebly rose at midmorning , and the castle  --  the world itself  --  was locked in ice that would never melt , then the children slept two or three in a bed , swathed in layers of clothing , with long fluffy angora socks pulled up to their knees ; then there were , throughout the day , cups of steaming hot chocolate with marshmallows that , half-melted , stuck wonderfully to the roof of the mouth ; afternoons of sledding followed by long lazy hours before the fireplace , listening to stories . What is the curse on the family , one of the children might ask , not for the first time , and the answer might be  --  depending upon who was t here  --  that there was no curse , such talk was silly ; or it might be that the nature of the curse was such ( perhaps the nature of all curses is such ? ) that those who are burdened with it can not speak of it .

If uncle Hiram was morose and oblique , others  --  grandmother Cornelia , for instance , and aunt Aveline , and cousin Vernon , and sometimes even ( when his breath smelled sweet with bourbon , and his poor misshapenfoot ached so that , stretched out luxuriously before the huge fieldstone fireplace in the parlor , the second-warmest room in the house , he pulled off his shoe and massaged the fi-ot and pushed it daringly close to the  --  fire ) grandfather Noel  --  were surprisingly generous with their wot cls , and seemed to he drawn , pet flaps by the high-leaping crackling flames of the birch logs , into disturhing labyrinthian tales the children perhaps should not have been told : would n't have been told , surely , byp274daylight . But only if no other adult were present . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret and not to be repeated  --  so the very best of the stories began . The stories , it seemed , always had to do with " fateful mismatches . " ( This was the quaint term employed by the older women  --  they must have inherited from their mothers and grandmothers . But Yolande quite liked it . Fateful mismatches  --  ! Do you think , when we grow up , she whispered to Christabel , giggling and shivering , do you think that might happen to us ? ) While most Bellefleur marriages were certainly excellent ones , and husband and wife supremely suited for each other , and no one would dare question their love , or the wisdom of their parents in consenting to the marriage , or , in many cases , arranging for it  --  still  --  still there were , from time to time , however infrequently , fateful mismatches . Is n't it strange , people said , that the Bellefleur stories are all about love going wrong ?  --  when of course , most of the time , ninety-nine times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noel laughed behind clouds of foul pipe smoke .... Yes indeed , he said , most of the time things go perfectly well . I 've noticed that . It was Yolande herself , at the precocious age of nine , who said , after having heard a fascinating ( and convoluted : for it was necessarily expurgatedfor the ears of children ) story about her father 's oldest brother Raoul , her uncle Raoul whom she had never once seen , who clearly lived in one of the strangest imaginable households , and lived in it happily enough  --  it was pretty little Yolande who exclaimed ; " The curse on us is that we ca n't love right ! " She was immediately hushed up . And cautioned never to say such a bizarre thing again , or even to think it . The very idea ! Bellefleurs , after all , prided themselves on the depth and passion and longevity of their love . But to her brother Raphael she whispered , half in fear , " Oh , but what if it 's the truth  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can love right ! " Her distress was such , one could not have said whether it was spontaneous or acquired ; for even as a young child Yolande had been fond of exaggeration . The trouble was , the tragedy was , no one cared to hear about the wonderful marriages . Wife and husband bound together for life , and happily ; or at any rate not unhappily ; who cared ? In the midst of the children 's very world , for instance , there was the example of Garth and Little Goldie : forgiven almost at once for their recklessness in eloping , given a handsome little stone-and-stucco cottage on several acres of wooded land in Bellefleur Village , and the promise of as much financial support as Garth wished  --  though Garth , newly self-confident , and freed for the first time in memory of his waspish ill-temper , declared that he would earn every penny of the salary the family paid him for his help in managing the farms . There they were , two young people in love , handsomeGarth and lovely Little Goldie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there to say about them ?  |p275By  contrast , there was a great deal to say about love gone wrong . And disagreements too . The children were awed by their elders quarreling among themselves , about who had loved whom most , or first , or why a love affair had gone wrong , whether it had been poisoned from within or without , whether it was part of the curse or just a bad accident . ... Whether a love had been " tragic " or just plain " shameful ... " Everyone knew of the Onondagan Indian woman with whom Jeani'ierrelived for several years , and with whom he died , in Bushkill 's Ferry ( her name was Antoinette  --  she had been baptized Catholic , and named for Marie Antoinette whose son , the Dauphin  --  King Louis XVII  --  was commonly believed to have escaped to the Chautauqua mountains ) ; the match was considered a wicked one , though not half so wicked as it would have been had the old man actually married the woman . But few people knew of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' his wedding to poor Hilda Osborne , many years previously . He may have just returned from his honeymoon at the time ( a two-month trip through the South , culminating with a grand ball in the newlyweds ' honor at Chapell Hall in Charlottesville , Virginia ) , or he may in fact have begun the liaison while still an engaged man : but the shame of it was , he took as a mistress a coarse lumber-camp follower named Lucille who had lived with a succession of men in the Lake Noir area , and so alternated his attentions between this woman in the country and his lawful wife Hilda in Manhattan ( where they lived , supported by the Osbornes ' generosity , in the palatial brownstone originally built by George Washington 's aide " Baron de Steuben , " and lavishly remodeled by the Osbornes ) , that the two women  --  so different in quality , in temperament , in beauty , in worth !  --  were made pregnant by him within the same week . Lucille  --  " Brown Lucy "  --  remained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even her name  --  and it was n't known at what point in Jean-Pierre 's ambitious career he jettisoned the woman . As late as 1795 , when Hilda first attempted to file for divorce , he was said to have been involved with a north country woman , presumably Lucille ; there were children now  --  three or four , at least , all sons  --  but how ( so Jean-Pierre as well as his sympathetic friends asked , laughing ) , how could one be certain whose - sons were whose , when a woman of such promiscuous morals as this " Brown Lucy " was involved  --  1 By the time Jean-Pierre ran for Congress in 1797 the woman had been dropped from his life , for pragmatic reasons . ( And then , as he explained , when drunk , to anyone who would listen , even to his son Louis and his daughter-in-law Germaine , he had n't loved her any more than he had loved the other one , his wife : both women were desperate stratagems to keep him from throwing himself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever loved was lost to him when he was still a young man .... ) Of flat lan Bellelleur 's women little was known  --  he was said to have been invoked , tot a brief ' while , with the widow of a saloonkeeper somewhere in Ohio , and was said to have had , in unclear succession , not onlyp276a full-blooded Chippewa " wife " but a Haitian " wife " as well ; and in the crumpled papers found on his person , after his death , there was a scribbledmessage for his " sole heir " in New Orleans , about whom no one knew anything  --  except that , as an officer of sorts alongside Jean and Pierre Laffite , in Andrew Jackson 's militia ( made up of sailors , backwoods riflemen , Creoles , Santo Domingan Negroes , and Baratarian pirates ) , he had had occasion to spend some time in New Orleans in late 1814 and the early weeks of 1815 .

Perhaps the marriage was a good one . No one knew , since Raphael and Violet rarely exchanged a word in public ; in fact , after some eight or nine years of marriage they were rarely seen together except at the most public , the most social , of events  --  at which they were extremely courteous to each other , with the graciousness normally reserved for strangers who suspect they will not get along , and who are accordingly all the more congenial . ( Judging from the portrait that remained , Violet Odlin possessed a frail , faded , nervously intense kind of beauty , and her wedding dress with its hundreds of pearls and its eight-foot-long veil of Belgian lace had a waist so tiny  --  seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been hardly larger than a child . Indeed , it was the only dress in the family that Christabel could wear for her wedding , and even then they had to squeeze her rather brutally into it . ) The tragedy of Samuel Bellefleur 's " love match " was well known despite the Bellefleurs ' attempts to keep it secret , and to this day a worried adult might wonder aloud whether , when a child was behaving badly , he or she might also go over to the other side . ( The crude expression take up with Negroes was sometimes used as well . ) Hiram 's marriage to unhappy Eliza Perkins lasted hardly more than a year , but could not be said , even initially , to have been a love match ; and though Della 's ill-fated marriage to Stanton Pym was a love match , on her testimony at least , it came to an abrupt and tragic conclusion , albeit an accidental conclusion , after only a few months . And then there was Raoul , about whom no one dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was the " love match " of poor Hepatica Bellefleur . Hepatica lived a very long time ago , but her example was often raised when Bellefleur girls behaved in a headstrong manner . You know what happened to Hepatica  --  1 their mothers said . And even the boldest of the girls grew sober . Hepatica was a very pretty , and very spoiled , young girl of sixteenp277when she fell in love with the man who called himself Duane Doty Fox . ( When , in subsequent years , Jeremiah became acquainted with relatives of the legitimate Duane Doty  --  the Wisconsin land speculator and circuit judge of some renown  --  they claimed to have never heard of " Duane Doty Fox . " Which was unsurprising . ) Sunny , even-tempered , sometimes a little childish , Hepatica had long wavy hair in coloring rather like Yolande 's , and a fondness for concocting , as often as the cook would allow , elaborate fanciful dishes of her own invention  --  a **27;7351;TOOLONG mousse , an extremelysweet syllabub , a **27;7380;TOOLONG tart that was a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , being a wealthy young Bellefleur heiress , and a strikingly pretty one as well , she had innumerable suitors , among them several very desirable young men ( and some no longer young , precisely , but desirable just the same for various practical reasons ) : but without so much as asking her parents permission , she turned them all rudely down . I do n't ever want to get married , she said , making a fastidious little moue ; I do n't want all that fuss . But then , one warm April afternoon , while being driven home from the village ( where she frequently visited with the rector 's daughter  --  the only girl in the vicinity who was not too embarrassingly a social inferior ) she happened to see , working with a small gang of laborers alongside the read , a most unusual young man . He was tall  --  he was shirtless  --  he wore a straw hat pulled low over his forehead  --  and as the Bellefleur two-seater passed he raised his head slowly , with the unhurried calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had yet to discover pain at the hands of human beings : and stared openly at Hepatica in her yellow polka-dot frock and bonnet . No other man in the area would have dared look at her in quite that way ; even small children , living in the vicinity of the castle , were cautioned not to stare . But how silly he was , Hepatica thought , shirtless , gleaming with perspiration , his chest hair furry and frizzy  --  how wonderfully hilarious ! ( for it was extraordinary , the sight of a bare-chested man , particularly along the lakefront road  --  which was very nearly a private road of the Rcllefleurs , though in theory it was open to anyone . Most unusual , lcpatica thought . Most strange . ) She saw too that he was handsome , though swarthy-skinned ; and bearded ( and she was not at all certain road , lowering his pickax t't gaze at her , his face strong and broad and deeply tanned , his eyes very dark ; dark but gleaming ; intensely gleaming  --  or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and ridicule him , to whoever would listen , ho she kept thinking about hint , thinking and thinking about him , and at the mere suggestion of a walk to the village . or even down to the lake , het heart flutte  --  to ( l so that she felt almost faint . Whet e . t mole modest ( ot at least a mote pt talent ) gill would have waited ten cm ( ) until the young man again by accident , hepatica , actingp278with a single-minded impetuosity more suitable , perhaps , in one of her brothers , made inquiries among the servants and the villagers , and soon learned that the young man , new to the area ( he had just come down from Canada , it was believed , and had lived for a while previously in Wisconsin ) , was a blacksmith 's assistant and a laborer-for-hire in the village ; and his name was Duane Doty Fox . Did he have any family ? shameless Hepatica asked . Did he have a wife ? Evidently he had no one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , exactly , he lived . Ah , but did n't he live in the village ? Hepatica asked . He worked in the village but he lived , so far as anyone knew , up in the woods . A strange , quiet , unfriendly man . . . though he was said to be an excellent worker . And so one fine spring day Hepatica walked to the village , accompanied by a servant girl whom she sent off on an errand of embarrassing flimsiness , and , quite alone , quite fearless , she strode directly to the blacksmith 's shop ( where her family never did business , since at that time the Bellefleurs employed their own blacksmith ) , and met with Duane Doty Fox . It is n't known what they talked of , at that first meeting  --  the conversation must have been awkward and strained  --  Hepatica must have been somewhat embarrassed  --  though perhaps ( she was a marvelously inventive and imaginative child , and told lies with such a pretty flair that they never seemed serious ) she simply prattled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She might have asked him about Canada , what sort of Indians and wild beasts lived there ; or about Wisconsin ; or what he thought of the new President ; or any flibbertigibbet thing that flew into her head . And so they met , and fell in love . Hepatica Bellefleur and the swarthy stranger known only as Duane Doty Fox : and it was a measure of Hepatica 's precocious ingenuity that they contrived to meet some five or six times ( always in the woods , or along a little-frequented stretch of Lake Noir ; once on the banks of Bloody Run , high above the water ) without arousing the family 's suspicions . Just when the first of the gossip made its way to the manor , Hepatica , her eyes shining , brought Fox into the castle itself and introduced him  --  introduced him as her husband-to-be . There was her tiny white hand in his enormous grimy first  --  there was her curly wheat-colored hair beside his shoulder . It was not even a question of love , Hepatica said bluntly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the other and that was that . . . . The family objected , as one might expect . But Hepatica , perhaps telling the truth and perhaps not , simply whispered something in her mother 's ear ; something feverish and secret and unsurprising . And so the engagement took place . And then the wedding  --  a private wedding attended by only a few Bellefleurs , in the old manor chapel.  |p279Are  you happy ? Hepatica 's girl cousins asked enviously . She had only to smile at them , showing her lovely white teeth , and they knew the answer . But there was something alarming ( or so they liked to say , afterward ) about the intensity of feeling in her . . . . It was overwroughtand exaggerated and unhealthy . Why , just to see that big dark brute squeeze his bride 's hand in his , and smile his hesitant but unmistakablysensual smile . . . ! Just to be near the couple , and sense the unrestrainedpassion of their " love " .. . The Bellefleurs were generous , however , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Mink Creek , with the promise of assistance whenever Fox should request it , and the promise  --  unstated , but quite tangible  --  to Hepatica that she might return at any time . ( For she was n't the first Bellefleur to have married impetuously . And she might very well , like some of the others , wake one morning to a realization of her mistake . ) Now time passed : weeks and months and part of a year . And the young couple kept to themselves . Though frequently invited to the manor they never came . Hepatica 's parents were heartbroken ; and then angry ; and bewildered ; and again heartbroken ; but what was to be done ? They drove out to the farm as often as they dared ( not being invited ) , and spent an empty hour or so with Hepatica , who looked and behaved much the same as usual , and insisted that she adored being an old-fashioned wife who did her own cooking and baking and housecleaning . ( Though the house hardly looked clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tea served in Sevres cups already cracked , tasted lardy  --  not at all the sort of thing she had made at home . ) Duane Doty Fox stayed out in the field , working . Or in the barn . Working . Shirtless , with his dirty straw hat set rakishly on his head , in manure-splattered boots . He did no more than wave a pawlike hand at his in-laws , ducking into a doorway , turning away out of shyness or indifference . How crude he was , their new son-in-law ! How clumsy , how barely human ! And then one of Hepatica 's uncles encountered Fox at a supply store beside the lake , and was astonished at the sight of him : for he had n't remembered his niece 's fiancee as quite so dark and hairy . And he was gruff as well : mumbled in so guttural a voice the storekeeper could hardly understand him . His muscular shoulders were somewhat stooped , and his neck was thick , and his beard was tangled and snarled . Worst of all , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A nasal sound that was part a grunt and part a snarl . . . and that was all . Imagine , so primitive a man married into the Bellefleur family ... ! During the long winter they kept to themselves , but soon after the first thaw Hepatica arrived at the manor , unaccompanied  --  she 'd just ridden over fin- an afternoon 's visit , she said , and did n't want anyone to make a fuss . Though she kept up a steady stream of chatter  --  charming and girlish and entertaining as always  --  she was obviously unhappy , and there were sad dark dents beneath her eyes . But to every question she replied in the same bright Insouciant way , saying only that it was a pityp280Duane could n't be talked into coming along  --  but he was so shy , he was so very shy  --  he hoped they would understand . ( Was Hepatica pregnant ? The question could n't be asked , and she gave no hints . But she was distressed about something , despite her frivolousconversation . ) From time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was something of a joke , at first , how coarse and bearish he had become . Hepatica 's cooking , perhaps ? Or had he always inclined toward stoutness ? His beard was no bushier than ever , perhaps , but now hair grew on his throat , and no doubt on his shoulders . There were tufts of thick hair on the backs of his hands . His eyes , which had been of ordinary size in the past , so far as anyone remembered , now looked small and close-set ; even rather stupidly cruel . ( Was he drinking ? Was he drunk when they met him ? He always brushed past or turned away , often without even a grunted hello . ) They joked of " Fox , " saying that he had n't the comeliness of a red or even a gray fox ; he had n't a fox 's intelligent grace . His hair resembled thick dark quills , heavy with oil . And his nose . . . his nose had become somewhat flattened , had n't it . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bellefleurs , despite their affection for Hepatica , could not resist jests of a coarse nature ; and such jests  --  as the men readily admitted  --  required a certain distortion of human reality . ) Hepatica came to visit her mother more and more frequently , and sometimes she began weeping as soon as she arrived ; but she never explained what was wrong . Asked why she was crying she would say lightly , Oh , I just feel sad ! or , I 'm such a silly girl , was n't I always a silly girl , do n't take any notice of me ! But they noticed that she was thinner ( and she had always been a slight , nervous little thing ) , and that she blinked her eyes rapidly while she spoke , and looked out the window frequently . There were bruises on her wrist and neck . There was an odd long wavering scratch on the back of her left hand . Oh , that 's just a cat scratch ! she said , laughing . Do n't take any notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't like to move back to the manor ? Her room was in readiness for her , unchanged ; she could at least stay a few nights ; and perhaps everything could be discussed ... . But there 's nothing to be " discussed , " she said listlessly . I love my husband and he loves me . There 's nothing else . He loves you  --  he truly loves you ? Oh , yes . And you love him ? Well  --  yes . You do love him ? Yes . Hepatica  --  ? I said yrs.  |p281She  spoke emphatically but with an air of bewilderment . As if she did not quite know what to say . . . only what ought to be said . Leaving the manor she turned to her mother , and embraced her , and seemed about to burst into tears ; but she restrained herself . I do n't know , Mamma , if anything is wrong . I 've never been married before , the poor child whispered . After that she stayed away for months . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her , Fox met them in the driveway , and said , or seemed to say ( for they could barely understand his slurred words ) that 1 lepatica was " resting " and was n't " receiving visitors . " Now it was clear that Fox had changed considerably . He could no longer be considered even remotely attractive . His teeth were tobaccostained , he gave off a fetid , meaty odor , tufts of hair grew alarmingly on the backs of his hands and high on his cheeks , and his eyebrows , which had always been thick and glowering , had gone wild . His hair was greasy , tumbling to his massive , muscle-choked shoulders ; his small cruel redrimmedeyes glared like a beast 's . He was a beast . It was suddenly quite clear  --  both Hepatica 's father and her uncle realized the fact , at the same moment  --  quite clear , that Hepatica had married a beast . A bear , it was . A black bear . ( Though he was several inches taller than the fullgrownblack bear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Unwittingly , the poor innocent girl had fallen in love with , and married , a black bear . They went away , shaken . And returned home where they talked of nothing else . To convince the others ( who did not really need convincing , of course ) they imitated Hepatica 's husband , stooping and grunting as he ( lid , with their arms hanging loose , and their eyes murderously narrowed . ' They snarled that Hepatica was resting and not receiving visitors ; they ran their hands violently through their hair , and fluffed out their beards . It was alarming , how successfully they imitated him  --  imitated a halfhumanbear . For he was a black bear . No matter how improbable , how incredible , it might seem . A black bear who had cynically named himself " Fox " ! ... And what might they do , to rescue poor Hepatica ? ( " What do you think they did ? " the Bellefleur children were asked . At first they did not reply  --  they stared into the fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls said in a whisper : " Hunted him down , the nasty thing ! " ) So indeed they hunted him down ; but not immediately . Not immediately . Fit thew had to be certain . And they did n't want to endanger I Icpatica . She did not fe  --  tutn to the ( nano ( to visit , howe vet , and as the weeks payed the Bellelleurs ( who were obsessed with their girl 's tragedy ) grewp282more and more impassioned . Though Hepatica had seemed adamant about loving him , and even more adamant about his loving her , it was clear that something must be done : she could n't remain married to a beast : she would have to be rescued . In the end , not quite with her parents ' knowledge , a group of young Bellefleur men and their friends rode out one night to the farm , their shotguns across their saddles . They dismounted a quarter-mile from the farmhouse , careful that the wind blew into their faces ; they were far more cautious than if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear-Man must have sensed their approach , for when they burst into the house he was out of bed , staggering toward them , his teeth exposed in a hideous snarl that rose to a shriek . He was naked , of course  --  yet covered with thick greasy hair  --  everywhere , even on the backs of his toes  --  covered with thick dark greasy hair . They fired at him . But he kept coming . Swatting at them with his great clawed hands  --  managing to rake one of the men viciously in the cheek  --  catching another in the eye . Never had they heard such unearthly shrieking , they testified afterward . In all , they emptied the contents of six double-barreled shotguns into him , two at exceedingly close range , before , it seemed , he finally died . ( And the cub , what of the cub ?  --  what did they do with the cub ? There was n't any cub , they swore . But somehow it was disclosed , months or even years later , that there had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Though the young men involved in the raid always denied it . There was no cub ? There was no cub . And what of Hepatica ? She withdrew from the world afterward , and eventually entered a French house of the order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel  --  much to her parents ' distress , for they were bitterly anti-Catholic. )  |p283Somewhat  reluctantly , yet not with the pouty self-pitying resistance her somber face seemed to declare ( for though she did n't love him she did n't know she did n't love him , not knowing at that time what love should have been ; and anyway since the burning of Johnny Doan on Germaine 's first birthday she had such terrifying nightmares , she yearned to escape the castle ) , Christabel consented , meekly enough , to be wed to Edgar Holleran von Schaff III , the **32;7409;TOOLONG of the Revolutionary hero Baron von Schaff . Edgar was a widower with two children , a wealthy man who owned , among other things , a chain of newspapers throughout the state . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lund , a U.S. Senator for many years ; she had died while still in her twenties , in a tragic hunting accident at Silver Lake . Though Edgar 's puffy , ruddy , creased moonish face was that of a man of middle age , he was in fact only thirty-eight years old . And he adored , as he frequently said , both in person and by hand-delivered letter , dear little Christabel . Edgar had inherited , along with the newspapers , beautiful Schaff Hall at Silver Lake , some fifty miles from Bellefleur Manor , and the original 25,000 acres of fertile valley land deeded Baron von Schaff by the state , as payment for his services in the Revolutionary War . ( The baron  --  whose nobility was questioned only by the envious  --  had been an officer in the Prussian Army , who emigrated to America at the request of General George Washington in order to train soldiers at Valley Forge . Ile later became major general and inspector general of the United States Army , where he served from 1777 to 1784 . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German professionals , a United States citizen ; and in addition to the land given him in the Nautauga Valley he owned 30,000 acres in Virginia and 5,000 in eastern New Jersey  --  not thep284grandest of empires , but a highly respectable one . ) Schaff Hall , a Greek revival mansion with some twenty-five rooms , and six Doric columns , and a superb view of Silver Lake , was erected by the baron 's grandson , a contemporary of Raphael Bellefleur 's , in 1850 ; it was said that forty yoke of oxen were required to haul the enormous limestone slab on the front portico . But on her first visit to Schaff Hall Christabel , gnawing at her thumb , was not impressed . The gilded wooden eagle over the front door looked , she said , as if termites had riddled it through , and the house was n't anywhere near as big as Bellefleur Manor . " Do n't be silly , " Leah said , squeezing her daughter 's hand , hard , in a little spasm of affection . " Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , not having seen Christabel for a while , were appalled that so young a child was even being considered for matrimony ; but when they did see her  --  tall , lithe , selfpossessed ( though that was only an aspect of her terror ) , with her small shapely breasts and her uplifted chin  --  they were forced to agree , with Leah and Cornelia , that she was certainly mature enough to be wed . After all , many Bellefleur brides had been very young , and in every case  --  in nearly every case  --  the matches were excellent ones . How strange , for Bromwell , grandmother Della said , Christabel 's more than a head taller than he is , and while he looks like a little boy , still , no more than ten , she looks like a young woman of eighteen . . . ! Leah stared at her mother for several seconds , frowning . But why , Mamma , she said finally , why should it be strange for Bramwell ? I do n't understand you . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins . Christable was required to meet with Edgar only three times , and always , to her relief , in the presence of others . Arrangements between the two families were made : papers signed , contracts sealed . The fuss she loathed took place somewhere beyond her exact awareness , which pleased her , though she came briefly alive at her bridal shower , cutting a wonderful six-tier angel food cake Edna had baked , with the special whipped frosting , vanilla threaded with apricot , Christabel loved : what pleasure it was , she thought suddenly , cutting cake for her girl cousins and friends . . . ! She had wished the lively little party , held in the remodeled Ivory Room , would never end . Some weeks later she was married , snugly buttoned into **30;7443;TOOLONG wedding dress , with its magnificent long train and its hundreds of pearls and the lace veil that was , even to Christabel 's skeptical eye , beautiful ( though , clowning beforehand with her maids of honor , she draped it over her head and sucked it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Though " Edgar "  --  she did not call him that , did not call him anything , thought frequently of him as if him were a nebulous shapeless not exactly malevolent presence  --  though " Edgar " accompanied her hack from the altar of the Lutheran church , his hand gripping hers somewhat less firmly than Leah had gripped it that morning , she was not required to speak with him , or even to acknowledgep285him in any particular , any detailed way . And the wedding party was a merry one . And the farewell , afterward , on the front walk of the manor , was very moving : hoydenish cynical Christabel actually burst into tears ... Farewell , farewell . She hugged and kissed them all , one by one . Her mother , looking radiantly beautiful in a turquoise gown ; her father , stooping to kiss her , and to accept her kiss ; little Germaine in her white flower-girl dress ( which , though somewhat stained , was still adorable ) ; the new baby Cassandra , held wriggling and cooing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wig ; grandfather Noel ; grandmotherDella , whose wrinkled prune of a face was wet with sudden , unacknowledged tears ; uncle Hiram ; cousin Vernon , whose thin-lipped melancholy grin made her cry all the more ; aunt Lily ; uncle Ewan ; her c ousins Vida and Albert and Raphael and Morna and Jasper and Louis and . . . And there was little Bromwell , blinking behind his glasses , extending a hand to her for a formal handshake . . . ! And Garth , and pretty Little Goldie ; and aunt Aveline and uncle Denton ; and Edna ; and Lissa ; and " the old man from the flood " who had been brought outside by great-grandmother Elvira ; and of course great-grandmother Elvira herself , who had had her white hair puffed out for the occasion in a kind of ' pompadour , and whose frail fingers were surprisingly strong , gripping Christabel 's wrist . ( Since his rescue , the " old man from the flood "  --  who remained nameless because he could not recall his name , and the Bellefleurswere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had n't the right , and his own people would soon be stepping forward to claim him  --  had improved considerably , and was no longer in any danger , and capable , even , of playing games with the children ( mainly Chinese checkers and Old Maid ) and helping with little household tasks , when he felt strong enough . Dr. Jensen had given him injections of vitamin C and left behind a supply of iron tablets , and great-grandmother Elvira prepared for him , in the kitchen , allowing no one else to help , meals laced with special herbs , which were evidently quite beneficial , since the old - nan  --  who was a very old man , possibly older than Elvira  --  seemed to be gaining strength steadily . He was soft-spoken and gentle , and slept often , and caused no one any trouble . Though Elvira fussed in the kitchen , it . was always a maid who brought the old man his meal , and Elvira did no more than peek in from time to time , from the doorway , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abashed , and perplexed greeting , when he was awake . Sometimes she complained of him , that nuisance , that old fool , but she was , in fact , the only person who remembered him Iro-n day to day . ) And last of all tearful Christabel , squatting impulsively , so that her silk stockings broke out in a half-dozen runs and ladders , said lamewell to the cats : to great-grandmother Elvira 's Minerva , and to CeCi and Dexter-Margaret and George and Charley and Misty and Miranda and Wallace and 1 ( ou ... and Troilus and Buddy and Muffin and Tristram and 1 ' . c  --  ou ... and Mahalaleel , who humped his large head against her as -f nudging het , purring deep in his throat , pausing to lick , with hisp286sandpaperish tongue that was so wet and so ticklish , her stockinged knee : beautiful haughty Mahalaleel himself , the ruff about his head plumped out as if one of the children had just been brushing him , his frosted bluish-gray coat gleaming in the sun . Christabel backed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never see you again ! If I come back everything will be different ! I 'll never see you again like this .... " They called her a silly little goose , and Edgar took her arm , and helped her into the gleaming black Mercedes , which , evidently , he was going to drive himself . Though the baron became a U.S. citizen in 1784 it was clear that he , and his progeny , retained strong Teutonic memories . The Schaff collection , old Mrs. Schaff told Christabel in a whisper , was a national treasure  --  curious medieval weapons and shields ; ancient panels ; tapestries more threadbare than those at Bellefleur Manor ; sixteenth-century Flemish stonewear ; medieval and sixteenth-century stained glass panels ; a **25;7475;TOOLONG bronze nest of weights ; leather-bound books , whole walls of them , in German ; etchings , engravings , mezzotints ; and of course dark , time-stained oil paintings , one of which  --  Folly , Cupid , Leda , and Silenus , attributed to van Miereveld  --  reminded homesick Christabel of a large painting that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east wing . Entire walls were muffled in the skins of animals . Fireplaces were so festooned with furbelows and brass that they could not be used . In every room , but concentrated in the Main Hall , were bald eagles  --  wooden , pewter , wrought-iron , brass  --  some with arrows clutched in their talons . It was said that the baron and his sons had collected hundreds of Indian scalps ( properly tanned and treated , of course ) , but these were not in evidence . Old Mrs. Schaff , a very short , cork-shaped woman , rose each morning at 6:30 . She bathed , aided by a servant ; read aloud from the Bible ; came downstairs promptly at 7:30 to lead the household staff in prayers ; breakfasted ; then went upstairs again for a morning of letter writing , sewing , mending , and further reading in the Bible . The main meal of the day , to Christabel 's amazement , was served at 2:00 p.m . It was a formal occasion though only Edgar , Christabel , and Mrs. Schaff ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her new daughter-in-law , was only for servants . It was in the basement . Food was prepared there by persons Christabel never saw , and sent up by dumb waiter to the butler 's pantry above . ) Edgar 's two little boys dined at noon and then again at 5:30 , upstairs in the nursery , with their tutor . The very first morning after her arrival at Schaff Hall , Christabel , in a bright-flowered frock , with a yellow scarf tied about her head , passed by the nursery just to peer inside . . . and saw , to her surprise , and very much to her interest , the man who must have been the boys ' tutor : he was standing at an opened window , glasses in one hand , rubbing the bridge of his nose and muttering to himself . He wasp287no age Christabel could determine . His ash-blond hair was ill-cut , falling unevenly across his collar ; his jaw , clean-shaven , was strong but almost too square ; the leather patch on the right elbow of his tweed jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a young ox , and more resembled a farmer 's son than a tutor said to have been educated abroad , in England and Germany , and to have been employed by the very best families in the East . Something about his stance , his air of lassitude and melancholy , touched Christabel to the heart . She stared , standing in the doorway , and halfway thought he looked familiar . That agreeably homely profile , those clumsily broad shoulders that made his coat strain into wrinkles across the back . . . He turned , suddenly , and drew in his breath at the sight of her . It was Demuth Hodge ...  |p288It  was as a consequence of an astonishing outburst of passion  --  remarkable in one so frail , and so customarily meek  --  that GarnetHecht encountered Lord Dunraven , who was to bring so much guiltriddentorment into her life . She had arranged ( her heart sinking at his weary politeness ) to see her lover once again , after so many months of mutual renunciation : she did not like to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not her words begging 0 Gideon you must know how I love you , I have always loved you , I continue to love you despite the promise we made never again to see each other , the promise we made in order not to hurt Leah and your children .... ( And had she not behaved nobly , surrenderingher baby girl to the castle , to the Bellefleurs , guessing that this was the baby 's father 's unarticulated wish ? How nobly , with what heartrendingpain , only she herself knew . . . . Even good Mrs. Pym , who , alone among the Bellefleurs seemed to know , without having been told , of her liaison with Gideon , could not have guessed ( for Garnet kept her sobbing to herself , and sometimes , in the pantry or the kitchen , thrust her fingers in her mouth to keep from moaning aloud at the double loss of her lover and her baby ) at the depth of her suffering . Della frequently touched Garnet 's shoulder and smiled sadly and spoke of her own terrible bereavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been a young bride . " We must tell ourselves , Garnet-This too will pass , " Della said . " Every morning , every midday , every evening , when silly hopeful persons say their prayers , like children , we must say , calmly and clearly  --  This too will pass . For it will , my dear ! Never doubt but that it will ! " ) While accompanying Mrs. Pym on a weeklong visit to the castle , shortly after the surprising occasion of ' Miss Christabcl 's marriage to Edgar Holleran von Schaff Ill , Garnet was able to draw aside ( discreetly ,  |p289though  she trembled violently that they might be discovered even in so innocent a place as the nursery , where she was " visiting with " Cassandra ) her lover Gideon ; and to arrange for a secret meeting very late on the following night . " I will make no demands of you , " she whispered . " But we must meet . One final time . " Gideon , dressed for the outdoors , his dark beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw with a pang of love , threaded with gray  --  silver-gray ) , his somewhat prominent eyes darting quickly about behind her ( touching upon , and veering off , the beautiful Cassandra napping on her stomach in the cradle ) , seemed at first incapable of speaking . He opened his mouth  --  smiled  --  the smile thinned  --  he blinked rapidly  --  cleared his throat  --  looked her full in the face  --  and , wincing , drew back an inch or two , as if involuntarily . She could see that , for Gideon as well as herself , even so casual a meeting was painful : it was likely that he suffered as she did , though of course he would never speak of such things . " I know , I know , this violates our promise , " Garnet said quickly , half feeling pity for him ( for herself , she had long abrogated pity , as unworthy of one who was loved by , and had borne a child for , Gideon Bellefleur ) , " but you must understand that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid that something terrible will happen to me . . . . Ah , it was good , really , though your wife could not have known , that she came to take my baby away from me ! " Garnet whispered . " Do n't talk like that , do n't say such foolish things , " Gideon said . " If you say them they are likely to become  --  " She touched her fingers daringly to his lips . " Then we 'll meet ? Tomorrow ? And you wo n't despise me ? And you will come ? " He seized her hand and , hesitating a moment , kissed it ; or anyway pressed it to his cold lips . Garnet was to feel the imprint of those lips against her hand ( but it was the back of her hand , for he had , oddly , turned it at the very last instant ) for many hours . Shamelessly , like a young girl new to love , and delirious with its promise , she had even kissed her own hand  --  hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she murmured aloud to her wan , indistinct reflection , as she plaited her hair for bed that night . " But his love makes our predicament all the more tragic .... " And so they met , the following night . In the unused room on the third floor of the east wing where , so very long ago , in another lifetime , Garnet had gone , at Mrs. Pym 's suggestion , to bring poor Gideon some nourishment . It was in the doorway of that room , in the shadowy corridor outside the room , that Garnet , staring as Gideon Bellefleur tore with ravenous appetite at the meat she had brought him , that she fell  --  plunged  --  was thrown , violently  --  in love . She had wanted to cry aloud 0 Gideon I love you , you must know , you can not not know .... Perhaps ( she sometimes wonder cc ! , c diving that night ) she had cried aloud ... . Meeting dim had been Garnet 's idea . But if it struck her lover as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Gideon was sop290polite . So impassively courteous . Garnet had once overheard , out in the garden , one humid August afternoon , Leah herself shouting at him  --  What do you mean , showing that frosty insupportable gentlemanliness to me , to your own wife , who knows you inside and out ! ) Instead he merely nodded , and repeated the time she had said  --  1:00 A.M.  --  in a hurried and preoccupied manner . Well before 1:00 A.M. Garnet slipped away , and climbed the drafty stairs to the third floor , daring only a small candle ( whose flame flickered wildly , cupped behind her hand ) , for fear of being discovered . Bellefleur Manor , even during the day , was intimidating : there were corridors , and corners , and dark little niches , that looked as if no one ever visited them ; and of course the sillier women , and even some of the men , among the domestic staff , freely complained of ghosts . But Garnet did not believe in ghosts . She found it difficult , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself  --  certainly in the baby to whom she had given birth . . . . There were only the cruel stretch marks on her abdomen and a certain oversensitivity about her breasts , even after many months , to remind her of the arduous physical reality of her motherhood . In preparation for the many houseguests who were to have stayed at Bellefleur Manor , for great-grandmother Elvira 's birthday celebration , all the rooms had been cleaned ; and in many  --  in this room , for instance  --  furniture had been reupholstered and new carpets laid . So Garnet 's first impression was one of pleased surprise . The really quite filthy carpet upon which Gideon had slept was gone , and in its place lay what appeared to be an attractive thick-piled rug . There were chairs  --  a bureau  --  a large mirror  --  several small tables , inlaid with marble  --  and of course a bed  --  a double bed  --  a canopied bed with high pillows and a thick crimson cover . Blushing , Garnet saw by the flickering light ( and perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most embarrassing tapestry hanging just to the right of the bed : it showed a scantily clad couple , the woman as well as the man quite full-bodied , and vigorous , and impatient to make love , being surprised in a boudoir by  --  could it be ?  --  a lascivious little Cupid leading , down a staircase , a horse  --  a horse with outlandish long eyelashes and a queer human expression . The lovers gaped with surprise : and indeed who would not have been surprised ? Garnet was staring at this strange tapestry ( she could not decide if it was obscene , or merely playful ; or both ; but in any case it should be taken down and stored at the very back of a closet ) when she heard a sound in the corridor . For some reason ( had she doubted , even then , her lover 's truthfulness ? ) her first thought was that someone other than Gideon was there . One or two of the male servants had expressed an interest in her  --  an interest , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sleepwalking , which had evidently flared up again after some months of quiescence ; and innumerable cats , some of them quite large , roamed the castle freely at night . So she stood , cringing , the little candle cupped in her hand , a young woman who  --  despite her moth/erhood , despite her passion  --  looked hardly more than a child , staring at the empty doorway as if she had no idea who might appear . And then of course Gideon did arrive , with a flashlight in hand  --  entering the room boldly , yet without haste . He murmured a greeting and reached out to take her hand ( ah , how awkward she was !  --  Garnet jerked away because of the candle she was holding , not wanting it to be upset , and then of course it was upset ; and her lover , swearing , had to scramble for it across the rug ) , and managed at last to kiss her on the forehead . Yet something was wrong . Garnet felt it , she knew , unmistakably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too rapidly , of her love for him , which had not ebbed , which had in fact increased  --  though , yes , she knew they had promised never to say such things again  --  never to torment themselves . But she had to break her vow : her life was so empty , so miserable , so futile . It was all the more intolerable , she told him , that his wife ( who meant well  --  of course Leah always meant well ) chattered about finding a " suitable " husband for her , and had even been making inquiries about eligible bachelors and widowers in the area . Could n't he speak  --  discreetly , of course  --  to Leah ? Did n't Leah realize how such remarks wounded Garnet ? Did n't he realize ? But that was n't the primary cause of her unhappiness , as he must know . Even the surrender of Cassandra  --  which had nearly broken her heart  --  was n't the primary cause . And then , suddenly , desperately , she threw herself into his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , he murmuredwords she could not interpret ; he behaved , in short , exactly as Gideon Bellefleur  --  as nearly any Bellefleur , for that matter  --  might have behaved if , in public , quite suddenly , unpredictably , a grieving stranger had fairly collapsed in his arms . Sobs wracked her body . She knew  --  knew from the very moment he entered the room , really  --  that he no longer loved her . ( And the hairsbreadthof a thought which she had n't quite had , about the handsome big bed  --  how that would return to haunt her , poor humiliated Garnet Becht ! ) Still she could not keep herself from saying , " 0 I love you , I ca n't stop loving you , you are a prince among men , I ca n't stop loving you  --  please , Gideon  --  please do n't abandon me ! Have n't I given up my baby girl for you , for your sake  --  Have n't I doomed myself to a life of sorrow , knowing that my child will grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am her mother , still  --  " ( ; ideon stepped back from her , blinking . He asked her to repeat what she had said . " About Cassandra ? Why , I  --  I  --  " " You gave her up for me ? " ( ; ideon asked , baffled . " But what do you mean ?  --  for me ? " " I  --  I naturally thought  --  " " Leah told me that you had begged her to take the child : that you did n't want her : that the baby would interfere with your chances ofp292getting married . What do you mean , now , by saying that you gave her up for me ? " He stared at her with such incredulity , with such an air of  --  of unloving alarm  --  that Garnet came close to swooning . She stammered , " I thought  --  I only thought  --  Leah and Hiram came to visit Mrs. Pym , you see , and  --  and  --  And somehow it came about  --  I do n't remember clearly  --  I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought you  --  you were behind it  --  sending them  --  her  --  to bring your own child back  --  to rear her as a Bellefleur  --  of course without letting Leah know  --  I had thought , " Garnet whispered , " that it might even have been a test of  --  of  --  a test of my love for you  --  " Gideon stepped back . He exhaled loudly  --  puffed out his cheeks and extended his lower lip and blew upward , so that his hair was stirred  --  in a gesture Ewan frequently made , to show half-amused disgust and bewilderment. " . . . but no not really , " he muttered . " Gideon ? " Garnet cried , reaching for him , stumbling toward him , " do you mean  --  do you mean  --  you did n't  --  As Cassandra 's father you did n't especially want her  --  ? " He stepped back again , eluding her . As her fingers groped for his sleeve he brushed them half-consciously away . For a long moment he appeared unable to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " . . . so it was Leah . . . Leah 's idea . . . she knows . . . must know . . . but why did she do it . . . to spite me , or . . . to spite you . ... Or is there another reason ... " " Gideon , " Garnet said , in a lower voice , " please tell me : you did n't ask her to bring the child back ? You do n't , even now , especially want her ? As Cassandra 's father you do n't especially want her  --  ? " It was at this point that , quite suddenly , in a voice that hardly resembledhis , Gideon said something that was to be as inexplicable  --  indeed , as unfathomable  --  in his own imagination as in Garnet 's , and to cause him , in secret , great torment : he heard himself say sardonically , Am I the father ? " For a long moment Garnet simply stared at him . She could not comprehend his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp hair out of her eyes  --  tried to speak  --  stood swaying  --  staring at him . It was only when his face contorted with shame , and guilt , and immediate sorrow , that she realized the terrible thing he had said . He exclaimed , " Oh , Garnet of course I did n't mean  --  " but already she had turned , and was running out of the room , her long hair streaming behind her . He would have pursued her at once , and might have caught her , but in Garnet 's shock she dropped the candle ; and once again he had to scramble after it as it rolled , not yet entirely quenched , beneath the bed . " Dear fucking God , why is this happening , " Gideon half-sobbed , his shoulder striking the bedframe ( fir he was a large man , and could not comfortably maneuver in that cramped space ) , " why am I plagued as I am , who is playing this vile trick , whom should I murder .... Jesus fuckingp293God ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retrieving it . And with great passion he spat on the wick , though the meager flame had at last died . " . . . should have let it go , " he murmured , " should have let everything go up in flames .... " So Garnet fled , in a paroxysm of shame , hardly knowing what she did , which turn in the corridor to take , which stairway to descend . She fled , too stupefied even to weep , and somehow found herself in an unheatedback hallway , and then at a door , throwing herself against a door , as dogs began to yip in a startled chorus . Gathering her cloak about her she ran across the lawn . Moonlight illuminated the long hill that dipped to the lake  --  illuminated the hill and not the surrounding woods  --  so that she had only one way to run . Now barefoot , her hair streaming , the skirt of her pretty silken gown beginning to rip , she ran , her eyes open and fixed . Somehow the cloak was torn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ran , oblivious of her surroundings , knowing only that she must run , to flee the horror behind her , and to eradicate herself in the dark murmurous lake before her . Senseless words careened about her head : 0 Gideon I love you , I can not live without you , I have always loved you and I will always love you  --  Please forgive me ( An angel , transfixed by suffering ! A crucifixion , Lord Dunraven was to think , afterward , in her lovely face ! But how terrifying a sight she was , on that night , running like a madwoman , only partly clad , to drown herself in the frigid March waters of that ugliest of lakes ! ) So Garnet fled ; and would surely have drowned herself . Except , through the unlikeliest of coincidences ( though not , upon reflection , any less likely , Lord Dunraven reasoned , than many another coincidence he had experienced in his lifetime , or had heard of in others ' lives ) there turned up the Bellefleur drive at that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying Eustace Beckett , Lord Dunraven , a distant relative of grandmother Cornelia 's who had been invited , originally , for great-grandmother Elvira 's birthday , but who had had regretfully to decline , though saying ( with a graciousness that struck Cornelia as kindly rather than sincere ) that he would like to visit his American cousin another time . A telegram announcing his arrival had been sent from New York , but had not , evidently , been delivered , for no one awaited him at the manor . As the carriage turned up the drive , and passed by the gate house , Lord Dunraven saw , to his astonishment , a ghostly figure running down the long , long hill  --  running barefoot , despite the cold  --  her hair flying behind her  --  her arms outstretched  --  and though the vision was a most alarming one ( for Garnet did resemble a madwoman ) Lord Dunraven had the presence of mind , and the courage , to shout for the driver to stop at once ; and he leapt down ; and pursued the girl to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries had made no impression upon her , he was fin ( rd to sei/e her bare arm , to prevent her I-uuu plunging in the water . " No , no  --  you must not  --  My poor girl , you must not  --  " Lord Dun/raven cried , out of breath . The girl tried to struggle free . She clawed at him , even slashed at him  --  quite harmlessly , as it turned out  --  with her teeth , and writhed with such demonic violence that her gown was torn nearly off her back , exposing the bare flesh . " I say you must not , " Lord Dunraven grunted , holding her , at last , still , in the moment before she sank into blessed unconsciousness.  |p295Another  carriage , piled high with trunks , unceremoniouslyjammed with people , carried her away : so Jean-Pierre theorized , though in fact he could not see her : though he saw , quite clearly , her bewigged and vacant-eyed father . The next day , outside a tavern , he joined a regiment bound for Fort Ticonderoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girl , but of the ugly prison-castle his family inhabited for centuries , in the north of France : its monstrous walls eighty-five feet high and seven feet thick , the shallow green-scummed water of the moat giving off a most unpleasantstink . Ticonderoga , Lake Champlain , Crown Point .... He left for the north without seeing a map . Henceforth he would not meet his fate passively : he would forge it.  |p296It  was on a windless June day of heart-stopping beauty ( only a very few clouds , diaphanous , subtle as milkweed fluff , were brushed against the china-blue sky ) that Vernon Bellefleur , who had despaired for more than twenty years of being a poet ( a genuine poet , in his own terms : everyone else referred to him , glibly , if not contemptuously , as The Poet ) , became , at last , quite suddenly , through an experience of obscene horror , a poet . And so he was to remain , for the rest of his exceptionally long life . " A man 's life of any worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegory .... " But what is the nature , precisely , of this allegory ? Are all men 's lives allegorical , or only the few , the extraordinary few ? He liked to read to The People . To his family 's field hands , or mill hands , good simple unquestioning sturdy folk , about whom the phrase the salt of the earth was not inappropriate : he liked to stand before them in his jacket that was too tight in the armpits , and buttoned crookedly , part of his beard caught up in the gay red scarf he knotted about his neck for such occasions , his voice rising with a dramatic intensity that stirred his listeners to a sympathy so profound it expressed itself in spasms of mirth . ( But were their lives allegorical , their simple laborers ' lives . . . ? Or might they require the transcendental services of the poet , of poesy , to transform them . . . ? ) At any rate he read , though his knees trembled with the audacity of his undertaking ( for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or on a window ledge in the Fort Hanna mill ; even in crowded taverns on Friday evenings , where the tavern keeper , knowing he was a Bellefleur , commanded a modicum of attention fin- hint ) , and tears jerked in the corners of his eyes , he read until his throat was hoarse , until his head reeled with exhaustion . until , glancing up , he saw that mostp297of his audience had drifted away  --  for perhaps his thirty-eight-line sonnetson " Lara " were too painfully candid for them , or they found too difficult , too demanding , the words of certain other poets , lifelong heroes of Vernon 's , whom he also read : Ah ! who can e'er forget so fair a being ? Who can forget her half retiring sweets ? God ! she is like a milk-white lamb that bleats For God 's protection . Surely the All-seeing , Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing , Will never give him pinions , who intreatsSuch innocence to ruin ,  --  who vilely cheats A dove-like bosom . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty ; when I hearA lay that once I saw her hand awake , Her form seems floating palpable , and near ; Had I e'er seen her from an arbour takeA dewy flower , oft would that hand appearAnd o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake ... . Because he took little heed of such things , Vernon scarcely knew his own age . He was , he supposed , in his early thirties at the time of the great shock  --  the sight , to be repeatedly continuously in his mind 's eye , whether he woke or slept , of an infant borne aloft in the talons of a gigantic vulturelike bird , and partly dismembered , and even devoured , in midair , before his helpless gaze ; the last time anyone in the family ( and that person had been Leah ) thought to celebrate his birthday was a considerable number of years before , and he had been twenty-seven or twenty-eight at the time , he could n't quite recall . Vernon will never grow up , Hiram once said , not caring that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his son . But Vernon halfway thought that he had always been grownup . He had n't had a childhood , had he ?  --  had n't it come to an abrupt , cruel end ? But perhaps since his mother had abandoned him to the Bellefleurs , so many , many years ago , his childhood had been blighted from the start . He had been , he sometimes thought ( though he did n't write about such sentiments because he believed poetry must be rhapsodic and hymnal and " beautiful " ) , a kind of changeling . ... For though he was , by heredity , a Bellefleur , in his soul he most emphatically was not a Bellefleur . So he frequently quarreled , not only with his father but with his uncle Noel and his aunt Cornelia , and his cousins Ewan and Gideon whom he had always , since boyhood , feared ; for he knew himself an aspect of God , .1 hagene  --  nt of God 's consciousness , whose bodily form as well as his family Identity was irrelevant . ( ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' language ) if he had ever made love  --  " With a woman , that is "  --  and stared at him blandly , as if daring Vernon even to srn.s the uisult of his words . Vernon 's skin flared and prickled hotly , but hep298managed to reply , in his usual gentle voice , No , no , he had n't , he supposedhe had not , in the usual sense of the words . " What other sense is there ? " Ewan wanted to know . He ignored such crudities , and forgave them , for he was , he supposed , something of a clownish figure ; and anyway what choice had he ? Sometimes in his wanderings back in the foothills , miles from home , when the towers of the castle were barely visible at the horizon , he allowed himself to think , warmly , that his poetry would someday be the means of his escape from those terrible soulless people  --  it would be the means of his power  --  his fame  --  his revenge . Ah , if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language lodged deep in the human soul  --  what profound truths he would utter ! Like Icarus he would construct wings to carry him free of this vast , beautiful , gloomy , overpowering corner of the world ( which felt so often , in the mountains especially , or along the lakeshore , like an edge of the world ) ; unlike Icarus he would escape , and live in triumph , for his wings would be the inviolable wings of poetry . At such times his heart beat painfully , and he yearned to seize hold of someone  --  anyone  --  even a stranger  --  and attempt to explain the rapture that swelled in his breast  --  which must be , he thought , like the rapture Christ experienced  --  Christ who yearned only to be the Saviour of pitiful fallen mankind , of the very people who failed to hear His words . Like a man trapped in a tomb , whose voice is not strong enough to penetrate the dense rock that has been rolled up against it , he yearned to explain himself , yet lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he groped , he annoyed and exasperatedand embarrassed and bored other people , and made ( ah , how frequently ! ) a contemptible fool of himself . One by one the children outgrew him . For a while each loved him  --  loved him very much  --  sought him out to tell little secrets to , to complain of the other adults ' indifferenceor cruelty ; gave him presents ; climbed on his lap , kissed his prickly cheek , teased , even taunted him , played little tricks on him ; but loved him . One by one , Yolande ( sweet , pretty , strong-willed Yolande , who had broken his heart by running away without leaving , as he had truly thought she would , a message for him ) , Vida , Morna , Jasper , Albert , Bromwell , Christabel . . . . Garth had never liked him . Garth had always been faintly contemptuous of him , making rude razzing noises during lessons or during Vernon 's readings . There was dreamy gentle dark-eyed Raphael , with his long pale slender hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy he had taken to avoiding , in recent years , not only his rowdy brothers and cousins and their friends , but Vernon himself . For , a while Vernon and Raphael had been quite close . Vernon had liked to think of the boy as his son , a changeling of sorts , for was n't it improbable  --  ludicrous  --  that beefy beery Ewan should be the boy 's father ? He had taken Raphael on hikes with him , he had shared with him certain beautiful moments  --   |p299For  I have learnedTo look on nature , not as in the hourOf thoughtless youth ; but hearing oftentimes The still , sad music of humanity , .. . And I have feltA presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts ; a sense sublimeOf something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the blue sky , and in the mind of man : A motion and a spirit , that impelsAll thinking things , all objects of all thought , And rolls through all things .. .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , they became estranged . Of course it was all on the boy 's side : Vernon had never ceased loving him . But the boy rose early and slipped away before breakfast , and spent all his time at the pond north of the cemetery ( Mink Pond , it was called , though another pond , now dried up , had once been called Mink Pond ) , and when Vernon hiked out there to be with him he could feel how unwelcome he was : how , as he approached the pond 's marshy reedy willow-choked bank , and caught sight of the boy lying stomach-down on his raft , staring into the water , he was clumsily violating the child 's privacy , the child 's very soul . It was , he thought , sadly , like tramping heedlessly on a bird 's wing ... Raphael lingered about the pond until after sunset , and then only reluctantly came home ; even in the rain he played there ; even on uncomfortably cold days . ( What does he do for so many hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a doctor 's care , or simply a good spanking , and Vernon said , somewhat arrogantly , What do any of us do  --  ? ) But he had lost Raphael and would never reclaim him . Now there was only Germaine : Germaine , that sturdy red-cheeked beauty with the amazing , uncanny eyes , and Garnet 's baby Cassandra , who was of course far too young , still , to appreciate Vernon 's devotion . And someday , he supposed , he would lose Germaine and Cassandratoo . And then there was Leah . Leah  --  " Lara "  --  his Muse  --  his inspiration  --  his folly . Ewan had asked rudely if Vernon had ever performed the act of love with a woman ; he had not asked if Vernon had ever loved a woman . Surely there was an important distinction . He had fallen in love with Gideon 's young wife on the very day of the wedding , at the wedding party , as he gazed with longing at the dancers  --  at his cousin Gideon and Gideon 's bride  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Della Pym 's daughter  --  one of the " poor " Bellefleurs . ( Poor out of pride , it was said . For Della could certainly have lived in the castle had she wished . ) He had loved her then and had been , over the years , content to love her at arm'sp300length , like a courtier of old , reading in her presence ( though not , alas , always with her attentive ear ) poems of longing , his own and others ' , With how sad steps 0 moon , and " Greensleeves , " and the tender , clumsy , assonance-heavy " Lara " sonnets ; eager to do errands for her , to mind the children , to listen sympathetically as she complained of Cornelia 's tyranny . But Leah was , in recent months , not always an inspiration . The gross but marvelous physicality of her pregnancy had somewhat unnervedhim  --  he had discovered , then , that Leah in his imagination was sometimes lovelier than Leah in the flesh  --  but the Leah of the present was more extreme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with newsprint ( for she read , each morning at breakfast , several papers ) , and her quick wit , her manner of addressing Hiram , even in Vernon 's presence , in a language so studded with private allusions and financial terms and abbreviations of one kind or another that it constituted , nearly , a code  --  a code poor Vernon could not hope to decipher , and which caused him pain . And she was frequently imperious . Hoarsevoiced , and then shrill . Sending back the tea things because a single cup was cracked , or the tea was n't hot enough , or there was an indentation  --  " Suspiciously like a thumbnail ! "  --  in the icing on a piece of coffee cake . ( Is n't she terrible , the servants whispered , sometimes in tears . Is n't she full of herself ! And such was their distress that they frequently spoke in voices loud enough for Vernon to hear . ) Of course she was still beautiful . She would always be , Vernon knew , beautiful . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinned slightly so that near-invisible lines showed about her eyes , ghostlines , really , not seriously imprinted in the flesh , and visible only in harsh bright sunlight . . . . ( She had lost a considerable amount of weight after her pregnancy , and continued to lose it . For she was always rushing from place to place  --  the state capitol , Vanderpoel , the Falls , Port Oriskany , Derby , Yewville , Powhatassie , even New York City  --  and even at home she rarely relaxed , as she had in the old days , in the walled garden or Violet 's boudoir . Even sprawled exhausted in a chair she was thinking , thinking , planning , plotting , her mind turning and turning about like a windmill blade , giving off a nearly palpable heat . Vernon had actually glimpsed her , once , through the partly open door of Raphael 's study , talking over two telephones , a receiver tightly couched against each of her hunched shoulders ! ) But Leah would always be a beautiful woman , Vernontold himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would always love her ; and she would always belong to another man . He wandered in the Lake Noir area , and in the foothills , gone sometimes for a week or ten days , tramping the fields and lanes and riverbanks in his muddy , leaking shoes , wearing on his head a cast-off rubber rainhat of Noel 's , or a cast-off Irish hat of . Ewan 's he had ( inind on the floor of ' a closet . With his straggly graying beard he . looked decades older than he was , like a figure out of mythology , or out of the mountain mists , anp301incongruous red scarf tied about his neck , his trousers stained at the knee , his jackets sometimes baggy , sometimes tight , sometimes not even his . Aunt Matilde had knitted him a wonderful bulky sweater heavy as a coat , with generous-sized pockets for his books and papers and pens , and she had sewn on wooden buttons she 'd carved herself , out of hickory wood ; but one day he returned to the manor without it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that he could not  --  could not  --  remember what had happened to it . ( A man who loses an article of clothing he is wearing , Hiram intoned , will eventually lose everything . ) So he wandered , always on foot . Eccentric , probably not " crazy " ( for there were far crazier people in the hills ) , probably not dangerous . He was never to encounter , in his years of wandering , his cousin Emmanuel  --  by now an almost legendary , improbable figure , about whom the other Bellefleurs rarely spoke , as if they had forgotten he was a brother of Gideon 's and Ewan 's , and had come to think of him as remote in time , like Raphael 's son Rodman , about whom so little was known : though presumably Emmanuel was still mapping the region , covering every acre on foot , and would one day return home in triumph . With his mismatched eyes ( which always surprised and amused children , but sometimes made adults uneasy ) and his untidy appearance and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region ; of course he was also known as a Bellefleur , and given a wide berth . Farmers driving pick-up trucks along the country roads he traveled slowed courteously as they passed him , never offering him a ride ( for to offer a Bellefleur anything might be interpreted as impertinence , coming from a social inferior , and everyone lived in dread of offending or insulting the Bellefleurs : Ewan had injured a number of men in fights , as had Gideon ; and Raoul 's temper had been legendary ; Noel had been a hellion in his day ; Hiram , in some ways the most sinister of ' the Bellefleurs , had exercised his kind of power decades ago by buying up , at dismayingly cheap prices , land belonging to farmers who had been forced into bankruptcy ; and of course there had been Jean-Pierre II who had murdered eleven men one night , quite calmly and methodically , because of an " insult " he had overheard ) , though they were quick to stop if Vernon indicated he wanted a ride . And quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to help with farm chores ( though he was almost comicallyclumsy ) in exchange for meals . They liked Vernon  --  they liked him  --  however they may have felt about his family  --  and could forgive him his doggerel-poetry which he imagined , poor fool , would someday save the world . And if he spoke of a farmer 's kindness , back at the castle , perhaps one of ' the harder-hearted Bellefleurs would overhear . . . . just as the Bellefleurs were sharply divided on the subject of religion  --  mote spe ( ifirally , on the subject of ' God  --  so were they divided on the related subjc  --  rt of the existence of Evil . Whether Evil " existed " or whethrt it only appealed to exist , from a necessarily limited point of view ; ssbethet it certainly dui exist , and existed ( or a purpose ( inevitably divinep302in scope if not in sentiment ) ; whether there was no Evil , but a small galaxy of evils , each contending for its share of human flesh ; whether Evil was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laziest of the arguments ) ; whether , given a universe dominated by spirit , the only significantEvil could be spiritual ; or , conversely , whether the only significantEvil could be material , given the fundamental material nature of the universe ... so the Bellefleurs argued , sometimes quite passionately , sometimes with a lamentable lack of civility , and not only failed to convinceone another but , by way of their very passion , closed their minds against those subtleties , however infrequent , which might have aided their intellectual growth . ( Indeed , the spirit of contention was sometimes thought to be the essential curse of the Bellefleurs  --  for is n't it out of contention that all evils spring ? ) Pious and good-natured , and stubborn , Vernon considered himself a henotheist , or perhaps a pantheist ; what mattered , he reasoned , was not the content of one 's belief but its depth . Since his God encompassed and swallowed up everything , every particle of matter  --  the filigree of synapses in that masterwork of cunning , the human brain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of planing mills , Germaine 's happy smile , his mother 's tearful farewell , the splendor of Mount Blanc and the rank gloomy silence of Noir Swamp  --  since his God was identical with His creation , there could be nothing left over , no room for laborious theorizing . The pulses sang as pulses have always sung Here I am , I am here by right , I exist , and the spirit of all creation through me , and the wise man , and certainly the poet , echoes this song . ( But there is a God of Destruction , too , Gideon said one day to Vernon , years ago , when members of the family still took Vernon seriously enough to quarrel with him , come and I will show you . . . . And dragged him away to the witchhobble-choked foot of Sugarloaf Hill where in angry boyish triumphhe showed Vernon a partly eaten doe . The poor thing had been pregnant , evidently  --  her belly had been torn open by dogs  --  her throat so crudely slashed that she had bled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not yet picked clean by birds , were open and fixed ) the horror of the dogs ' greedy devouring jaws . She had died while witnessingthe death of her fetus . And the dogs had n't been especially hungry , Gideon said , look at all they 've left .... Vernon gagged , and backed away ; could not stop himself from vomiting , though he felt his cousin 's excited contempt . But when he recovered he said , Gideon , the dogs must be nourished . . . we eat , and are eaten . . . do n't despair . Gideon had stared at him . What do you mean , what do you mean , do n't despair ! Do n't judge , Vernon whispered . Do n't despair . But Gideon had looked at him uncomprehendingly , as , years later , the child Raphael was to look at him after having asked him a question about leeches . Do n't despair , do n't judge , do n't set yourself apart from God so that you are forced to judge , Vernon implored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't touch me , Gideon said. )  |p303The  family was also divided , though not as decisively , on the subject of certain more immediate beliefs . Uncle Hiram did not believe in spirits , but his brother Noel did ; most of the children believed in the giant snowman in the mountains , and in the Swamp Vulture , or Noir Vulture , as it was sometimes called ( indeed , it was sometimes called the Bellefleur Vulture , by people in the area ) , and most of the adults  --  though certainly not all of the adults  --  did not . That there were Bellefleurs who claimed to have seen the enormous bird , up in the mountains , or circling the swamp , seemed to inspire , in the others , only amused contempt : All the more reason for knowing the thing is a hoax , Della once declared , if that pathological liar Noel claims to have seen it . Bromwell maintained a scientific detachment , pointing out , pedantically , but quite correctly , that . a vulture would not seize living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ; hence the Noir Vulture , if it existed at all ( and he had no opinion on that subject , and would never commit himself , even after that unfortunate June morning ) was misnamed . But no one paid attention to him , for it seemed somehow pointless to quibble about a mere name , when the thing itself was such a horror . Vernon would not have said he " believed " in the vulture , had he been asked , before the creature actually appeared in the walled garden ( of all places !  --  of all secluded , private , secret places ) since , to his knowledge , he had never seen such a bird , and he thought it wisest to minimize the children 's fears . Yet when he caught sight of it with its naked , red head , its incongruously white feathers ( tipped with black as if with a tar brush ) , and its curious pronged tail , he knew at once what it must be . ... Even before he saw the baby gripped in its talons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop it ! Get a gun ! for so Vernon 's words were torn from him , at the mere sight of the hideous creature . But of course there was nothing to be done . The baby was lost . As women 's screams lifted from the garden the bird rose higher and higher , with a noisy muscular grace , already jabbing at the helpless prey in its claws  --  tearing and stabbing at it with its sharp beak  --  so that pieces of flesh and skeins of blood fell , it seemed almost lightly , back toward earth ; like laundry flapping in the wind the Noir Vulture rose above the highest branches of the oak trees , an astonishing sight on that mildest of pale blue June days , bearing the baby away as if it were no more than a rabbit or chipmunk . Vernon , who happened to be returning from a morning 's hike down to the river , and who was approximately sixty feet from the southern wall of ' the garden ( for he was approaching the manor from the rear ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant , simply staring . Then he began to shout . His cousins !  --  the boys !  --  were n't they always shooting off guns !  --  and now where were they ?  --  but in the next moment he realized that the bird was carrying something away , and that it was something living  --  something human  --   |p304At  first he thought it was Germaine . But it was too small to be Germaine . Cassandra  --  ? So the Noir Vulture struck , taking advantage ( taking advantage , it would seem , almost rationally ) of Leah 's absence from the garden : no more than a five-minute absence : for she needed to make a telephone call to undo the decision of an earlier telephone call , made impetuously at seven that morning . Five minutes ' absence ! Five minutes ! That Lissa or another of the servants or one of the older children was not nearby , watching over the cradle , was something of an accident , for Germaine had been feeling feverish and prickly that morning , and had thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shards of glass , and the child whisked away , up to the nursery ; and after that Leah 's nerves were such ( so she explained , afterward , again and again ) that she could n't bear anyone in the garden with her , not even the least obtrusive of the servants . And she had wanted , for once , to be alone with Cassandra , and with her thoughts , which tumbled and cascaded and spilled in every direction on certain mornings , quite enchanting her ... . But she had been gone no more than five minutes : no more , certainly , than ten : how had that hellish creature known ? When she returned to the garden and saw the thing just rising from the cradle , its enormous wings beating the air , she began to scream at once , and ran forward , waving her arms as if the Noir Vulture were an ordinary bird to be frightened away . Then she saw the squirming bleedingbaby in its talons , and cried out Oh , Cassandra  --  no  --  in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone terrace . ( Where Vernon , some minutes later , found her . Vernon , whose wild eyes and incoherent babble , whose ticlike grimace , were those of a man Leah had never before gazed upon. )  |p305Eight  or ten miles north of Kincardine there was , suddenly , a giant putty-hued Christ stretched with unmuscular flatness upon His cross , angular , womanish , cartoon-crude , weary . The cross was made of two halved and unskinned logs . Three bloody teardrops moved down Christ 's sunken cheeks . The woman whom the driver of the car had acquired ( not an hour previously , in the dim , smoky , overwarm recesses of Stan 's Tropicana Lounge ) reared back and squeezed his knee in girlish alarm , and laughed , though the sight of the thing could not have been entirely new to her . Did n't she live , after all , around here ? Not around here , exactly . But your mother 's people , you said .. . Oh , they 're from all over , they 're scattered all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Christ as they passed , though she was lodged beside , had seated herself immediately beside , the man who drove the big cream-colored automobile . Jesus , she whispered . Then giggled clumsily at her mistake . Then giggled , blushing , at that lapse of taste . . . . The cross itself must have been about fifteen feet high . Christ was well over twelve feet tall . He gazed out through grape-hued melancholyeyes at the traffic on the highway , His back to the unpainted farmhouse , his dead-pale arms stretched out unnaturally wide . His hair was black  --  tar-black , crow's-wing-black . His ribs were prominent , perhaps Ile had been starved before being nailed to the cross , His legs were painfully thin , a child 's legs , though very long . How silly a fate , the driver of the cal ' thought briefly . That fanny kind of hat they gave him , there , the woman said . IIcr Kootds trailed oil . Thr crown of thorns ?  |p306Oh  , yeah  --  yes ! The crown of thorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her warm stocking-strainingthigh against the driver 's , and at the sight of the morose staring Christ she withdrew it slightly . She unknotted her scarf  --  a filmy powder blue , sprinkled with bits of stardust  --  and fastened it more securelyabout her hair . She cleared her throat . I suppose they 're Catholic , she said . In that house back there . In Stan 's Tropicana Lounge , at 6:00 P.M. on a gauzy-hot July afternoon , there had been a noisy crowd despite the stagnant air : truckers bound for Port Oriskany five hundred miles to the west , men from the mills and the canning factory , farmhands , a few smalltime farmers , a number of very old men who sat quietly at the rear nursing glasses of tepid ale . Four or five unattached women , one of them Tina , who had finished with her job at Kresge 's notions and baby clothes counter for the weekend . . . . Gay , teetering on her high heels , she fed coins into the new jukebox , which bubbled and glared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowness of its mechanical arm , incapable of making a mistake . Nickels were given her by the tall bearded heavy-lidded man in the stained white vest , a stranger , who had driven up ( so everyone in the Tropicana knew , within seconds of his arrival ) in a long low creamcoloredautomobile quite unlike anything they had ever seen . He had a curled , sensual mouth , a very attractive mouth , inside that somewhat untidy beard . Tina , seated beside him at the bar , felt the weight of his interest , unmistakably the weight of his interest , though he said little , and appeared to be discomforted by the commotion around him . She leaned toward him , tapping her pretty painted fingernails against the bar , singing under her breath with the jukebox 's shrill chorus No not 1 , no not I , no no no no no not I ... . When the music ended she slid from the bar stool , her skirt sticking ( damn it , what a nuisance ! ) to her damp buttocks , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's gaze following her . No not I ... . Spider 's legs , her mascara 'd eyelashes . Black and stiff . Running in tears down her cheeks . . . perhaps down his ... staining the pillow . And her ruby-dark lipstick smeared greasily everywhere : his mouth , his beard , his ears , his neck and chest and abdomen and thighs ... . No not I , she sang slyly , her skin glowing with high spirits , rocking from side to side so that her satin blouse strained against her plump shapely shoulders , No not I , no no no no no not I. No no no , no no no , no no no not ! ... ! That damn catchy tune ! I think it 's kind of cute , though . I love to sing . It 's funny how you catch yourself singing , is n't it , when you 're alone , or do n't even know what you 're doing . You have , the man said with a smile , a pretty voice . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what those goddamn summer colds can be like.  |p307Later  , driving along the highway , driving very fast along the highway , he leaned over to unlock the glove compartment and took out a heavy pint-sized silver flask . A silver chain like the one Tina wore on her left ankle attached the cap to the flask . . . . You live around here , or your family is from around here , last name Varrell , you said ? Mother 's side of the family . Out around Kittery . But they also live over there  --  in the mountains  --  spread out all over , y'know ? Got cousins I never met , Tina laughed , and never want to meet . She sipped daintily at the flask . If the bourbon struck her as especiallyfine she gave no indication . My father 's name was Donahauer . Jake . He got killed in the war just did n't come back  --  was s'posed to be on some transport boat or something , but he was n't ; and that was that . My name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't know Al , I hope ! The name seemed to mean nothing to him . Or perhaps he had n't heard . Who ? Al Schmidt . Your husband , you mean ? Ex-husband . Thank the good Lord . She passed the flask to him and his fingers closed slowly about it , stroking her own . In Stan 's Tropicana Lounge , at the very end of the bar , his pale hair fading into long lazy diaphanous plumes of smoke , Nicholas Fuhr lifted a foam-ringed glass in a mock toast . Eying himself in the mirror , perhaps . Behind the disorder of the bottles and the fly-specks . . . . A barman 's rag nearby , reeking . For of course there is always spillage : things smashed , liquids sprayed about . Beer , vomit , blood . Soaked rags . Shreds of clothingthat resemble rags . Had he worn something on his head perhaps that would not have been injured ; but there , in the Tropicana Lounge , lifting a glass gracefully as if he  --  as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhurt . At the sight of the car , parked in the weedy gravel lot , Tina 's pulses leapt . Her eyes narrowed lustfully ; but only for a moment . For she was n't a silly greedy vulgar little half-assed girl . She asked him a few questions about the car because not to ask would have seemed , maybe , unconvincing . ... German ? German . Yes . I suppose , she said coquettishly , running the tip of her tongue lightly about her lips , stroking the fender ( which burned , for the July sun was wicked ) . I suppose , she said , trying not to giggle , you 're one of them men trim ' the city ... you know ... from Port Oriskany ... . I le looked toward her though not at her . His car keys in hand . like in the old days , you know . . . the speedboats on the lake the sraplanrs ... running whiskey down from Canada . I saw one ofp308the seaplanes once , at night . I halfway wanted to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ask them to take me along . . . y'know , for the hell of it . . . . I was just a kid . I did n't know any better . Jesus , she said , shivering , smiling up at him , they would probably have mowed me down with machine-gun bullets . You think I 'm a gangster ? the man in the vest asked . His unlined face looked as though it had been baked , and was incapable of showing expression : but now he drew in a quick amused breath and the corners of his mouth curled . A gangster from the city ? Oh , I know you would n't say , if you were , Tina cried gaily . You think I run rum , at night ? Across the lakes ? Oh , not now , they do n't do that now , Tina laughed , as she brushed past him to climb inside the car . He held the door for her and it pleased him , her warm perfumy odor , lightly touched with an odor of sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But between women he could not , of course , remember it . You think I 'm a gangster from Port Oriskany . He laughed . She settled herself gracefully inside the car , conscious of his admiringgaze . Almost primly tucked her narrow black skirt about her legs . Stockings , in this heat ? And open-backed shoes with tiny black straps , bought just a few days ago . And the thin silver chain around her left ankle . And her toenails painted red . I do n't think anything , she cried gaily . I just like the smell of these seat covers  --  is it leather , real leather ?  --  white leather ? And the dashboard , here , made of some kind of fancy wood6:25 P.M. 6:32 P.M. His pulses leapt too  --  but sporadically , as if they obeyed an inner logic he could not control . Nicholas Fuhr , standing there . But of course it was not Nicholas . But then perhaps it was . His shadowed eyes in the mirror shifting to the side accusingly . You made me kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kill no one ! You 're insane ! Leah shouted in return . She slapped at him  --  he seized her by the upper arm  --  threw her across the bed . The old bed creaked in alarm at the weight of her , at the surprise of her . I loved Nick , you know I loved him , Leah sobbed . How can you accuse me ofYou did n't love him enough , did you ! Gideon shouted . Do n't rove any of us enough , to keep us from dying ! But Gideon was not with Leah , Gideon was rarely with Leah , he was forcing himself to listen to a woman 's high pleased giggly chatter . There was a flirtation of some kind going on : in the midst of it Gideon swallowed a good-sized mouthful of his father 's finest bourbon and wondered that it had so little taste . But in the past several years this particular bourbon had begun to lose its potency too . You think I 'm a gangster ? he said again , laughing.  |p309Well   --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said wittily . You never did tell me your name , she said accusingly , nuzzling his ear . My name , he said slowly . I 'm not sure that I have a name . What do your women call you ? My women ? Yes ! You must have all kinds of women ! It was merry , it was gay and harmless , simply a flirtation . I do n't like anyone to call me by name , he said in the same slow bemused voice . Well  --  are you married ? No . Yes , you are , yes , you are  --  I can tell . Not really . Well , then what ? Separated ? Divorced ? No . No  --  what ? No nothing . She might have been nervous but she erupted in a peal of girlish laughter , as if he had said something extraordinarily funny . She beat on his thigh with her fist in a fierce little delighted gesture she had certainly used before , with other men . It was gay , it was merry and harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a wife , sure enough , Tina said . And I bet she 's beautiful . Gideon said nothing . He pressed down on the accelerator . Is n't she , eh ? Beautiful ? And rich too  --  rich too . I know you people . She laughed . Do you ? Do you know us ? he asked . I know your kind . He glanced at her , his face stiffening . But then he decided to smile . For why not smile ?  --  Nicholas had no right to accuse him , back in Stan 's Tropicana Lounge . And perhaps Leah had told the truth : they were not guilty of killing anyone . His tone changed , became formal , mock-formal : What do you say to tlu Nautauga House for dinner . . . ? Ah , but she is n't dressed for a place like that ! The very idea frightens her ; sobers her . " I'herr we 'll take you somewhere first , he said vaguely , so ( hat you can buy something . A half-hour should be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little frightened . Wriggled her toes .

But you do n't know if you 're going to like me yet , Rodman , she said , her voice dipping coarsely . He murmured something she could not hear . You 're sweet , she said , linking her arm through his , and bringing her hand beside his on the steering wheel . His hand was immense  --  such a broad palm , such long wide strong fingers  --  she was sure they must be extremely strong . She sang under her breath again . No no no , no no no . . . . Then began to tell him about her husband . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I like a man with a sense of humor . Willing to laugh at things , you know , not crying in his beer , taking it out on everybody else . AI went around with his head in a goddamn sack or something . I swear he did . My little girl  --  that 's Audrey  --  maybe you 'll meet Audrey sometime  --  was afraid of him , he had such a nasty temper . Got wounded in the war but nothing special , they gave him a purple heart like everybody else got , what the hell , it was all he was good for , getting himself shot in the leg , though actually it was his rear-end but he did n't like to say , he thought people 'd laugh and they did .

She laughed extravagantly , wheezing , gasping for breath . You ever heard anything so crazy ? So funny ? Daddy 's holes in his face are cut out right where his eyes areHe joined her , laughing . Uproariously laughing . As the heavy car sped along the highway . To the left , the sun was nowhere near the horizon but the sky , threaded with somber quizzical clouds , had begun to darken . There was a bruised , faintly resentful look to the air . But the clouds were too thin to be storm clouds . North , into the mountains . But Nautauga Falls was in the other direction . So perhaps he should turn the car around . He braked . And turned into a narrow dirt road , an old logging road . Drove a little too fast so that the big car rattled . The flask slipped out of Tina 's hand and struck the dashboard , and bourbon splashed. ... driving too goddamn fast , she said , surprised . Not for people in a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge , of all he could see , there might be a place he could stand , to look back at what he was : but perhaps it was dangerous to go there . Men hacked their way to that place . . . and then did not return . They slipped over the edge , or stared down too long into the abyss ; they could n't remember where they had come from , still less ' why they had gone where they had . There , you forgot it was the rim , most likely . You did n't even think it might be the center of a circle because the idea of a circle would n't be there , for you to step into , the way you usually step into thoughts prepared beforehand .. Oh , look  --  That tree  --  There must have been a storm  --   |p311The  road was impassable : a giant poplar lay at an angle across it . All right , said the driver , get out . This is as far as we go , I want to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the bourbon had splashed . You 're in such a goddamn hurry all at once , she said sullenly . But the color was up in her cheeks and her eyes were shining as she slid across the seat to get out his door . Grunting , giggling , trying to pull her skirt down . Embarrassed that her thighs , which showed for a moment , whitely , were so raddled and jellyish . But he was staring off into the sky . Slowly he ran both hands through his stiff bushy hair . Broad-shouldered , tall , very tall , lean , handsome , but wearing that soiled white vest , and a pale blue shirt that looked as if he had n't changed it for several days ; and his beard needed trimming . They would stay at the Nautauga House , probably . Where ( Tina knew , for a friend worked in the smoke shop off the lobby ) there was a gentleman 's barber ... . Now he turned to her , and was looking at her . For the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggered , her heels sinking in the sandy soil , and tried to smile . All right , he said , as if not catching that smile , strip . What ? Your clothes . Strip . Now . Before we go back . I want to see , he said softly , with an air of melancholy resignation , if I like you.
