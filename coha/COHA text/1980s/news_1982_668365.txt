America ' s newest and hottest accommodations trend is B &; B , initials which stand for Bed and Breakfast but could just as easily represent Bigger - and Bedder . " We ' re absolutely inundated with requests from all over the country . . . people seem delighted with us and the kind of personalized service we offer , " said Joan Brownhill of Pineapple Hospitality , a New England-wide B &; B service based in New Bedford . Pineapple Hospitality - 384 Rodney French blvd. , New Bedford , Mass. , 02744 . Tel : 990-1696 - was founded in January 1981 , primarily to put visitors into spare rooms in restored houses in the old whaling town ' s historic district . By the spring of last year , the service had some 40 rooms available , mostly in southeastern Massachusetts . Today , Pineapple Hospitality can book clients into 125 B &; B ' s in all six New England states and has links with B &; B ' s in other parts of the US and abroad . Its growth rate has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing just a handful of rooms only a half dozen years ago , B &; B ' s now number in the thousands and are found all across North America . The first attempt at a definite directory of B &; B ' s - " Christopher ' s Bed and Breakfast Guide to US and Canada " ( Travel Discoveries , $3.95 ) - lists more than 3000 houses , inns , hotels , organizations , and services but is by no means complete . Another guidebook , " Bed and Breakfast USA - A Guide to Tourist Homes &; Guesthouses , " by Betty Rundback and Nancy Ackerman ( E.P . Dutton , $5.95 ) lists more than 2000 old fashioned guesthouse with room-and- breakfast packages . The B &; B name and concept originated in Great Britain , where it has been a popular form of budget accommodation for many years . The basic British B &; B is invariably a private home which displays an identifying sign , charges a modest price , and serves " a full English breakfast " - almost always bacon and eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardized . All provide beds , but breakfast can be anything from a stale danish to eggs Benedict with chilled chablis . If in a private home , the American B &; B rarely has any kind of identifying sign and usually has to be booked by calling a reservation service or becoming a dues paying member of a B &; B organization . Most American B &; B ' s are in private homes or apartments , but many guest houses , inns , and small hotels now also call themselves B &; B ' s . Rates naturally vary , but B &; B accommodation for two in private homes currently seems to be averaging $30-$50 a night , with prices in rural areas much lower than urban ones . By contrast , B &; B inns and hotels can often be quite pricey . The Bed and Breakfast Inn in San Francisco , for example , an elegant , 10- room " European style pension " a short walk from Fishermen ' s Wharf charges up to $148 a night for a double room - with continental breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The Bed and Breakfast Inn , and some others nearly as expensive , are listed in " Bed &; Breakfast - American Style , " by Norman Simpson ( Berkshire Traveler Press , $7.95 ) . Simpson is author of the perennially best selling inn guide " Country Inns and Back Roads , " but in " Bed &; Breakfast - American Style " he does little to clear up the confusion about what constitutes an American B &; B. The 1981 edition of Simpson ' s guide listed about 170 so-called B &; B ' s , this year ' s edition has more than 270 . However , virtually all are hotels or inns which could be ( and in a number of cases are ) included in " Country Inns and Back Roads . " Some of the room rates quoted by Simpson don ' t even include breakfast - and one " American Style " B &; B ( which he admits to not having even seen ) is in New Zealand ! In his preface , Simpson explains : " American Style ' implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this book is not based on budget travel . . . " But , economy-minded travelers seem to be the ones most enthusiastic about the B &; B concept . In fact , the first American B &; B service was organized in Virginia in 1976 - the Bicentennial year - especially to meet the needs of foreign tourists on tight budgets . The expected hordes of foreign Bicentennial visitors never materialized , but the B &; B ' s , many of them in old plantion houses , proved very popular with American travelers . The service still exists : Guesthouses Reservation Service , PO Box 5737 , Charlottesville , Va . Tel : ( 804 ) 979-7264 . The Charlottesville experiment was successful , but attracted relatively little attention . It wasn ' t until 1978 when Jean Brown launched Bed and Breakfast International in San Francisco that the American B &; B movement really began to take off . A former teacher , Brown was familiar with the British B &; B from summer vacations abroad . " There was no B &; B in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it was a service never known here before . " The name included the word " international , " Brown said " because I intended it to be for Europeans who might want to stay in an American home - I didn ' t expect it to appeal to Americans . " However , from the first Bed and Breakfast International attracted far more Americans than foreigners . It also received much favorable publicity and was widely copied all over California . ( Californians have also done much to spread the movement : Pineapple Hospitality ' s Brownhill reports that of all her clients " . . . Californians are particularly enthusiastic . " ) Today , Bed &; Breakfast International - 151 Ardmore rd. , Kensington , Calif. 94707 . Tel : ( 415 ) 525-4569 - represents close to 300 B &; B ' s , most of them in or around San Francisco . " I don ' t advocate being spread out , " said Brown . She is also critical of attempts to create national B &; B services by incorporating commercial properties into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commercial business of room renting , " Brown said " Good B &; B can ' t be mass produced - and it will never make anybody a millionaire . " The first major B &; B service in the Northeast , and one of the first to try to go national , was the Bed and Breakfast League of America . Founded in Princeton , N.J. , the league was reorganized last year and under new management now operatesfrom Washingon : Bed and Breakfast League , 2855 29th st. , N.W. , Washigton , D.C. 20008 . Tel : ( 202 ) 232-8718 . The League has about 250 host B &; B ' s around the country , the majority in the Northeast . Most B &; B organizations are reservation services which charge an annual fee to host members - typically $50 a year - and take a commission on each room rented . The Bed and Breakfast League is an exception , a membership organization which makes its B &; B information available only to guest members , who pay $15 for a single membership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual dues of $50 , plus a l5 percent nightly commission on each transaction . ) The league publishes a directory of hosts , which gives location and a description of the accommodations - but no names or addresses . ( For those those you have to call the league on a members 800 number . ) The B &; B organizations which seem to be growing fastest are those rooted in place - and careful about whom they let belong to them . One such is Urban Ventures , Box 426 , New York , N.Y. , 10024 . Tel : ( 212 ) 662-1234 . " Our mottos is We Give You A Friend In The City ' and all our hosts are selected for their friendliness , " said Urban Ventures co- owner Mary McCauley , " we reject about half the people who apply ; the chief criteria is hospitality - if the host is warm and hospitable , hardly anybody ever kvetches . " Urban Ventures has about 300 B &; B rooms , almost all in Manhattan . Rates run from $25 to $50 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also probably the only B &; B reservation service which regularly rents apartments . These come without breakfast - guests have the run of the kitchen and can cook their own - and range in price from $50 to $100 a night . In the opinion of many B &; B enthusiasts , the best of both worlds would be a national organization of local and regional B &; B services ; and one is now in its initial organizing stages . Called Associated Bed and Breakfast Services , it consists of l5 established B &; B services from Florida to Hawaii . " We ' re just trying to help each other out . . . and its nice to know there is someone else out there , " said Allison Caswell , owner and manager of House Guests , Cape Cod and an organizer and founding member of Associated Bed and Breakfast . Founded a year ago , House Guests , Cape Cod is based in Dennis , and represents 100 B &; B ' s - about 80 of them private homes , the rest small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number as yet , but any member service will put guests in touch with the others The members are : Bed and Breakfast in Arizona , 8433 North Black Canyon , Suite 160 , Phoenix , Arizona , 85021 .
