Salvadoran voters survive bullets and chaos , but fail to select a new President <P> It seemed to be a moment of democratic triumph , but only a moment , too fragile to be sustained . Almost immediately the political situation in El Salvador last week was clouded with the familiar burdens of uncertainty and confusion , all of which had potentially troublesome consequences for the Reagan Administration and its policies in Central America . But there was no denying a remarkable sense of occasion : for a brief instant , the future of El Salvador ( pop . 4.7 million ) had rested where it belonged , in the hands of its electorate . <P> By the hundreds of thousands , Salvadorans braved the threats , and sometimes the bullets , of the Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( F.M.L.N. ) to join long , serpentine polling lines for the country 's much awaited presidential elections . Sadly , untold thousands were then cheated of the chance to cast their ballots by a sophisticated election system that led to chaos because it was too complex for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were disenfranchised by the guerrillas , who occupied 44 of the country 's 261 electoral municipalities , blocked highways , conducted sabotage and confiscated the national identity cards that voters needed to show before casting ballots . <P> Despite that formidable array of difficulties , about 1.3 million Salvadorans , or roughly 76% of those able to vote , successfully took part in the U.S.-backed election process , which climaxed two months of acrimonious and sometimes violent campaigning . Their collective decision , however , was to remain indecisive . Unofficially , it appeared that no candidate in the seven-man race had passed the 50% mark necessary to become the country 's first freely elected President in a half-century . <P> At week 's end Salvadoran election officials were still laboriously tallying the results by hand . Up to 45% of the votes were expected to go to front-running Jos Napolen Duarte , 58 , leader of the center-left Christian Democratic Party . Well behind , with an estimated 30% , was Duarte 's archrival , Roberto d'Aubuisson , ultrarightist leader of the Nationalist Republican Alliance , known by its Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Francisco ( " Chachi " ) Guerrero , 58 , leader of the conservative National Conciliation Party . The election 's inconclusive outcome means that Duarte and D'Aubuisson will face each other in a runoff election , probably at the beginning of May . <P> The balloting was hardly over before President Reagan hailed the election as " another victory for freedom over tyranny . " Said he : " Those valiant people braved guerrilla violence and sabotage to do what we take for granted : cast then-votes for President . " The President 's enthusiasm was shared at a White House gathering of the 31 official U.S. observers who were among some 300 foreign onlookers from 28 countries to witness the election . House Majority Leader James Wright of Texas declared himself ecstatic at the " deep desire " of Salvadorans to achieve a democratic society . Republican Senator Jeremiah Denton of Alabama observed that " the Salvadorans made more effort to conduct fair elections than we do in the state of Alabama . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
