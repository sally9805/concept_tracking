The EPA wants more lead out <P> When the Environmental Protection Agency two years ago took steps to cut the amount of lead used in gasoline , it failed to reckon with the orneriness of American motorists . Car owners have been illegally filling an estimated 13% of the no-lead vehicles on the road with leaded gas , which costs an average of 7 per gal . less than the unleaded variety . Last week the EPA fought back . It proposed rules that would slash the amount of lead in leaded gasoline by 91% , starting in 1986 . <P> The agency based its proposal on growing concern about the danger of lead , which can be fatal in large doses and can damage the liver and kidneys and cause mental retardation in smaller ones . Said EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus : " The evidence is overwhelming that lead is a threat to human health . This action will greatly reduce the threat , especially for pregnant women and young children . " He added , moreover , that " recent evidence shows that adverse health effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretofore considered safe . " Ruckelshaus estimated that the ruling would lower by nearly 50% the number of children with levels of lead in their blood that exceed U.S. health standards . He said the affected youngsters would be reduced from 97,000 at present to 47,000 by 1988 . <P> While many environmentalists and health advocates had urged an outright ban on the toxic element , Ruckelshaus said that some lead was needed to protect the engines in older cars . Lead helps lubricate valves and reduce engine knock . <P> The EPA predicted that the benefits of getting the lead out will be far greater than the cost . The agency said the move would create overall savings of $1.8 billion in the form of lower medical bills and increased fuel economy . By contrast , staff members estimated that refiners will need to spend only about $575 million to retool their facilities , or less than 1% of the current total cost of making gasoline . That could push the price of leaded fuel , which still accounts for some 45% of gasoline sales , close to the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hurt most by the EPA action are those like Virginia-based Ethyl Corp . that produce lead additive for refiners . The firm , which supplies about 40% of the lead in U.S. gasoline , has vowed to fight the proposal . <P> Ruckelshaus suggested last week that even tougher rules may follow if motorists continue to pollute illegally by using leaded fuel in engines designed for lead-free gasoline . One possible remedy being considered : a total ban on leaded gas if the violations persist .
