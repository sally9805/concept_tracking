On many a Monday morning , when the first copies of TIME go on sale , I have paged through the magazine and felt the twinge of a missed opportunity . My letter to you in this space had mentioned a cover story , some other single article or member of our staff , but neglected half a dozen other pieces that were similarly distinctive . So I made myself a promise : This week I will write about stories that I am particularly proud of in this issue , until I run out of space . <P> My task was complicated by the course of events . We began the week with a different cover story in mind , but were struck by the sudden upsurge of debate over the highly emotional issue of whether drugs should be legalized . On Thursday we switched to the story that appears in the Nation section . It was reported by all our domestic bureaus and written by Senior Writer George Church . Accompanying the main story are examinations of the military 's new role in the war on drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug consumers . <P> A few pages away in the World section is Washington Bureau Chief Strobe Talbott 's inside account of how , after years of feints and frustrations , the U.S. and the Soviet Union have just about reached a strategic-arms-reduction agreement , an achievement that will be at the center of next week 's Moscow summit . It is a tough subject , but one worth a few minutes ' extra attention , and we do n't think anyone can tell it better than Talbott , the author of two books on arms control . Not far beyond that story comes Profile , a department we introduced six months ago to provide word portraits of compelling personalities . This week 's Profile , written by Washington Correspondent Ted Gup , is about North Carolina 's often contentious , always colorful Senator Jesse Helms . Then there is the Design section , which showcases the work of Architects Gordon Bunshaft and Oscar Niemeyer , 1988 co-winners of the prestigious Pritzker Prize . Some stories can be told only in words , but this one must also be seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Contributor Kurt Andersen 's description , catches the essence of the architects ' accomplishments . Then there is the Technology section 's look at a new generation of cameras , the Living story on women 's clubs , the fascinating piece in Medicine about . . . I could go on . And on . But I have run out of space . Perhaps I will feel better this Monday .
