Jane Fonda has made more than her share of controversial scenes , in the movies and in the headlines , but none has quite matched a certain sylvan sequence in On Golden Pond . She stands on the edge of a dock in Squam Lake , N.H. , her body firm and svelte , her skin as burnished as an Indian totem , her bikini two bright tattoos . A shiver or two later , she has backflipped off the dock and sliced into the cold water . As sentimental drama , the moment is effective ; as cinema , it is unremarkable ; as a display of new-fashioned star quality , it is radiant . But , oh , the ruckus it raised , as the movie reeled surprisingly toward blockbuster status last winter and spring . No audience could watch Jane without murmuring in tones of awe , " Look at <P> that tan ! " " Look at that tone ! " Fonda 's critics took a different view . " She has a body like wood , " one man said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand her down . " Dale Pollock , a reporter for the Los Angeles Times , complained , " That scene is supposed to be the climax of the film . Instead , it 's a commercial for Jane Fonda 's Workout Book . " If so , the commercial did its job . Work-out ( Simon &; Schuster , $18.95 ) , published the month On Golden Pond was released , has had 31 weeks on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list ( No. 1 for 21 weeks ) . The book has become the focus for a baby conglomerate that mints money by marketing Fonda 's exercise ideology . A 90-min. video cassette showing Fonda and the workout instructors performing the regimen retails for $59.95 ; a two-record album of mellow-rock exercises has made the Top 40 ; her Workout studios are now in Beverly Hills , Encino and San Francisco and will be opening up in other large cities . At the Beverly Hills center , housewives and secretaries mingle with Hollywood actresses , such as Kate Jackson , Ali MacGraw and Jill Clayburgh , spending $6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donkey kicks . <P> Occasionally , Fonda supervises the workouts-in those intervals when she is not acting in a movie or producing one , touring the talk shows , raising her two daughters , or promoting the campaign of her husband Tom Hayden for a California state assembly seat this fall . At 44 , she is at the top of both her profession and her form . Fonda is an ace saleswoman for her program because for a quarter of a century now she has reflected changing fashions in dress and image , politics and physique . In the ' 40s she was a movie star 's brat , going chubby and haywire , while her father Henry played love scenes and went to war . In the late ' 50s Jane was a Vogue cover girl , fresh out of Vassar and mummified in heavy makeup . The early ' 60s saw her as Hollywood 's all-American ingenue in Tall Story and Sunday in New York . A few years later , her then husband Roger Vadim retooled her into a European sex symbol as Barbarella .
