" I thought that was it , " said the two-time Irish Olympian , who set the world indoor mile mark of 3 : 50. 6 last week in San Diego . Not quite . Coghlan ' s official time , 12 : 54. 8 , missed Emiel Puttemans ' s world record by two-tenths of a second , but was the second fastest in history. // " It ' s a tremendous personal achievement to come so close , " Coghlan said , after hearing his time. // // Woodard Excels in High Jump // On any other night , Coghlan would have been an overwhelming choice for the outstanding athlete citation . But Jeff Woodard became America ' s record-setting high jumper , indoors or outdoors , by clearing 7 feet 7 3/4 inches on his first attempt. // In an almost flawless exhibition of " flopping , " the 6-foot 170-pound Woodard cleared 6-11 1/4 and 7-1 1/4 on his first attempt , 7-3 1/4 on his second jump and then 7-4 1/4 , 7-5 1/2 and 7-7 3/4 on first jumps . He missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark , 7-9 , but made two convincing efforts on his first two jumps. // Only one other competitor , Vladimir Yaschenko of the Soviet Union , has jumped higher indoors . Woodward is 22 years old and won the National Collegiate outdoor title for the University of Alabama last spring . However , his 7-7 1/4 winning jump then was not officially recognized because of sloping conditions at the meet site in Austin , Tex. , // Coghlan ' s middle-distance doubleheader has clearly established him as track and field ' s new chairman of the boards . Not since Martin McGrady dominated the 600-yard run with a 1970 record that still stands has anyone seemed more suited for the tactical world of indoor racing than Coghlan , 28 years old. // Last week , he outkicked Steve Scott , America ' s premier miler , en route to a record . Last night , he led for all but eight of the 33 laps , on a smaller , slower , 11 laps-to-the-mile banked track than the eight-lap track where Puttemans ran his record race five years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a surprising spirited spurt to the front by Dick Buerkle with nine laps left could shake Coghlan ' s concentration . Buerkle led the seven-man field for four laps before Coghlan , comfortably in second place , accelerated to the front with five laps left , kicking his last mile in 4 : 12. // " I was trying to open up a little bit , but he wouldn ' t let me , " said the baldish Buerkle , who finished second in 12 : 58 , the second fastest by an American . Solomon Chebor of Fairleigh Dickinson University also finished under 13 minutes , in 12 : 59. 8. // Coghlan ' s performance , wearing the red and white colors of the New York Athletic Club , delighted an announced crowd of 15 , 891 . So did the 9 : 38. 1 world indoor best in the two-mile by Francie Larrieu , who won a last-lap duel from Margaret Groos. // " A lot of spunk left in the old maid , " said Miss Larrieu , 28 . <> <> Kania Sets Weight Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35-pound weight throw with a toss of 73 feet 4 inches , an American indoor mark . The weight throw was held at Jadwin Gymnasium of Princeton University and broke a 12-year-old standard. // Other strong women ' s performances came from Chandra Cheeseborough of Tennessee State University , who ran the fastest indoor 220 yards ever ( 23. 27 ) and was voted the meet ' s outstanding woman athlete , and Evelyn Ashford , who beat the season ' s best sprint field with a 6. 63 in the 60-yard dash. // Two years ago , Miss Ashford was the world ' s dominant sprinter , overwhelming the best from East Germany and the Soviet Union . A knee injury and the United States Olympic boycott sidetracked her in 1980 , but after overhauling Jeannette Bolden in the final few strides last night , she said , " Everything ' s fine , I ' m where I want to be . I think I ' m better than I was. " // Besides her speed , Miss Ashford dazzled the crowd with her sleek beige speed-skating suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets as a precaution against muscle pulls . Now she says she feels so comfortable in the outfit ( " it feels like a second skin " ) that she is considering wearing the suit outdoors . <> <> Nehemiah Among Absentees // The meet was not without its share of problems . Renaldo ( Skeets ) Nehemiah and Greg Foster were absentees in the high hurdles , Houston McTear and Steve Williams missed the sprints , and Jodi Anderson and Kathy McMillan were entered but failed to appear in the women ' s long jump. // Nehemiah appeared in street clothes at the Garden yesterday afternoon , after the heats of the hurdles in which he was entered . He said he was " physically sore and exhausted " from participating in two " Superstars " competitions for television in the last 10 days . Nehemiah won the national version of the made-for-television event. // " I haven ' t had a chance to train in three weeks , " said the world record-holder from Scotch Plains , N.J. Alejandro Casanas of Cuba won the high hurdles in a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed " at Nehemiah ' s non-appearance. // Runway difficulties nullified the anticipated duel between Larry Myricks and Carl Lewis in the long jump yesterday afternoon . Myricks , the top-ranking American in recent years , fouled five of his six jumps but still won with 26-8 1/4 . Lewis , the Willingboro , N.J. , collegian who set the world indoor mark of 27-10- 1/4 last week , was second in 26-6- 1/4 , his steps admittedly choppy because of the shortened runway . <> <> Scott Takes Mile in 3 : 57. 3 // Coghlan ' s decision to enter the three mile allowed Scott and Ray Flynn of Ireland to chase an indoor mile crown . Scott won with a final lean , in 3 : 57. 3 , to Flynn ' s 3 : 57. 4. // Coghlan spent yesterday afternoon showing his father and coach around Manhattan . " Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise having my mind off the race , " said Coghlan , the former Villanova National Collegiate champion , who finished fourth in the 1 , 500 meters at the 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Moscow last summer. // Coghlan , however , has always run smoothly on the cozier indoor tracks , where his shorter stride has maximum efficiency . He ran the first mile last night in 4 : 18 but said , " I wasn ' t too comfortable out there all by myself. " // At the two-mile mark , his time had slowed slightly to 8 : 42 . " When I heard 10 : 55 , " he said of the time with seven laps left , " I knew I had a good shot at getting it. " // With the crowd on its feet , Coghlan ran his last half mile in 2 : 03. 8 , determination vividly captured in his pained facial expression. // " I was going as hard as I could , " he said , recalling the time he had eased at the finish at the Wanamaker Mile , losing a world indoor mark by only one-tenth of a second . " But I was finding it difficult to be zippy . I was running more on strength than on speed. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
