The Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers Union accepted a two-year contract proposal from Gulf Oil Corp. that affords minimal wage and benefit improvements , reflecting a tough bargaining environment resulting from a spate of industry refinery closings and layoffs . The union said in Denver that it expects the settlement to become the pattern for dozens of other new contracts covering some 50 , 000 of its oil worker members nationwide . All such pacts are subject to ratification by the rank and file . The Gulf offer would raise an average worker ' s $13. 61-an-hour wage by a total 4% over the two years . That includes 20 cents an hour more in the first year and 35 cents in the second . The offer would also boost by $10 , and then $5 , the company ' s monthly contribution to workers ' family medical insurance premiums . Gulf currently pays $151. 50 of the $174-a-month cost of such coverage . But such costs are expected to rise to $212 beginning Feb. 1 . The union wanted " substantial " wage boosts in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil Bargaining Policy Committee approved the Gulf offer about an hour after it was extended yesterday morning . The offer affords 10 cents an hour in wages and $5 a month in premiums more than Gulf ' s previous bid that the committee rejected last week . The union didn ' t have much immediate comment on the pact . A spokesman offered : " I don ' t think members of the committee felt it ( the wage increase ) was substantial . But they did accept it . " Old contracts were set to expire at 12 : 01 a. m. last Sunday . But the union ' s president , Joseph Misbrener , asked workers to remain on the job 72 hours longer in the hope of reaching an accord . The union never ruled out chances that it might call a nationwide strike to win a better offer . But it seemed dedicated to negotiating a settlement , in apparent recognition of a weakened bargaining position . Plant closures and layoffs have worked to deplete OCAW ' s ranks by about 18% since 1980 ; its strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refineries have become more automated . Separately , Gulf directors , as expected , rejected unanimously a proposal by the T. Boone Pickens Jr. group of investors , to spin off oil profits directly to shareholders in a royalty trust . " The union got everything it could out of us , " said a bargainer for a company that expects to follow Gulf ' s lead . " We were in an area that was as far as we were prepared to go . " The accord rules out a nationwide call to action by union officials here . But there remains a signficant chance of strikes at individual work sites around the country where oil companies are working hard to win concessions that would give them more control over deploying workers . " A strike on local issues is entirely possible here  --  in fact it ' s entirely probable , " according to Roy Barnes , A local OCAW official in Deer Park , Texas , the site of Shell Oil Co. ' s flagship refinery . Shell has been pushing a slate that includes reducing seniority rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers to bid for new jobs . Mr. Barnes said , " We have made no progress at all " with Shell . The two sides were called together late yesterday by a federal mediator . The OCAW said that the approved Gulf offer also provides for expedited arbitration of union grievances as well as a voluntary political action committee checkoff plan .
