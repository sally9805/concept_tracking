A killer goes free as an angry Britain sends Libya 's " diplomats " packing <P> Somewhere over the western Mediterranean or southern France last Friday evening , a British Caledonian Airways jetliner heading northwest toward London crossed paths with a Libyan airliner flying southeast toward Tripoli . The planes were carrying home the second and final contingents of British and Libyan diplomats , thereby ending an eleven-day war of nerves between the two countries . It had begun a week earlier when an unidentified man fired shots through the windows of the Libyan embassy in London , killing a British policewoman and wounding eleven Libyan dissidents gathered outside in St. James 's Square . <P> After the British government responded by breaking relations with the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and giving his representatives until midnight Sunday to vacate the premises in London , it seemed at first that the petulant Gaddafi might hold out until the last possible moment before repatriating his people . The British remained fearful that a slip-up could lead to a gun battle in St. James 's Square and a greater loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a week of painstaking negotiation , the withdrawal of diplomats and the closing of embassies was accomplished without further mishap . <P> The week was a tense and painful one for the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . The British public was outraged by the murder of the policewoman , Constable Yvonne Fletcher , 25 , and by the thought that the Libyan " diplomat " who had fired an automatic weapon into a crowd of anti-Gaddafi demonstrators should go unpunished . Even as the diplomats of the two countries were preparing to fly home on Friday afternoon , the funeral of Constable Fletcher was being held at the 13th century Salisbury Cathedral in southern England . <P> But the Thatcher government had been concerned about the welfare and safety of the estimated 8,500 Britons in Libya . It also doubted the feasibility of bringing the Libyan gunman to trial , since in the end he could probably claim diplomatic immunity . Finally , there was the fear that the Libyans might attempt a desperate act of terrorism , possibly by planting a time bomb in their vacated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-ranking British official : " We want them out , out , out ! " <P> There were reasons for the British concern . From within the sealed-off embassy on St. James 's Square , the militants sent Gaddafi a message , reported from outside sources , pledging that they were prepared to die " in defense of our principles and aims . " The British government understood that such rhetoric comes easily to Libyan revolutionaries , but it also knew that it could not rule out the possibility of a Libyan act of ultimate defiance . In the meantime a coroner 's court was told that Constable Fletcher had died of stomach wounds from shots fired by a high-velocity weapon , and that eyewitnesses had seen smoke and flames emanating from the barrel of an AK-47 automatic rifle thrust from an upstairs window of the embassy . For most of last week , her constable 's cap lay on the pavement where it had fallen , still within firing range of Libyans inside the embassy . On Thursday , a fellow officer flouted orders and retrieved the cap so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slain constable 's coffin .
