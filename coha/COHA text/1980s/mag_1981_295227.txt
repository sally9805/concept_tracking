THE VANISHING HITCHHIKER by Jan Harold Brunvand Norton ; 208 pages ; $14.95 <P> Just off old Highway 81 near McPherson , Kans. , writes Jan Harold Brunvand , there is an unmarked lane known to young couples as Hookman 's Road . One night , a teen-age boy and girl were parked there when they heard over the car radio that a killer with a hook for a hand was on the loose . The girl became frightened and demanded that her companion drive her home . Angry , and perhaps a bit uneasy himself , he roared off abruptly . When they arrived at her house , he went around the car to open her door . Dangling from the handle was a bloody hook . <P> Tellers of the story swear it is true even though there are many tellers and many datelines . Brunvand , 48 , professor of English at the University of Utah , says reports of the bloody hook have surfaced in Maryland , Wisconsin , Indiana , Texas , Arkansas , Oregon and parts of Canada . The hook has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that either Detroit has begun issuing it as optional equipment or the story has become nothing less than an American folk tale . <P> <P> Brunvand has catalogued dozens of local happenings that somehow seemed to happen in different localities all over the country , yarns that are probably untrue but widely retold . There is , for instance , the story of the old woman who , whenever her dog or cat got wet , would dry it off in the oven . Then her children bought her a microwave , with gruesome consequences . Perhaps the most popular American folk yarn , the " vanishing hitchhiker , " has been around for decades ( centuries , if you count the version in Acts 8 : 26-39 ) . It has been updated for the automobile age . A driver picks up a hitchhiker , usually a young woman , who sits in the back seat and says little . When the driver arrives at her destination , he turns around and finds she has vanished . Inquiring at the address she had given him , he learns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales are based at least partly on fact . What New Yorker has not heard of the giant alligators that prowl the city 's sewer system , descendants of smaller ones brought home from Florida vacations and flushed down the toilet ? Brunvand cites evidence that a few underground gators may have existed . Yet a modern legend 's staying power seems to have little to do with its veracity . Since the late 1960s , there have been reports from around the country of shoppers in discount stores being bitten by poisonous snakes or insects hidden in some piece of imported merchandise or other . None of the incidents has been verified . Nor has anyone ever documented the " Kentucky fried rat " that allegedly fell into the batter at a fast-food restaurant . <P> Why do such stories survive , even flourish , in an age of science and cynicism ? Many of them , says Brunvand , serve as cautionary tales , sermonettes on the evils of , say , parking in deserted lanes or buying cheap imported goods . Others are inspired by suspicion of change-of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever is new and puzzling or scary , but which eventually becomes familiar , may turn up in modern folklore .
