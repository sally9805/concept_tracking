Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis was a long-distance runner before it was cool , finishing the Boston Marathon as a high school senior in 1951 . His political career had its own Heartbreak Hill , a devastating primary defeat when he first sought re-election as Governor in 1978 . But Dukakis hit his stride with a comeback victory in 1982 , and since then has compiled a record of achievement from welfare reform to tax reduction that has earned him a laurel wreath as one of the best Governors in the country . Last week Dukakis embarked on the most grueling endurance race of them all , an uphill quest for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination . " I have the energy to run this marathon , " the 53-year-old Governor declared , " the strength to run this country , the experience to manage our Government and the values to lead our people . " <P> But does Dukakis , often viewed as too aloof and cerebral for national politics , have the vision to inspire Democratic voters ? The son of Greek immigrants , he lacks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a candidate , and that leaves Dukakis as the only Northeasterner and the , only ethnic Democrat in a field further narrowed last week when Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers announced he would not run . <P> In place of stirring rhetoric , Dukakis offers his own stewardship of a surging state economy that has transformed Massachusetts from industrial stagnation to New Age affluence . Dukakis has been refining this message of economic regeneration since he began nurturing dreams of the Oval Office after his landslide re-election victory last November . An initial foray into Iowa drew mixed reviews . But Dukakis , generally far more impressive in small groups than on a podium , gave a relaxed and polished performance at the New Hampshire state Democratic dinner early this month . His speech combined a vision of an entrepreneurial yet compassionate Democratic Party , pointed references to local issues like his opposition to the Seabrook nuclear power plant , and a rare evocation of his immigrant heritage . <P> At least initially , the fact that New Hampshire is right next door vaults Dukakis ahead of other Democratic dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second to Front Runner Gary Hart . But much of Dukakis ' early support is linked to high name recognition , and Joseph Grandmaison , a veteran New Hampshire party organizer , says voters there may view Dukakis more as an admired neighbor than as a would-be President . Even if Dukakis does well in the Granite State , he will be dismissed as a regional favorite son unless he then holds his own in the Southern primaries . <P> Dukakis ' New England ties mask a major disadvantage : his circumscribed career has brought him no closer to foreign policy than his morning newspaper . Dukakis ' positions , which are still hazy , smack more of Harvard than of the heartland , which may be a problem in the South . He opposes the President 's policies in Central America and on Star Wars but has yet to offer a positive program other than wispy references to world peace . Nonetheless , Dukakis ' pragmatic liberalism is appealing to a party searching for a post-Reagan philosophy . Pollster Geoffrey Garin contends that Dukakis is the only Democrat able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've made it work . "
