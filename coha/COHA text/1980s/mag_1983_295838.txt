Parade rains on an old story <P> Dorothy Ridgway was nine in 1960 when wire services reported that she was dying of a rare bone disease and that her only wish was for Christmas cards : a kindly world sent 600,000 of them within weeks . This year Parade , the ubiquitous ( circ. 22 million ) Sunday newspaper supplement , decided to visit Dorothy , now 31 and alive after all . The portrait in the Dec. 19 issue was vivid down to the last teardrop : Freelance Writer Dotson Rader found Dorothy , stunted and virtually housebound , living with her parents in Roanoke , Va. , sustained by memories , dreams and a disability check of $221 a month . Once again America responded . Parade Managing Editor Larry Smith announced last week that the magazine was forwarding truckloads of mail to Dorothy . She also received cash , offers of color televisions , furniture and a central heating system . Exulted Smith : " Dorothy 's story has tugged at the heartstrings of America . " But the Ridgways were embarrassed ; they pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorest , and insisted that their home was not , as Parade depicted it , " bleak . " Further , Dorothy 's check is augmented by Medicaid , and her parents receive public assistance totaling about $500 more a month ; gifts may imperil the family 's eligibility for relief . Said Mary Ridgway : " Others are worse off than us . I do not want people to think Dorothy was begging . " Parade Editor Walter Anderson defended the story as a " powerfully written work that proved itself by the response . "
