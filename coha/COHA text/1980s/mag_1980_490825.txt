THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE 'VE just received a from a young man we who lives in California : An ashram has occurred next to the family ranch in California . Mansions and oId resorts have a way of finding religion these days , and our neighbor , the old White Sulphur Springs resort ( it was the first spa in California to install a stock ticker ) , is an example . My parents called on their new neighbors . My father invariably wears a hat stuck with a collection of the feathers he comes across in rural life , a neckerchief under the collar of a flannel shirt , and ankle-high moccasins he 's been getting by mail order from some Indians in New Mexico since 1932 . He calls carrying the cane , staff , or club he habitually goes about with " wearing a stick . " Mother dresses on such occasions as she would for a minor garden party . At the resort , they found , in my father 's words , " young Americans walking around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , a young woman , and asked her name . " Vidya Kumari , " she answered . " No , no . I mean your real name , " my father said . " That is my real name , " the young woman replied . " No , no . I mean a name , like Alice or Mary Lou , " my father insisted . The young woman compromised by telling him that her name used to be Nancy , and she led my parents to a Winnebago that contained the spiritual leader of the establishment . " The man was just about naked and all twisted up , " my father reported . " He looked like a little brown pretzel . They asked me not to smoke in the headman 's trailer , and we were further instructed to leave our shoes outside . I told them where to send away for these very comfortable deerskin moccasins I was wearing . " After their audience with the swami , my parents were attended by Vidya Kumari as they strolled through what had been , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite a place in the days when Queen Victoria sat on the British throne , " my father told their guide . " In those days , women wore dresses and petticoats . " He glanced pointedly at the " sheet " she wore . " I love your aura , " the young woman said to my mother . " It 's Joy , " my mother replied . " I know , " said Vidya Kumari " Jean Patou , " my mother elucidated . ? ? Preview RANDOM observations inspired by a recent visit to Lake Placid , where preparations arc feverishly under way for the Olympic Winter Games next month : Adirondacks aswarm with officials from the United States Olympic Committee , hereinafter designated USOC , and the Lake Placid Olympic Organizing Committee , hereinetc . LPOOC , plus assorted athletes , coaches , trainers , oglers . Temperature : 46 ? Fahrenheit .

All hands too busy for superstition . Petr L. Spurney , general manager of LPOOC , tells visitors , " Our slogan is ' Welcome , world , we 're ready , ' and we will be . " He speaks of " duck philosophy , " defining it as " smooth and unruffled on the surface and paddling Eke hell underneath , " and declares , " This is going to be an Olympics with a soul . " Robert J. Kane , president of USOC , declares , " I do n't think we 've ever been better prepared . We must be at full efficiency to represent this great country the way it should be represented .

" Now Dr. Tenley Albright , general surgeon in Boston , also secretary of USOC , she says she still skates , but mostly for fun , with her kids . Adds , " The only trouble is that the best time to skate is usually when I 'm in the operating room . " Sheila Young , who won three medals in speed skating at last Tinter Games  --  Innsbruck , 1976 and is now Sheila Young Ochowicz and public-relations representative for LPOOC , says main problem in Austria was that beds were too hard , with the result that athletes slept on top of their blankets , with further result that they had no blankets to cover themselves with .

Fregoe , says t POOC has no qualms about housing competitors in a future prison Says , " After all , ever since the 1972 Games in Munich the International Olympic Committee has required that the ath- ? letes he fenced in . Before we began building this facility , two years ago , I went to look at a prison in Memphis . I thought it was nice . I wo n't get into a discussion of whether such a place should look nice . " Olympic Village courtyard , surrounded by double fence , a sea of mud , but Mayor Fregoe anticipates carpet of snow by Games time , decoratively enhanced by snow sculptures of male and female athletes in various sports . " Will there be any blacks ? " asks sassy bystander . Mayor frowns .

" Colonel Miller proud that although LPOOC has received sixty-nine million dollars from federal government toward hundredand-forty-million total tab for Games , JANUARY 7 , 1 9 8 0 USOC has n't had a penny from that source . " We 're the only nation on earth that provides its athletes with no government help , " he says . " America does n't send our teams to the Olympic Games . Americans do . " Bobsled run is same one  --  though much reconditioned  --  built for 1932 Lake Placid Olympics , which drew three hundred and seven athletes from seventeen countries . This time , fourteen hundred are expected from thirty-six . On February 13 , 1978 , Iran was sent an invitation to participate , but it has n't replied yet . Eight hundred New York State Policemen have been assigned to the Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York State Police has ever been involved in , " a police lieutenant says . The first bank robbery in the history of the neighboring village of Saranac Lake occurred early this month while the F.B.I . was conferring on Olympic security there with local law enforcers . The perpetrator was speedily apprehended . Art Devlin , Lake Placid native , Olympic ski jumper , proprietor of Art Devlin 's Olympic Motor Inn , on Main Street in Lake Placid , is unfazed by environmentalists ' grumbling about two ski-jump towers that probe the sky at the upper end of John Brown Road . ( The abolitionist is , along with Victor Herbert , Kate Smith , and Art Devlin , one of Lake Placid 's home-town heroes . ) The ninety-metre-jump tower , two hundred fifty-seven feet six inches high , is the tallest structure between Albany and Montreal , and although Devlin has n't jumped competitively since 1960 , he says that as soon as the snow starts to fall he plans to take a few hops off it .

Those sixteen and over will be permitted to work for LPOOC . The younger ones will have special classes elsewhere , all Olympics-oriented ; e.g. , their mathematical studies will have to do with things like speed skaters ' lap times . One irate schoolteacher asserts in a letter to the Lake Placid News that " the residents of this town have been turned into a group of puppets . " Dianne Holum , gold-medal speed skater at Sapporo , Japan , in 1972 , now coach , says , " The skaters are working hard . The team is ready .

" Audition MIKE POMPEO invited thirty cou- ples who will soon be married to the banquet room of the Ramada Inn in Rochelle Park , New Jersey , the other evening to audition three musical groups that specialize in playing at weddings and are booked for those occasions through a company run by Mike Pompeo . Mr. Pompeo was greeting the arriving couples at the entrance to the banquet room when we met him and his wife , Betty , who was seated with two other young women at a table in front of the doorway . Inside the room , a group began to play a song called " On and On " as the couples settled in . " This is the first one of these we 're running ourselves , " said Mr. Pompeo , who is in his late twenties and has a round haircut , a trim brown beard , and glasses . He wore a splendid tuxedo , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , together with an eager manner of speaking , gave him the air of the maitre d'h  --  tel of a new suburban steak house . " We 've played at bridal fashion shows in places like this , " he continued , " hut tonight , rather than show them gowns or tuxes or jewelry , we 're showing them the bands . We 've got a three-piece , a four-piece , and a five-piece hand here . You know , every time I played one of those bridal shows I heard ' Hey , Mike , we 're looking for a band . When can we see you ? ' So I got this idea . I subscribed to a listing service that lists all the engaged couples in Essex County ; I wrote down the names of all the couples who announced their engagements in the local papers ; got the names of people who had seen us at the bridal shows ; and I ar ranged to have them all come here tonight . We chose the Ramada Inn because it 's the perfect location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossroads of Bergen and Essex Counties . " Several young men who were wearing tuxedos and carrying electric guitars passed by the doorway , and Mike Pompeo excused himself to consult with them . We noticed that Betty Pompeo and her two companions at the table were preparing stacks of flyers and contractual forms . " I think we 'll sign up a few couples tonight , " she said . " But how many depends on how well Mike sells them . " She introduced us to her two friends , who turned out to he the wife and the sister of the bass player of the four-piece group . " You know , Mike plays lead guitar in this four-piece group himself , " Betty Pornpeo informed us . " He likes to wear all the hats . " The banquet room of the Ramada Inn contained about twenty rows of high-hacked chairs , with an aisle in the middle , and a row of tables on one side of the room and another in the rear . The tables on the side held a large coffee urn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptions , and a bar , which seemed to be doing brisk business ; and on the tables in the back was a model display of the Ramada Inn 's special wedding dinner , which included bottles of champagne nestling in empty ice buckets and plates of hardened petit fours under fancy shrink-wrap . The room 's color scheme was wheatand-brown , and the lighting was provided by overhead fluorescent panels , spotlights that gave off a pinkish glow , and three huge brass chandeliers with teardrop bulbs sprouting in every direction . In the front of the room , a trio of musicians , led by a young blond man in a three-piece tuxedo outlined with shimmering bugle beads , played abbreviated versions of popular songs like " After the Lovin ' , " " Che la Luna , " and " Boogie Oogie Oogie . " Looking around the room , we noticed that some couples were seated way off by themselves ; some couples were only just within earshot of other couples ; some couples were bunched up with single friends or with another couple ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future bride 's mother . Most of the couples were dressed casually , in jeans and sweaters or short outer jackets . All the future brides wore their engagement rings prominently . Some of the couples held hands while they listened to the music . Some of the women bounced to the music while their future husbands sat back with their arms folded on their chests . Some couples leaned hack impassively through the trio 's entire repertoire , and some listened to the mothers as the band played . When the first group finished , having wound up with a lively " Satin Doll , " Mike Pamper ) stepped up to a microphone at the center of the performance area . " Hey , that 's a lot of music for three men , huh ? " he said . " Rob 's group can also work as a four-piece outfit , if we add one more man  --  probably a guitar player . Now , you know , when you hire one of our groups , we do all the announcing , the miking , and the fronting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as your guests . So , as I said before , we 'd like you to sit back , relax , and enjoy it . The four-piece group will he right out . You 've been a very kind audience . " The fluorescent lights were switched off , and the room 's wheat-and-brown took on a mellow glow as Mike Pornpeo 's group slipped into its version of " More , " which featured an echoey electronic synthesizer . We caught up with the first group of musicians out in the hall , where they were pacing nervously with dnnks in their hands . We asked the young blond fellow in the three-piece tuxedo , who introduced himself as Rob Dickson , whether his group had a name . " We should get one thing straight , " said Dickson . " We have n't really been a group very long . The three of us are musicians , and we know each other , but we 've only played together a few hours all told . We 've all done the fashion shows  --  well , one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few rock groups around Jersey . " He opened his jacket , revealing that his vest was completely beaded . " I 've just started getting into this line of weekend gigs , " he said . " The thing is , you 've got to know a lot of songs , but once you get the basic repertoire down , then the musicians are interchangeable . We do n't consider ourselves to be a wedding band , if you know what I mean . We come out of a rock background . But I 'll tell you , these wedding gigs are the hardest to play . You have no idea what your audience 'll he like until the moment they show up And to make everyone happy you have to know everything . You ca n't turn down requests at a wedding . One time , some old guy comes up to me and asks for ' Alabama Jubilee . ' I never heard of the damn song . But I said I did , and we just jammed . No one complain ed . " We stepped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mike Pompeo 's hand broke for an announcement . " Right about now , we 'd like to show you that we also do ethnic music , " said Mike Pompeo . " So here 's a little something by the Polish Prince . " The band launched into Bobby Vinton 's " My Melody of Love , " then played " Femmina " and " Nava Nagila . " It also played a " medley for older people , " which included " Bye Bye Blackbird " and " When the Saints Go Marching In , " and a medley of " the prettiest songs of 1979 . " At the conclusion of the set , Mike Pornpco announced that the five-piece group , including two horn players , would be on next . " And remember , " he said , " if you hook tonight you get five hours of music for the price of four , because we 'll provide one musician who 'll play through the cocktail hour . " Many of the couples had decided to leave by the time the five-piece group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage and began an impassioned version of " Femmina . " We followed the guests out into the hall , where a number of them were lined up at the table making arrangements with Betty Pompeo . We watched as a couple and an accompanying mother signed up Mike Pompeo 's band for an April wedding date . We saw from the names on the contract that we were meeting Henry Bailey and June Wil son , and we were introduced to June 's mother , Doris Wilson , who told us that her daughter had invited her along to offer a second opinion . " We think this is a great idea , " said June Wilson . " We 'd already agreed to have the wedding here at the Ramada Inn , so it really worked out fine . We did n't have to sneak into other people 's weddings and we did n't have to drag around to all the other places to hear a band . Now we know what it 'll sound like in our own place . " Looking Back ON the very brink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on around us , we decided to pay a call on our Great-Uncle Augustus , who is eighty-five and tends to Look Back . Great-Uncle Augustus is distinguished in appearance  --  a handsome old sport with splendid posture  --  and he had just returned from a daily session of shooting pool in the village near his home , in Connecticut ; he was wearing a heavy white sweater , Second ' orld I.Var khaki trousers , and black basketball sneakers . He greeted us and sat us down in an armchair in the living room ; outside the window there were hare trees and , beyond , the Connecticut River stretching away to Long Island Sound . We started out on politics , referring to Carter and Kennedy . " I once rode in an elevator with William Howard Taft , " said Great-Uncle Augustus . " That left no room for anybody else . My father said that Taft was the ' worst-licked , least sore , and best-liked man who ever ran for President . ' My father was not given to aphorisms ; that 's the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine was on his staff in France , and he said that every time Pershing reviewed a regiment he lost three thousand four hundred and twenty-six votes . " We mentioned the gas crisis . " I was a small boy when the automobile arrived on the scene , " said G.-U . A. " I remember sitting on a stone wall at the corner of our property in Croton-on-Hudson and watching a road race . All the roads were dirt in those days , of course . It was a White Steamer versus a Stanley Steamer , and as they got halfway up the steep hill in front of me they both collapsed . The Briarcliff Race was a major event , and I used to watch that with great excitement . Besides the driver , each car had a mechanic , who 11111111 ? **28;6220;TOOLONG ? " Liverwurst is down an eighth , egg-salad is up two and a half , and peanut-butter-and-jelly remains unchanged . " clung to the back , leaning out as far as possible on the turns , so that the car would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tires constantly . One of the mechanics for Isotta-Fraschini was the chauffeur for a neighbor of ours the rest of the time ; John Marquis was the chauffeur 's name , and he cherished a set of silver nutpicks in a purple satin case which he had won for a pole vault . I remember seeing a Crane-Simplex entry in the Briarcliff Race land upside down in the Saw Mill River . It was recovered and dried off , and went on to win . Trains were the way to go in those days . The New York Central was a thing of beauty and desire that ran with perfect regularity . My grandfather , who had been a steamboat captain on the Hudson and then became , I 'm sorry to say , a banker , used to leave the Lincoln Bank in the afternoon , go down to the Fulton Fish Market , purchase a fish , and bring it home to Croton on the train . The fish was always on time , and in good condition for dinner . My father , courting my mother , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could leave his job in Albany  --  he was running a streetcar  --  at five , catch a train down to Croton , visit my mother during the evening , get a late train hack to Albany , and he on his streetcar promptly at 8 A.M. " He gazed out the window . " My mother had a passion for masonry . She designed and built a number of stone houses on her Father 's land , using topflight Italian masons who had come over to build the New Croton Dam . Once the dam was finished , they did n't have much to do . At lunchtime , she would carry a Victrola to the construction site and play Puccini and Verdi records , and the masons would sing . " ? Vould there be global conflict in the nineteen-eighties , we asked . " I was in a reconnaissance balloon in Texas when our troops went into Mexico to capture Pancho Villa , and in the cavalry and artillery in the First World War , and in the Army Air Forces in the Second World War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the First NVorIcl War , I moved to New York City and lived in a brownstone at 45 West Forty-ninth Street . It later became part of Rockefeller Center . The Rockefellers , incidentally , forced the Briarcliff Race to change its course , because they did n't want those noisy cars going through Pocantico Hills . There were about eight young men living on the first floor of the brownstone , and upstairs lived Mrs. McGuire , an English lady , with two daughters . One of them was very homely , and the other was Dolores , the most beautiful showgirl who ever lived . She was in the center of the line at the ' Ziegfeld Follies . ' Mrs. McGuire would invite us all upstairs to tea on Tuesdays . All eight of us were in love with Dolores . " Great-Uncle Augustus seemed lost in thought . " But she married a Texan , " he said presently , " and went to live in Paris . She had a house on the Ile Saint-Louis , with a magnificent view of Notre Dame . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
