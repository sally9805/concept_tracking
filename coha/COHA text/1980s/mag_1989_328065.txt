TV 's sin-and-sex parade marches on . Highlights on last week 's tabloid shows ranged from a story on " the undercover Romeo , " a drug informant who allegedly lured innocent women into dope deals , to an ogling visit to a topless coffee shop . Ca n't something be done , critics and concerned viewers cry , about such tasteless shows ? Now a campaign against TV sleaze appears to be gathering steam . But the cure may be worse than the disease . <P> The issue leaped to the fore two weeks ago , when a Michigan housewife , Terry Rakolta , became an instant celebrity for her successful letter-writing campaign against the bawdy Fox network sitcom Married . . . With Children . Responding to her complaints , several major advertisers , including Kimberly- Clark and Procter &; Gamble , said they would no longer run ads on the show because of its " offensive " content . The sitcom  --  Fox 's highest-rated show  --  is in no mortal danger : ad time is sold out for the season , Fox officials say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheduled commercial because of Rakolta 's complaints . <P> Her one-woman ground swell , however , has exposed a growing skittishness among advertisers . While many are " tonnage " buyers , willing to place their commercials anywhere , others carefully select shows in order to avoid being associated with questionable material . With the proliferation of so-called trash TV , the number of troublesome programs has multiplied . Among them are such tabloid shows as A Current Affair , Inside Edition and The Reporters ; sensational talk programs like The Morton Downey Jr . Show and Geraldo ; and occasional over-the-edge network offerings like Geraldo Rivera 's NBC special last fall on Satanism . <P> Most of these shows do quite well in the ratings . But as the Married . . . With Children flap demonstrated , ratings are not everything , even along Madison Avenue . " What Married . . . With Children has done is make everybody take a sharper look at standards , " says Betsy Frank , a senior vice president of Saatchi &; Saatchi advertising . NBC , under attack for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of program standards and policy , eliminated last year for budgetary reasons . The network is also setting up meetings with ad executives to explain its policy for screening out offensive material . <P> In a TV marketplace that seems to be operating with fewer and fewer restraints , it is ironic that advertisers have become the new guardians of quality . The trouble is : Whose definition of quality ? Campaigns against " tasteless " shows usually come from the most conservative elements of American society . One pressure group , Christian Leaders for Responsible TV , is making plans to monitor TV programming this spring and to organize a boycott of major sponsors of " anti-Christian " shows . Rakolta 's objections to Married . . . With Children managed to miss totally the show 's satirical point . This sitcom family  --  male-chauvinist husband , unliberated wife , sluttish teenage daughter  --  is being lampooned by exaggeration . The same sort of complaints  --  just as misguided  --  were launched against the bigoted Archie Bunker in the early 1970s.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
