THE ELEPHANT MAN Directed by David Lynch Screenplay by Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren , and David Lynch <P> The most striking feature about him was his enormous head . From the brow there projected a huge bony mass like a loaf , while from the back of the head hung a bag of spongy fungus-looking skin , the surface of which was comparable to brown cauliflower . . . From the upper jaw there projected another mass of bone . It protruded from the mouth like a pink stump , turning the upper lip inside out and making of the mouth a mere slobbering aperture . . . The back was horrible , because from it hung , as far down as the middle of the thigh , huge , sack-like masses of flesh covered by the same loathsome cauliflower skin .

John Hurt , last seen giving caesarean birth to a malignant Alien , plays Merrick in a grotesquely authentic foam latex mask that leaves the actor almost unrecognizable . Yet he captures Merrick 's humanity through his eyes and his gestures , the way he reflexively straightens his tie when a nurse enters the room , the way his voice rises and falls in the fruity arpeggios of a Covent Garden tenor . Treves described Merrick as having " the brain of a man , the fancies of a youth and the imagination of a child , " and Hurt inhabits this sweet-souled ogre with the Elphant Man 's own grace and spirit . Perhaps Hurt 's delicacy was contagious : Anthony Hopkins , who has been known to dine on the scenery , gives a scrupulously restrained peformance as Treves .
