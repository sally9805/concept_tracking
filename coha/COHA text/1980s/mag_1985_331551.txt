The Soviet KGB is one of the most ruthless organizations on earth . Its functions are comparable to most of those belonging to the CIA , the FBI , the Secret Service and parts of the departments of Justice and Defense . To control a population it can no longer inspire , the Kremlin relies upon security police and informers . To obtain military secrets and advanced technology it can not develop efficiently at home , it employs espionage abroad . To subvert governments it can not persuade through normal interaction , the U.S.S.R. has fielded a secret army  --  of mercenaries as well as Soviets  --  to advance its international goals . <P> The global scale of KGB operations is larger than the intelligence activities of all the West combined . Besides more than 100,000 professionals , the KGB has a specially trained elite army of roughly 500,000 equipped with the latest weapons , tanks and artillery . They guard frontiers , the Kremlin and other major government installations . They include highly developed sabotage units and special-purpose forces . The latter were used extensively to crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperors , the men of the KGB exercise preventive supervision of the population and its loyalty . The KGB could not halt the alienation that grew as Khrushchev 's and Brezhnev 's expansive promises of well-being went unfulfilled . But the " GehBeh , " as the organization is nicknamed after its initials , can report what is happening to the leadership . The more disquieting evidence it produces , the more the KGB justifies its insistence on larger budgets and greater manpower . Since there really has been trouble  --  a food riot in Novocherkassk in 1962 , for instance  --  the leadership has acquiesced to the KGB 's demands . <P> Even the top men are constrained by the KGB . The Vertushka , the Kremlin telephone system , is installed , maintained and monitored by the secret police . Their agents serve as bodyguards , chauffeurs , cooks , valets and maids to Politburo members , guaranteeing not only security but surveillance . <P> Most sinister of the secret-police operatives are the shadowy assassins and terrorists whose specialty is mokrie dela ( wet affairs ) , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had naively assumed that political murders , kidnapings , sabotage targeted against Western civilian sectors had been pretty much abandoned by the U.S.S.R. by the mid-1950s , after the Stalin-Beria era . I was wrong . I met some of those operatives when I first lived in New York as a junior diplomat . <P> One agent , expelled from the U.S. in 1969 after two tours at the mission , liked to brag suggestively about little matters he had " cleared up . " One Sunday at lunch on the New Jersey Palisades in late 1965 , he could not stop talking about New York 's great blackout . " All those shining towers , " he said , gesturing at the Manhattan skyline , " they look so strong , so tall , but they 're just a house of cards . A few explosions in the right places and do svidaniya ( goodbye ) . We 're only beginning to realize how vulnerable this country really is . " No one commented . Even KGB personnel feared him .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
