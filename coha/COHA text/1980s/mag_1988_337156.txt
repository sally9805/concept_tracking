If there is a single word to characterize 1987 in the gourmet marketplace , it would be silliness . Mustard came in for a drubbing with a variety of novelty flavorings , and deodorized garlic is in the wings . Dieters still want to eat their cake without having it on their waistlines , and speaking of cake , Texas is exporting cheesecake to New York , the home of the original . Frightened by a shaky market ( and perhaps having exhausted their ingenuity ) , restaurateurs began to think small , and the future of the epic theme eatery is much in doubt . A stronger trend in dining out is the renaissance of Italian cuisine in stylish settings  --  beating the fancy French at their own game . <P> CHUTZPAH AWARD The hands-down winner is Lyn Dunsavage , who in July brought her New York , Texas Cheesecake to , of all places , New York , New York , hoping to find retail outlets . Baked back home , this lemon- and vanilla-flavored cake is based on a recipe Dunsavage 's mother developed after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Apple . The verdict from this aficionado of the genre : not bad , but a bit too sweet and creamy to fool connoisseurs . <P> CUISINE OF THE YEAR Italian food is the no-contest fashion favorite , especially in new casually chic cafe-trattorias . Enticing antipasti , new thin pizzas , and the pasta , fish and vegetable dishes suit modern ideas of good nutrition , as well as the desires of grazers . The Milan import Bice took Manhattan by storm last summer , and hopes to do the same in Beverly Hills in ' 88 , when it opens another branch . Both Avanzare and Spiaggia are seeing heavy action in Chicago , and Restaurant Associates is planning to expand its Vivande format from Baltimore to Washington , D.C. , and Livingston , N.J. <P> MOST OVERWORKED CONDIMENT Cutting the mustard with just about everything from apricots to tarragon , with champagne , honey , horseradish , garlic , pickles and jalapenos in between , seemed the favorite ploy of sales-minded merchandisers , invariably with cloying results . Jars of mustard line store shelves as flavored oils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONFUSING FISH DISH Dubbed Skin Caviar by its maker , La Prairie , and packed with a silvery spoon , this chemical anti-aging goop looks good enough to eat . It raises the question of whether these tiny pearly grains are meant to be spread on toast or on one 's face . The latter is the answer , of course , but if stored in the refrigerator , Skin Caviar , at $65 for two ounces , could lead to some surprise snacking . <P> NEATEST TURNAROUND Can a new management take over a revered but fading institution , refurbish it and attract a young and trendy clientele without alienating its valuable old regulars ? In the case of Manhattan 's fabled ' 21 ' Club , the answer promises to be yes . Biggest controversy is the house hamburger , now with herb butter at the center . Newcomers love it , but old- timers say , " Hold everything . " <P> ; NOSTALGIA ON THE HIGHEST The ' 30s in all of their sleek and glitzy Art Deco splendor have been re-created in the restoration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perched atop the 70-story RCA Building , this classic setting offers incomparable views of the fabulous skyline , plus revolving dance floor , deep purple walls and glints of crystal and brass . Now if only they can cook . . .
