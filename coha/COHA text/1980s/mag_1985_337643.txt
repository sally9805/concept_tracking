After serving six years for kidnaping and rape , Gary Dotson , 28 , seemed suddenly to be a technicality away from freedom when Cathleen Crowell Webb , his alleged victim , came forward to confess that she had made up the story . But last week , after listening to Webb recant her testimony in a Cook County court , Judge Richard Samuels upheld the original jury verdict and ordered Dotson returned to prison . As a stunned Dotson was taken away once more , Webb sobbed , " He 's wrong ! Gary Dotson is innocent ! " <P> Webb 's original testimony was critical to Dotson 's conviction . The other evidence offered in the 1979 trial was inconclusive . The doctor who examined her on the night of the alleged attack could not say without a doubt that she had been raped , though she certainly had suffered bruises and lacerations . A hair found on her body and semen on her underwear might have belonged to Dotson , but the results of those tests were also uncertain . <P> Webb , now 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed she was raped because she feared she was pregnant after having sex with her boyfriend ( she was not ) . To make her tale believable , she said , she had torn her clothes and inflicted the cuts and bruises . When her description of her assailant led to Dotson 's arrest , she said , she stuck to the lie . <P> Judge Samuels , who presided at the original trial in 1979 , found Webb 's new testimony less credible than that of a seemingly terrified 16-year-old girl who had told a brutal tale of kidnaping , assault and rape . Also troubling were parts of Dotson 's testimony last week . While a friend testified that he had spent the evening of the attack with Dotson and two others , Dotson said that he had spent much of the time sleeping in the back seat of a car while his companions were stopping at parties . He might have been separated from the group , he said , for as much as two hours . Altogether , said Samuels , the witnesses who appeared on Dotson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cathy 's recantation . " <P> Judge Samuels ' ruling appeared to follow Illinois legal precedent in cases where witnesses recant their testimony after a conviction . Such retractions are generally viewed with suspicion , and the convictions stand . Said Thomas Royce , a prominent Chicago criminal-defense lawyer : " Recanting testimony is not ( in itself ) sufficient to impeach a jury 's verdict . It basically falls on deaf ears . " <P> If Dotson 's conviction is not overturned , he must wait until 1988 before he is eligible for parole . Warren Lupel , his attorney , said that he will appeal the decision and ask Governor James Thompson to grant clemency . In the wake of the ruling , scores of sympathizers have called or wired the Governor 's office . Said Lupel : " The battle is n't lost yet . "
