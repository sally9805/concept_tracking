" The people of Princeton are going to have a lot of work to do , " remarked University of Michigan Regent Thomas Roach last week . His comment came on hearing that Michigan President Harold Shapiro , renowned for his 15-hour workdays , would succeed William Bowen next January as Princeton 's 18th president . An economist by training ( Ph.D. , Princeton ' 64 ) and a genial if demanding manager by reputation , Shapiro , 51 , lifted Michigan in seven years from financial crisis to a prosperous institution loaded with new research facilities . Although guarded about an agenda for his new job , Shapiro , who will be Princeton 's first Jewish president as well as the first president in 120 years to be chosen from outside its faculty , cites minority enrollment and a richer core curriculum as general concerns . His first task , says Shapiro , is " to listen to students , faculty and alumni . " He adds , " I hope I will get wiser as I begin to develop ideas with the faculty and others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
