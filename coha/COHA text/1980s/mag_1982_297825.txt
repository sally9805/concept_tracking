Engineers and designers at the headquarters of Apple Computer Inc. in Cupertino , Calif. , are accustomed to seeing a slender figure saunter past their offices wearing frayed jeans , suede boots and a cowboy shirt . The boyish-looking fellow with the stringy mustache is Steven Jobs , Apple 's chairman of the board . At 26 , Jobs heads a company that six years ago was located in a bedroom and garage of his parents ' house , but this year it is expected to have sales of $600 million . Like so many new entrepreneurs , Jobs is a child of California 's Silicon Valley . As a student at Homestead High School in Los Altos during the early 1970s , he was fascinated by technology . <P> After school , he attended lectures at Hewlett-Packard , the big electronics firm . One day he boldly called William Hewlett , the president , to ask for some equipment for a machine he was building . Impressed , Hewlett gave it to him and helped arrange summer employment . One of Jobs ' best friends at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Steves built and sold so-called blue boxes , which were illegal electronic attachments for telephones that allowed users to make long-distance calls for free . On one occasion , Wozniak called the Vatican and , pretending to be Henry Kissinger , asked for Pope Paul VI . As Wozniak tells the story , the Pontiff was summoned , and Vatican officials caught on to the ruse only after a bishop came on the line to act as translator . In 1972 , Jobs entered Oregon 's Reed College , but he left two years later to ease his family 's financial hardships . He then took a job designing video games at Atari . Wozniak , meanwhile , had dropped out of Berkeley to become a designer at Hewlett-Packard . After hours , Wozniak worked hard building a small , easy-to-use computer . In 1976 he succeeded . The pint-size machine was smaller than a portable typewriter , but it could do the feats of much larger computers . <P> To Wozniak , the new machine was simply a gadget to show his fellow computer buffs . Jobs , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help families do their personal finance or small businesses control inventories , and he urged that they form a company to market the computer . The two raised $1,300 to open a makeshift production line by selling Jobs ' Volkswagen Micro Bus and Wozniak 's Hewlett-Packard scientific calculator . Jobs , recalling a pleasant summer that he spent working in the orchards of Oregon , christened the new computer Apple . <P> To build the company , Jobs adroitly tapped the network of support services that has made Silicon Valley such a fertile place for fledgling businesses . Says he : " We did n't know what the hell we were doing , but we were very careful observers and learned quickly . " Jobs pestered Regis McKenna , the area 's premier public relations specialist , to take on Apple as a client . After refusing twice , McKenna finally agreed . For advice on how to raise money , Jobs consulted both McKenna and Nolan Bushnell , his former boss at Atari . They suggested that he call Don Valentine , an investor who frequently puts money into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new computer , he found Jobs wearing cutoff jeans and sandals while sporting shoulder-length hair and a Ho Chi Minh beard . Valentine later asked McKenna : " Why did you send me this renegade from the human race ? "
