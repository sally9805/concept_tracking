The agency said that if the researcher , Dr. Gary Strobel , a 48-year-old plant pathologist at Montana State University in Bozeman , planned any outdoor experiments with living , gene-altered microbes over the next 12 months , he would need a co-sponsor inside or outside the university. // It also said he must follow Federal rules governing all university researchers who seek outdoors tests of altered microbes , and must apply for permission to a standing committee of scientists at his university and submit an application to the Government. // Dr. Strobel ' s injection of 14 trees with a living , altered microbe in June did not warrant a more vigorous response , said Dr. John A. Moore , Assistant Administrator of the E.P.A. for pesticides and toxic substances . Under laws covering genetically engineered microbes , first offenders are not fined. // // Reaction Mixed Among Scientists // Some scientists said the Government ' s mild sanctions served as a message to the nation ' s genetic engineers that violating the rules for tests outside the laboratory would be tolerated. // Other scientists said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new national dialogue aimed at making the regulations far less inclusive. // The sanctions against Dr. Strobel were the first imposed on a university researcher by the environmental agency . The Government ' s regulatory review of Dr. Strobel ' s experiment now shifts to the National Institutes of Health , which announced today that it was forming a committee to study the incident. // Dr. Strobel ' s experiment is regarded as an important test of the adequacy and necessity of sweeping Federal rules covering genetic engineering research and the products of the growing field of biotechnology . Meanwhile , a panel of six scientists is to meet Friday at Montana State to consider a recommendation by the university ' s biosafety committee : To terminate the experiment by killing the 14 young American elms into which Dr. Strobel injected the microbes . <> <> E.P.A. Looks for Perspective // " I don ' t condone what he did , " said Assistant Administrator Moore . " On the other hand , let ' s keep this in perspective . Hopefully this decision will not be perceived as telling everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And hopefully it won ' t be perceived as precedence for five more regulations. " // Dr. Strobel , who said weeks ago that he regarded Federal regulations as a barrier to his research and injected the trees without permission as an act of " civil disobedience , " said today that he was relieved. // " I used some strong language because I felt what I was doing was correct , " he said . " I ' m not a maverick lawbreaker . I believe in honoring and sustaining the law . But with the regulations as confusing as they are , it ' s hard to know whose law you ' re supposed to obey and under what conditions you are supposed to operate. " // Dr. Strobel , an expert on Dutch elm disease , developed a novel strain of a common bacterium , Pseudomonas syringae , that produced greater amounts of an antibiotic . In laboratory tests , the organism indicated an ability to kill the fungus that causes the Dutch elm disease . The organism was engineered by combining Pseudomonas with another common bacterium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop a way to wipe out Dutch elm disease. // He said today that his organism was not a product of recombinant DNA , in which genes are combined in organisms through direct insertion , and therefore it was not subject to Federal law . Some scientists agreed . But the E.P.A. said today that the organism was a recombinant organism and he was required to seek permission before testing it outdoors . Some scientists say adding or subtracting genes from a microbe can change its behavior and though most changes would not be environmentally harmful , others would . They said the year-old Federal requirements for review by the E.P.A. and other agencies of outdoor tests were reasonable. // For years , the Department of Agriculture has required farm researchers to apply for permission before releasing into the environment new organisms like wasps to replace insecticides , or replace new crop plantings . The E.P.A. ' s treatment of Dr. Strobel , the scientists said , could lead to testing of organisms without permission. // " What they did is a big mistake , " said Dr. David Pimentel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any individual release , just like any introduction of an organism from outside the United States , has a small ability to cause problems . However , rare events do take place , which is why we have such a large pest problem in the United States . " <> <> Rules Termed Too Sweeping // Other scientists say the Federal rules are too sweeping . The National Academy of Sciences said earlier this month that genetically altered organisms do not present " unique " hazards , and that organisms produced through genetic engineering should be evaluated on their ability to produce damage , not simply because they have been produced with a new technology. // Today , any gene-altered organism to be released into the environment is supposed to be subjected to intense review . If Dr. Strobel was to apply to the Government to have his microbe tested outdoors , he would have to obtain the approval of the university , the E.P.A. and the Department of Agriculture. // Dr. Nina Federoff , a plant molecular biologist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Baltimore and a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy of Sciences , said : " There isn ' t a reason to fear these organisms as much as the current regulations imply that we should fear them . But we need to change the regulations . We don ' t need to disobey them. " // Top Federal scientists said today that they were willing to consider altering the rules . " We put a stake in the ground and said as we learn more , we will be able to relax some of the restrictions , " said Dr. David T. Kingsbury , Assistant Director at the National Science Foundation , and chief architect of the Reagan Administration ' s program to regulate biotechnology. // " Two things are happening . One is that we ' re not relaxing the restrictions at the speed some had hoped . And we are just now developing the broad consensus among the different scientific disciplines involved in this field.
