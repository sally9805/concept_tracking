As coordinator of the new Boston Neighborhood Preservation Program ( BNPP ) , Ms. Canavan makes sure that the neighbors are heard. // Now that many ' ' capital H ' ' historic landmarks have been saved , she says , it is ' ' time to move out into the neighborhoods ' ' with preservation. // The BNPP , which began this spring , works closely with neighborhood groups like the one in the Highland Park section of West Roxbury that stopped the bulldozer in its caterpillar track . Its goal is to save buildings that , although they probably did not shelter plotters of the American Revolution , are very important to a neighborhood ' s character . All of BNPP ' s targeted buildings are at least 40 years old and of historical or social value to their neighborhoods . And most have fallen victim to arsonists and vandals. // Jointly proposed by the Boston Landmarks Commission , the National Trust for Historic Preservation , and the Boston Preservation Alliance , BNPP is funded through the Permanent Charity Fund of Boston . The fund is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable giving , ' ' says Ms. Canavan , who as a consultant to the Landmarks Commission maintains her office in City Hall. // Concentrating in low- and moderate-income areas , the BNPP finds new uses for old buildings that will spur community development while avoiding displacement of neighborhood residents . Working with developers , the BNPP presents plans to the city which ensure that ' ' the city ' s interest complements that of the community , ' ' Ms. Canavan says. // Since the passage of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981 , corporate interest in preservation has grown significantly . Since October the Massachusetts Historical Commission has received as many applications for historic designation as in the previous 12 months . Under the federal act , developers can take a 25 percent tax credit for investments in historic structures . Then , upon sale of their historic buildings , their capital gains tax is reduced. // But some observers are concerned that the edge these tax incentives gave to preservation efforts may now be lost , as the Reagan administration seeks to eliminate the Historic Preservation Fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Among Boston projects that are directly threatened by such a cutoff is the planned development of Commonwealth Pier as a national center for marketing high technology. // In joining the fight to restore federal funding of preservation , Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas ( D ) says preservation brings urban revitalization , economic growth , and energy conservation . Pat Weslowski , executive director of the Massachusetts Historical Commission , agrees , citing the renovation of the Charlestown Navy Yard as a ' ' good example of lots of different groups working together ' ' in a preservation effort that has generated jobs and private investment. // ' ' Preservation is not a frill , not a luxury , ' ' Mrs. Weslowski says . ' ' It is fundamental to the business economy and tourism ' ' as well as to the quality of life . As in Baltimore and San Antonio , Mrs. Weslowski says , Boston hopes aggressive restoration efforts will stimulate growth. // With that goal , Ms. Canavan says the BNPP strives to have a ' ' catalytic effect on a neighborhood . ' ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // * A vacant building formerly used as Girls Trade High School and little city hall in the Fenway. // * A study of owner-occupied lodging houses in the South End. // * Five turn-of-the-century , triple-decker houses in Highland Park. // * Two adjacent mid-19th century mansions now used by two nonprofit organizations in East Boston. // * Four buildings in Codman Square , including a church , a commercial building , a former library , and a former school. // * The oldest factory standing in Hyde Park. // BNPP is working to get the Codman Square and Hyde Park projects on the National Register of Historic Places. // The five Highland Park houses are among 40 abandoned buildings in that completely residential West Roxbury neighborhood . The City of Boston owns 13 of them , and the Highland Park Neighborhood Association is suing the city for failure to keep them securely boarded up. // But Boston said it couldn ' t maintain the houses because they were repeatedly vandalized . BNPP and the neighborhood group are working on a reuse plan for the houses which would put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noting a marble staircase or carved wood mantelpiece that graces these homes , Ms. Canavan says , ' ' People do appreciate beauty , and most of the construction and workmanship in these houses is beautiful and couldn ' t be duplicated today. ' ' // At a rally to kick off lobbying against President Reagan ' s proposed elimination of federal preservation funding , Nancy Coolidge of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities said , ' ' The old ladies in the tennis shoes did what they could . ' ' Now , she says , preservationists must start to work with developers and politicians. // According to Mrs. Weslowski , Boston has a high density of sites worth saving , owing to their historical or architectural significance , and ' ' demand for recognition continues to increase . ' ' She says the future of the downtown financial section causes her the most concern , particularly the intersection of Broad and High Streets , where there is a fight to maintain the ' ' character of the area amid pressure for development . ' ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston ' s designated historic districts are Beacon Hill , Back Bay , and the South End . In order to maintain their character , anyone wanting to make changes in these neighborhoods ' buildings must get approval from the local neighborhood association. // Many preservationists point to the destruction of Boston ' s West End in the early days of urban renewal as a mistake which sobered the city ' s regard for its heritage and was instrumental in passage of protective legislation . This new vigilance is echoed by Mrs. Weslowski as she states the obvious : ' ' Once a building is gone , you ' re not going to ever retrieve it. ' ' // //
