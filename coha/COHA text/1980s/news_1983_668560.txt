The first hints about what the sun was doing during the last Ice Age more than 7500 years ago are beginning to emerge from studies of ice cores drilledfrom the depths of the Greenland ice sheet . " In the past two years , " said Dr. Jack Eddy , " the first results on the earlier history of the sun " have begun " to show lots of promise . But it ' s complicated ; it needs to be refined . " The goal of such research is to understand the sun and its activity , and to learn whether changes in the sun can be related to climatic changes on earth . Such information can be important because of the impact of climatic changes on agriculture . If long-term weather patterns do change in response to changes in solar activity , then food- producing crops will be forced to change with them . One such period of low solar activity , Eddy said , coincided with the " little ice age , " which occurred during a 75-year period known as the Maunder minimum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs regularly every few hundred years , as some older , less solid evidence suggests . Eddy , from the High Altitude Observatory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. , said that as a result of new research " it ' s a very exciting thing to think we ' ve broken the barrier " to understanding solar activity beyond 7500 years ago . This seems possible , he said , because two European teams have been pulling ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica , trying to track the history of solar activity by measuring concentrations of a metal called beryllium 10 . In a lecture delivered to fellow physicists and astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge last week , Eddy explained that reliable records of the sun ' s activity - including the 22-year sunspot cycle - are only available for the last 150 years or so . Before then , other sources of information must be used . When reliable historical records are not available , he said , it is possible to go back several thousand years by looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to detect drought patterns in the Southwest , for example , by looking at tree-ring patterns in very old trees , bristlecone pines . But the key measurement for long-term climatic change lies in the relative amounts of a radioactive form of carbon 14 found in the tree rings . Carbon 14 patterns can be used to monitor solar activity because of the way this isotope of carbon is made . Carbon 14 is produced at the top of earth ' s atmosphere when energetic cosmic rays coming from deep in space collide with nitrogen atoms , creating carbon 14 . If there are a lot of cosmic rays , a lot of carbon 14 gets made . The flow of cosmic rays - and thus the production of carbon 14 - is controlled by solar activity , Eddy said . If the sun is highly active , its face pocked with numerous sunspots , its strong magnetic field tends to block the flow of cosmic rays . But when the sun is quiet , more cosmic rays get through to impact earth ' s atmosphere . The sun ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible in the carbon 14 tree ring data , and the longer period over several hundred years - including the Maunder minimum - appears to be there too . " I feel quite sure that we ' re looking at Maunder minimums " going back to about 7500 years , Eddy said . But to go beyond that is more difficult . Like the thin historical records , the carbon 14 data get fuzzy farther back and eventually disappears , so scientists have looked for another " solar activity proxy , " or gauge for measuring solar fluctuations . " We would like to see what the sun was doing , what the sun was like when the paintings were made in the caves ( in France* by Cro- Magnon man , " he said . " We need a solar-modulated proxy that goes back beyond carbon 14 , and was abundant . " That proxy is beryllium 10 , which has a half-life of 1.5 million years . Fortunately , Eddy said , nature has an " almost compulsive habit " of keeping records , which can be found if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " An especially good place to look is in Greenland , " which acts as a " global ice bucket " two miles deep . The compressed layers of ice in Greenland date back as much as 100,000 years . What Swiss and French teams have done is collect samples from deep in the ice and measure the content of beryllium 10 . As a result , it seems they are seeing signs of variation in the sun ' s output . Eddy noted , however , there are reasons for caution in assessing the findings . For instance , he said , once beryllium 10 is made , it quickly adheres to water droplets , so it falls out with rain and snow . So patterns of beryllium 10 may reflect rain patterns as much as they reflect production of the metal at high altitude . Despite such complexity , Eddy said , " I tend to think ( signs of* the solar cycle are there , " even though " the proxy is going to have to be made better . But it does show for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last Ice Age .
