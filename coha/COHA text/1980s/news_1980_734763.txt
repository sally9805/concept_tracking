txt Big-time auto racing in Grant Park ? That is a happy daydream for Arnie Morton , the restaurateur. and other promoters of a two-day racing extravaganza next July 4 weekend , using Grant Park between the band shell and Soldier Field as the race course . They have dazzled Mayor Byrne with the prospect of a glamorous international event , at : trading a cosmopolitan crowd not only to the races but to Chicago hotels and restaurants . But it is a nightmare for officials of ; Grant Park museums and for Chica ; goans accustomed to thinking of city ' parks as tranquil refuges from the bustle and bustle of city life . Auto racing is undeniably a popular sport with a big following  --  and undeniably highly dangerous . The special vehicles that compete In races usually perform in special places , like the In ? ? anapolis Speedway . Precedents for big- ; time racing on city streets exist only in Long Beach and Monaco . Cris Pook , the organizer of the Long Beach Grand Prix , is an expert witness ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 million to 53 million dol ? lars , " he says , " but it can be self-liquidating if done properly . " Doing it prop erly , he says , involves a checklist of 13f items , including devoting 20 work days for welding down manhole covers . Barricades must be set up long in advance pavement may require repair afterwards , etc . Protests that the museums would be inaccessible or accessible only to those who had paid for admission to the races are answered with the suggestion that part of the course could be shared between racers and normal traffic to and from Meigs Field , Burnham Harbor , and the Adler Planetarium . Obviously such details have not been thought through . The promoters say that safety is their big preoccupation , but 21 drivers have died from injuries on the course at Monza , Italy , and 83 spectators diec when a car sailed into the crowd at Le Mans , France . They say they hope the drivers will be experienced , but Remit Peterson , ranked second in the world and winner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Monza . The safe course of action with respect to racing in Grant Park is not to do it . The idea of attracting visitors to Chicago , the country 's premier convention city , is of course familiar and generally commendable . But no single convention , however big or rowdy , could interfere with access to the city 's public parks and museums , or entail the kind of capital expenditure that a major auto race in Grant Park would require . The decision on whether to go ahead with the project  --  assuming that the racing fraternity would cooperate  --  is essentially a political one . The idea is that the event would be sponsored by the mayor 's office , with any profit or loss going to the city . Striking a balance between glamorous publicity on the liorld 's TV screens and a harsh , negative impact on the quality of life in Chicago is a matter of judgment . Mayor Byrne has shown little re.sislance to glamorous ideas for luring big spenders to Chicago  --  e.g. , her advocacy of casino gambling . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and site must be told so ,
