Evidence of P.O.W. killings <P> For nearly two years , Iran and Iraq have been locked in an inconclusive war notable for its size and savagery . An estimated 200,000 soldiers from both sides have died , and 70,000 more have been taken prisoner . Yet even by those grim standards the charge was shocking : that Iran 's Islamic Guards , fanatical supporters of the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini , have massacred substantial numbers of unarmed Iraqi prisoners of war . <P> The allegation surfaced last week in Paris , where members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq , a Muslim socialist party opposed to the Khomeini regime , released photos purporting to be of one such incident . The massacre , said to have occurred last January in Bostan , a town in the southwestern province of Khuzistan , was photographed by Iranian officers sympathetic to the Mujahedin . According to the officers , Islamic Guards assembled a group of Iraqi prisoners in front of pictures of Khomeini and ordered them to chant slogans praising the Ayatullah . Several dozen Iraqis refused . They were led away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army officers watched in disbelief , an earthmover dug a large ditch . After the prisoners had been placed along the edge , the guards opened fire . The bodies tumbled into the waiting grave . <P> Other disgruntled Iranian officers have reported similar killings by the Islamic Guards , who fight alongside the regular army but are under the command of the Islamic clergy . Last February , a group of guards allegedly captured about 15 Iraqi soldiers in Gilan-e Gharb , an Iranian border town . As the P.O.W.s were being escorted to a makeshift detention center , a wounded Islamic Guard suddenly pointed at one of the Iraqis and yelled , " He killed Hamid ! " The accused man was shot to death on the spot . The guards then killed the other prisoners with bullets and bayonets . On several occasions , the guards have simply led prisoners to an isolated spot in the battle zone and killed them . When the guards returned to camp , they informed curious army officers that they had suddenly found themselves behind enemy lines and could not have returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We usually ca n't stop the guards because they have the support of the clergymen at the front . " <P> Indeed , the Islamic clergy ignores and at times even encourages the mistreatment of Iraqi P.O.W.s . The massacres are seen as a way to boost Iraqi casualty figures and , perhaps more important , to instill ferocity and brutality in the ill-trained guards for their larger mission . Most of them serve only a short time at the front before being shipped back to the cities to battle the regime 's stubborn domestic opponents . <P> That home-front war is getting bloodier too . Late last week , a bomb hidden in a truck exploded in the heart of the capital , destroying a five-story hotel and three passing buses . Hundreds of wounded people were rushed to nearby hospitals , and rescue workers pulled dozens of bodies out of the rubble . According to Tehran Radio , some 60 were killed and 700 wounded . But at week 's end authorities still were not sure exactly how many were dead or who had planted the explosives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
