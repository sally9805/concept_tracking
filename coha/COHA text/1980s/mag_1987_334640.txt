It happened with surreal swiftness . One moment , the pageant of Reaganism was proceeding , with brilliant fireworks over the harbor . The next moment , the Iranian scandal burst up through the floorboards . Strange blackbirds of policy flapped out of the White House basement . The Reagan Administration , the phenomenon that had defined so much of the ' 80s , that had given the decade its agenda and style , seemed to collapse in a bizarre shambles . <P> If the U.S. were a parliamentary democracy , the Reagan Government might have fallen . As it is , Ronald Reagan will remain in Washington for another 22 months . His White House is laboring to repair the damage . In time Reagan may reassert his charm . Even as a lame duck , he will have his successes , perhaps even an arms-control agreement . It is possible that Ronald Reagan has not yet exhausted his luck . <P> But the question is not whether Reagan can recover . The nation is beginning to look beyond Reagan now . Any President in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode . The Iran affair simply hastened the process and abruptly concentrated the nation 's mind . The 1988 election is coalescing . The parties are sorting out candidates and issues . There are signs of a fundamental change in the nation 's political weather , a philosophical mood shift like those that seem to occur in America every generation or so . <P> Even without Iran , the era of Reagan was passing . It has left its indelible mark , yet its battle cry  --  that Government is the problem , not the solution  --  is losing force . Presidential candidates of both parties are struggling to define a new role for Government in the post-Reagan era . While seeing the need to be frugal , they are talking more and more about compassion , more active approaches to deep-rooted social problems , a new sense of community values . Reagan has done what he has done , and he has accomplished much . He presided over one of the longest periods of economic recovery in American history , a time attended by the end of inflation and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Government , helped to initiate tax reform , strengthened ( amid some set-backs ) the American posture in the world . But now one feels the ground shifting underfoot , a grinding of the tectonic plates . <P> " We 're at the end of an Eisenhower period , " says UCLA Political Sociologist Jeffrey Alexander , " and we 're moving into something not unlike the 1960s . The ' era of good feeling ' that Reagan presided over is ending , and people are ready for the next cycle of history , for a new period of activism and social change . " But as Alexander well knows , the future never merely recycles the past . The nation can not return to federal taxing and spending on a Great Society scale . Most candidates in 1988 will focus wistfully on new ways to engage Government , business and labor in projects to solve problems and help people . It will never again be the all-daddy Government of the New Deal , they say , but neither will it be the shrunken Reagan version . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of Ronald Reagan to one that takes a more active , compassionate approach to those in true need , " says Republican Mayor William Hudnut of Indianapolis . " It is a ground swell gaining force . "
