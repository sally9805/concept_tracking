In a deft political move , Reagan sends summit signals to the Soviets <P> Exit Ronald Reagan , rough rider . <P> No tough talk , no declarations that the Soviets are " the focus of evil in the modern world , " no boasts that the " march of freedom and democracy ... will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history . " Enter Reagan the statesman , man of peace and reason , holding out an olive branch to the Kremlin . " I am willing to meet and talk any time , " he declared at a White House press conference last week . " The door is open . Every once in a while , we 're standing in the doorway , seeing if anyone 's coming up the steps . " <P> The clear implication was that if Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko would just climb up , the two world leaders could sit together at the summit and begin to thaw the big chill between the superpowers . Reagan 's calming words marked a clear departure from his old hard line against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead to a superpower sitdown any time soon . <P> <P> Despite some conciliatory words of their own , the Soviets remain wary , distant adversaries ( see WORLD ) . <P> Reagan 's softer line was not aimed so much at Moscow as at the American electorate . If he has a political vulnerability , it is the state of relations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. , which are cooler than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 . " The risk we face now is that the people view the President as being locked in concrete and against negotiations with the Soviets , " says a senior White House adviser . In taking a more conciliatory tack , he said , Reagan was " making sure the Democrats do n't have an issue . " At his press conference , Reagan insisted , " One thing let me make clear . I 'm not going to play political games with this subject . " White House operatives took a less noble view of the exercise . " We got just what we wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A SUMMIT MEETING . " <P> <P> In fact , he does not , at least not until after the election . A pre-election summit might turn out to be politically risky , his advisers believe . Some voters would see it as a campaign gimmick , and conservatives might accuse him of groveling before the Soviets . Moreover , a face-to-face encounter would give the Soviets a chance to cause mischief . They could feign interest in a summit , then stay home because of some trumped-up U.S. offense , or walk out of the talks with words of derision for the President . Either way , Reagan would have trouble repairing the damage before November . <P> Democrats were understandably skeptical about Reagan 's transformation . Said House Speaker Tip O'Neill : " Reagan has built a wall around them and thrown brickbats . Now he wants to reach through a crack in the wall and extend the hand of fellowship . " Reagan 's likely Democratic opponent , Walter Mondale , has long pledged to make unconditional talks with Kremlin leaders his first priority after Inauguration Day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a President who will lead us toward a safer world from the first day I 'm in office , and not from the first day I start my campaign .
