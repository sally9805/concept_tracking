In Stalin 's day , a disgraced party official received a show trial and a bullet in the head . In more recent times , Kremlin power brokers who fell from grace languished in obscure retirement .

In a widely publicized speech to senior party leaders at week 's end , Gorbachev did not mention Yeltsin by name but criticized officials whose management decisions " bring society to a fever " and " unnerve people "  --  charges that were leveled by many against the abrasive Moscow party chief during the meeting that preceded his downfall .
