WHY WE WERE IN VIET NAM by Norman Podhoretz Simon &; Schuster ; 210 pages ; $13.50 <P> This book is 210 pages leading up to a punch line . The punch line is Ronald Reagan 's remark that Viet Nam was a " noble cause . " Norman Podhoretz , neo-conservative guru , editor of Commentary , author of that 1980 call to arms , The Present Danger , argues that Reagan 's description of Viet Nam is close to the truth . He seeks to prove that much fulmination to the contrary , America 's participation in the war was not immoral . While Podhoretz will not convince those to whom America 's guilt is an invigorating article of faith , he does a good job in supporting his proposition . <P> The book correctly describes how the U.S. edged into the Viet Nam conflict with the best of motives , hoping to contain the spread of Communism , and how at first the idea was supported by all the leading liberals , including John Kennedy and Senator William Fulbright , later the Viet Nam War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too briskly ) disposes of some of the cliches about the war : he argues that it was not really a civil war , that it was no more brutal than other wars ( a view supported both by statistics and by the word of no less an authority than Daniel Ellsberg ) , that it was not lost because it alienated the " hearts and minds " of the people but ultimately because of conventional invasion from the North . The only conceivable way to victory , Podhoretz suggests , would have been for the U.S. to have been a different country capable of fighting a different war . He concedes that defeat was inevitable , but he nevertheless maintains that the attempt to win was worthwhile . <P> Podhoretz is bloodcurdlingly effective in recalling the outrageous and irresponsible charges of the anti-anti-Communist and radical opposition , which he accurately describes as " McCarthyism of the left . " Here is Susan Son tag reporting from Hanoi that most of the world would be greatly improved by living in a society like North Viet Nam 's , and adding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recanted and made the discovery that " Communism is fascism " ) . Here is Mary McCarthy , also in Hanoi , defending the regime 's censorship by explaining that a free press can be unhealthy for a body politic , and Noam Chomsky proclaiming that America needs deNazification . Podhoretz contrasts this pernicious idealization of Hanoi and the guerrillas it led to the well-documented horrors the victors have since visited on their own people . The point is well worth making . However , when he observes that in any other country the war critics who were openly cheering for the enemy would have been treated as traitors , he fails to note that the war , after all , was never formally declared-which is not merely a legalism .
