LET THERE BE LIGHT Directed and Written by John Huston <P> When " the best and the brightest " went to war against the Axis , there was no ambiguity attached to the phrase . <P> Many of the best fueled the American war machine with their guts and lives . Some of the brightest designed the strategy that won the war and the Bomb that ended it . <P> And a few heroes-John Ford , George Stevens , William Wyler , most especially John Huston-emerged from the klieg lights of Hollywood fantasy into the strobe lights of enemy strafing to record the war as artist-combatants . Ford , wounded while photographing The Battle of Midway ( 1942 ) , kept on shooting and won an Oscar for his pains . Huston 's war trilogy suffered more serious casualties . <P> The first documentary , Report from the Aleutians ( 1942 ) , included a shot of an aircraft bombsight , which was considered a military secret ; the film was quickly pulled from movie theaters . San Pietro ( 1943-44 ) chronicled the battle for one ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film was chopped from five reels to three and its release delayed a year , until after V-E day . Let There Be Light ( 1945-46 ) showed the scarring effects of the war on soldiers hospitalized for shell shock ; the War Department slapped a ban on it . Wrote Critic James Agee in the Nation of May 11 , 1946 : " I do n't know what is necessary to reverse this disgraceful decision , but if dynamite is required , then dynamite is indicated . " <P> Dynamite may have been required ; patience was indicated . Let There Be Light remained suppressed for 35 years-until last month , when the Department of Defense finally authorized its release . There are good soldiers in peacetime too : silver stars should be awarded to Jack Valenti , president of the Motion Picture Association of America , and Ray Stark , producer of three later Huston films , who lobbied with the Government to liberate Let There Be Light ; Ron Haver of the Los Angeles County Museum , who organized the film 's first public showing ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast light on the film 's splendid achievements and sorry history . This week the hour-long documentary receives its theatrical premiere at Manhattan 's Thalia theater . <P> Another task remains . Report from the Aleutians , San Pietro and Let There Be Light must be seen on a single program , as a single work . Each comments on , draws contrast with and enriches the others . Together they describe the arc of experience common to every foot soldier in every war : the preparation , the fighting , the hope of recovery and reconciliation . <P> Report is a 45-minute manual on the grunt 's first challenge : combatting boredom while he learns his job . War is n't hell , it 's just a drag . In depicting men at work , at meals , at the meager forms of play available to them , the film seems relentlessly mundane . And so it is - if the viewer forgets that many of these youngsters , smiling or shivering or just hanging around , are marking time before an early , explosive death .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
