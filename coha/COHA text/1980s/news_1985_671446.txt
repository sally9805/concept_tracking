The 10-day trip , with stops in Spain , Portugal , France and other parts of West Germany , has been overshadowed by outrage over the President ' s plan to visit a cemetery that has graves of Waffen SS soldiers. // Today officials said the White House chief of staff , Donald T. Regan , was seeking to shift attention from the cemetery visit on Friday to a previously announced trip to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp site earlier that day . Page 16 . Fears of a Recession But the President ' s trip is also clouded by new apprehensions that the American economy , which pulled other countries from a prolonged global recession , is showing signs of pushing them into another. // In his weekly radio address to the nation today , Mr. Reagan in effect asked the other summit countries to join him in giving the world economy a boost and to repel protectionism , which has emerged as one of the conference ' s most contentious issues. // " By working together with our allies , " he said , " we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running with efficiency . We want to make certain the fruits of open and free exchange are enjoyed by all and that free trade is a two-way proposition . " <> <> Some Common Concerns // The Bonn summit meeting , which will be held Thursday through Sunday , will bring together the leaders of the United States , Japan , West Germany , Britain , France , Italy and Canada , in addition to officials of the European Economic Community. // Europeans and the Reagan Administration are concerned about turmoil in world currencies , signs that the long United States economic boom may be sputtering out , high unemployment in Europe and Canada and growing disputes over protectionism , notably the United States Congress ' s fury with Japan over trade practices. // Protectionist sentiments could lead to an increase in barriers to the international trade that all the countries consider vital to their prosperity. // There are few disagreements over the nature of the hazards , but sharp divisions over how to avert them . For all the first-name cordiality among the national leaders , the ceremonial splendor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlikely to produce decisive policy changes that could alter world economic behavior. // At best , officials of the participating countries expect little more than vague commitments on resolving their conflicts over several years. // " If we just keep things from getting worse , " a senior State Department official said , " that might be enough. " // The principal issues before the summit conference are the ones that have occupied all the conferences since they began at Rambouillet , France , in 1975 : The first , stability of currency exchange rates , is the essential lubricant of the second , international trade , which is vital to the fulfillment of the third , worldwide economic growth. // All the countries share the ideals of stable currencies , free trade and economic growth . But on some questions , domestic political priorities force the countries to compromise their ideals , and the countries are ideologically divided over how to realize their goals . <> <> Criticism of Reagan Policies // Inevitably , as the chief of the biggest of the participating countries , the United States President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has expanded his influence much further . Since his first summit conference , in Ottawa in 1981 , he has been preaching the gospel of free markets and small government that underlie his economic policies at home. // Other summit countries , especially France and Britain , have derided the Reagan policies . They contend that the $200 billion budget deficits resulting from the President ' s policies wash through their own economies because they hold United States interest rates unusually high and divert investment from their own economies to the United States . The Reagan Administration counters that without its policies , the rest of the world would have had virtually no economic growth over the last two years. // Voices on both sides are now a little less strident . The President calls the deficits " immoral " in invoking them to press his goal of cutting spending to reduce the size of Government . Europeans , for their part , have become concerned over their failure to halt the rise in unemployment despite economic improvements. // " They look at Reagan differently , " said W. Allen Wallis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been directing the Administration ' s planning for the summit meeting with counterparts from the other countries . The President ' s policies , Mr. Wallis said , " are looked at with more interest and respect. " // But the United States and Europe now are concerned that the American economy has exhausted the energy that let it grow faster than any other country , including Japan , over the last two years and may be decelerating to a growth rate well below the 4 percent pace that the Reagan Administration calls desirable and sustainable. // During the first three months of the year , it grew at a near-recession rate of only 1. 3 percent . The President ' s chief of staff , Mr. Regan , called the figure " a disappointment " last week , but like many economists , the former Treasury Secretary noted that such gauges have sometimes proved wildly wrong. // Even so , the Administration assumes the United States economy has slowed and is unlikely to remain the engine of world growth . It wants other countries to take up the slack. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trade and growth will be defined in terms of differences over the extent to which government action or market forces should be relied on . <> <> Differences on Exchange Rates // Thus the issue of exchange rates comes down to disputes over French and European Economic Community insistence that governments link the values of their currencies . They contend that central banks should intervene to defend such linkage - for example , by selling dollars if the market should push the dollar above its prescribed limits. // At the root of the French position is the view that government management of exchange rates forces governments to avoid the economic excesses , particularly inflation , that cause currencies to move out of line with others. // Earlier this month , at a meeting of Finance Ministers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris , Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy of France reinvoked President Francois Mitterrand ' s declaration two years ago that the time had come " to think again of a new Bretton Woods . " He was referring to the monetary conference 41 years ago in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system abandoned in the early 1970 ' s. // The Reagan Administration ' s view , supported by the other summit countries , is just the opposite . Sound management of national economies keeps currencies in line , the Administration contends , not management of the currencies themselves. // But the exceptional strength and more recent volatility of the dollar have also worried the Administration . By lowering the relative prices of foreign goods , the dollar ' s strength has caused record United States trade deficits and forced farmers and companies out of business. // Partly to deflect the French , but also to show support of more active government intervention to prevent disorder in the currency markets , Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d earlier this month said that " the United States is willing to consider the possible value of hosting " a multinational conference to explore the question. // According to Beryl W. Sprinkel , the new chairman of the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers , " It was said that way to give Jim Baker and the President room to consult to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Bonn , President Reagan is likely to be more specific . " The idea of hosting a meeting is on the table , " Mr. Sprinkel said . <> <> Trade Issues Are Divisive // Trade issues are equally divisive . The question before the summit meeting is the United States insistence on a specific date to begin a worldwide round of negotiations to eliminate obstacles to free trade in agriculture and services , including nontariff devices such as farm subsidies and Japanese measures to block foreign goods. // " I think that one of the things that is of great importance that we want to be talking about is another round of trade talks to resist the protectionism that raises its head every once in a while , " the President told a group of foreign correspondents in an interview that the White House released today. // But the United States is the most openly committed to free trade , and not solely because of its commitment to unregulated markets . Protectionism , in the form of price supports to farmers , increases the Government spending that the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid to farmers , the Administration wants to assure them greater access to world markets . The reductions in Government farm supports could pass Congress late this year , so there is some urgency to the Administration ' s appeal for trade negotiations . " We need a date to discipline the process of getting started with the talks , " Mr. Sprinkel said . " We want to get it going in early 1986. " // France , and to a lesser extent other European countries , are less committed to beginning the talks soon . A European Economic Community official said the organization of the negotiations is so complicated , involving the participation of countless developing countries , that the summit countries ought to move cautiously . <> <> The Question of Growth // As with exchange rates and trade , the Reagan Administration has brought its own ideological views to the issue of growth . The principal obstruction to growth is seen as " structural rigidities , " such as regulations preventing ailing companies from laying off workers and tax systems that discourage investment. // Here the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the United States economy expanding , the Administration wants Europe and Canada to accelerate their lackluster recoveries so they are able to buy more American goods . Some Europeans have interpreted this as a call for tax cuts and other " pump-priming " measures , but the Administration denies that assertion. // " I read all about how we ' re going to ask them to cut their taxes , " said Mr. Wallis of the State Department . " There ' s never been a whiff of that . " Instead , the Administration urges the same kind of industrial deregulation and tax revisions that it has been pursuing , which it says could result in lower taxes. //
