' ' Horizon ' 83 ' ' poses the question : ' ' Since 1968 , A New Romanticism ? ' ' It is a brave idea , devoting so much time and expense to new and often difficult music composed during this time . More typical of the Philharmonic ' s efforts at the time is the fact that the late conductor Andre Kostelanetz tried to duplicate the Arthur Fiedler Boston Pops magic in the Big Apple. // Even with various flaws - mostly quite minor in retrospect - ' ' Horizons ' ' is emphatically an important addition to the concert scene . The Philharmonic players , it must be noted , seemed to respond to the challenge of the music with dedication , care , and commitment - something rarely seen in standard subscriptions series. // The first three concerts gave a hearty sampling of what ' ' new romanticism ' ' might just be all about . Jacob Druckman , the composer-in-residence here , put this ambitious series together , and he has chosen a wide spread of compositional types . The thesis seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by the Romantic composers of yore , from Berlioz through Mahler. // Curiously , not all of the 12 works heard the opening weekend reveal this influence . The first two programs seemed more like marathons of endurance rather than savvily constructed arguments for the thesis. // But I come not to bury Mr. Druckman ( and the Philharmonic ) for undertaking this festival , but to praise him ( and them ) . The Philharmonic has taken a bold step during this increasingly conservative era in devoting so much time to the relatively new . After all , new music is not popular . Subscription audiences flee the contemporary almost without exception ( they even flee turn-of-the-century music if there is nothing hummable about it ) . // Everyone in the music business complains about the problem . But few are willing to do much about it , apart from the occasional commissions and world premieres . The Philharmonic ' s batting average has been higher than most , but this festival puts them in something of a vanguard : There are few other cities where the symphony organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that this festival is without flaws . Mr. Druckman ' s programming is not exactly skillful . The best pieces on the programs tend to be oppressed by the lesser ones . The attempt to include all the New York contemporary performance groups made the two opening programs unwieldy . In some cases , composers on the program have clearly not been touched by anything Romantic or even heartfelt , writing today in the same style as a full decade ago. // ' ' New romanticism ' ' is most audible in David del Tredici ' s ' ' All in the Golden Afternoon . ' ' This is still more of the composer ' s ' ' Alice in Wonderland ' ' music , and it tends to go on too long for the material presented . But it is consistently entertaining and utterly , if raucously , accessible , with a tune repeated so often it is etched in the mind ' s ear forever ! // Other composers have softened their hard-bitten ways with the musical form called seriality , and the result is quite startling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty from Toru Takemitsu , but his ' ' Far Calls , Coming Far ! ' ' is just that - a shimmering , vibrant work for violin and orchestra that ends long before one wants it to. // The major discovery of the trio of evenings is the John Harbison Violin Concerto . Though it received the drabest , least colorful possible performance from associate concertmaster Charles Rex ( beautiful tone , little content ) and conductor Arthur Weisberg , one could clearly hear a work of haunting beauty . Mr. Harbison does not venture into new forms , but he broodingly , meltingly exploits contemporary harmonies and eventually incorporates a touch of hoedown fiddling into what emerges as a refreshingly unpretentious American work. // Morton Subotnik ' s ' ' Ascent Into Air ' ' showed a warmer side than usual to his live-with-computer compositional style . Marc-Antonio Consoli ' s ' ' Afterimages ' ' ( a world premiere ) appeared to lack a clear sense of purpose and forward motion . Donald Martino ' s ' ' Triple Concerto for Clarinet , Bass Clarinet , and Contrabass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solo line among three instruments of wide , wide range ) , but lacked the least hint of spontaneity and beauty in its aggressive tone-clustered meanderings. // Fred Lerdahl ' s ' ' Chords ' ' ( world premiere of the revised version ) offered some gorgeous moments without real cohesiveness . Sandor Balassa ' s ' ' Lupercalia , ' ' billed as a tribute to Stravinsky , suggested that composer only in a few shrieking chords . Peter Maxwell Davies ' s ' ' Ave Maris Stella ' ' deserved a better performance than it got from the New York New Music Ensemble , though only parts of the score really take wing. // Barbara Kolb ' s ' ' Chromatic Fantasy ' ' proved to be a slender divertissement with Tony Randall the narrator . Leonard Rosenman ' s exploration of microtonalities , entitled ' ' Foci I ' ' ( world premiere of the revised version ) captured the ear quickly and held interest throughout. // John Adams ' s ' ' Grand Pianola Music ' ' was evidently the composer ' s attempt to write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimalist roots while incorporating a pop beat and harmonies . Mr. Druckman conducted the score rather too seriously , and too many seams showed through . It was constantly entertaining , though a surprisingly hostile segment of the audience thought otherwise - and quite vocally - at performance ' s finish. // The Horizions comes to an end tonight . Here ' s hoping the concept does not come to an end as well . The audiences were larger than expected ( the price for all seats was $8 ) , and this sort of high-profile series can only help to win further friends to the new . Perhaps the next time around fewer pieces will be better juxtaposed on each program . Maybe the pieces chosen will better bear out the premise of whatever the new series will be named. // //
