Does the modern state of Israel fulfill God 's biblical promise , which bestowed the Holy Land upon the Chosen People ? That question has been the source of considerable spiritual and political debate among Christians ever since Israel was founded in 1948 . The problem came to the fore again last week in Biloxi , Miss. , for 665 delegates to the national assembly of the 3 million-member Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) . The Israel issue led to a dispute that stirred passions over six days before the assembly finally approved an eight-page statement . The document is probably the most amicable declaration any U.S. denomination has yet issued on Jewish-Christian relations . <P> The words of goodwill , however , were nearly overshadowed by the intense debate over Israel . After considerable soul-searching , the church agreed that the " state of Israel is a geopolitical entity and is not to be validated theologically . " As originally proposed by a special task force , the paper said that Presbyterians " take no position on the theological significance of the state of Israel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial wording to a statement opposing pro-Zionist theology was led by the Rev. Benjamin Weir , the former U.S. missionary in Lebanon who was held hostage by Muslim terrorists for 16 months until his release last September . To him , both Jews and Palestinians have the right to a homeland . Weir is completing a year as the church 's Moderator ( titular head ) . Besides amending the section on Israel , Weir 's allies , primarily churchmen who have worked in the Middle East , got the document downgraded from a church-policy statement to a study paper , pending further discussions in 1989 . <P> The final text recognizes the overriding spiritual importance of the Holy Land for Jews , but it adds an expression of sympathy for Palestinians and " all people to whom rights of ' land ' are currently denied . " ( In a separate action , the church pledged to counteract bigotry against Muslims and Arabs in the U.S. ) The document also considered the touchy matter of converting Jews to Christianity . The approved text asserts that " Christians have no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith with anyone . " It adds , " Many Jews have been unwilling to accept the Christian claim and have continued in their covenant tradition . " <P> Insistence upon respect for the continuing validity of Judaism was the important achievement of the assembly . The delegates repudiated the idea that God turned against the Jews because they rejected Jesus as the Messiah , and expressed repentance for Christianity 's part in past anti-Semitism . The American Jewish Committee said the document is " potentially of great historic importance " and has " broken significant new ground . " <P> Turning to internal business , the assembly voted to move the church 's headquarters from New York City and Atlanta to Louisville . The head of a site % committee , which had selected Kansas City , glumly eyed the Louisville lobbyists ' brochures and gift baseball bats and grumbled , " Glitz and hype carried the day . " Not exactly . To gain 900 Presbyterian jobs and a $32 million payroll , the Kentuckians will give the church a downtown building virtually free .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
