Baseball and Pete Rose , once thought to be inseparable institutions , teetered last week on the edge of an almost unbearable sadness . Several Cincinnati-area bookmakers allege that Rose has been betting on baseball games . If Rose is found to have gambled on baseball , he can expect a year 's suspension as Reds manager . If he bet on Cincinnati games , Rose could be shunned for life by the sport he personifies , jeopardizing everything he has accomplished , even the place in baseball 's Hall of Fame that awaits him in 1992 . <P> The first alarm bell rang in February , when Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth and National League President A. Bartlett Giamatti summoned Rose to New York City for a private conversation on a secret subject . Reporters who knew Rose guessed gambling . Last week Ueberroth acknowledged that his office was conducting an ongoing investigation into " serious allegations " after Ron Peters and Alan Statman , a saloon-keeping bookie and his lawyer , claimed they had been cooperating with the commissioner 's office . They offered to expand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati Enquirer . Both publications demurred . But the story began to drip out , and its most graphic charge was that the leading hitter in baseball history may have exchanged signals with his bookie from the dugout . Rose denies betting on baseball games or indulging in any other illegal form of gambling , though he admits he is a habitue of dog and horse tracks . <P> The ordinarily bright spring-training atmosphere was further darkened by proliferating reports that Rose has blown his fortune on wagers . The Dayton Daily News stated that he recently sold the bat and ball from his record 4,192nd hit . Rose responded with a melancholy " No comment . " None of his comments throughout the besieged week were more expansive than a flippant remark to S.I. : " I 'd be willing to bet you , if I was a betting man , that I have never bet on baseball . " <P> A hometown Cincinnatian too enthusiastic ever to walk to first base , Rose arrived in the major leagues as a flat-topped Reds second baseman whom Mickey Mantle rechristened " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rose devoured the game with such a primitive pleasure that people said he had skipped his true generation . Usually sliding on his stomach , he inched closer and closer to the dustiest of legends until in 1985 he passed Ty Cobb in total hits and kept on going to a record 4,256 hits and 3,562 games . Then he became the legend . <P> Always a numbers man , Rose was at the vanguard of baseball 's economic revolt . His original ambition , " to be the first $100,000 singles hitter , " sounds quaint now . In the late 1970s he made an auction out of the new free- agent system , and for $3.2 million over four years stopped off in Philadelphia to show the Phillies how to win . <P> As a player , Rose savored six World Series and three world titles . But in four seasons as a manager , he has directed the Reds to second place in the National League 's West Division four times . Even before the gambling charges , Cincinnati owner Marge Schott was said to be impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
