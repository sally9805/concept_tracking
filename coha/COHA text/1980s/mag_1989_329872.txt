! Normally , international conferences at the Vatican are carefully staged and well modulated . Such was the expectation last week as 1,000 theologians , church officials , health workers and top-flight scientists gathered in Rome for the first Vatican meeting on AIDS . But the script was quickly ripped up as the three-day conference was disrupted by a sign-wielding protester , dissident caucuses and angry charges and countercharges . At one point the conference 's organizer , Archbishop Fiorenzo Angelini , had a tense confrontation with an AIDS victim who had sought to speak to the group . <P> Calm had returned by the time Pope John Paul II appeared . In the first major papal statement on AIDS , the Pontiff called on governments " to develop and carry out a worldwide plan to combat AIDS and drug addiction . " He urged patients not to despair and condemned " every form of discrimination " against them . But he warned against " morally illicit " methods of preventing AIDS  --  a clear allusion to condoms  --  and spoke of " abuse of sexuality , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of AIDS . He said the crisis results from " immunodeficiency " in values . <P> The conference 's trouble began after the sponsoring Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers refused to allow a speech by militant Peter Larkin of England , one of several AIDS sufferers who were invited by the Vatican . Frustrated by the council 's tight control of the agenda , some 50 dissidents accused it of hindering open discussions , then set up their own lunch-hour conference . On the sidelines , some medical professionals defended the use of condoms ; others accused the church of homophobia . John White , a priest who contracted the virus while in Kenya and now runs an AIDS treatment center in London , was ejected from one conference session for wearing a sandwich board that read THE CHURCH HAS AIDS . Declared one participant from the U.S. : " This is the worst conference I 've ever attended . " <P> The meeting strengthened Roman Catholic officialdom 's stand against advocating condom use for homosexuals or distribution of sterile needles to drug addicts , particularly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Connor . Father Rocco Buttiglione of Liechtenstein 's International Academy of Philosophy went so far as to suggest that the AIDS scourge could be a " divine punishment , " but quickly added that it was aimed not just at sexual misconduct but at all modern forms of sinfulness . The various flare-ups tended to obscure the repeated theme on which everyone at the conference agreed : AIDS is a horrendous health crisis that demands every bit of compassion and care the church can muster .
