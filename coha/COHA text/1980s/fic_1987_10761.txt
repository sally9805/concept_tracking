the trying early years of his reign while he was learning the difficult art of ruling well . He made mistakes , naturally , but the consequences of those early slips and miscalculations were never dire , and his subjects were pleased to note that this earnest , sincere young man who had come so startlingly to the throne never made the same mistake twice . Once he had settled in and had become accustomed to his job , it was probably safe to say that Belgarion  --  or Garion , as he preferred to be called  --  almost never encountered major problems in his capacity as King of Riva . He had other titles , however . Some were purely honorary , others not so much so . " Godslayer , " for example , involved certain duties which were not likely to come up very often . " Lord of the Western Sea " caused him almost no concern whatsoever , since he had concluded quite early that the waves and tides need little supervision and that fish , for the most part , were entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's headaches stemmed directly from the grand-sounding title , " Overlord of the West . " He had assumedat first  --  since the war with the Angaraks was over  --  that this title , like the others , was merely something in the nature of a formality , something impressive , but largely empty , which had been tacked on to all the rest , sort of to round them out . It earned him , after all , no tax revenue ; it had no special crown or throne ; and there was no administrativestaff to deal with day-to-day problems . But to his chagrin , he soon discovered that one of the peculiaritiesof human nature was the tendency to want to take problems to the person in charge . Had there not been an Overlordof the West , he was quite sure that his fellow monarchs would have found ways to deal with all those perplexing difficultiesby themselves . But as long as he occupied that exaltedposition , they all seemed to take an almost childlike delight in bringing him the most difficult , the most agonizing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with trusting smiles on their faces while he struggled and floundered with them . As a case in point , there was the situation which arose in Arendia during the summer of Garion 's twenty-third year . The year had gone fairly well up until that point . The misunderstandingwhich had marred his relationship with Ce'Nedra had been smoothed over , and Garion and his complicatedlittle wife were living together in what might best be described as domestic felicity . The campaign of Emperor Kal Zakath of Mallorea , whose presence on this continent had been a great cause for concern , had bogged down in the mountains of western Cthol Murgos and showed some promise of grinding on for decades far from the borders of any of the Kingdoms of the West . General Varana , the Duke of Anadile , functioning as regent for the ailing Emperor Ran Borune XXIII , had clamped down quite firmly on the excesses of the great families of Tolnedra in their unseeemly scramble for the Imperial Throne . All in all , Garion had been looking forward to a period of peace and tranquility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived from King Korodullin of Arendia . Garion and Ce'Nedra had been spending a quiet afternoon together in the comfortable royal apartment , talking idly of little , unimportant things  --  more for the pleasure of each other'scompany than out of any real concern for the subjects at hand . Garion lounged in a large , blue velvet armchair by the window , and Ce'Nedra sat before a gilt-edged mirror , brushingher long , copper-colored hair . Garion was very fond of Ce'Nedra 's hair . Its color was exciting . It smelled good , and there was one delightfully vagrant curl that always seemed to want to tumble appealingly down the side of her smooth , white neck . When the servant brought the letter from the King of Arendia , tastefully carried on a silver tray , Garion took his eyes off his lovely wife almost regretfully . He broke the ornatelystamped wax seal and opened the crackling parchment . " Who is it from , Garion ? " Ce'Nedra asked , still pulling thep152brush through her hair and regarding her reflection in the mirror with a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then began to read . " To his Majesty , King Belgarion of Riva , Overlord of the West , greetings : " the letter began . " It is our fervent hope that this finds thee and thy queen in good health and tranquil spirits . Gladly would I permit my pen the leisure to dwell fulsomely upon the regard and affectionmy queen and I bear thee and her Majesty , but a crisis hath arisen here in Arendia ; and because it doth derive directly from the actions of certain friends of thine , I have resolved to seek thy aid in meeting it . " To our great sorrow , our dear friend the Baron of Vo Ebor succumbed at last to those grievous wounds which he received upon the battlefield at Thull Mardu . His passing this spring hath grieved us more than I can tell thee . He was a good and faithful knight . His heir , since he and the baroness Nerina were childless , is a distant nephew , one Sir Embrig , a somewhatrash knight more interested , I fear , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he doth intrude himself upon the tragic baroness . With airs most unbecoming to one of gentle birth , he journeyed straightway to Vo Ebor to take possession of his new estates and with him he brought diverse other knights of his acquaintance , his cronies and drinking companions . When they reached Vo Ebor , Sir Embrig and his cohorts gave themselves over to unseemly carouse , and when they were all deep in their cups , one of these rude knights expressed admiration for the person of the but recently widowedNerina . Without pausing to think or to consider the lady 's bereavement , Sir Embrig promptly promised her hand to his drunken companion . Now in Arendia , by reason of certainof our laws , Sir Embrig hath indeed this right , though no true knight would so incivilly insist on imposing his will upon a kinswoman in her time of grief . " The news of this outrage was carried at once to Sir Mandorallen , the mighty Baron of Vo Mandor , and that greatp153knight went immediately to horse . What transpired upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Mandorallen'sprowess and the depth of his regard for the Baroness Nerina . Sir Embrig and his cohorts rashly attempted to stand in his path , and there were , as I understand , some fatalities and a great number of grievous injuries as a result . Thy friend removed the baroness to his own keep at Vo Mandor , where he holds her in protective custody . Sir Embrig , who  --  regrettablyperhaps  --  will recover from his wounds , hath declaredthat a state of war doth exist between Ebor and Mandor and he hath summoned to his cause diverse noblemen . Other noblemen flock to the banner of Sir Mandorallen , and southwesternArendia doth stand on the brink of general war . I have even been informed that Lelldorin of Wildantor , ever a rash youth , hath raised an army of Asturian bowmen and at this moment doth march southward with them , intending to aid his old comrade in arms . " Thus it cloth stand . Know that I am reluctant to bring the power of the Arendish crown to bear in this matter , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be forced by our laws to decide in favor of Sir Embrig . " I appeal to thee , King Belgarion , to come to Arendia and to use thy influence with thy former companions and dear friends to bring them back from the precipice upon which they now stand . Only thy intercession , I fear , can avert this impending disaster . In hope and friendship , Korodullin . " Garion stared helplessly at the letter . " Why me ? " he demandedwithout even thinking . " What does he say , dear ? " Ge'Nedra asked , laying aside her brush and picking up an ivory comb . " He says that  --  " Garion broke off . " Mandorallen and Lelldorin  --  " He got up and began to swear . " Here , " he said , thrusting the letter at her . " Read it . " He began to pace upp154and down with his fists clenched behind his back , still mutteringcurse words . Ce'Nedra read the letter as he continued pacing . " Oh dear , " she said finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums it up pretty well , I 'd say . " He started swearing again . " Garion , please do n't use that kind of language . It makes you sound like a pirate . What are you going to do about this ? " " I have n't got the faintest idea . " " Well , you 're going to have to do something . " " Why me ? " he burst out . " Why do they always bring these things to me ? " " Because they all know that you can take care of these little problems better than anybody else . " " Thanks , " he said drily . " Be nice , " she told him . Then she pursed her lips thoughtfully , tapping her cheek with the ivory comb . " You 'll need your crown , of course  --  and I think the blue and silver doublet would be nice . " " What are you talking about ? " " You 're going to have to go to Arendia to get this all straightenedout , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so conscious of appearances . Why do n't you go see about a ship ? I 'll pack a few things for you . " She looked out the window at the golden afternoon sunlight . " Do you think it might be too warm for you to wear your ermine ? " " I wo n't be wearing ermine , Ce'Nedra . I 'll be wearing armor and my sword . " " Oh , do n't be so dramatic , Garion . All you have to do is go there and tell them to stop . " " Maybe , but I have to get their attention first . This is Mandorallenwe 're talking about  --  and I , elldorin . We 're not dealingwith sensible people , remember ? " A little frown creased her forehead . " That is true , " she admitted . But then she gave him an encouraging little smile.  | " I 'm sure you can fix it , though . I have every confidence in you . " You 're as bad as all the rest , " he said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody says so . " " I guess I 'd better go talk to Brand , " he said glumly . " There are some things that need to be attended to , and this is likely to take me a few weeks . " " I 'll take care of them for you , dear , " she said reassuringly , reaching up and patting his cheek . " You just run along now . I can manage things here very well while you 're gone . " He stared at her with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach . When he arrived at Vo Mandor on a cloudy morningseveral days later , the situation had deteriorated even further . The forces of Sir Embrig were in the field , encamped not three leagues from Mandorallen 's castle , and Mandorallen and Lelldorin had marched from the city to meet them . Garion thundered up to the gates of his friend 's stout fortress on the war horse he had borrowed from an accommodating baron upon his arrival in Arendia . He wore the full suit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Iron-grip 's enormous sword rode in its scabbard across his back . The gates swung wide for him , and he entered the courtyard , swung awkwardly down from his saddle , and demanded to be taken immediately to the Baroness Nerina . He found her pale-faced and dressed all in black , standing somberly on the battlements , searching the cloudy sky to the east for the telltale columns of smoke which would announce that the battle had begun . " It doth lie upon me , King Belgarion , " she declared almost morbidly . " Strife and discord and anguish hath derived from me since the day I first wed my dear departed lord . " " There 's no need to blame yourself , " Garion told her . " Mandorallen can usually get himself into trouble without help from anyone . When did he and Lelldorin leave ? "  | " Somewhat past noon yesterday , " she replied . " Methinks the battle will be joined ' ere long . " She looked mournfully down at the flagstones of a courtyard lying far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go then , " he said grimly . " Maybe if I can get there before they start , I can head this off . " " I have just had a most excellent thought , your Majesty , " she declared , a bright little smile lighting up her pale face . " I can make thy task much easier . " " I hope somebody can , " he said . ' Ishe way things look right now , I 'm going to be in for a very had morning . " " Make haste then , your Majesty , to the field where rude war even now doth hover above our dear friends , and advise them that the cause of their impending battle hath departed from this sad world . " " I 'm not sure I follow that . " " It is most simple , your Majesty . Since I am the cause of all this strife , it doth lie upon me to end it . " He looked at her suspiciously . " Just what are we talking about here , Nerina ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their senses ? " Her smile became actually radiant . " I have but to hurl myselffrom this lofty battlement , my lord , and join my husband in the silence of the grave to end this dreadful bloodshed before it hath begun . Go quickly , my lord . Descend to that courtyard far below and take to horse . I will descend by this shorter , happier route and await thee upon those rude stones below . Then mayest thou carry the news of my death to the battlefield . Once I am dead , no man 's blood need be spilt over me . " She put one hand on the rough stone of the parapet . " Oh , stop that , " he said in disgust , " and get away from there . " " Ah , nay , your Majesty , " she said quite firmly . " This is the best of all possible answers . At one stroke I can avert this impending battle and rid myself of this burdensome life . "  | " Nerina , " he said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you jump , and that 's all there is to that . " " Surely thou wouldst not be so rude as to lay hands upon my person to prevent me , " she said in a shocked tone of voice . " I wo n't have to , " he said . He looked at her pale , uncomprehendingface and realized that she did not have the faintest idea of what he was talking about . " On second thought , maybe it 's not such a bad idea after all . The trip down to that courtyard is likely to take you about a day and a half , so it should give you time to think this all the way through  --  besides , it might just possibly keep you out of mischief while I 'm gone . " Her eyes went suddenly wide as what he was saying to herseeped ever so slowly into her mind . " Thou wouldst not usesorcery to foil my most excellent solution , " she gasped . " Try me . " She looked at him helplessly , tears coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my Lord , " she accused him . " I was raised on a farm in Sendaria , my Lady , " he reminded her . " I did n't have the advantages of a noble upbringing , so I have these little lapses from time to time . I 'm sure you 'll forgive me for not letting you kill yourself . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to go stop that nonsense out there . " He turned and clanked toward the stairs . " Oh , " he said , looking over his shoulder at her , " do n't get any ideas about jumping as soon as my back 's turned either . I have a long arm , Nerina  --  avery long arm . " She stared at him , her lip trembling . " That 's better , " he said and went on down the stairs . The servants in Mandorallen 's castle took one look at Garion'sstormy face as he strode into the courtyard below and prudently melted out of his path . Laboriously , he hauled himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had arrived , adjusted the great sword of the Rivan Kingp158in its scabbard across his back , and looked around . " Somebody bring me a lance , " he commanded . They brought him several , stumbling over each other in their haste to comply . He selected one and then set off at a thundering gallop . The citizens of the town of Vo Mandor , which lay just beyond the walls of Mandorallen 's keep , were as prudent as the servants within the walls had been . A wide path was opened along the cobblestone streets as the angry King of Riva passed through , and the town gates stood wide open for him . Garion knew that he was going to have to get their attention , and Arends on the verge of battle are notoriously difficult to reach . He would need to startle them with something . As he thundered through the green Arendish countryside , past neat , thatch-roofed villages and groves of beech and maple , he cast an appraising eye toward the gray , scudding clouds overhead , and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . When he arrived , he found the two armies drawn up on opposite sides of a broad , open meadow . As was the age-old Arendish custom , a number of personal challenges had been issued , and those matters were in the process of being settled as a sort of prelude to the grand general melee which would follow . Several armored knights from either side were tilting in the center of the field as the two armies looked on approvingly . Enthusiastically , the brainless , steel-clad young noblescrashed into each other , littering the turf with splinters from the shattered remains of their lances . Garion took in the situation at a single glance , scarcely pausingbefore riding directly into the middle of the fray . It must be admitted that he cheated just a little during the encounter . The lance he carried looked the same as those with which the Mimbrate knights were attempting to kill or maim each other . About the only real difference lay in the fact that his lance , unlike theirs , would not break , no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of nimbus of sheerp159force . Garion had no real desire to run the sharp steel tip of that lance through anybody . He merely wanted them off their horses . On his first course through the center of the startled , milling knights , he hurled three of them from their saddles in rapid succession . Then he wheeled his charger and unhorsedtwo more so quickly that the vast clatter they made as they fell merged into a single sound . It needed a bit more , however , something suitably spectacularto penetrate the solid bone Arends used for heads . Almost negligently , Garion discarded his invincible lance , reached back over his shoulder and drew the mighty sword of the Rivan King . The Orb of Aldur blazed forth its dazzling blue light , and the sword itself immediately burst into flame . As always , despite its vast size , the sword in his hand had no apparent weight , and he wielded it with blinding speed . He drove directly at one startled knight , chopping the amazed man 's lance into foot-long chunks as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the butt remained , Garion smashed the knight from his saddle with the flat of the burning sword . He wheeled then , chopped an upraised mace neatly in two and rode the bearer of the mace into the ground , horse and all . Stunned by the ferocity of his attack , the wide-eyed Mimbrateknights drew back . It was not merely his overwhelming prowess in battle , however , that made them retreat . From between clenched teeth , the King of Riva was swearing sulfurously , and his choice of oaths made strong men go pale . He looked around , his eyes ablaze , then gathered in his will . He raised his flaming sword and pointed it at the roiling sky overhead . " NOW ! " he barked in a voice like the cracking of a whip . The clouds shuddered , almost seeming to flinch as the full force of Belgarion 's will smote them . A sizzling bolt of lightningas thick as the trunk of a mighty tree crashed to earth with a deafening thunderclap that shook the ground for miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turfp160where the bolt had struck . Again and again Garion called down the lightning . The noise of thunder ripped and rolled through the air , and the reek of burning sod and singed earth hung like a cloud over the suddenly terrified armies . Then a great , howling gale struck ; at the same time , the clouds ripped open to inundate the opposing forces in a deluge so intense that many knights were actually hurled from their saddles by the impact . Even as the gale shrieked and the driving downpour struck them , flickering bolts of lightning continued to stagger across the field which separated them , sizzling dreadfully and filling the air with steam and smoke . To cross that field was unthinkable . Grimly , Garion sat his terrified charger in the very midst of that awful display , with the lightning dancing around him . He let it rain on the two armies for several minutes until he was certain that he had their full attention ; then , with a negligentflick of his flaming sword , he turned off the downpour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he announced in a voice as loud as the thunder had been . " Lay down your weaponsat once ! " They stared at him and then distrustfully at each other . " AT ONCE ! " Garion roared , emphasizing his command with yet another lightning bolt and a shattering thunderclap . The clatter of suddenly discarded weapons was enormous . " I want to see Sir Embrig and Sir Mandorallen right here , " Garion said then , pointing with his sword at a spot directly in front of his horse . " Immediately ! " Slowly , almost like reluctant schoolboys , the two steel-clad knights warily approached him . " Just exactly what do the two of you think you 're doing ? " Garion demanded of them . " Mine honor compelled me , your Majesty , " Sir Embrig declared in a faltering voice . He was a stout , florid-faced man of about forty with the purple-veined nose of one who drinks heavily . " Sir Mandorallen hath abducted my kinswoman . " " Thy concern for the lady extendeth only to thy authorityp161over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hast usurped her lands and chattels with churlish disregard for her feelings , and  --  " " All right , " Garion snapped , " that 's enough . Your personal squabble has brought half of Arendia to the brink of war . Is that what you wanted ? Are you such a pair of children that you 're willing to destroy your homeland just to get your own way ? " " But  --  " Mandorallen tried to say . " But nothing . " Garion then proceeded  --  at some length  --  to tell them exactly what he thought of them . His tone was scornful , and his choice of language wide-ranging . The two frequently went pale as he spoke . Then he saw Lelldorin drawing cautiously near to listen . " And you ! " Garion turned his attention to the young Asturian . " What are you doing down here in Mimbre ? " " Me ? Well  --  Mandorallen is my friend , Garion . " " Did he ask for your help ? " " Well  --  " " I did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then Included Lelldorin in his commentary , gesturing often with the burning sword in his right hand . The three watched that ' word with a certain wide-eyed anxiety as he waved it in their ices . " Very well , then , " Garion said after he had cleared the air , " this is what we 're going to do . " He looked belligerently at Sir 1 ? mbrig . " Do you want to fight me ? " he challenged , thrustingout his jaw pugnaciously . Sir Embrig 's face went a pasty white , and his eyes started from his head . " Me , your Majesty ? " he gasped . " Thou wouldst have me take the field against the Godslayer ? " He began to tremble violently . " I did n't think so . " Garion grunted . " Since that 's the case , you 'll immediately relinquish all claim of authority over the liaroness Nerina to me. "  | " Most gladly , your Majesty . " Embrig 's words tumbled over themselves as they came out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight me ? " " ' Thou art my friend , Garion , " Mandorallen protested . " I would die before I raised my hand against thee . " " Good . Then you will turn all territorial claims on behalt of the baroness over to me  --  at once . I am her protector now . ' " I agree to this , " Mandorallen replied gravely . " Sir Embrig , " Garion said then , " I bestow upon you the entirety of the Barony of Vo Ebor  --  including those lands which would normally go to Nerina . Will you accept them ? " " I will , your Majesty . " " Sir Mandorallen , I offer you the hand in marriage of m ward , Nerina of Vo Ebor . Will you accept her ? " " With all my heart , my Lord , " Mandorallen choked , with tears coming to his eyes . " Splendid , " Lelldorin said admiringly . " Shut up , Lelldorin , " Garion told him . " That 's it , then , gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go home  --  and if this breaks out again , I 'll come back . The next time I have to come down here , I 'm going to be very angry . Do we all understand each other ? " Mutely they nodded . That ended the war . The Baroness Nerina , however , raised certain strenuous objections when she was informed of Garion 's decisions upon the return of Mandorallen 's army to Vo Mandor . " Am I some common serf girl to be bestowed upon any man who pleases my lord ? " she demanded with a fine air of high drama . " Are you questioning my authority as your guardian ? " Garionasked her directly . " Nay , my Lord . Sir Embrig hath consented to this . Thou art my guardian now . I must do as thou commandest me . " " Do you love Mandorallen ? " She looked quickly at the great knight and then blushed . " Answer me ! "  | " I do , my Lord , " she confessed in a small voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for years , but when I order you to marry him , you object . " " My Lord , " she replied stiffly , " there are certain proprietiesto be observed . A lady may not be so churlishly disposed of . " And with that she turned her back and stormed away . Mandorallen groaned , and a sob escaped him . " What is it now ? " Garion demanded . " My Nerina and I will never be wed , I fear , " Mandorallen declared brokenly . " Nonsense . Lelldorin , do you understand what this is all about ? " Lelldorin frowned . " I think so , Garion . There are a whole series of rather delicate negotiations and formalities that you 're leaping over here . There 's the question of the dowry , the formal , written consent of the guardian  --  that 's you , of course  --  and probably most important , there has to be a formal proposal  --  with witnesses . " " She 's refusing over technicalities ? " Garion asked incredulously . ' Fechnicalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garion sighed with resignation . This was going to take longer than he had thought . " Come with me , " he told them . Nerina had locked her door and refused to answer Garion 's polite knock . Finally he looked at the stout oak planks barring his way . " Burst ! " he said , and the door blew inward , showeringthe startled lady seated on the bed with splinters . " Now , " Garion said , stepping over the wreckage , " let 's get down to business . How big a dowry do we think would be appropriate ? " Mandorallen was willing  --  more than willing  --  to accept some mere token , but Nerina stubbornly insisted upon somethingsignificant . Wincing slightly , Garion made an offer ac-t eptable to the lady . He then called for pen and ink and scribbled -- with Lelldorin 's aid  --  a suitable document of consent . " Very well , " he said then to Mandorallen , " ask her . "  | " Such proposal doth not customarily come with such unseemlyhaste , your Majesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple to have some time to acquaint themselves with each other . " " You 're already acquainted , Nerina , " he reminded her . " Get on with it . " Mandorallen sank to his knees before his lady , his armor clinking on the floor . " Wilt thou have me as thy husband , Nerina ? " he implored her . She stared at him helplessly . " I have not , my Lord , had time to frame a suitable reply . " " Try yes , ' Nerina , " Garion suggested . " Is such thy command , my Lord ? " " If you want to put it that way . " " I must obey , then . I will have thee , Sir Mandorallenwithall my heart . " " Splendid , " Garion said briskly , rubbing his hands together . " Get up , Mandorallen , and let 's go down to your chapel . We 'll find a priest and get this all formalized by suppertime . " " Surely thou art not proposing such haste , my Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am . I have to get back to Riva and I 'm not going to leave here until the two of you are safely married . Things have a way of going wrong in Arendia if somebodyis n't around to watch them . " " I am not suitably attired , your Majesty , " Nerina protested , looking down at her black dress . " Thou wouldst not have me married in a gown of sable hue ? " " And I , " Mandorallen also objected , " I am still under arms . A man should not approach his wedding clad in steel . " " I do n't have the slightest concern about what either of you is wearing , " Garion informed them . " It 's what 's in your hearts that 's important , not what 's on your backs . " " But  --  " Nerina faltered . " I do not even have a veil . " Garion gave her a long , steady look . Then he cast a quickp165look around the room , picked up a lace doily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 's head . " Charming , " he murmured . " Can anyone think of anything else ? " " A ring ? " Lelldorin suggested hesitantly . Garion turned to stare at him . " You , too ? " he said . " They really ought to have a ring , Garion , " Lelldorin said defensively . Garion considered that for a moment , concentrated , and then forged a plain gold ring out of insubstantial air . " Will this do ? " he asked , holding it out to them . " Might I not be attended ? " Nerina asked in a small , tremblingvoice . " It is unseemly for a noblewoman to be wed withoutthe presence of some lady of suitable rank to support and encourage her . " " Go fetch somebody , " Garion said to Lelldorin . " Whom should I select ? " Lelldorin asked helplessly . " I do n't care . Just bring a lady of noble birth to the chapel  --  even if you have to drag her by the hair . " Lelldorin scurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Mandorallen and Nerina in the slightly dangerous tone that indicated that his patience was wearing very thin . " It is customary for a bridegroom to be accompanied by a close friend , Garion , " Mandorallen reminded him . " Lelldorin will be there , " Garion said , " and so will I. We wo n't let you fall down or faint or run away . " " Might I not have a few small flowers ? " Nerina asked in a plaintive voice . Garion looked at her . " Certainly , " he replied in a deceptivelymild tone . " Hold out your hand . " He then began to create lilies  --  rapidly  --  popping them out of empty air and depositing them one after another in the startled lady 's hand . " Are they the right color , Nerina ? " he asked her . " I can change them if you like  --  purple , perhaps , or chartreuse , or maybe bright blue would suit you . " And then he finally decided that he was not really gettingp166anywhere . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they possibly could . They were both so accustomed to living in the very heart of their colossal tragedy that they were unwilling  --  unable even  --  to give up their mournful entertainment . The solution , of necessity , was going to be entirelyup to him . Knowing that it was a trifle overdramatic , but considering the mental capabilities of the two involved , he drew his sword . " We are all now going directly to the chapel , " he announced , " and the two of you are going to get married . " He pointed at the splintered door with the sword . " Now march ! " he commanded . And so it was that one of the great tragic love stories of all time came at last to a happy ending . Mandorallen and his Nerina were married that very afternoon , with Garion quite literally standing over them with flaming sword to insure that no last-minute hitches could interrupt . On the whole , Garion was rather pleased with himself and with the way he had handled things . His mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riva.  | " Anyway , " Garion was saying as he and Ce'Nedra relaxed in their blue-carpeted sitting room on the evening of his return to Riva , " when we got back to Mandorallen 's castle and told Nerina that it was all right for them to get married , she raised all kinds of objections . " " I always thought she loved him , " Ce'Nedra said . " She does , but she 's been in the very center of this great tragic situation for all these years , and she did n't really want to give that up . She had n't got all that noble suffering out of her system yet . " " Do n't be snide , Garion. "  | " Arends make my teeth ache . First she held out for a dowry  --  a very big one . " " That seems reasonable . " " Not when you consider the fact that I had to pay it . " " You ? Why should you have to pay it ? " " I 'm her guardian , remember ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airs , she haggles like a Drasnian horse trader . By the time she was done , my purse was very lean . And she had to have a formal letter of consent  --  and a veil , a lady to attend her , a ring , and flowers . And I was getting more irritated by the minute . " " Are n't you forgetting something ? " " I do n't think so . " " Did n't Mandorallen propose to her ? " Ce'Nedra leaned forward , her little face very intent . " I 'm certain that she would have insisted on that . " " You 're right , I almost forgot that part . " She shook her head almost sadly . " Oh , Garion , " she said in a disapproving tone . " That came earlier  --  right after the business with the dowry . Anyway , he proposed , and I made her say yes , and then  --  " " Wait a minute , " Ce'Nedra said firmly , holding up one little hand . " Do n't rush through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her ? " Garion scratched his ear . " I 'm not sure I remember , " he confessed . " Try , " she urged him . " Please . " " Let 's see , " he pondered , looking up at the ornately carved wooden beams of the ceiling . " First she objected to having the proposal come before they had gone through all the business of getting acquainted , ' as she put it . I guess she meant all the sneaking around so that they could be alone together in secluded places  --  and the love poems and the flowers and all those calf-eyed looks . " Ce'Nedra gave him a hard little stare . " You know , some/times you can be absolutely infuriating . You 've got about as much sensitivity as a block of wood . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " Never mind . Just tell me what happened next . " " Well , I told her straight off that I was n't having any ofthat nonsense . I said that they were already acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just full of charm , are n't you ? " she said sarcastically . " Ce'Nedra , what is the problem here ? " " Never mind . Just get on with the story . You always dawdle so when you 're telling me about something like this . " " Me ? You 're the one who keeps interrupting . " " Just move along with it , Garion . " He shrugged . " There is n't much more . He asked her ; shesaid yes ; and then I marched them down to the chapel . " " The words , Garion , " she insisted . " The words . Exactlywhat did he say ? " " Nothing very earth-shaking . It went sort of like Wilt thou have me as thy husband , Nerina ? ' " " Oh , " Ce'Nedra said with a catch in her voice . He was astonished to see tears in her eyes . " What 's the matter ? " he demanded . " Never mind , " she replied , dabbing at her eyes with a wispy scrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " She said that she had n't had time to work up a suitable answer , so I told her just to say yes . ' " " And ? " " She said , I will have thee , Sir Mandorallen  --  with all my heart . ' " " Oh , " Ce'Nedra said again , her handkerchief going once more to her brimming eyes . " That 's just lovely . " " If you say so , " he said . " It seemed a little drawn-out to me . " Sometimes you 're hopeless , " she told him . Then shep170sighed a little forlornly . " I never got a formal proposal , " she said . " You most certainly did , " he said indignantly . " Do n't you remember all that ceremony when you and the Tolnedran Ambassador came into the throne room ? " " I did the proposing , Garion , " she reminded him with a toss of her flaming curls . " I presented myself before your throne and asked you if you would consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all there was to it . You never once asked me. " 1 le frowned and thought back . " I must have . " " Not once . " " Well , as long as we got married , anyway , it does n't really matter all that much , does it ? " Her expression turned to ice . He caught that look . " Is it really that important , Ce'Nedra ? " he asked her . " Yes , Garion . It is . " He sighed . " All right then . I guess I 'd better do it . " " Do what ? " " Propose . Will you marry me , Ce'Nedra ? " " Is that the best you can do ? " He gave her a long , steady look . She was , he had to admit , very appealing . She was wearing a pale green dress , all frilly and touched here and there with lace , and she sat rather primly in her chair , looking pouty and discontented . He arose from his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his knees . He took her small hand in both of his and looked imploringly into her face , trying to match the look of fatuous adoration that Mandorallen had worn . " Will her Imperial Highness consent to have me as her husband ? " he asked her . " I can offer little besides an honest , loving heart and boundlessdevotion . " " Are you making fun of me ? " she asked suspiciously . " No. " he said . " You wanted a formal proposal , so I just gave you one . Well ? "  | " Well what ? " " Will you consent to marry me ? " She gave him an arch look , her eyes twinkling . Then she reached out fondly and tousled his hair . " I 'll think about it , " she replied . " What do you mean , you 'll think about it ? " " Who knows ? " she said with a smirk . " I might get a better offer . Do get up , Garion . You 'll make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor like that . " He got to his feet . " Women ! " he said exasperatedly , throwinghis arms in the air . She gave him that tiny , wide-eyed look that at one time , before he had come to recognize it as pure deception , had always made his knees go weak . " Do n't you love me any more ? " she asked in that trembling , dishonest , little-girl voice . " Did n't we decide that we were n't going to do that to each other any more ? " " This is a special occasion , dear , " she replied . And then she laughed , sprang up from her chair , and threw her arms about his neck . " Oh , Garion , " she said , still laughing . " I do love you . " " I certainly hope so , " he said , wrapping his arms around her shoulders and kissing her upturned lips . The following morning Garion dressed rather informally and then tapped on the door to Ce'Nedra 's private sittingroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Garion , " he said . " May I come in ? " His Sendarian good manners had been so deeply ingrained in him that even though he was the King here , he always asked permission before opening the door to someone else 's room . " Of course , " she said . He turned the latch and entered her frilly private domain , a room all pink and pale-green flounces and with yards of rustling satin and brocade drapery . Ce'Nedra 's favorite lady/in-waiting , Arell , rose in some confusion to perform the customarycurtsy . Arell was Brand 's niece , the daughter of his youngest sister , and she was one of several highborn Rivan ladies who attended the queen . She was very nearly the archetypicalAlorn woman , tall , blond , and buxom , with golden braids coiled about her head , deep blue eyes and a complexion like new milk . She and Ce'Nedra were virtually inseparable , and the two spent much of their time with their heads together , whispering and giggling . For some reason , Arell always blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that at all , but privately suspected that Ce'Nedra had told her lady-in-waiting certain things that really should have remained private  --  things that brought a blush to the Rivan girl 's cheeks whenever she looked at him . " I 'm going down into the city , " Garion told his wife . " Did you want anything ? " " I prefer to do my own shopping , Garion , " Ce'Nedra replied , smoothing the front of her satin dressing gown . " You never get things right anyway . " He was about to reply to that , but decided against it . " Whatever you want . I 'll see you at luncheon then . " " As my Lord commands , " Ce'Nedra said with a mockinglittle genuflection . " Stop that . " She made a face at him and then came over and kissed him . Garion turned to Arell . " My Lady , " he said , bowing politely . Arell 's blue eyes were filled with suppressed mirth , and there was a slightly speculative look in them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty , " she said respectfully . As Garion left the royal apartment , he wondered idly what Cc'Nedra had told Arell to cause all those blushes and peculiar looks . He was grateful to the blond girl , however . Her presenceprovided Ce'Nedra with company , which left him free to attend to other matters . Since Aunt Pol had intervened andp173healed the estrangement that had caused them both so much anguish , Ce'Nedra had become very possessive about Garion'sspare time . On the whole he felt that being married was rather nice , but sometimes Ce'Nedra tended to overdo things a bit . In the corridor outside , Brand 's second son , Kail , was waiting , holding a parchment sheet in his hand . " I think this needs your immediate attention , Sire , " he said formally . Although Kail was a warrior , tall and broad-shouldered like his father and his brothers , he was nonetheless a studious man , intelligent and discreet , and he knew enough about Riva and its people to be able to sort through the voluminous petitions , appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important from the trivial . When Garion had first come to the throne , the need for someone to manage the administrativestaff had been painfully clear , and Kail had been the obvious choice for that post . He was about twenty-four years old and wore a neatly trimmed brown beard . The hours he had spent in study had given him a slight squint and a permanentfurrow between his eyebrows . Since he and Garion spent several hours a day together , they had soon become friends , and Garion greatly respected Kail 's judgment and advice . " Is it serious ? " he asked , taking the parchment and glancing at it . " It could be , Sire , " Kail replied . " There 's a dispute over the ownership of a certain valley . The families involved are both quite powerful , and I think we 'll want to settle the matter before things go any further . " " Is there any clear-cut evidence of ownership on either side ? " Kail shook his head . " The two families have used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friction between them lately , however . " " I see , " Garion said . He thought about it . " No matter what I decide , one side or the other is going to be unhappy with me , right ? "  | " Very probably , your Majesty . " " All right , then . We 'll let them both be unhappy . Write up something that sounds sort of official declaring that this valley of theirs now belongs to me . We 'll let them stew about that for a week or so , and then I 'll divide the land right down the middle and give half to each of them . They 'll be so angry with me that they 'll forget that they do n't like each other . I do n't want this island turning into another Arendia . " Kail laughed . " Very practical , Belgarion , " he said . Garion grinned at him . " I grew up in Sendaria , remember ? Oh , keep a strip of the valley  --  about a hundred yards wide right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forbid them to trespass on it . That should keep them from butting heads along the fence line . " He handed the parchmentback to Kail and went on down the corridor , rather pleased with himself . His mission in the city that morning took him to the shop of a young glass blower of his acquaintance , a skilled artisan named Joran . Ostensibly the visit was for the purpose of inspectinga set of crystal goblets he had commissioned as a present for Ce'Nedra . Its real purpose , however , was somewhat more serious . Because his upbringing had been humble , Garion was more aware than most monarchs that the opinions and problems of the common people seldom came to the attention of the throne . He strongly felt that he needed a pair of ears in the city  --  not to spy out unfavorable opinion , but rather to give him a clear , unprejudiced awareness of the real problems of his people . Joran had been his choice for that task . After they had gone through the motions of looking at the goblets , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of Joran 's shop . " I got your note as soon as I got back from Arendia , " Garion said . " Is the matter really that serious ? " " I believe so , your Majesty , " Joran replied . " The tax wasp175poorly thought out , I think , and it 's causing a great deal of unfavorable comment . " " All directed at me , I suppose ? " " You are the king , after all . " " Thanks , " Garion said drily . " What 's the main dissatisfactionwith it ? " " All taxes are odious , " Joran observed , " but they 're bearableas long as everybody has to pay the same . It 's the exclusionthat irritates people . " " Exclusion ? What 's that ? " " The nobility does n't have to pay commercial taxes . Did n't you know that ? " " No . " Garion said . " I did n't . " " The theory was that nobles have other obligations  --  raisingand supporting troops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The crown raises its own army now . If a noblemangoes into trade , though , he does n't have to pay any commercial taxes . The only real difference between him and any other tradesman is that he happens to have a title . His shop is the same as mine , and he spends his time the same way that I do  --  but I have to pay the tax , and he does n't . " " That does n't seem very fair , " Garion agreed . " What makes it worse is that I have to charge higher prices in order to pay the tax , but the nobleman can cut his rates and steal my customers away from me . " " That 's going to have to be fixed , " Garion said . " We 'll eliminate that exclusion . " " The nobles wo n't like it , " Joran warned . " They do n't have to like it , " Garion said flatly . " You 're a very fair king , your Majesty . " " Fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Garion disagreed . " How many nobles are in business here in the city ? " Joran shrugged . " A couple dozen , I suppose . " " And how many other businessmen are there ? " " Hundreds . "  | " I 'd rather have two dozen people hate me than several hundred . " " I had n't thought of it that way , " Joran admitted . " I sort of have to , " Garion said wryly . The following week a series of squalls swept in off the Sea of the Winds , raking the rocky isle with chill gales and tattered sheets of slanting rain . The weather at Riva was never really what one would call pleasant for very long , and these summer storms were so common that the Rivans accepted them as part of the natural order of things . Ce'Nedra , however , had been raised far to the south in the endless sunshineat Tol Honeth , and the damp chill which invaded the Citadel each time the sky turned gray and soggy depressed her spirits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these spells of bad weather by ensconcing herself in a large green velvet armchair by the fire with a warm blanket , a cup of tea , and an oversized book  --  usually an Arendishromance which dwelt fulsomely on impossibly splendidknights and sighing ladies perpetually on the verge of disaster . Prolonged confinement , however , almost always drove her at last from her book in search of other diversions . One midmorning when the wind was moaning in the chimneysand the rain was slashing at the windows , she entered the study where Garion was carefully going over an exhaustive report on wool production on crown lands in the north . The little queen wore an ermine-trimmed gown of green velvet and a discontented expression . " What are you doing ? " she asked . " Reading about wool , " he replied . " Why ? " " I think I 'm supposed to know about it . Everybody stands around talking about wool with these sober expressions on their faces . It seems to be terribly important to them . " " Do you really care that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to pay the bills . "  |p177She  drifted over to the window and stared out at the rain . " Will it never stop ? " she demanded at last . " Eventually , I suppose . " " I think I 'll send for Arell . Maybe we can go down into the city and look around the shops . " " It 's pretty wet out there , Ce'Nedra . " " I can wear a cloak , and a little rain wo n't make me melt . Would you give me some money ? " " I thought I gave you some just last week . " " I spent it . Now I need some more . " Garion put aside the report and went to a heavy cabinet standing against the wall . He took a key from a pocket in his doublet , unlocked the cabinet and pulled out the top drawer . Ce'Nedra came over and looked curiously into the drawer . It was about half-filled with coins , gold , silver , and copper , all jumbled together . " Where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They give it to me from time to time , " he answered . " I throw it in there because I do n't want to carry it around . I thought you knew about it . " " How would I know about it ? You never tell me anything . How much have you got in there ? " He shrugged . " I do n't know . " " Garion ! " Her voice was shocked . " Do n't you even count it ? " " No . Should I ? " " You 're obviously not a Tolnedran . This is n't the whole royal treasury , is it ? " " No . They keep that someplace else . This is just for personalexpenses , I think . " " It has to be counted , Garion . " " I do n't really have the time , Ce'Nedra . " " Well , I do . Pull that drawer out and bring it over to the table . " He did that , grunting slightly at the weight , and then stood smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not realized just how much sheer pleasure she could take in handling and stacking coins . She actually glowed as the merry tinkle of money filled her ears . A few of the coins had become tarnished . She looked at those disapprovinglyand stopped her count to polish them carefully on the hem of her gown . " Were you going to go down into the city ? " he asked , resuminghis seat at the other end of the table . " Not today , I guess . " She kept on counting . A single lock of her hair strayed down across her face , and she absently blew at it from time to time as she concentrated on the task at hand . She dug another handful of jingling coins out of the drawer and began to stack them carefully on the table in front of her . She looked so serious about it that Garion started to laugh . She looked up sharply . " What 's so funny ? " she demanded . " Nothing , dear , " he said and went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the summer wore on , the news from the southernlatitudes continued to be good . King Urgit of Cthol Murgoshad retreated deeper into the mountains , and the advance of the Emperor Kal Zakath of Mallorea slowed even more . The Mallorean army had suffered dreadful losses in its first efforts to pursue the Murgos in that craggy wasteland and it now moved with extreme caution . Garion received the news of the near-stalemate in the south with great satisfaction . Toward the end of summer , word arrived from Algaria that Garion 's cousin Adara had just presented Hettar with their second son . Ce'Nedra went wild with delight and dipped deeply into the drawer in Garion 's study to buy suitable gifts for both mother and child . The news which arrived in early autumn , however , was not so joyous . In a sadly worded letter , General Varana advised them that Ce'Nedra 's father , Emperor Ran Borune XXIII , was sinking fast and that they should make haste to Tol Honeth . Fortunately , the autumn sky remained clear as the shipp179which carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south before a good following breeze . They reached Tol Horb at the broad mouth of the Nedrane within a week and then began rowing upriver to the Imperial Capital at Tol Honeth . They had gone no more than a few leagues when their ship was met by a flotilla of white and gold barges , which formed up around them to escort them to Tol Honeth . Aboard those barges was a chorus of young Tolnedran women who strewed flower petals on the broad surface of the Nedrane and caroled a formal greeting to the Imperial Princess . Garion stood beside Ce'Nedra on the deck of their ship , frowning slightly at this choral welcome . " Is that altogether appropriate ? " he asked . " It 's the custom , " she said . " Members of the Imperial Family are always escorted to the city . " Garion listened to the words of the song . " Have n't they heard about your wedding yet ? " he asked . " They 're greeting the Imperial Princess , not the Rivan Queen . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In a Tolnedran 's eyes , an Imperial Princess is much more important than the queen of some remote island . " The singing continued as they moved on upriver . As the gleaming white city of Tol Honeth came into view , a huge brazen fanfare greeted them from the walls . A detachment of burnished legionnaires , their scarlet pennons snapping in the breeze and the plumes on their helmets tossing , awaited them on the marble quay to escort them through the broad avenues to the grounds of the Imperial Palace . General Varana , a blocky-looking professional soldier with short-cropped , curly hair and a noticeable limp , met them at the palace gate . His expression was somber . " Are we in time , uncle ? " Ce'Nedra asked with an almost frightened note in her voice . The general nodded , then took the little queen in his arms.  | " You 're going to have to be brave , Ce'Nedra , " he told her . " Your father is very , very ill . " " Is there any hope at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We can always hope , " Varana replied , but his tone said otherwise . " Can I see him now ? " " Of course . " The general looked gravely at Garion . " Your Majesty , " he said , nodding . " Your Highness , " Garion replied , remembering that Ce'Nedra 's wily father had " adopted " Varana several years back , and that the general was heir apparent to the Imperial Throne . Varana led them with his limping gait through the marble corridors of the vast palace to a quiet wing and a door flanked by a towering pair of legionnaires in burnished breastplates . As they approached , the heavy door opened quietly , and Lord Morin , the brown-mantled Imperial Chamberlain emerged . Morin had aged since Garion had last seen him , and his concern for his failing Emperor was written clearly on his face . " Dear Morin , " Ce'Nedra said , impulsively embracing her father 's closest friend . " Little Ce'Nedra , " he replied fondly . " I 'm so glad you arrived in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the fact you were coming is all he 's been hanging on to . " " Is he awake ? " Morin nodded . " He dozes a great deal , but he 's still alert most of the time . " Ce'Nedra drew herself up , squared her shoulders and carefullyassumed a bright , optimistic smile . " All right , " she said . " Let 's go in . " Ran Borune lay in a vast canopied bed beneath a goldcoloredcoverlet . He had never been a large man , and his illness had wasted him down to a near-skeleton . His complexionwas not so much pale as it was gray , and his beaklike nose was pinched and rose from his drawn face like the prowp181of a ship . His eyes were closed , and his thin chest seemed almost to flutter as he struggled to breathe . " Father ? " Ce'Nedra said so softly that her voice was hardly more than a whisper . The Emperor opened one eye . " Well , " he said testily , " I see that you finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , " she told him , bending over the bed to kiss his withered cheek . " That 's hardly encouraging , " he grunted . " Now that I 'm here , we 'll have to see about getting you well again . " " Do n't patronize me , Ce'Nedra . My physicians have given up entirely . " " What do they know ? We Borunes are indestructable . " " Did someone pass that law while I was n't looking ? " The Emperor looked past his daughter 's shoulder at his son-inlaw . " You 're looking well , Garion , " he said . " And please do n't waste your time on platitudes by telling me how well I look . I look awful , do n't I ? " " Moderately awful , yes , " Garion replied . Ran Borune flashed him a quick little grin . Then he turned back to his daughter . " Well , Ce'Nedra , " he said pleasantly , " what shall we fight about today ? " " Fight ? Who said we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been looking forward to it . I have n't had a really good fight since you stole my legions that day . " " Borrowed , father , " she corrected primly , almost in spite of herself . " Is that what you call it ? " He winked broadly at Garion . " You should have been there , " he chuckled . " She goaded me into a fit and then pinched my whole army while I was frothing at the mouth . " " Pinched ! " Ce'Nedra exclaimed . Ran Borune began to chuckle , but his laughter turned into a tearing cough that left him gasping and so weak that hep182could not even raise his head . He closed his eyes then and dozed for a while as Ce'Nedra hovered anxiously over him . After a quarter of an hour or so , Lord Morin quietly entered with a small flask and a silver spoon . " It 's time for his medicine , " he said softly to Ce'Nedra . " I do n't think it really helps very much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you , Morin ? " the Emperor asked without opening his eyes . " Yes , Ran Borune . " " Is there any word from Tol Rane yet ? " " Yes , your Majesty . " " What did they say ? " " I 'm afraid the season 's over there , too . " " There has to be one tree somewhere in the world that 's still bearing fruit , " the emaciated little man in the imperial bed said exasperatedly . " His Majesty has expressed a desire for some fresh fruit , " Morin told Ce'Nedra and Garion . " Not just any fruit , Morin , " Ran Borune wheezed . " Cherries . I want cherries . Right now I 'd bestow a Grand Duchy on any man who could bring me ripe cherries . " " Do n't be so difficult , father , " Ce'Nedra chided him . " The season for cherries was over months ago . How about a nice ripe peach ? " " I do n't want peaches . I want cherries ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're an undutiful daughter , Ce'Nedra , " he accused her . Garion leaned forward and spoke quietly to Ce'Nedra . " I 'll be right back , " he told her and went out of the room with Morin . In the corridor outside they met General Varana . " How is he ? " the general asked . " Peevish , " Garion replied . " He wants some cherries . " " I know , " Varana said sourly . " He 's been asking for themfor weeks . Trust a Borune to demand the impossible . " " Are there any cherry trees here on the palace grounds ? " " There are a couple in his private garden . Why ? "  | " I thought I might have a word with them , " Garion said innocently , " explain a few things , and give them a bit of encouragement . " Varana gave him a look of profound disapproval . " It 's not really immoral , " Garion assured him . Varana raised one hand and turned his face away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pained voice , " do n't try to explain it to me . I do n't even want to hear about it . If you 're going to do it , just do it and get it over with , but please do n't try to convince me that it 's in any way natural or wholesome . " " All right , " Garion agreed . " Which way did you say that garden was ? " It was n't really difficult , of course . Garion had seen Belgaraththe Sorcerer do it on many occasions . It was no more than ten minutes later that he returned to the corridor outside the sickroom with a small basket of dark purple cherries . Varana looked steadily at the basket , but said nothing . Garionquietly opened the door and went inside . Ran Borune lay propped on his pillows , his drawn face saggingwith exhaustion . " I do n't see why not , " he was saying to Ce'Nedra . " A respectful daughter would have presented her father with a half-dozen grandchildren by now . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why is everyone so worried about it ? " " Because it 's important , Ce'Nedra . Not even you could be so silly as to  --  " He broke off , staring incredulously at the basket in Garion 's hand . " Where did you get those ? " he demanded . " I do n't think you really want to know , Ran Borune . It 's the kind of thing that seems to upset Tolnedrans for some reason . " You did n't just make them , did you ? " the emperor asked suspiciously . " No . It 's much harder that way . I just gave the trees in your garden a little encouragement , that 's all . They were very co-operative . "  | " What an absolutely splendid fellow you married , Ce'Nedra , " Ran Borune exclaimed , eying the cherries greedily . " Put those right here , my boy . " He patted the bed at his side . Ce'Nedra flashed her husband a grateful little smile , took the basket from him , and deposited it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the cherries and popped it into her mouth . " Ce'Nedra ! You stop eating my cherries ! " " Just checking to see if they 're ripe , father . " " Any idiot can see that they 're ripe , " he said , clutching the basket possessively to his side . " If you want any , go get your own . " He carefully selected one of the plump , glowing cherriesand put it in his mouth . " Marvelous , " he said , chewing happily . " Do n't spit the seeds on the floor like that , father , " Ce'Nedra reproved him . " It 's my floor , " he told her . " Mind your own business . Spitting the seeds is part of the fun . " He ate several more cherries . " We wo n't discuss how you came by these , Garion , " he said magnanimously . " Technically , it 's a violation of Tolnedranlaw to practice sorcery anywhere in the Empire , but we 'll let it pass  --  just this once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garion said . " I appreciate that . " After he had eaten about half of the cherries , the Emperor smiled and sighed contentedly . " I feel better already , " he said . " Ce'Vanne used to bring me fresh cherries in that same kind of basket . " " My mother , " Ce'Nedra said to Garion . Ran Borune 's eyes clouded over . " I miss her , " he said very quietly . " She was impossible to live with , but I miss her more every day . " " I scarcely remember her , " Ce'Nedra said wistfully . " I remember her very well , " her father said . " I 'd give my whole Empire if I could see her face just one more time . "  |p185Ce'Nedra  took his wasted hand in hers and looked imploringlyat Garion . " Could you ? " she asked , two great tears standing in her eyes . " I 'm not entirely sure , " he replied in some perplexity . " I think I know how it 's done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to  --  " He broke off , still trying to work it out in his mind . " I 'm sure Aunt Pol could do it , but  --  " He came to the bedside . " We can try , " he said . He took Ce'Nedra 's other hand and then Ran Borune 's , linking the three of them together . It was extremely difficult . Ran Borune 's memory was clouded by age and his long illness , and Ce'Nedra 's remembranceof her mother was so sketchy that it could hardly be said to exist at all . Garion concentrated , bending all his will upon it . Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead as he struggled to gather all those fleeting memories into one single image . The light coming in through the flimsy curtains at the windowseemed to darken as if a cloud had passed over the sun , and there was a faint , far-off tinkling sound , as if of small , golden bells . The room was suddenly filled with a kind of woodland fragrance  --  a subtle smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded a bit more , and the tinkling and the odor grew stronger . And then there was a hazy , nebulous luminosity in the air at the foot of the dying Emperor 's bed . The glow grew brighter , and she was there . Ce'Vanne had been a bit taller than her daughter , but Garion saw instantly why Ran Borune had always so doted on his only child . The hair was precisely the same deep auburn ; the complexion was that same goldentingedolive ; and the eyes were of that exact same green . The face was willful , certainly , but the eyes were filled with love . The figure came silently around the bed , reaching out briefly in passing to touch Ce'Nedra 's face with lingering , phantom fingertips . Garion could suddenly see the source of that small bell sound . Ce'Nedra 's mother wore the two goldenp186acorn earrings of which her daughter was so fond , and the two tiny clappers inside them gave off that faint , musical tinkle whenever she moved her head . For no particular reason , Garionremembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table back at Riva . Ce'Vanne reached out her hand to her husband . Ran Borune'sface was filled with wonder , and his eyes with tears . " Ce'Vanne , " he said in a trembling whisper , struggling to raise himself from his pillow . He pulled his shaking hand free from Garion 's grasp and reached out toward her . For a moment their hands seemed to touch , and then Ran Borune gave a long , quavering sigh , sank back on his pillows , and died . Ce'Nedra sat for a long time holding her father 's hand as the faint , woodland smell and the echo of the little golden bells slowly subsided from the room and the light from the window returned . Finally she placed the wasted hand gently back on the coverlet , rose , and looked around the room with an almost casual air . " It 's going to have to be aired out , of course , " she said absently . " Maybe some cut flowers to sweetenthe air . " She smoothed the coverlet at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she turned . " Oh , Garion , " she wailed , suddenly throwing herself into his arms . Garion held her , smoothing her hair and feeling the shaking of her tiny body against him and looking all the while at the still , peaceful face of the Emperor of Tolnedra . It may have been some trick of the light , but it almost seemed that there was a smile on Ran Borune 's lips.  |p187The  state funeral for Emperor Ran Borune XXIII of the Third Borune Dynasty took place a few days later in the Temple of Nedra , Lion God of the Empire . The temple was a huge marble building not far from the Imperial Palace . The altar was backed by a vast fan of pure , beaten gold , with the head of a lion in its center . Directly in front of the altar stood the simple marble bier of Ce'Nedra 's father . The late Emperor lay in calm repose , covered from the neck down by a cloth of gold . The column-lined inner hall of the temple was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vied with one another , not so much to pay their respects top188Ran Borune , but rather to display the opulence of their clothingand the sheer weight of their personal adornment . Garion and Ce'Nedra , both dressed in deepest mourning , sat beside General Varana at the front of the vast hall as the eulogies were delivered . Tolnedran politics dictated that a representative of each of the major houses should speak upon this sad occasion . The speeches , Garion suspected , had been prepared long in advance . They were all quite flowery and tiresome , and each one seemed to be directed at the point that , although Ran Borune was gone , the Empire lived on . Many of the speakers seemed quite smug about that . When the eulogies had at last been completed , the whiterobedHigh Priest of Nedra , a pudgy , sweating man with a grossly sensual mouth , arose and stepped to the front of the altar to add his own contribution . Drawing upon events in the life of Ran Borune , he delivered a lengthy homily on the advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked by the High Priest 's choice of subject matter , but the rapt faces of the throng in the temple told him that a sermon about money was very moving to a Tolnedran congregationand that the High Priest , by selecting such a topic , was able thereby to slip in any number of laudatory comments about Ce'Nedra 's father . Once all the tedious speeches were completed , the little Emperor was laid to rest beside his wife under a marble slab in the Borune section of the catacombs beneath the temple . The so-called mourners then returned to the main temple hall to express their condolences to the bereaved family . Ce'Nedra bore up well , though she was very pale . On one occasion she swayed slightly , and Garion , without thinking , reached out to support her . " Do n't touch me ! " she whispered sharply under her breath , raising her chin sharply . " What ? " Garion was startled . " We can not show any sign of weakness in the presence of our enemies . I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Vordues . My father would rise from his grave in disgust if I did . " The nobles of all the great houses continued to file past to offer their extensive and obviously counterfeit sympathy to the sable-gowned little Rivan Queen . Garion found their halfconcealedsmirks contemptible and their barbed jibes disgusting . His face grew more stern and disapproving as the moments passed . His threatening presence soon dampened the enjoyment of the Grand Dukes and their ladies and sycophants . The Tolnedrans were genuinely afraid of this tall , mysterious Alorn monarch who had come out of nowhere to assume Riva 's throne and to shake the very earth with his footsteps . Even as they approached Ce'Nedra to deliver their poisonous observations , his cold , grim face made them falter , and many carefully prepared impertinences went unsaid . At last , disgusted so much that even his Sendarian good manners deserted him , he placed his hand firmly on his wife 's elbow . " We will leave now , " he said to her in a voice which could be clearly heard by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place has turned a trifle rancid . " Ce'Nedra cast him one startled glance , then lifted her chin in her most regal and imperious manner , laid her hand lightly on his arm , and walked with him toward the huge bronze doors . The silence was vast as they moved with stately pace through the throng , and a wide path opened for them . " That was very nicely done , dear , " Ce'Nedra complimentedhim warmly as they rode in the gold-inlaid imperial carriage back toward the palace . " It seemed appropriate , " he replied . " I 'd reached the point where I either had to say something rather pointed or turn the whole lot of them into toads . " " My , what an enchanting thought , " she exclaimed . " We could go back , if you want . " When Varana arrived back at the palace an hour or so later , he was positively gloating . " Belgarion , " he said with a broad grin , " you 're a splendid young fellow , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire nobilityof northern Tolnedra . " " Which word was that ? " " Rancid . " " I 'm sorry about that one . " " Do n't be . It perfectly describes them . " " It is a bit coarse , though . " " Not under the circumstances . It did manage to make you any number of lifelong enemies , however . " " That 's all I need , " Garion replied sourly . " Give me just a few more years , and I 'll have enemies in all parts of the world . " " A king is n't really doing his job if he does n't make enemies , Belgarion . Any jackass can go through life without offendingpeople . " " Thanks . " There had been some uncertainty about which course Varanawould follow once Ran Borune was gone . His " adoption " by the late Emperor had clearly been a ruse with very little in the way of legality to back it up . The candidates for the throne , blinded by their own lust for the Imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a kind of caretaker until the question of the succession had been settled in the usual fashion . The issue remained in doubt until his official coronation , which took place two days after Ran Borune 's funeral . The gloating exultation among the contenders for the throne was almost audible when the general limped into the Temple of Nedra dressed in his uniform , rather than the traditional gold mantle which only the Emperor was allowed to wear . Obviouslythis man did not intend to take his elevation seriously . It might cost a bit to bribe him , but the way to the Imperial Palace was still open . The grins were broad as Varana , gleamingin his gold-inlaid breastplate , approached the altar . The pudgy High Priest bent forward for a moment of whisperedconsultation . Varana replied , and the ecclesiast 's facep191suddenly went deathly pale . Trembling violently , he opened the gold and crystal cask on the altar and removed the jewelencrustedImperial Crown . Varana 's short-cropped hair was annointed with the traditional ungent , and the High Priest raised the crown with shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice almost squeaky with fright . "  --  I crown thee Emperor Ran Borune XXIV , Lord of all Tolnedra . " It took a moment for that to sink in . Then the temple was filled with howls of anguished protest as the Tolnedran nobilitygrasped the fact that by the choice of his imperial name , Varana was clearly announcing that he intended to keep the crown for himself . Those howls were cut off sharply as the Tolnedran legionnaires , who had quietly filed into place along the colonnade surrounding the main temple floor , drew their swords with a huge , steely rasp . The gleaming swords raised in salute . " Hail Ran Borune ! " the legions thundered . " Hail Emperor of Tolnedra ! " And that was that . That evening as Garion , Ce'Nedra , and the newly crowned Emperor sat together in a crimson-draped private chamber filled with the golden glow of dozens of candles , Varana exclaimed . " Surprise is as important in politics as it is in military tactics , Belgarion . If your opponent does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he can prepare countermeasures . " The general now openly wore the gold mantle of the Emperor . " That makes sense , " Garion replied , sipping at a goblet of Tolnedran wine . " Wearing your breastplate instead of the ImperialMantle kept them guessing right up until the last minute . " " That was for a much more practical reason . " Varana laughed . " Many of those young nobles have had military training , and we teach our legionnaires how to throw daggers . Since my back was going to be toward them , I wanted a good , solid layer of steel covering the area between my shoulder blades . " " Tolnedran politics are very nervous , are n't they ? "  |p192Varana  nodded his agreement . " Fun , though , " he added . " You have a peculiar notion of fun . I 've had a few daggersthrown at me and I did n't find it all that amusing . " " We Anadiles have always had a peculiar sense of humor . " " Borune , uncle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You 're a Borune now , not an Anadile  --  and you should start acting like one . " " Bad-tempered , you mean ? That 's not really in my nature . " " Ce'Nedra could give you lessons , if you like , " Garion offered , grinning fondly at his wife . " What ? " Ce'Nedra exclaimed indignantly , her voice going up an octave or so . " I suppose she could at that , " Varana agreed blandly . " She 's always been very good at it . " Ce'Nedra sighed mournfully , eyeing the pair of grinning monarchs . Then her expression became artfully tragic . " What 's a poor little girl to do ? " she asked in a trembling voice . " Here I am , maltreated and abused by both my husband and my brother . " Varana blinked . " You know , I had n't even thought of that . You are my sister now , are n't you ? " " Perhaps you are n't quite as clever as I thought , brother dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Garion 's not quite bright , but I thought better of you . " Garion and Varana exchanged rueful glances . " Would you gentlemen like to play some more ? " Ce'Nedra asked them , her eyes twinkling and a smug smile hovering about her lips . There was a light tap on the door . " Yes ? " Varana said . " Lord Morin to see you , your Majesty , " the guard outside the door announced . " Send him in , please . " The Imperial Chamberlain entered quietly . His face wasp193marked by the sorrow he felt at the passing of the man he had served so long and faithfully , but he still performed his duties with the quiet efficiency that had always been his **25;15249;TOOLONG . " Yes , Morin ? " Varana said . " There 's someone waiting outside , your Majesty . She 's rather notorious , so I thought I should speak to you privately before I presented her to you . " " Notorious ? " " It 's the courtesan Bethra , your Majesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's been  --  ahshallwe say , useful to the crown in the past . She has access to a great deal of information as a result of her professional activities and she was a longtime friend of Ran Borune 's . From time to time she kept him advised of the activities of certain unfriendly nobles . He made arrangements for there to be a way by which she could enter the palace unnoticed so that they could  --  ah  --  talk , among other things . " " Why , that sly old fox . " " I have never known her information to be inaccurate , your Majesty , " Morin continued . " She says she has something very important to tell you . " " You 'd better bring her in , then , Morin , " Varana said , " With you permission , of course , dear sister , " he added to Ce'Nedra . " Certainly , " Ce'Nedra agreed , her eyes afire with curiosity . When Morin brought the woman in , she was wearing a light , hooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , she reached up and pushed the hood back , Garion started slightly . He knew her . He recalled that when he and Aunt Pol and the others had been passing through Tol Honeth during their pursuit of Zedar the Apostate and the stolen Orb , this same woman had accosted Silk for a bantering exchange . As she unfastened the neck of her cloak and let it slide almost sensuously from her creamy shoulders , he saw that she had not changed in the nearly ten years since he had last seen her.  |p194Her  lustrous , blue-black hair was untouched by any hint of gray . Her startlingly beautiful face was still as smooth as a girl 's , and her heavy-lidded eyes were still filled with a sultry wickedness . Her gown was of palest lavender and cut in such a way as to enhance rather than conceal the lush , almost overripebody it enclosed . It was the kind of body that was a direct challenge to every man she met . Garion stared openly at her until he caught Ce'Nedra 's green eyes , agate-hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your Majesty , " Bethra said in a throaty contralto as she curtsied gracefully to the new Emperor , " I would have waited a time before introducing myself , but I 've heard a few things I thought you should know immediately . " " I appreciate your friendship , Lady Bethra , " Varana replied with exquisite courtesy . She laughed a warm , wicked laugh . " I 'm not a lady , your Majesty , " she corrected him . " Most definitely not a lady . " She made a small curtsy to Ce'Nedra . " Princess , " she murmured . " Madame , " Ce'Nedra responded with a faint chill in her voice and a very slight inclination of her head . " Ah , " Bethra said almost sadly . Then she turned back to Varana . " Late this afternoon I was entertaining Count Ergon and the Baron Kelbor at my establishment . " " A pair of powerful Honethite nobles , " Varana explained to Garion . " The gentlemen from the house of Honeth are less than pleased with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethracontinued . " They spoke hastily and in some heat , but I think that you might want to take what they said seriously . Ergon is an unmitigated ass , all bluster and pomposity , but Baron Kelbor is not the sort to be taken lightly . At any rate , they concluded that , with the legions all around the palace , it would be unlikely that an assassin could reach you ; but then Kelbor said , If you want to kill a snake , you cut off its tailp195just behind the head . We ca n't reach Varana , but we can reach his son . Without an heir , Varana 's line dies with him . ' " " My son ? " Varana said sharply . " His life is in danger , your Majesty . I thought you should know . " " Thank you , Bethra , " Varana replied gravely . Then he turned to Morin . " Send a detachment of the third legion to my son 's house , " he said . " No one is to go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements . " " At once , your Majesty . " " I would also like to speak with the two gentlemen from the House of Honeth . Send some troops to invite them to the palace . Have them wait in that little room adjoining the torture chamber down in the dungeons until I have the time to discuss this with them . " " You would n't , " Ce'Nedra gasped . " Probably not , " Varana admitted , " but they do n't have to know that , do they ? Let 's give them a nervous hour or two . " " I 'll see to it immediately , your Majesty , " Morin said . He bowed and quietly left the room . " I 'm told that you knew my father , " Ce'Nedra said to thelushly curved woman standing in the center of the room . " Yes , Princess , " Bethra responded . " Quite well , actually . We were friends for years . " Ce'Nedra 's eyes narrowed . " Your father was a vigorous man , Princess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many people prefer not to believe that kind of thing about their parents , but it does happen now and again . I was quite fond of him and I 'll miss him very much , I think . " " I do n't believe you , " Ce'Nedra said bluntly . " That 's up to you , of course . " " My father would not have done that . " " Whatever you say , Princess , " Bethra said with a faint smile . " You 're lying ! " Ce'Nedra snapped.  |p196A  momentary glint came into Bethra 's eyes . " No , Princess . I do n't lie . I might conceal the truth at times , but I never lie . Lies are too easily found out . Ran Borune and I were intimate friends and we enjoyed each other 's company in many ways . " Her look became faintly amused . " Your upbringing has shelteredyou from certain facts , Princess Ce'Nedra . Tol Honeth is an extremely corrupt city , and I am fully at home here . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I make no apology for that fact . The work is easy  --  even pleasant at times  --  and the pay is very good . I 'm on the best of terms with some of the richest and most powerful men in the world . We talk , and they value my conversation , but when they come to my house , it 's not the talk they 're interested in . The talk comes later . It was much the same when I visited your father . We did talk , Princess , but it was usually later . " Ce'Nedra 's face was flaming , and her eyes were wide with shock . " No one has ever talked to me that way before , " she gasped . " Then it was probably overdue , " Bethra said calmly . " You 're much wiser now  --  not happier , perhaps , but wiser . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I should probably leave . The Honethshave spies everywhere , and I think it might not be a good idea for them to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you for the information you 've just brought me , Bethra , " Varana said to her . " Let me give you something for your trouble . " " That has never been necessary , your Majesty , " she replied with an arch little smile . " Information is not what I sell . I 'll go now  --  unless you want to talk business , of course . " She paused in the act of putting her cloak back on and gave him a very direct look . " Ah  --  this might not be the best time , Bethra , " Varana said with a faintly regretful note in his voice and a quick sidelong glance at Ce'Nedra . " Some other time then , perhaps . " She curtsied again andp197quietly left the room , the musky fragrance of the scent she wore lingering in the air behind her . Ce'Nedra was still blushing furiously , and her eyes were outraged . She spun to face Garion and Varana . " Do n't either of you dare say anything , " she commanded . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honeth ended a few days later , and Garion and Ce'Nedra took ship again for the voyage back to the Isle of the Winds . Though Ce'Nedra seldom gave any outward hints of her grief , Garion knew her well enough to understand that her father 's death had hurt her deeply . Becausehe loved her and was sensitive to her emotions , he treated her with a certain extra tenderness and consideration for the next several months . In midautumn that year , the Alorn Kings and Queen Porenn , Regent of Drasnia , arrived at Riva for the traditional meeting of the Alorn Council . The meeting had none of the urgency which had marked those meetings previously . Torak was dead , the Angaraks were convulsed by war , and a king sat upon the Rivan throne . The entire affair was almost purely social , though the kings did make some pretense at holding business sessions in the blue-draped council chamber high in the south tower of the Citadel . They gravely talked about the stalemated war in southern Cthol Murgos and about the troublesVarana was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the failure of the Honeths in their attemptsat assassination , the Vordues decided to try secession . Shortly after Varana 's coronation as Ran Borune XXIV , the Vordue family declared that their Grand Duchy was no longer a part of Tolnedra but rather was a separate , independent kingdom  --  although they had not yet decided which of their number was to ascend the throne . " Varana 's going to have to move the legions against them , " King Anheg declared , wiping the ale foam from his mouthp198with his sleeve . " Otherwise , the other families will seceed too , and Tolnedra will fly apart like a broken spring . " " It 's not really that simple , Anheg , " Queen Porenn told him smoothly , turning back from the window out of which she had been watching the activity in the harbor far below . The Queen of Drasnia still wore deep mourning , and her black gown seemed to enhance her blonde loveliness . " The legions will gladly fight any foreign enemy , but Varana ca n't ask them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could bring up legions from the south . They 're all Borunes or Anadiles or Ranites . They would n't mind trampling over the Vordues . " " But then the northern legions would step in to stop them . Once the legions start fighting each other , the Empire will really disintegrate . " " I guess I really had n't thought of it that way , " Anheg admitted . " You know , Porenn , you 're extremely intelligent  --  for a woman . " " And you 're extremely perceptive  --  for a man , " she replied with a sweet smile . " That 's one for her side , " King Cho-Hag said quietly . " Were we keeping score ? " Garion asked mildly . " It helps us to keep track , sort of , " the Chief of the ClanChiefsof Algaria answered with a straight face . It was not until several days later that word reached Riva concerning Varana 's rather novel approach to his problem with the Vordues . A Drasnian ship sailed into the harbor one morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheaf of dispatches to Queen Porenn . After she read them , she entered the council chamber with a smug little smile . " I believe we can set our minds at rest about Varana 's abilities , gentlemen , " she told the Alorn Kings . " He appears to have found a solution to the Vordue question . " " Oh ? " Brand rumbled . " What is it ? " " My informants advise me that he has made a secret arrangement with King Korodullin of Arendia . This so-calledp199Kingdom of Vordue has suddenly become absolutely infested with Arendish bandits  --  most of them in full armor , oddly enough . " " Wait a minute , Porenn , " Anheg interrupted . " If it 's a secretarrangement , how is it that you know about it ? " The little blonde Queen of Drasnia lowered her eyelids demurely . " Why , Anheg , dear , were n't you aware of the fact that I know everything ? " " Another one for her side , " King Cho-Hag said to Garion . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At any rate , " the Drasnian Queen continued , " there are now whole battalions of brainless young Mimbrate knights in Vordue , all posing as bandits and plundering and burning at will . The Vordues do n't have what you could call an army , so they 've been screaming for aid from the legions . My people managed to get their hands on a copy of Varana 's reply . " She unfolded a document . " To the government of the Kingdom of Vordue , ' " she read , " ' Greetings : Your recent appeal for help came as a great surprise to me . Surely the esteemed gentlemen in Tol Vordue would not want me to violate the sovereignty of their newly established kingdom by sending Tolnedran legions across their borders to deal with a few Arendishbrigands . The maintenance of public order is the paramountresponsibility of any government , and I would not dream of intruding my forces into so fundamental an area . To do so would raise grave doubts in the minds of reasonable men the world over as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , send you my best wishes in your efforts to deal with what is , after all , a strictly internal matter . ' " Anheg began to laugh , pounding his heavy fist on the table in his glee . " I think that calls for a drink , " he chortled . " I think it might call for several , " Garion agreed . " We can toast the efforts of the Vordues to maintain order . " " I trust you gentlemen will excuse me then , " Queen Porennsaid . " No mere woman could ever hope to compete with the Kings of Aloria when it comes to really serious drinking . "  | " Of course , Porenn , " Anheg agreed magnanimously . " We 'll even drink your share for you . " " You 're too kind , " she murmured and withdrew . Much of the evening that followed was lost in a hazy fog of ale fumes for Garion . He seemed to remember weaving down a corridor with Anheg on one side and Brand on the other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , and they staggered in a peculiar kind of unison . He also seemed to remember that they were singing . When he was sober , Garion never sang . That night , however , it seemed like the most natural and enjoyable thing in the world . He had not been drunk before . Aunt Pol had always disapproved of drinking , and , as he did in most things , he had deferred to her opinions about the matter . Thus , he was totally unprepared for the way he felt the next morning . Ce'Nedra was unsympathetic , to say the very least . Like every woman who had ever lived since the beginning of time , she smugly enjoyed her husband 's suffering . " I told you that you were drinking too much , " she reminded him . " Please do n't , " he said , holding his head between his hands . " It 's your own fault , " she smirked . " Just leave me alone , " he begged . " I 'm trying to die . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You might wish you could , but you wo n't . " " Do you have to talk so loud ? " " We all just loved your singing , " she congratulated him brightly . " I actually think you invented notes that did n't even exist before . " Garion groaned and once more buried his face between his trembling hands . The Alorn Council lasted for perhaps another week . It might have continued longer had not a savage autumn storm announced with a howling gale that it was time for the assembledguests to return to the mainland while the Sea of the Winds was still navigable.  |p201Not  too many days later , Brand , the tall , aging Rivan Warder , requested a private audience with Garion . It was raining gustily outside , and sheets of water intermittently clawed at the windows of Garion 's study as the two men sat down in comfortable chairs across the table from each other . " May I speak frankly , Belgarion ? " the big , sad-eyed man asked . " You know you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a personal one . I do n't want you to be offended . " " Say what you think needs to be said . I promise not to be offended . " Brand glanced out the window at the gray sky and the winddrivenrain . " Belgarion , it 's been almost eight years now since you married Princess Ce'Nedra . " Garion nodded . " I 'm not trying to intrude on your privacy , but the fact that your wife has not yet produced an heir to the throne is , after all , a state matter . " Garion pursed his lips . " I know that you and Anheg and the others are very concerned . I think your concern is premature , though . " " Eight years is a long time , Belgarion . We all know how much you love your wife . We 're all fond of her . " Brand smiled briefly . " Even though she 's a little difficult at times . " " You 've noticed . " " We followed her willingly to the battlefield at TullMardu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but Ithink we 'd better face the possibility that she may be barren . " " I 'm positive that she 's not , " Garion said firmly . " Then why is n't she having children ? " Garion could n't answer that . " Belgarion , the fate of this kingdom  --  and of all Aloriahangson your weakest breath . There 's virtually no other topic of conversation in all the northern kingdoms . " " I did n't know that , " Garion admitted . " Grodeg and his henchmen were virtually wiped out atp202Thull Mardu , but there 's been a resurgence of the Bear-cult in remote parts of Cherek , Drasnia , and Algaria . You knew that , did n't you ? " Garion nodded . " And even in the cities there are those elements that sympathize with the cult 's aims and beliefs . Those people were not happy that you chose a Tolnedran princess for your wife . Rumors are already abroad that Ce'Nedra 's inability to have children is a sign of Belar 's disapproval of your marriage to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course it is , but if that kind of thinking begins to take hold , it 's ultimately going to have some unpleasant effects . Other elements in Alorn society  --  friendly to you  --  are very concerned about it . To put it bluntly , there 's a rather widely held opinion that the time has come for you to divorce Ce'Nedra . " ' What ? " " You do have that power , you know . The way they all see it , the best solution might be for you to put aside your barren Tolnedran queen and take some nice , fertile Alorn girl , who 'll present you with babies by the dozen . " " That 's absolutely out of the question , " Garion said hotly . " I wo n't do it . Did n't those idiots ever hear about the Accords of Vo Mimbre ? Even if I wanted to divorce Ce'Nedra , I could n't . Our marriage was agreed upon five hundred ears ago . " " The Bear-cult feels that the arrangement was forced on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Since those two are loyal to Aldur , the cult feels that it might have been done without Belar 's approval . " " Nonsense , " Garion snapped . " There 's a lot of nonsense in any religion , Belgarion . The point remains , however , that Ce'Nedra has few friends in any part of Alorn society . Even those who are friendly to you are n't very fond of her . Both your enemies and your friends wouldp203like to see you divorce her . They all know how fond of her you are , so they 'll probably never approach you with the idea . They 're likely to take more direct action instead . " " Such as ? " " Since they know that you ca n't be persuaded to divorce her , someone may try to remove her permanently . " " They would n't dare ! " " Alorns are almost as emotional as Arends are , Balgarionandsometimes almost as thick-headed . We 're all aware of it . Anheg and Cho-Hag both urged me to warn you about this possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on it so that we 'll at least have some advance warning if someone starts plotting against the queen . " " And just where do you stand in this , Brand ? " Garion asked quietly . " Belgarion , " the big man said firmly , " I love you as if you were my own son , and Ce'Nedra is as dear to me as the daughterI never had . Nothing in this world would make me happier than to see the floor of that nursery next to your bedroom absolutely littered with children . But it 's been eight years . Things have reached the point where we must do something  --  iffor no other reason , then to protect that tiny , brave girl we both love . " " What can we do ? a woman does or does not have children ? And that 's the crux of the whole situation . I implore you , Garion  --  I beg you -- send for Polgara . We need her advice and help  --  and we need it now . " After the Warder had quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rain . All in all , he decided that it might be wiser not to tell Ce'Nedra about the conversation . He did not want to frighten her with talk of assassins lurking in the dim corridors , and any hint that political expediency might compel consideration of divorce would not be well received . After carefulthought , he concluded that the best course would be justp204to keep his mouth shut and send for Aunt Pol . Unfortunately , he had forgotten something rather important . When he entered the cheery , candlelit royal apartment that evening , he wore a carefully assumed smile designed to indicate that nothinguntoward had happened during the day . The frosty silence which greeted him should have warned him ; even had he missed that danger sign , he certainly should have noticed the scars on the door casing and the broken shards of several vases and assorted porcelain figurines that lay in the corners where they had been missed in the hasty clean-up following an explosion of some sort . The Rivan King , however , sometimes tended to be slightly unobservant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy little wife in a cheerfulvoice . " Really ? " " How did your day go ? " She turned to regard him with a look filled with daggers . " How can you possibly have the nerve to ask that ? " Garion blinked . " Tell me , " she said , " just when is it that I am to be put aside so that my Lord can marry the blonde-headed brood sow who 's going to replace me in my Lord 's bed and fill the entire Citadel with litters of runny-nosed Alorn brats ? " " How  --  ? " " My Lord appears to have forgotten the gift he chained about my neck when we were betrothed , " she said . " My Lord also appears to have forgotten just exactly what Beldaran 's amulet can do . " " Oh , " Garion said , suddenly remembering . " Oh , my . " " Unfortunately , the amulet wo n't come off , " Ce'Nedra told him bitingly . " You wo n't be able to give it to your next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off so that you can reclaim it . " " Will you stop that ? " " As my Lord commands me . Did you plan to ship me backp205to Tolnedra  --  or am I just to be shoved out the front gate into the rain and left to fend for myself ? " " You heard the discussion I had with Brand , then , I take it . , , " Obviously . " " If you heard part of it , then I 'm sure you heard it all . Brand was only reporting a danger to you caused by the absurd notions of a group of frothing fanatics . " " You should not have even listened to him . " " When he 's trying to warn me that somebody might attempt to kill you ? Ce'Nedra , be serious . " " The thought is there now , Garion , " she said accusingly . " Now you know that you can get rid of me any time you want . I 've seen you ogling those empty-headed Alorn girls with theirlong blonde braids and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which one will you choose ? " " Are you about finished with all of this ? " Her eyes narrowed . " I see , " she said . " Now I 'm not merely barren , I 'm also hysterical . " " No , you 're just a little silly now and then , that 's all . " ' Silly ? " " Everybody 's silly once in a while , " he added quite calmly . " It 's part of being human . I 'm actually a little surprised that you are n't throwing things . " She threw a quick , guilty glance in the direction of some of the broken fragments in the corner . " Oh , " he said , catching the glance . " You did that earlier , I see . I 'm glad I missed that part . It 's hard to try to reason with somebody when you 're dodging flying crockery and the other person is shrieking curses . " Ce'Nedra blushed slightly . " You did that too ? " he asked mildly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those words . How did you ever find out what they mean ? " " You swear all the time , " she accused.  | " I know , " he admitted . " It 's terribly unfair . I 'm allowed co , but you 're not . " " I 'd like to know who made up that rule , " she started , and then her eyes narrowed . " You 're trying to change the subject , " she accused him . " No , Ce'Nedra , I already did . We were n't getting anywhere with the other topic . You are not barren , and I am not going to divorce you , no matter how long somebody else 's braids are , or how  --  well , never mind . " She looked at him . " Oh , Garion , what if I am ? " she said in a small voice . " Barren , I mean ? " " That 's absurd , Ce'Nedra . We wo n't even discuss that . " The lingering doubt in the eyes of the Rivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they did not discuss it , she would continue to worry about it.  |p207The  season made the Sea of the Winds extremely hazardous , and Garion was forced to wait for a full month before he could dispatch a messenger to the Vale of Aldur . By then the late autumn snowstorms had clogged the passes in the mountains of eastern Sendaria , and the royal messenger was obliged literally to wade his way across the plains of Algaria . With all these delays , it was very nearly Erastide by the time Aunt Poi , Durnik , and Errand arrived at the snowy quay in the harbor at Riva . Durnik admitted to Garion that it had only been a chance meeting with the wayward Captain Greldik , who feared no storm that any sea could hurl at him , that had made the trip possible at all . Polgara spoke briefly withp208the vagabond seaman before they began the long climb up to the Citadel , and Garion noted with some surprise that Greldik slipped his hawsers immediately and sailed back out to sea . Polgara seemed quite unconcerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send for her . She spoke with him only a couple of times about it , asking a few rather direct questions that set his ears to flaming . Her discussions with Ce'Nedra were a bit more lengthy , but only slightly so . Garion received the distinct impression that she was waiting for someone or something before proceeding . The Erastide celebration at Riva that year was somewhat subdued . Although it was very pleasant to have Polgara , Durnik , and Errand with them to join in the festivities , Garion 's concern over the problem Brand had raised dampened his enjoyment of the holiday . Several weeks afterward , Garion entered the royal apartmentone snowy midafternoon to find Polgara and Ce'Nedra seated by a cozy fire sipping tea and chatting together quietly . The curiosity which had been growing in him since the arrival of his visitors finally boiled to a head . " Aunt Pol , " he began . " Yes dear ? " " You 've been here for almost a month now . " " Has it been that long ? The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There 's still this little problem , you know , " he reminded her . " Yes , Garion , " she replied patiently . " I 'm aware of that . " " Are we doing anything about it ? " " No , " she said placidly , " not yet , anyhow . " " It 's sort of important , Aunt Pol . I do n't want to seem to be trying to rush you or anything , but  --  " He broke off helplessly . Polgara rose from her chair , went to the window , and looked out at the small private garden just outside . The garden was clogged with snow , and the pair of intertwined oak treesp209Ce'Nedra had planted there at the time of her betrothal to Garion were bowed slightly beneath the weight on their limbs . " One of the things you 'll learn as you grow older , Garion , " she said to him , gravely looking out at the snowy garden , " is patience . Everything has its proper season . The solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just not the proper time to come to grips with it yet . " " I do n't understand at all , Aunt Pol . " " Then you 'll just have to trust me , wo n't you ? " " Of course I trust you , Aunt Pol . It 's just --  " " Just what , dear ? " " Nothing . " It was late winter before Captain Greldik returned from the south . A storm had sprung one of the seams of his ship , and she was taking water as she wallowed heavily around the headlandand made for the quay . " I thought for a while there that I might have to swim , " the bearded Cherek growled as he jumped across to the quay . " Where 's the best place to beach this poor old cow of mine ? I 'm going to have to calk her bottom . " " Most sailors use that inlet there , " Garion replied , pointing . " I hate to beach a ship in the winter , " Greldik said bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink ? " " Up at the Citadel , " Garion offered . " Thanks . Oh , I brought that visitor Polgara wanted . " " Visitor ? " Greldik stepped back , squinted at his ship to determine the location of the aft cabin , then went over and kicked the planking several times . " We 're here ! " he bellowed . He turned back to Garion . " I really hate to sail with women on board . I 'm not superstitious , but sometimes I really think they do bring bad luck  --  and you 've always got to watch your manners . " " You have a woman aboard ? " Garion asked curiously . Greldik grunted sourly . " Pretty little thing , but she seemsp210to expect deferential treatment ; and when your whole crew is busy bailing seawater out of your bilges , you do n't have much time for that . " " Hello , Garion , " a light voice said from up on deck . " Xera ? " Garion stared up into the small face of his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Garion , " the red-haired Dryad replied calmly . She was bundled up to the ears in thick , warm furs , and her breath steamed in the frosty air . " I got here as quickly as I could when I received Lady Polgara 's summons . " She smiled sweetly down at the sour-faced Greldik . " Captain , " she said , " could you have some of your men bring those bales along for me ? " " Dirt , " Greldik snorted . " I sail two thousand leagues in the dead of winter to carry one small girl , two casks of water , and four bales of dirt . " " Loam , Captain , " Xera corrected meticulously , " loam . There 's a difference , you know . " " I 'm a sailor , " Greldik said . " To me , dirt is dirt . " " Whatever you wish , Captain , " Xera said winsomely . " Now do be a dear and have the bales carried up to the Citadel for me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grumbling , Captain Greldik gave the orders . Ce'Nedra was ecstatic when she learned that her cousin had arrived in Riva . The two of them flew into each other 's arms and dashed off immediately to find Polgara . " They 're very fond of each other , are n't they ? " Durnik observed . The smith was dressed in furs and wore a pair of well-tarred boots . Shortly after his arrival , despite the fact that it was in the dead of winter , Durnik had discovered a large , swirling pool in the river that dropped out of the mountains and ran just to the north of the city . With astounding selfrestraint , he had actually stared at that ice-rimmed pool for a full ten minutes before going in search of a fishing pole . Now he happily spent most of each day probing those dark , churningwaters with a waxed line and a bright lure in search of thep211silvery-sided salmon that lurked beneath the turbulent surface . The closest Garion had ever seen his Aunt Pol actually come to scolding her husband had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of the Citadel into the very teeth of a screaming blizzard , whistling , and with his fishing pole over his shoulder . " What am I supposed to do with all of this ? " Greldik demanded , pointing at the six burly sailors who had carried Xera 's bales and casks up the long stairway to the grim fortress brooding over the city . " Oh , " Garion said , " just have your men put them over there . " He pointed toward a corner of the antechamber they had just entered . " I 'll find out what the ladies want done with them later . " Greldik grunted . " Good . " Then he rubbed his hands together . " Now , about that drink  --  " Garion did not have the faintest idea what his wife and her cousin and Polgara were up to . Most of the time , their conversationsbroke off as soon as he entered the room . To . his astonishment , the four bales of loam and the two casks of what seemed to be water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . Ce'Nedra adamantly refused to explain , but the look she gave him when he asked why they needed to be so close to the royal bed was not only mysterious , but actually faintly naughty . It was perhaps a week or two after Xera 's arrival that a sudden break in the weather brought the sun out , and the temperature soared up to almost freezing . Shortly before noon , Garion was in conference with the Drasnian ambassador when a wide-eyed servant hesitantly entered the royal study . " Please , your Majesty , " the poor man stammered . " Please forgive me for interrupting , but Lady Polgara told me to bring you to her at once . I tried to tell her that we do n't bother you when you 're busy , but she  --  well , she sort of insisted . " " You 'd better go see what she wants , your Majesty , " thep212Drasnian ambassador suggested . " If the Lady Polgara had just summoned me , I 'd be running toward her door already . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margrave , " Gariontold him . " She would n't actually hurt you . " " That 's a chance I 'd prefer not to take , your Majesty . We can talk about the matter we were discussing some other time . " Frowning slightly , Garion went down the hall to the door of Aunt Pol 's apartment . He tapped gently and then went in . " Ah , there you are , " she said crisply . " I was about to send another servant after you . " She wore a fur-lined cloak with a deep hood pulled up until it framed her face . Ce'Nedra and Xera , similarly garbed , were standing just behind her . " I want you to go find Durnik , " she said . " He 's probably fishing . Find him and bring him back to the Citadel . Get a shovel and a pick from someplace and then bring Durnik and the tools to that little garden just outside your apartment window . " He stared at her . She made a kind of flipping motion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " The day is wearing on . " Yes , Aunt Pol , " he said without even thinking . He turned and went back out , half-running . He was nearly to the end of the hallway before he remembered that he was the king here , and that people probably should n't order him around like that . Durnik , of course , responded immediately to his wife 's summons  --  well , almost immediately . He did make one last cast before carefully coiling up his fishing line and following Garion back to the Citadel . When the two of them entered the small private garden adjoining the royal apartment , Aunt Pol , Ce'Nedra , and Xera were already there , standing beneath the intertwined oak trees . " Here 's what we 're going to do , " Aunt Pol said in a businesslikefashion . " I 'd like to have the area around these tree trunks opened up to a depth of about two feet . "  | " Uh  --  Aunt Pol , " Garion interposed , " the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little difficult . " " That 's what the pick is for , dear , " she said patiently . " Would n't it be easier to wait until the ground thaws ? " " Probably , but it needs to be done now . Dig , Garion . " " I 've got gardeners , Aunt Pol . We could send for a coupleof them . " He eyed the pick and shovel uncomfortably . " It 's probably better if we keep it in the family , dear . Youcan start digging right here . " She pointed . Garion sighed and took up the pick . What followed made no sense at all . Garion and Durnik picked and spaded at the frozen ground until late afternoon , opening up the area Aunt Pol had indicated . Then they dumped the four bales of loam into the hole they had prepared , tamped down the loose earth , and watered the dark soil liberally with the water from the two casks . After that , Aunt Pol instructed them to cover everything back up again with snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garion asked Durnik as the two of them returned their tools to the gardeners ' shed in the courtyard near the stables . " No , " Durnik admitted , " but I 'm sure she knows what she 's doing . " He glanced at the evening sky and then sighed . " It 's probably a little late to go back to that pool , " he said regretfully . Aunt Pol and the two girls visited the garden daily , but Garion could never discover exactly what they were doing , and the following week his attention was diverted by the suddenappearance of his grandfather , Belgarath the Sorcerer . The young king was sitting in his study with Errand as the boy described in some detail the training of the horse Garion had given him a few years back when the door banged unceremoniouslyopen and Belgarath , travel-stained and with a face like a thundercloud , strode in . " Grandfather ! " Garion exclaimed , starting to his feet . " What are  --  "  | " Shut up and sit down ! " Belgarath shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you . We are going to have a talk , Garionthatis , I 'm going to talk , and you 're going to listen . " He paused as if to get control of what appeared to be a towering anger . " Do you have any idea of what you 've done ? " he demanded at last . " Me ? What are we talking about , Grandfather ? " Garion asked . " We 're talking about your little display of pyrotechnics on the plains of Mimbre , " Belgarath replied icily . " That impromptuthunderstorm of yours . " " Grandfather , " Garion explained as mildly as possible , " they were right on the brink of war . All Arendia would probably have gotten involved . You 've said yourself that we did n't want that to happen . I had to stop them . " " We are n't talking about your motives , Garion . We 're talking about your methods . What possessed you to use a thunderstorm ? " " It seemed like the best way to get their attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They were already charging , Grandfather . I did n't have a lot of time to consider alternatives . " " Have n't I told you again and again that we do n't tamper with the weather ? " " Well  --  it was sort of an emergency . " " If you thought that was an emergency , you should have seen the blizzard you touched off in the Vale with your foolishness  --  andthe hurricanes it spawned in the Sea of the East  --  not to mention the droughts and tornados you kicked up all over the world . Do n't you have any sense of responsibilityat all ? " " I did n't know it was going to do that . " Garion was aghast . " Boy , it 's your business to know ! " Belgarath suddenlyroared at him , his face mottled with rage . " It 's taken Beldinand me six months of constant travel and the Gods only knowp215how much effort to quiet things down . Do you realize that with that one thoughtless storm of yours you came very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that change would have been a universal disaster ? " " One tiny little storm ? " " Yes , one tiny little storm , " Belgarath said scathingly . " Your one tiny little storm in the right place at the right time came very close to altering the weather for the next several cons  --  all over the world  --  you blockhead ! " " Grandfather , " Garion protested . " Do you know what the term ice age means ? " Garion shook his head , his face blank . " It 's a time when the average temperature drops  --  just a bit . In the extreme north , that means that the snow does n't melt in the summer . It keeps piling up , year after year . It forms glaciers , and the glaciers start to move farther and farther south . In just a few centuries , that little display of yours could have had a wall of ice two hundred feet high moving down across the moors of Drasnia . You 'd have buried Boktor and Val Alorn under solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Of course not . Grandfather , I honestly did n't know . I would n't have started it if I 'd known . " " That would have been a great comfort to the millions of people you very nearly entombed in ice , " Belgarath retorted with a vast sarcasm . " Do n't ever do that again ! Do n't even think about putting your hands on something until you 're absolutelycertain you know everything there is to know about it . Even then , it 's best not to gamble . " " But  --  but  --  you and Aunt Pol called down the rainstorm in the Wood of the Dryads , " Garion pointed out defensively . " We knew what we were doing , " Belgarath almost screamed . " There was no danger there . " With an enormous effort , the old man got control of himself . " Do n't ever touch the weather again , Garion  --  not until you 've had at least a thousand years of study . " " A thousand years ! "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You seem to have this extraordinary luck . You always manage to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . " " I wo n't do it again , Grandfather , " Garion promised fervently , shuddering at the thought of towering ice walls creepinginexorably across the world . Belgarath gave him a long , hard look and then let the matter drop . Later , when he had regained his composure , he lounged in a chair by the fire with a tankard of ale in one hand . Garion knew his Grandfather well enough to be aware of the fact that ale mellowed the old man 's disposition and he had prudently sent for some as soon as the initial explosion had subsided . " How are your studies going , boy ? " the old sorcerer asked . " I 've been a little pressed for time lately , Grandfather , " Garion replied guiltily . Belgarath gave him a long , cold stare , and Garion could clearly see the mottling on his neck that indicated that the old man 's interior temperature was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he apologized quickly . " From now on , I 'll make the time to study . " Belgarath 's eyes widened slightly . " Do n't do that , " he said quickly . " You got into enough trouble fooling around with the weather . If you start in on time , not even the Gods could predict the outcome . " " I did n't exactly mean it that way , Grandfather . " " Say what you mean , then . This is n't a good area for misunderstandings , you know . " He turned his attention then to Errand . " What are you doing here , boy ? " he asked . " Durnik and Polgara are here , " Errand replied . " They thought I ought to come along . " " Polgara 's here ? " Belgarath seemed surprised . " I asked her to come , " Garion told him . " There 's a little bit of a problem she 's fixing for me  --  at least I think she 's fixing it . She 's been acting sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly what is this problem she 's working on ? "  | " Uh  --  " Garion glanced at Errand , who sat watching the two of them with polite interest . Garion flushed slightly . " Ituh  --  hasto do with the  --  uh  --  heir to the Rivan Throne , " he explained delicately . " What 's the problem there ? " Belgarath demanded obtusely . " You 're the heir to the Rivan Throne . " " No , I mean the next one . " " I still do n't see any problem . " " Grandfather , there is n't one  --  not yet , at least . " " There is n't ? What have you been doing , boy ? " " Never mind , " Garion said , giving up . When spring arrived at last , Polgara 's attention to the two embracing oak-trees became all-consuming . She went to the garden at least a dozen times a day to examine every twig meticulously for signs of budding . When at last the twig ends began to swell , a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again she and the two young women , Ce'Nedra and Xera , began puttering in the garden . Garion found all these botanical pastimes baffling  --  even a little irritating . He had , after all , asked Aunt Pol to come to Riva to deal with a much more serious problem . Xera returned home to the Wood of the Dryads at the first break in the weather . Not long afterward , Aunt Pol calmly announced that she and Durnik and Errand would also be leaving soon . " We 'll take father with us , " she declared , lookingdisapprovingly over at the old sorcerer , who was drinking ale and bantering outrageously with Brand 's niece , the blushingLady Arell . " Aunt Pol , " Garion protested , " what about that littleuh  --  difficultyCe'Nedra and I were having ? " " What'about it , dear ? " " Are n't you going to do something about it ? " " I did , Garion , " she replied blandly . " Aunt Pol , you spent all your time in that garden . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the whole matter for several weeksp218after they had all left . He even began to wonder if he had somehow failed to explain fully the problem or if Aunt Pol had somehow misunderstood . When spring was in full flower and the meadows rising steeply behind the city had turned bright green , touched here and there with vibrantly colored patches of wildflowers , Ce'Nedra began behaving peculiarly . He frequently found her seated in their garden , looking with an odd , tender expression at her oak trees , and quite often she was gone from the Citadel entirely , to return at the end of the day in the company of Lady Arell all bedecked with wildflowers . Before each meal , she took a sip from a small , silver flagon and made a dreadful face . " What 's that you 're drinking ? " he asked her curiously one morning . " It 's a sort of a tonic , " she replied , shuddering . " It has oak buds in it and it tastes absolutely vile . " " Aunt Pol made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Her medicines always taste awful . " " Mmm , " she said absently . Then she gave him a long look . " Are you going to be very busy today ? " " Not really . Why ? " " I thought that we might stop by the kitchen , pick up some meat , bread , and cheese , and then go spend a day out in the forest . " " In the forest ? What for ? " " Garion , " she said almost crossly , " I 've been cooped up in this dreary old castle all winter . I 'd like some fresh air and sunshine  --  and the smell of trees and wildflowers around me instead of damp stone . " " Why do n't you ask Arell to go with you ? I probably should n't really be gone all day . " She gave him an exasperated look . " You just said you did n't have anything important to do . " " You never know . Something might come up . " " It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot her a quick glance , recognized the danger signals , and then replied as mildly as he could , " I suppose you 're right , dear . I do n't see any reason why we should n't have a little outing together . We could ask Arell  --  and maybe Kailifthey 'd like to join us . " " No , Garion , " she said quite firmly . " No ? " " Definitely not . " And so it was that , shortly after breakfast , the Rivan King , hand in hand with his little queen , left the Citadel with a well-stocked basket , crossed the broad meadow behind the city , and strolled into the sunlight-dappled shade beneath the evergreens that mounted steeply toward the glistening , snow-capped peaks that formed the spine of the island . Once they entered the woods , all traces of discontent dropped away from Ce'Nedra 's face . She picked wildflowers as they wandered among the tall pines and firs and wove them into a garland for herself . The morning sun slanted down through the limbs high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue shadows . The resinous smell of the tall evergreens was a heady perfume , and birds swooped and spiraled among the tall , columnlike trunks , caroling to greet the sun . After a time , they found a glade , a mossy , open clearing embraced by trees , where a brook gurgled and murmured over shining stones to drop into a gleaming forest pool and where a single , soft-eyed deer stood to drink . The deer raised her head from the water swirling about her delicate brown legs , looked at them quite unafraid , and then picked her way back into the forest , her hooves clicking on the stones and her tail flicking . " Oh , this is just perfect , " Ce'Nedra declared with a soft little smile on her face . She sat on a round boulder and began to unlace her shoes . Garion put down the basket and stretched , feeling the cares of the past several weeks slowly draining out of him . " I'mp220glad you thought of this , " he said , sprawling comfortably on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . " " Naturally , " she said . " All my ideas are good ones . " " I do n't know if I 'd go that far . " Then a thought occurred to him . " Ce'Nedra , " he said . " What ? " " I 've been meaning to ask you something . All the Dryads have names that begin with an X , do n't they ? Xera , Xanthalikethat . " " It 's our custom , " she replied , continuing to work on her shoelaces . " Why does n't yours , then ? Begin with an X , I mean ? " " It does . " She pulled off one of her shoes . " Tolnedrans just pronounce it a little differently , that 's all . So they spell it that way . Dryads do n't read or write very much , so they do n't worry too much about spelling . " " X'Nedra ? " " That 's fairly close . Make the X a little softer , though . " " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why did n't you ask , then ? " " I do n't know . I just never got around to it . " " There 's a reason for everything , Garion , " she told him , " but you 'll never find it out if you do n't ask . " " Now you sound just like Aunt Pol . " " Yes , dear . I know . " She smiled , pulled off her other shoe and wriggled her toes contentedly . " Why barefoot ? " he asked idly . " I like the feel of the moss on my feet  --  and I think that in a little bit I might go swimming . " " It 's too cold . That brook comes right out of a glacier . " " A little cold water wo n't hurt me . " She shrugged . Then , almost as if responding to a dare , she stood up and began totake off her clothes . " Ce'Nedra ! What if someone comes along ? " She laughed a silvery laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soak my clothes just for the sake of propriety . Do n't be such a prude , Garion . " " It 's not that . It 's  --  " " It 's what ? " " Never mind . " She ran on light feet into the pool , squealing delightedly as the icy water splashed up around her . With a long clean dive , she disappeared beneath the surface of the pool , swam to the far side , where a large , mossy log angled down into the crystal-clear water , and surfaced with streaming hair and an impish grin . " Well ? " she said to him . " Well what ? " " Are n't you coming in ? " " Of course I 'm not . " " Is the mighty Overlord of the West afraid of cold water ? " " The mighty Overlord of the West has better sense thanto catch cold for the sake of a little splashing around . " " Garion , you 're getting positively stodgy . Take off yourcrown and relax . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , then . " " Ce'Nedra ! " She laughed another silvery peal of laughter and began kicking her bare feet , sending up showers of sparkling water drops that gleamed like jewels in the midmorning sunlight . Then she lay back and her hair spread like a deep copper fan upon the surface of the pool . The garland of flowers she had woven for herself earlier had come apart as a result of her swimming , and the individual blossoms floated on the water , bobbing in the ripples . Garion sat on a mossy hummock with his back resting comfortablyagainst a tree trunk . The sun was warm , and the smell of trees and grass and wildflowers filled his nostrils . A breeze carrying the salt tang of the sea sighed among the green limbs of the tall fir trees surrounding the little glade , and golden sunlight fell in patches on the floor of the forest.  |p222An  errant butterfly , its patterned wings a blaze of irridescentblue and gold , flitted out from among the tall tree trunks into the sunlight . Drawn by color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wavered through the lucid air to the pool and the flowers bobbing there . Curiously it moved from flower to floating flower , touching each of them lightly with its wings . With a breathless expression Ce'Nedra slowly sank her head into the water until only her upturned face was above the surface . The butterfly continued its curious investigation , coming closer and closer to the waiting queen . And then it hovered over her face , its soft wings brushing her lips ecstatically . " Oh , fine . " Garion laughed . " Now my wife is consorting with butterflies . " " I 'll do whatever it takes in order to get a kiss , " she replied , giving him an arch look . " If it 's kisses you want , I 'll take care of that for you , " he said . " That 's an interesting thought . I think I 'd like one right now . My other lover seems to have lost interest . " She pointed at the butterfly , which had settled with quivering wings on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kiss me , Garion . " " You 're right in the middle of the deepest part of the pool , " he pointed out . " So ? " " I do n't suppose you 'd consider coming out . " " You offered kisses , Garion . You did n't make any conditions . " Garion sighed , stood up , and began to remove his clothing . " We 're both going to regret this , " he predicted . " A cold in the summertime lasts for months . " " You 're not going to catch cold , Garion . Come along now . " He groaned and then waded manfully into . the icy water . " You 're a cruel woman , Ce'Nedra , " he accused , wincing at the shocking chill . " Do n't be such a baby . Come over here . "  |p223Gritting  his teeth , he plowed through the water toward her , stubbing his toe on a large rock in the process . When he reached her , she slid her cold , wet little arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her kiss was lingering and it pulled him slightly off balance . He felt her lips tighten slightly as she grinned impishly , even in the midst of the kiss , and then without any warning , she lifted her legs , and her weight pulled him under . He came up sputtering and swearing . " Was n't that fun ? " she giggled . " Not really , " he grumbled . " Drowning is n't one of my favoritesports . " She ignored that . " Now that you 're all wet , you might as well swim with me . " They swam together for about a quarter of an hour and then emerged from the pool , shivering and with their lips turning blue . " Make a fire , Garion , " Ce'Nedra said through chattering teeth . " I did n't bring any tinder , " he said " or a flint . " " Do it the other way , then . " " What other way ? " he asked blankly . " You know  --  " She made a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hurry , Garion . I 'm freezing . " He gathered some twigs and fallen branches , cleared a space in the moss , and concentrated his will on the pile of wood . At first , a small tendril of smoke arose , then a tongue of bright orange flame . Within a few minutes , a goodly little fire was crackling just beside the moss-covered hummock upon which the shivering Ce'Nedra was huddled . " Oh , that 's much better , " she said , stretching her hands out to the fire . " You 're a useful person to have around , my Lord . " " Thank you , my Lady . Would my Lady like to consider putting on some clothes ? "  | " Not until she 's dry , she would n't . I hate pulling on dry clothes over wet skin . " " Let 's hope nobody comes along , then . We 're not really dressed for company , you know . " " You 're so conventional , Garion . " " I suppose so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here beside me ? " she invited . " It 's much warmer here . " He could n't really think of any reason why he should n't , so he joined her on the warm moss . " See , " she said , putting her arms about his neck . " Is n't this much nicer ? " She kissed him  --  a serious kind of kiss that made his breath catch in his throat and his heart pound . When she finally released her grip about his neck , he looked around the glade nervously . A fluttering movement near the foot of the pool caught his eye . He coughed , looking slightly embarrassed . " What 's the matter ? " she asked him . " I think that butterfly is watching , " he said with a slight flush . " That 's all right . " she smiled , sliding her arms about his neck and kissing him again . The world seemed unusually quiet as spring gently slipped into summer that year . The secession of the Vordues crumbled under the onslaughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vordue family finally capitulated , pleading with an almost genuine humility to be readmitted to the Empire . While they were not fond of Varana 's tax-collectors , they all ran out into the streets to greet his legions as they returned . The news from Cthol Murgos was sketchy at best , but it appeared that things in the far south remained at an impasse , with Kal Zakath 's Malloreans holding the plains and Urgit 's Murgos firmly entrenched in the mountains . Periodic reports forwarded to Garion by Drasnian Intelli/gence seemed to indicate that the re-emergent Bear-cult was doing little more than milling around out in the countryside . Garion enjoyed this respite from crisis and , since there was no really pressing business , he took to sleeping late , sometimeslying in bed in a kind of luxurious doze until two or three hours past sunrise . On one such morning about midsummer , he was having an absolutely splendid dream . He and Ce'Nedra were leaping from the loft in the barn at Faldor 's farm into the soft hay piled below . He was awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into an adjoining chamber where she was violently and noisily sick . " Ce'Nedra ! " he exclaimed , jumping out of bed to follow her . " What are you doing ? " " I 'm throwing up , " she replied , raising her pale face from the basin she was holding on her knees . " Are you sick ? " " No , " she drawled sarcastically . " I 'm doing it for fun . " " I 'll get one of the physicians , " he said , grabbing , up a robe . " Never mind . " " But you 're sick . " " Of course I am , but I do n't need a physician . " " That does n't make any sense , Ce'Nedra . If you 're sick , you need a doctor . " " I 'm supposed to be sick , " she told him . ' What ? " " Do n't you know anything , Garion ? I 'll probably get sick every morning for the next several months . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're impossibly dense . People in my condition always get sick in the morning . " " Condition ? What condition ? " She rolled her eyes upward almost in despair . " Garion , " she said with exaggerated patience , " do you remember thatp226little problem we had last fall ? The problem that made us send for Lady Polgara ? " " Well  --  yes . " " I 'm so glad . Well , we do n't have that problem any more . " He stared at her , slowly comprehending . " You mean  --  ? " " Yes , dear , " she said with a pale smile . " You 're going tobe a father . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I think I 'll throw upagain. "  |p227They  did not match . Now matter how hard Garion twisted and turned the sense of the two passages , there was no apparent way to make them match . Despite the fact that they both seemed to describe the same period of time , they simply went off in opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , but the dusty library seemed somehowdim , chill , and uninviting . Garion did not think of himself as a scholar and he had approached the task that Belgarath had laid upon him with some reluctance . The sheer volume of the documents he was obliged to read was intimidating , for one thing , and this gloomy little room with its smell of ancient parchment andp228mildewed leather bindings always depressed him . He had done unpleasant things before , however , and , although he was a bit grim about it , he nonetheless dutifully spent at least two hours a day confined in this prisonlike cell , struggling with ancient books and scrolls written in often-times difficult script . At least , he told himself , it was better than scrubbing pots in a scullery . He set his teeth together and laid the two scrolls side by side on the table to compare them again . He read slowly and aloud , hoping perhaps to catch with his ears what his eyes might miss . The Darine Codex seemed relatively clear and straightforward . " Behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldur 's Orb burns hot with crimson fire shall the name of the Child of Dark be revealed . Guard well the son of the Child of Light for he shall have no brother . And it shall come to pass that those which once were one and now are two shall be rejoined , and in that rejoining shall one of them be no more . " The Orb had turned crimson , and the name of the Child of Dark  --  Zandramas  --  had been revealed . That matched what had taken place . The information that the son of the Child of Light  --  his son  --  would have no brother had concernedGarion a bit . At first he had taken it to mean that he and Ce'Nedra would only have one child , but the more he thought about that , the more he realized that his reasoning there was flawed . All it really said was that they would only have one son . It said nothing about daughters . The more he thought about it , the more the notion of a whole cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last passage , however  --  the one about the two which once were one  --  did n't really make any sense yet , but he was quite certain that it would , eventually . He moved his hand over to trace the lines of the Mrin Codex , peering hard at them in the flickering yellow candlelight . He read slowly and carefully once more . " And the Child of Light shall meet with the Child of Dark and shall overcome him  --  " That obviously referred to the meeting with Torak.  | "  --  and the Darkness shall flee . " The Dark Prophecy had fled when Torak had died . " But behold , the stone which lies at the center of the light  --  " The Orb , obviously , "  --  shall  --  " One word seemed to be blotted at that point . Garion frowned , trying to make out what word might lie beneath that irregular splotch of ink . Even as he stared at it , a strange kind of wearinesscame over him , as if the effort to push aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as moving a mountain . He shrugged and went on , "  --  and this meeting will come to pass in a place which is no more , and there will the choice be made . " That last fragment made him want to howl in frustration . How could a meeting  --  or anything else  --  happen in a place which is no more ? And what was the meaning of the word " choice " ? What choice ? Whose choice ? Choice between what and what ? He swore and read it again . Once again he felt that peculiar lassitude when his eyes reached the blot on the page . He shrugged it off and went on . No matter what the word under the blot might be , it was still only one word , and one single word could not be that important . Irritably he put the scroll aside and considered the discrepancy . The most immediate explanation was that this spot , like so many others , was a place where the Mrin Prophet 's well-known insanity had simply got the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not precisely accurate . The scribe who had copied it off had perhaps inadvertently skipped a line or two at the time when he had blotted the page . Garion recalled an occasionwhen he had done that himself , turning a perfectly bland proclamation into a horrendous declaration that he was on the verge of naming himself military dictator of all the kingdoms lying on this side of the Eastern Escarpment . When he had caught the blunder , he had not just erased the offendinglines , he had shudderingly burned the whole sheet to make sure that no one ever saw it . He stood up , stretching to relieve his cramped muscles andp230going to the small , barred window of the library . The autumn sky was a crisp blue . The nights had turned chilly in the past few weeks , and the higher meadows lying above the city were touched with frost when the sun arose . The days , however , were warm and golden . He checked the position of the sun to gauge the time . He had promised to meet with Count Valgon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to be late . Aunt Pol had stressed the importance of punctuality , and Garion always did his best to be on time . He turned back to the table and absently rerolled the two scrolls , his mind still wrestling with the problem of the conflictingpassages . Then he blew out the candles and left the library , carefully closing the door behind him . Valgon , as always , was tedious . Garion felt that there was an innate pomposity in the Tolnedran character that made it impossible for them to say what they meant without extensive embellishment . The discussion that day had to do with " prioritizing " the unloading of merchant vessels in the harbor at Riva . Valgon seemed terribly fond of the word " prioritizing , " finding a way to insert it into the discussion at least once in every other sentence . The essence of Valgon 's presentation seemed to be a request  --  or a demand  --  that Tolnedran merchantmenshould always have first access to the somewhat limited wharves at the foot of the city . " My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refuse , " I actually believe that this matter needs  --  " He broke off , looking up as the great carved doors to the throne room swung inward . One of the towering , gray-cloaked sentries who always stood guard outside when Garion was in the throne room stepped in , cleared his throat , and announced in a voice that probably could have been heard on the other side of the island , " Her Royal Majesty , Queen Ce'Nedra of Riva , Imperial Princessof the Tolnedran Empire , Commander of the Armies of the West , and beloved wife of his Majesty , Belgarion of Riva ,  |p231Godslayer  , Lord of the Western Sea , and Overlord of the West ! " Ce'Nedra , demure and tiny , entered on the sentry 's heels , her shoulders unbowed by the weight of all those vast titles . She wore a teal-green velvet gown , gathered beneath the bodiceto conceal her expanding waistline , and her eyes were sparkling mischieviously . Valgon turned and bowed smoothly . Ce'Nedra touched the sentry 's arm , strained up on tiptoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back toward the throne at the front of the hall , and cleared his throat again . " His Highness , Prince Kheldar of Drasnia , nephew of the beloved late King Rhodar , and cousin to King Kheva , Lord of the Marches of the North ! " Garion started up from the throne in astonishment . Silk entered grandly . His doublet was a rich pearl gray , his fingers glittered with rings , and a heavy gold chain with a large pendant sapphire hung about his neck . " That 's all right , gentlemen , " he said to Garion and Count Valgon with an airy wave of his hand , " you need n't rise . " He extended his arm grandly to Ce'Nedra , and the two of them came down the broad , carpeted aisle past the three glowing firepits in the floor . " Silk ! " Garion exclaimed . " The very same , " Silk replied with a mocking little bow . " Your Majesty is looking well  --  considering . " " Considering what ? " Silk winked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merchant prince again , " Valgon murmured politely . " Your Highness has become a legend in recent years . Your exploits in the East are the absolute despair of the great commercial houses in Tol Iloneth . " " One has had certain modest success , " Silk responded , breathing on a large ruby ring on his left hand and then polishingit on the front of his doublet . " In your next report ,  |p232|please  convey my regards to your new Emperor . His handling of the Vordue situation was masterly . " Valgon permitted himself a faint smile . " I 'm sure his ImperialMajesty will appreciate your good opinion , Prince Kheldar . " He turned to Garion . " I know that your Majesty and his old friend will have many things to discuss , " he said . " We can take up this other matter at a later date , perhaps . " He bowed . " With your Majesty 's permission , I will withdraw . " " Of course , Valgon , " Garion replied . " And thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne room . Ce'Nedra came down to the foot of the throne and linked her arm affectionately with Silk 's . " I hope you did n't mind being interrupted , Garion , " she said . " I know that you and Valgon were having an absolutely fascinating talk . " Garion made a face . " What was the idea behind all that formality ? " he asked curiously . " The business with all those titles , I mean ? " Silk grinned . " Ce'Nedra 's idea . She felt that if we overwhelmedValgon with enough titles , we could persuade him to go away . Did we interrupt anything important ? " Garion gave him a sour look . " He was talking about the problem of getting Tolnedran merchant vessels unloaded . I think that , if he 'd thrown the word prioritizing ' at me about one more time , I 'd have jumped up and strangled him . " " Oh ? " Ce'Nedra said , all wide-eyed and girlish . " Let 's call him back , then . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silk suggested . " He 's a Honethite , " Ce'Nedra replied , making an indelicatelittle sound . " I despise the Honeths . " " Let 's go someplace where we can talk , " Garion said , looking around at the formal throne room . " Whatever your Majesty wishes , " Silk said with a grand bow . " Oh , stop that ! " Garion said , coming down from the dais and leading the way to the side door.  |p233When  they reached the quiet , sunlit sanctuary of the royal apartment , Garion sighed with relief as he took off his crown and shrugged out of his formal state robes . " You have no idea how hot that thing gets , " he said , tossing the robe in a heap on a chair in the corner . " It also wrinkles , dear , " Ce'Needra reminded him , picking up the robe , folding it carefully , and hanging it over the chair back . " Perhaps I could find one for you in Mallorean satin  --  suitable color and interwoven with silver thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich  --  tastefully understated  --  and not nearly so heavy . " " That 's a thought , " Garion said . " And I 'm sure I could offer it to you at a very attractive price . " Garion gave him a startled look , and Silk laughed . " You never change , do you , Silk ? " Ce'Nedra said . " Of course not , " the little thief replied , sprawling unaskedin a chair . " What brings you to Riva ? " Garion asked him , taking a chair across the table from his friend . " Affection  --  at least mostly . I have n't seen you two for several years now . " He looked around . " I do n't suppose you 've got anything to drink handy ? " " We could probably find something . " Garion grinned at him . " We have a rather pleasant little wine , " Ce'Nedra offered , going to a dark , polished sideboard . " We 've been trying to keep Garion here away from ale . " One of Silk 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to want to sing when he drinks ale , " the Queen explained . " I would n't really want to put you through that . " " All right , " Garion said to her . " It 's not so much his voice , " Ce'Nedra went on relent/lessly . " It 's the way he goes looking for the right notes  --  and does n't find them . " " Do you mind ? " Garion asked her . She laughed a shimmering laugh and filled two silver gobletswith a blood-red Tolnedran wine . " Are n't you joining us ? " Silk asked . She made a face . " The heir to the Rivan Throne does n't care much for wine , " she replied , delicately placing one hand on her swelling abdomen . " Or perhaps he enjoys it too much . It makes him start kicking , and I 'd rather that he did n't break too many of my ribs . " " Ah , " Silk said delicately . She brought the goblets to the table and set them down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's time for my visit to the baths . " " Her hobby , " Garion said . " She spends at least two hours of every afternoon down in the women 's baths  --  even when she is n't dirty . " She shrugged . " It relaxes my back . I 've been carrying this burden lately . " Once again she touched her abdomen . " And it seems to get heavier every day . " " I 'm glad that it 's the women who have the babies , " Silksaid . " I 'm sure I would n't really have the strength for it . " " You 're a nasty little man , Kheldar , " she retorted tartly . " Of course I am . " He smirked . She gave him a withering look and went in search of Lady Arell , her usual companion in the baths . " She looks absolutely blooming , " Silk observed , " and she 's not nearly as bad-tempered as I 'd expected . " " You should have been around a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine . " " It happens , I suppose  --  or so I 've been told . " " What have you been up to lately ? " Garion asked , leaning back in his chair . " We have n't heard much about you . " " I 've been in Mallorea , " Silk replied , sipping at his wine.  | " The fur trade is n't very challenging any more , and Yarblek 's been handling that end of the business . We felt that there was a great deal of money to be made in Mallorean silks , carpets , and uncut gemstones , so I went over to investigate . " " Is n't it a little dangerous for a Western merchant in Mallorea ? " Silk shrugged . " No worse than Rak Goska  --  or Tol Honeth , for that matter . I 've spent my whole life in dangerous places , Garion . " " Could n't you just buy your goods at Yar Marak or Thull Zelik when they come off the Mallorean ships ? " " The prices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another pair of hands , the price , doubles . " " That makes sense , I suppose . " Garion looked at his friend , envying the freedom that made it possible for Silk togo anywhere in the world he wanted to go . " What 's Mallorea really like ? " he asked . " We hear stories , but I think that 's all they are most of the time . " " It 's in turmoil just now , " Silk replied gravely . " Kai Zakath'soff fighting his war with the Murgos , and the Grolimswent all to pieces when they heard about the death of Torak . Mallorean society has always been directed from either Mal Zeth or Mal Yaska -- the emperor or the church  --  but now nobody seems to be in charge . The government bureaucracy tries to hold things together , but Malloreans need strong leadershipand right now they do n't have it . All sorts of strange things are beginning to surface  --  rebellions , new religions , that kind of thing . " A thought occurred to Garion . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously . Silk looked at him sharply . " It 's odd you should ask that , " he said . " When I was in Boktor , just before Rhodar died , I was talking with Javelin . Errand happened to be there and he asked Javelin the same question . Javelin told him that it 's a Darshivan name and that was about all he knew . When I want hack to Mallorea , I asked in a few places , but people got veryp236tight-lipped and white-knuckled every time I mentioned it , so I let it drop . I gathered that it has something to do with one of those new religions I mentioned before . " " Did you happen to hear anything about something called the Sardion  --  or Cthrag Sardius , maybe ? " Silk frowned , tapping the rim of his goblet thoughtfully against his lower lip . " It 's got a familiar ring to it , but I ca n't quite put my finger on where I heard it . " " If you happen to remember , I 'd appreciate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is it important ? " " I think it might be . Grandfather and Beldin have been trying to track it down . " " I 've got some contacts in Mal Zeth and Melcene , " Silk noted . " When I get back , I 'll see what I can find out . " " You 're going back soon , then ? " Silk nodded . " I 'd have stayed there , but a little crisis came up in Yar Nadrak . King Drosta started to get greedy . We 've been paying him some very healthy bribes to persuade him to look the other way about some of our activities in his kingdom . He got the notion that we were making a great deal of money and he was toying with the idea of expropriating our holdings in Gar og Nadrak . I had to come back and talk him out of the notion . " " How did you manage that ? I 've always had the impression that Drosta does pretty much what he wants in Gar og Nadrak . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pointed out that I 'm closely related to the King of Drasnia and hinted that I was on very good terms with Kal Zakath . The prospect of an invasionfrom either the East or the West did n't appeal to him , so he dropped the idea . " " Are you on good terms with Zakath ? " " I 've never met him  --  but Drosta does n't know that . " " You lied ? Is n't that dangerous ? " Silk laughed . " Lots of things are dangerous , Garion . We'vep237both been in tight spots before . Rak Cthol was n't the safest place in the world , if you 'll recall , and Cthol Mishrak made me definitely edgy . " Garion toyed with his goblet . " You know something , Silk ? " he said . " I sort of miss all that . " " All what ? " " I do n't know  --  the danger , the excitement . Things have settled down pretty much for me . About the only excitement I get these days is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I wish  --  " He left it hangingthere . " You can come to Mallorea with me , if you 'd like , " Silk offered . " I could find interesting work for a man of your talents . " " I do n't think Ce'Nedra would be too pleased if I left just now . " " That 's one of the reasons I never married , " Silk told him . " I do n't have to worry about things like that . " " Are you going to stop in Boktor on your way back ? " " Briefly , maybe . I visited the people I needed to see on my way here from Yar Nadrak . Porenn 's doing very well with Kheva . He 's probably going to be a good king when he grows up . And I stopped by to see Javelin , of course . It 's more or less expected . He likes to get our impressions of foreign countries  --  evenwhen we 're not acting in any official capacity . " " Javelin 's very good , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I always thought you were . " " Not by a long way , Garion . " Silk smiled . " I 'm too erratic  --  brilliant , maybe , but erratic . I get sidetracked too easily . When Javelin goes after something , he does n't let anythingdistract him until he gets it . Right now , he 's trying to get to the bottom of this Bear-cult thing . " " Is he having any luck ? " " Not yet . He 's been trying for several years to get somebodyinto the inner councils of the cult , but he has n't beenp238able to manage it . I told him that he ought to send in Hunter , but he told me that Hunter 's busy with something else and to mind my own business . " " Hunter ? Who 's Hunter ? " " I have no idea , " Silk admitted . " It 's not really a who , you see . It 's a name that 's applied to the most secret of our spies , and it changes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wo n't tell anybody  --  not even Porenn . Javelinhimself was Hunter for a time  --  about fifteen years ago . It 's not always necessarily a Drasnian , though  --  or even a man . It can be anybody in the world . It might even be somebody we know  --  Barak , maybe , or Relg  --  or maybe somebody in Nyissa . " " Mandorallen , perhaps ? " Garion suggested , smiling . Silk considered that . " No , Garion , " he concluded . " I do n't think Mandorallen has the right equipment . It can surprise you though . On several occasions , Hunter has even been a Murgo . " " A Murgo ? How could you possibly trust a Murgo ? " " I did n't say we always have to trust Hunter . " Garion shook his head helplessly . " I 'll never understand spies and spying . " " It 's a game , " Silk told him . " After you 've played for a while , the game itself gets to be more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things sometimes get pretty obscure . " " I 've noticed that , " Garion said . " And as long as the subject has come up , what 's your real reason for coming to Riva ? " " It 's nothing all that secret , Garion , " Silk replied urbanely , adjusting the cuffs of his gray doublet . " I realized a few years ago that a traveling merchant tends to lose track of things . If you want to stay on top of a local situation , you need to have an agent on the scene  --  somebody who can take advantage of opportunities when they arise . I 've located some markets for certain Rivan products  --  glass , good boots , those wool capes ,  |p239that  sort of thing  --  and I decided that it might not be a bad idea to have a representative here . " " That 's really a very good idea , Silk . Things are a little static down in the city . We could use some new businesses to liven things up . " Silk beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional revenue , " Garion added . " What ? " " There are a few taxes , Silk  --  nothing too burdensome , but I 'm sure you understand . A kingdom is very expensive to run . " Garion ! " Silk 's voice was anguished . " It 's one of the first things I learned . People do n't mind taxes so much if they 're sure that everybody 's paying the same . I ca n't really make exceptions at all  --  not even for an old friend . I 'll introduce you to Kail . He 's my chief administrator . He 'll set things up for you . " " I 'm terribly disappointed in you , Garion , " Silk said with a crestfallen look . " As you 've said so many times , business is business , after all . " There was a light tap on the door . " Yes ? " Garion answered . " The Rivan Warder , your Majesty , " the sentry outside announced . " Send him in . " The tall , graying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he greeted Silk with a brief nod , then turned to Garion . " I would n't bother you , your Majesty , " he apologized , " but a matter of some urgency has come up . " " Of course , Brand , " Garion replied politely . " Sit down . " " Thank you , Belgarion , " Brand said gratefully , sinking into a chair . " My legs are n't what they used to be . " " Is n't it a joy to grow older ? " Silk said . " The mind gets better , but everything else starts to fall apart . "  |p240Brand  smiled briefly . " There 's been a bit of a squabble in the garrison here in the Citadel , Belgarion , " he said , getting directly to the point . " I 'll discipline the two young men involvedmyself , but I thought that perhaps if you spoke to them , it might head off bloodshed . " " Bloodshed ? " " They were bickering over something quite unimportant , and one thing led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other 's teeth loose . That should have been the end of it , but they started issuing each other formal challenges . I was fairly sure that you would want to keep the swords out of it . " " Definitely . " " I can order them to withdraw the challenges , but there 's always the possibility that they 'll sneak out some night and find a private place to do war on each other . I think that if the king spoke with them , we might be able to head off that sort of foolishness . They 're a couple of fairly good young men , and I do n't think we want to have them chop each other into dog meat . " Garion nodded his agreement . " Send the pair of them to me first thing in the  --  " The medallion he always wore gave a peculiar little twitch , and he broke off what he was saying , startled by the flutter against his chest . The amulet suddenly seemed to grow very hot , and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Garion ? " Silk asked him curiously . Garion started to hold up one hand as he tried to pinpoint the source of the humming sound . Then his amulet gave a violent lurch that was almost like a blow to his chest . The humming shattered , and he heard Ce'Nedra 's voice crying to him . " Garion ! Help me ! " He sprang to his feet as Brand and Silk stared at him in amazement . " Ce'Nedra ? " he shouted . " Where are you ? " " Help me , Garion ! The baths ! " " Quick ! " Garion exclaimed to the others . " Ce'Nedra needsp241us  --  in the baths ! " and he ran from the room , grabbing up a plain sword standing sheathed in the corner as he passed . " What is it ? " Silk demanded , running along behind as they burst into the outer corridor . " I do n't know , " Garion shouted . " She called me for help . " He shook his sword as he ran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening down in the baths . " It was a long way down seemingly endless flights of torchlit stairs to the baths in the cellars of the Citadel . Garion went down those stairs three and four at a time with Silk and Brand hot on his heels . Startled servants and officials jumped out of their way as they rushed down , faces grim and with drawn weapons in their hands . At the bottom of the last flight of stairs they found the heavy door to the women 's baths bolted from the inside . Instantly summoning his will , Garion focused it and commanded , " Burst ! " The iron-bound door blasted inward off its hinges . The scene inside was one of horror . The Lady Arell lay in a crumpled heap on the tile floor with the hilt of a dagger protruding from between her shoulders . In the center of the steaming pool , a tall , raw-boned woman in a dark cloak was grimly holding something under the water  --  something that struggled weakly  --  and floating on the surface above that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ce'Nedra ! " Garion shouted , leaping feetfirst into the pool with his sword aloft . The cloaked woman gave him one startled glance and fled , splashing frantically away from the enraged king . Ce'Nedra 's tiny body rose limply to the surface of the pool , and she floated facedown and bobbing slightly in the water . With a cry of anguish , Garion dropped his sword and struggled through the warm , waist-deep water , his desperate arms reaching out toward the limp body floating just beyond his grasp . Roaring with rage , Brand ran around the tiled walkway surrounding the pool with his sword aloft to pursue the tallp242woman , who was fleeing through a narrow doorway on the far side of the bath , but Silk was already ahead of him , running swiftly after the woman with a long-bladed dagger held low . Garion caught up the body of his wife in his arms and struggledtoward the edge of the pool . With horror he realized that she was not breathing . " What can I do ? " he cried desperately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Aunt Pol was not there . He laid Ce'Nedra on the tiles on the edge of the pool . There was no sign of movement , no flutter of breath , and her face was a ghastly bluegraycolor . " Somebody help me ! " Garion cried out , catching the tiny , lifeless form in his arms and holding it very close to him . Something throbbed sharply against his chest , and he looked into his wife 's still face , desperately searching for some sign of life . But Ce'Nedra did not move , and her little body was limp . Again he caught her to him . Once again he felt that sharp throb  --  almost like a blow against his heart . He held Ce'Nedra away from him again , searching with tear-filled eyes for the source of that strange , jolting throb . The flickering light of one of the torches stuck in iron rings around the marble walls of the pool seemed to dance on the polished surface of the silver amulet at her throat . Could it have been  --  ? With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt a tingling shock in his fingers . Startled , he jerked his hand away . Then he closed his fist about the amulet . He could feel it in his palm , throbbing like a silver heart , beating with a faltering rhythm . " Ce'Nedra ! " he said sharply . " You 've got to wake up . Please do n't die , Ce'Nedra ! " But there was no sign , no movementfrom his wife . Still holding the amulet , Garion began to weep . " Aunt Pol , " he cried brokenly , " what can I do ? " " Garion ? " It was Aunt Pol 's startled voice , coming to him across the empty miles . " Aunt Pol , " he sobbed , " help me ! " " What is it ? What 's wrong ? "  | " It 's Ce'Nedra . She  --  she 's been drowned ! " And the full horror of it struck him like some great , overwhelming blow , and he began to sob again , great , tearing sobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a whip . " Where ? " she demanded . " When did this happen ? " " Here in the baths . She 's not breathing , Aunt Pol . I thinkshe 's dead . " " Stop babbling , Garion ! " Her voice was like a slap in the face . " How long has it been since her breathing stopped ? " " A few minutes  --  I do n't know . " " You do n't have any time to lose . Have you got her out of the water ? " " Yes  --  but she 's not breathing , and her face is like ashes . " " Listen carefully . You 've got to force the water out of her lungs . Put her down on her face and push on her back . Try to do it in the same rhythm as normal breathing , and be careful not to push too hard . You do n't want to hurt the baby . " " But  --  " " Do as I say , Garion ! " He turned his silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs . An astonishing amount of water came out of the tiny girl 's mouth , but she remained still and unmoving . Garion stopped and took hold of the amulet again . " Nothing'shappening , Aunt Pol . " " Do n't stop . " He began pushing on Ce'Nedra 's ribs again . He was about ready to despair , but then she coughed , and he almost wept with relief . He continued to push at her back . She coughed again , and then she began to cry weakly . Garion put his hand on the amulet . " She 's crying , Aunt Pol ! She 's alive ! " " Good . You can stop now . What happened ? " " Some woman tried to kill her here in the baths . Silk and Brand are chasing the woman now . " There was a long silence . " I see , " Aunt Pol said finally . " Now listen , Garion  --  carefully . Ce'Nedra 's lungs will be very weak after this . The main danger right now is congestion andp244fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her life  --  and the baby 's  --  depend on that . As soon as her breathing is stronger , get her into bed . I 'll be there as soon as I can . " Garion moved quickly , gathering up every towel and robe he could find to make a bed for his weakly crying wife . As he covered her with a cloak , Silk returned , his face grim , and Brand , puffing noticeably , was right behind him . " Is she all right ? " the big Warder asked , his face desperately concerned . " I think so , " Garion said . " I got her breathing started again . Did the woman get away ? " " Not exactly , " Silk replied . " She ran upstairs until she reached the battlements . When she got up there , I was right behind her . She saw that there was no way to escape , so she threw herself off . " Garion felt a surge of satisfaction at that . " Good , " he said without thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question her . Now we 'll never find out who sent her here to do this . " " I had n't thought of that . " Brand had gone sadly to the silent body of his niece . " My poor Arell , " he said , his voice full of tears . He knelt beside her and took hold of the dagger protruding from her back . " Even in death , she served her queen , " he said almost proudly . Garion looked at him . " The dagger 's stuck , " Brand explained , tugging at it . " The woman who killed her could n't get it out . That 's why she was trying to drown Ce'Nedra . If she 'd been able to use this knife , we 'd have been too late . " " I 'm going to find out who 's responsible for this , " Garion declared from between clenched teeth . " I think I 'll have him flayed . " " Flaying is good , " Silk agreed . " Or boiling . Boiling has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said weakly , and all thoughts of ven/geance fled from Garion 's mind as he turned to her . While he held his wife close to him , he dimly heard Silk speaking quietly to Brand . " After somebody picks up what 's left of our would-be assassin , " the little man was saying in a terse voice , " I 'd like to have all of her clothing brought to me . " " Her clothing ? " " Right . The woman is n't able to talk anymore , but her clothing might . You 'd be surprised at how much you can learn about someone by looking at his undergarments . We want to find out who was behind this , and that dead woman out there is our only clue . I want to find out who she was and where she came from . The quicker I can do that , the quicker we can start heating up the oil . " " Oil ? " " I 'm going to simmer the man who was behind this  --  slowly and with a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived late that same afternoon . No one saw fit to raise the question of how she had crossed the hundreds of intervening leagues in the space of hours instead of weeks . The sentry who had been standing watch atop the battlements and who escorted her to the sickroom , however , had a slightly wild look in his eyes , as if he had just seen something about which he would prefer not to speak . Garion , at the moment she arrived , was in the midst of a discussion with one of the court physicians about the therapeuticvalue of bleeding , and the conversation had reached the point where he had just picked up a sword to confront the startled medical man who was approaching the bed withp247lancet in hand . " If you try to open my wife 's veins with that , " the young king declared firmly , " I 'm going to open yours with this . " " All right , " Polgara said crisply , " that will do , Garion . " She removed her cloak and laid it across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he gasped with relief . She had already turned to face the four physicians who had been tending the little queen . " Thank you for your efforts , gentlemen , " she told them . " I 'll send for you if I need you . " The note of dismissal in her voice was final , and the four quietly filed out . " Lady Polgara , " Ce'Nedra said weakly from the bed . Polgara turned to her immediately . " Yes , dear , " she said , taking Ce'Nedra 's tiny hand in hers . " How do you feel ? " " My chest hurts , and I ca n't seem to stay awake . " " We 'll have you up and about in no time at all , dear , " Polgara assured her . She looked critically at the bed . " I think I 'm going to need more pillows , Garion , " she said . " I want to prop her up into a sitting position . " Garion quickly went through the sitting room to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty ? " the sentry said as Garion opened the door . " Do you want to get me about a dozen or so pillows ? " " Of course , your Majesty . " The sentry started down the corridor . " On second thought , make that two dozen , " Garion called after him . Then he went back to the bedroom . " I mean it , Lady Polgara , " Ce'Nedra was saying in a weaklittle voice . " If it ever gets to the point where you have tomake a choice , save my baby . Do n't even think about me . " " I see , " Polgara replied gravely . " I hope you 've purgedyourself of that particular nonsense now . " Ce'Nedra stared at her . " Melodrama has always made me just ever so faintly nauseous . "  |p248A  slow flush crept up Ce'Nedra 's cheeks . " That 's a very good sign , " Aunt Pol encouraged her . " If you can blush , it means that you 're well enough to take final note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being embarrassed about how truly stupid that last statement of yours really was . Your baby 's fine , Ce'Nedra . In fact , he 's better off right now than you are . He 's sleeping at the moment . " Ce'Nedra 's eyes had gone wide , and her hands were placed protectively over her abdomen . " You can see him ? " she asked incredulously . " See is n't exactly the right word , dear , " Polgara said as she mixed two powders together in a glass . " I know what he 's doing and what he 's thinking about . " She added water to the mixture in the glass and watched critically as the contents bubbled and fumed . " Here , " she instructed , handing the glass to her patient , " Drink this . " Then she turned to Garion . " Build up the fire , dear . It 's autumn , after all , and we do n't want her getting chilled . " Brand and Silk had rather carefully examined the broken body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time Garion joined them late that evening . " Have you found out anything yet ? " he asked as he entered the room . " We know that she was an Alorn , " Brand replied in his rumbling voice . " About thirty-five years old , and she did n't work for a living . At least she did n't do anything strenuous enough to put calluses on her hands . " " That 's not very much to go on , " Garion said . " It 's a start , " Silk told him , carefully examining the hem of a blood-stained dress . " It sort of points at the Bear-cult then , does n't it ? " " Not necessarily , " Silk replied , laying aside the dress and picking up a linen shift . " When you 're trying to hide your identity , you pick an assassin from another country . Of course ,  |p249that  kind of thinking might be a little too subtle for the Bearcult . " He frowned . " Now , where have I seen this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead woman 's undergarment . " I 'm so very sorry about Arell , " Garion said to Brand . " We were all very fond of her . " It seemed like such an inadequate thing to say . " She would have appreciated that , Belgarion , " Brand said quietly . " She loved Ce'Nedra very much . " Garion turned back to Silk with a feeling of frustration boilingup in him . " What are we going to do ? " he demanded . " If we ca n't find out who was behind this , he 'll probably just try again . " " I certainly hope so , " Silk said . " You what ? " " We can save a lot of time if we can catch somebody who 's still alive . You can only get so much out of dead people . " " I wish we 'd been a little more thorough when we wiped out the Bear-cult at Thull Mardu , " Brand said . " I would n't get my mind too set on the notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " There are some other possibilities . " " Who else would want to hurt Ce'Nedra ? " Garion asked . Silk sprawled in a chair , scratching absently at his cheek and with his forehead furrowed with thought . " Maybe it was n't Ce'Nedra , " he mused . " What ? " " It 's altogether possible , you know , that the attempt was directed at the baby she 's carrying . There could be people out there in the world who do not want there to be an heir to Iron-grip 's throne . " " Who ? " " The Grolims come to mind rather quickly , " Silk replied . " Or the Nyissans  --  or even a few Tolnedrans . I want to keep an open mind on the matter  --  until I find out a few more things . " He held up the stained undergarment . " I 'm goingp250to start with this . Tomorrow morning , I 'm going to take it down to the city and show it to every tailor and seamstress I can find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave , and there 's a peculiar kind of stitching along the hem . If I can find somebody to identify it for me , it might give us something to work on . " Brand looked thoughtfully over at the still , blanket-draped form of the woman who had tried to kill Ce'Nedra . " She would have had to have entered the Citadel by way of one of the gates , " he mused . " That means that she passed a sentry and that she had to have given him some kind of excuse for coming in . I 'll round up every man who 's been on sentry duty for the past week and bring them all down here to have a look at her . Once we know exactly when she got in , maybe we can start to backtrack her . I 'd like to find the ship she arrived on and have a talk with the captain . " " What can I do ? " Garion asked quickly . " Probably you should stay close to Ce'Nedra 's room , " Silk suggested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ought to go in and take her place . There could be other attempts , you know , and I think we 'll all feel better if Ce'Nedra 's guarded rather closely . " Under Polgara 's watchful eyes , Ce'Nedra spent a quiet night , and her breathing was much stronger the next day . She complained bitterly about the taste of the medicines she was required to drink , and Polgara listened with a great show of interest to the queen 's extensive tirade . " Yes , dear , " she agreed pleasantly . " Now drink it all down . " " Does it have to taste so awful ? " Ce'Nedra said with a shudder . " Of course it does . If medicine tasted good , sick people might be tempted to stay sick so that they could enjoy the medicine . The worse it tastes , the quicker you get well . " Late that afternoon , Silk returned with a disgusted look on his face . " I had n't realized how many ways it 's possible to attach two pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , I take it , " Garion said . " Not really , " Silk replied , throwing himself into a chair . " I managed to pick up all sorts of educated guesses , though . " " Oh ? " " One tailor was willing to stake his reputation on the fact that this particular stitch is used exclusively in Nyissa . A seamstresstold me very confidently that this was an Ulgo garment . And one half-wit went so far as to say that the owner of the garment was a sailor , since this stitch is always used to repair torn sails . " " What are you talking about , Silk ? " Polgara asked curiously as she passed through the sitting room on her way back to Ce'Nedra 's bedside . " I 've been trying to get someone to identify the stitching on the hem of this thing , " he said in a disgusted tone , waving the blood-stained shift . " Here . Let me see it . " Silk wordlessly handed her the garment . She glanced at it almost casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from somewhere near the town of Rheon . " " Are you sure ? " Silk came to his feet quickly . She nodded . " That kind of stitching was developed centuries ago  --  back in the days when all the garments up there were made from reindeer skin . " " That 's disgusting , " Silk said . " What is ? " " I ran around with this thing all day long  --  up and down all those stairs and in and out of every tailor ship in Rivaandall I had to do to find out what I wanted to know was show it to you . " " That 's not my fault , Prince Kheldar , " she told him , handingback the shift . " If you do n't know enough to bring these little problems to me by now , then there probably is n't much hope for you . " " Thanks , Polgara , " he said drily . " Then the assassin was a Drasnian , " Garion said.  | " A northeastern Drasnian , " Silk corrected . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than the ones who live in the fens . " " Strange ? " " Standoffish , closemouthed , unfriendly , clannish , secretive . Everybody in northeast Drasnia behaves as if he had all the state secrets in the kingdom tucked up his sleeve . " " Why would they hate Ce'Nedra so much ? " Garion asked with a puzzled frown . " I would n't make too much of the fact that this assassin was a Drasnian , Garion , " Silk told him . " People who hire other people to do their killing for them do n't always go looking for their hirelings close to home  --  and , although there are a lot of assassins in the world , very few of them are women . " He pursed his lips thoughtfully . " I do think that I 'll take a trip up to Rheon and have a look around , however . " As the chill of winter set in , Polgara finally declared that Ce'Nedra was out of all danger . " I think I 'll stay , though , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few months , and I 'd probably no sooner get home than I 'd have to turn around and come back . " Garion looked at her blankly . " You did n't actually think that I was going to let anybody else deliver Ce'Nedra 's first baby , did you ? " It snowed heavily just before Erastide , and the steep streets of the city of Riva became virtually impassable . Ce'Nedra 's disposition soured noticeably . Her increasing girth made her awkward , and the depth of the snow in the city streets had rather effectively confined her to the Citadel . Polgara took the little queen 's outbursts and crying fits calmly , scarcely changing expression , even at the height of the eruptions . " You do want to have this baby , do n't you ? " she asked pointedly on one such occasion . " Of course I do , " Ce'Nedra replied indignantly . " Well then , you have to go through this . It 's the only way I know of to fill the nursery . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polgara , " Ce'Nedra flared . " I 'm not in the mood for reasonableness right now . " Polgara gave her a faintly amused look , and Ce'Nedra , in spite of herself , began to laugh . " I 'm being silly , are n't I ? " " A bit , yes . " " It 's just that I feel so huge and ugly . " " That will pass , Ce'Nedra . " " Sometimes I wish I could just lay eggs  --  the way birds do . " " I 'd stick to doing it the old way , dear . I do n't think you have the disposition for sitting on a nest . " Erastide came and passed quietly . The celebration on the island was warm , but somewhat restrained . It seemed as if the whole population was holding its breath , waiting for a much larger reason for celebration . Winter ground on with each week adding more snow to the already high-piled drifts . A month or so after Erastide there was a brief thaw , lasting for perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , turning the sodden snowbanks into blocks of ice . The weeks plodded by tediously , and everybody waited . " Would you just look at that ? " Ce'Nedra said angrily to Garion one morning shortly after they had arisen . " At what , dear ? " he replied mildly . " At that ! " She pointed disgustedly at the window . " It 's snowing again . " There was a note of accusation in her voice . " It 's not my fault , " he said defensively . " Did I say that it was ? " She turned awkwardly to glare at him . Her tininess made her swollen belly appear all the larger , and she sometimes seemed to thrust it out at him as if it were entirely his doing . " This is just absolutely insupportable , " she declared . " Why have you brought me to this frozen  --  " She stopped in mid-tirade , a strange look crossing her face . " Arc you all right , dear ? " Garion asked  | " Do n't dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Oh , my , " she said breathlessly . " What is it ? " He got to his feet . " Oh , dear , " Ce'Nedra said , putting her hands to the small of her back . " Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear . " " Ce'Nedra , that 's not very helpful . What 's the matter ? " " I think perhaps I 'd better go lie down , " she said almost absently . She started across the room , moving at a stately waddle . She stopped . " Oh , dear , " she said with much more vehemence . Her face was pale , and she put one hand on a chairbackto support herself . " I think that it might be a good idea if you sent for Lady Polgara , Garion . " " Is it  --  ? I mean , are you  --  ? " " Do n't babble , Garion , " she said tensely . " Just open the door and scream for your Aunt Pol . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trying , Garion . I 'm saying it . Get her in here right now . " She waddled to the bedroom door and stopped again with a little gasp . " Oh , my goodness , " she said . Garion stumbled to the door and jerked it open . " Get LadyPolgara ! " he said to the startled sentry . " Immediately ! Run ! " " Yes , your Majesty ! " the man replied , dropping his spearand sprinting down the hall . Garion slammed the door and dashed to Ce'Nedra 's side . " Can I do anything ? " he asked , wringing his hands . " Help me to bed , " she told him . " Bed ! " he said . " Right ! " He grabbed her arm and began to tug at her . " What are you doing ? " " Bed , " he blurted , pointing at the royal four-poster . " I know what it is , Garion . Help me . Do n't yank on me . " " Oh . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lifted her off her feet . He stumbled toward the bed , hiseyes wide and his mind completely blank . " Put me down , you great oaf ! " " Bed , " he urged her , trying with all the eloquence at hisp255command to explain . He carefully sent her back down on her feet and rushed on ahead . " Nice bed , " he said , patting the coverlets encouragingly . Ce'Nedra closed her eyes and sighed . " Just step out of my way , Garion , " she said with resignation . " But  --  " " Why do n't you build up the fire ? " she suggested . " What ? " He stared around blankly . " The fireplace  --  that opening in the wall with the burning logs in it . Put some more wood in there . We want it nice and warm for the baby , do n't we ? " She reached the bed and leaned against it . Garion dashed to the fireplace and stood staring at it stupidly . " What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No wood . " " Bring some in from the other room . " What an absolutely brilliant suggestion she had just made ! Ile stared at her gratefully . " Go into the other room , Garion , " she said , speaking very slowly and distinctly . " Pick up some wood . Carry it back in here . Put it on the fire . Have you got all that so far ? " " Right ! " he said excitedly . He dashed into the other room , picked up a stick of firewood , and dashed back in with it . " Wood , " he said , holding the stick up proudly . " Very nice , Garion , " she said , climbing laboriously into the bed . " Now put it on the fire and go back out and bring in some more . " " More , " he agreed , flinging the stick into the fireplace and dashing out the door again . After he had emptied the woodbin in the sitting room  --  one stick at a time  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . He picked up a chair . If he were to swing it against the wall , he reasoned , it ought to break up into manageable pieces . The door to the apartment opened , and Polgara came in.  |p256She  stopped to stare at the wild-eyed Garion . " What on earth are you doing with that chair ? " she demanded . " Wood , " he explained , brandishing the heavy piece of furniture . " Need wood  --  for the fire . " She gave him a long look , smoothing down the front of her white apron . " I see , " she said . " It 's going to be one of those . Put the chair down , Garion . Where 's Ce'Nedra ? " " Bed , " he replied , regretfully setting down the polished chair . Then he looked at her brightly . " Baby , " he informed her . She rolled her eyes toward the ceiling . " Garion , " she said , speaking carefully as if to a child , " it 's much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She needs to walk around  --  keep moving . " He shook his head stubbornly . " Bed , " he repeated . " Baby . " He looked around and picked up the chair again . Polgara sighed , opened the door , and beckoned to the sentry . " Young man , " she said , " why do n't you take his Majesty here down to that courtyard just outside the kitchen ? There 's a large pile of logs there . Get him an axe so that he can cut up some firewood . " Everybody was being absolutely brilliant today . Garion marveled at the suggestion Aunt Pol had just made . He set down the chair again and dashed out with the baffled sentry in tow . He chopped up what seemed like a cord of wood in the first hour , sending out a positive blizzard of chips as he swung the axe so fast that it seemed almost to blur in the air . Then he paused , pulled off his doublet , and really got down to work . About noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef , a large chunk of bread , and some ale . Garion wolfed down three or four bites , took a couple of gulps of the ale , and then picked up his axe to attack another log . It was altogether possible that he might have finished up with the woodpile outside the kitchen and then gone in search of morep257trees had not Brand interrupted him shortly before the sun went down . The big , gray-haired Warder had a broad grin on his face . " Congratulations , Belgarion , " he said . " You have a son . " Garion paused , looking almost regretfully at the remaining logs . Then what Brand had just said finally seeped into his awareness . The axe slid from his fingers . " A son ? " he said . " What an amazing thing . And so quickly , too . " He looked at the woodpile . " I only just now got here . I always thought that it took much longer . " Brand looked at him carefully , then gently took him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Let 's go up and meet your son . " Garion bent and carefully picked up an armload of wood . " For the fire , " he explained . " Ce'Nedra wants a nice big fire . " " She 'll be very proud of you , Belgarion , " Brand assured him . When they reached the royal bedchamber , Garion carefully put his armload of wood on the polished table by the window and approached the bed on tiptoe . Ce'Nedra looked very tired and wan , but there was , nonetheless , a contented little smile on her face . Nestled beside her in a soft blanket was a very small person . The newcomer had a red face and almost no hair . He seemed to be asleep , but as Garion approached , his eyes opened . Gravely , the crown prince looked at his father , then sighed , burped , and went back to sleep . " Oh , is n't he just beautiful , Garion ? " Ce'Nedra said in a wondering little voice . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " And so are you . " He knelt beside the bed and put his arms about them both . " Very nice , children , " Polgara said from the other side of the bed . " You both did just fine . " The following day Garion and his newborn son wentp258through a very ancient ceremony . With Polgara at his side in a splendid blue and silver gown , he carried the baby to the Hall of the Rivan King , where the nobles of the island kingdomawaited them . As the three of them entered the Hall , the Orb of Aldur , standing on the pommel of Iron-grip 's sword , blazed forth with a great shimmer of blue light . Almost bemused , Garion approached his throne . " This is my son , Geran , " he announced  --  in part to the gathered throng , but also , in a peculiar way , to the Orb itself . The choice of his son 's name had not been difficult . Though he could not remember his father , Garion had wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to give his son his father 's name . He carefully handed the baby to Polgara , reached up , and took down the great sword . Holding it by the blade , he extendedit toward the blanket-wrapped infant in Polgara 's arms . The shimmering glow of the Orb grew brighter . And then , as if attracted by that light , Geran stretched forth his tiny pink hand and put it on the glowing jewel . A great aura of manycoloredlight burst from the Orb at the infant touch , surroundingthe three of them with a pulsating rainbow that illuminated the entire Hall . A vast chorus filled Garion 's ears , rising to an enormous chord that seemed to shake the whole world . " Hail Geran ! " Brand boomed in a great voice , " heir to the throne of Iron-grip and keeper of the Orb of Aldur ! " " Hail Geran ! " the throng echoed in a thunderous shout . " Hail Geran , " the dry voice in Garion 's mind added quietly . Polgara said nothing . She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said everything that needed saying . Although it was winter and the Sea of the Winds was lashed by storms , the Alorn Kings all journeyed to Riva to celebrate the birth of Geran . Many others , friends and old acquaintances , joined with Anheg , Cho-Hag , and Queen Porenn on the journey to Riva . Barak was there , of course , accompanied by his wife Merel . Hettar and Adara arrived . Lelldorin and Mandorallen came up from Arendia with Ariana and Nerina.  |p259Garion  , now somewhat more sensitive to such things , was amazed at how many children his friends had produced . No matter which way he turned , there seemed to be babies , and the sound of little boys and girls running and laughing filled the sober halls of the Citadel . The boy-king Kheva of Drasnia and Barak 's son Unrak soon became the closest of friends . Nerina 's daughters romped with Adara 's sons in endless games involving much giggling . Barak 's eldest daughter , Gundred , now a ravishing young lady , cut a broad track through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while tinder the watchful eye of her huge , red-bearded father , who never actually threatened any of his daughter 's suitors , but whose looks said quite plainly that he would tolerate no foolishness . Little Terzie , Gundred 's younger sister , hovered on the very brink of womanhood  --  romping one moment with the younger children and looking the next with devastating eyes at the group of adolescent Rivan boys who always seemed to be around . King Fulrach and General Brendig sailed over from Sendariaabout midway through the celebration . Queen Layla sent her fondest congratulations , but she did not make the trip with her husband . " She almost got on board the ship , " Fulrach reported , " but then a gust of wind made a wave break over the stones of the quay , and she fainted . We decided not to subject her to the voyage at that point . " " It 's probably best , " Garion agreed. l ) urnik and Errand came up from the Vale , naturally , and with them came Belgarath . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal presentations of gifts , both by the visitors and by the ambassadors of various friendly kingdoms . And , of course , there were hours of reminiscences and a fair amount of serious drinking . Ce'Nedra was in her glory , since she and her infant stuff were the absolute center of attention . Garion found that the festivities , coupled with his normal ditties , left him almost no free time at all . He wished that hep260could find an hour or two to talk with Barak , Hettar , Mandorallen , and Lelldorin ; but no matter how he tried to rearrangehis days , the time simply was not there . Very late one evening , however , Belgarath came looking for him . Garion looked up from a report he had been reading as the old sorcerer entered his study . " I thought we might want to talk for a bit , " the old man said . Garion tossed aside the report . " I have n't meant to neglect you , Grandfather , " he apologized , " but they 're keeping my days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things are bound to settle down in a while . Did I ever get around to congratulating you ? " " I think so . " " Good . That 's taken care of , then . People always make such a fuss about babies . I do n't really care that much for them myself . They 're all squally and wet , most of the time , and it 's almost impossible to talk to them . You do n't mind if I help myself , do you ? " He pointed at a crystal decanter of pale wine standing on a table . " No . Go ahead . " " You want some ? " " No thanks , Grandfather . " Belgarath poured himself a goblet of wine and then settled down in a chair across from Garion 's . " How 's the king business ? " he asked . " Tedious , " Garion replied ruefully . " Actually , that 's not a bad thing , you know . When it gets exciting , that usually means that something pretty awful is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you been studying ? " Garion sat up quickly . " I 'm glad you brought that up . Things have been so hectic that something sort of important had almost slipped my mind . " " Oh ? "  | " Flow careful were people when they made copies of those prophecies ? " Belgarath shrugged . " Fairly careful , I suppose . Why do you ask ? " " I think that something got left out of my copy of the Mrin Codex . " " What makes you think so ? " " There 's a passage in there that just does n't make sense . " " Maybe not to you , but you have n't been studying all that long . " " That 's not what I mean , Grandfather . I 'm not talking about an obscure meaning . When I 'm getting at is a sentence that starts out and then just stops without going anywhere . I mean , it does n't have any ending the way it should . " " You 're concerned about grammar ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only passage I found in there that breaks off that way . It goes , But behold , the stone which lies at the center of the light shall  --  ' And then there 's a blot , and it takes up again with "  --  and this meeting will come to pass in a place which is no more , and there will the choice be made . ' " Belgarath frowned . " I think I know the passage , " he said . " The two just do n't fit together , Grandfather . The first part is talking about the Orb  --  at least that 's the way I read it  --  and the second part is talking about a meeting . I do n't know what word is under that blot , but I ca n't for the life of me figure out how the two parts could be hooked together . I think there 's something missing . That 's why I was asking about how they went about copying these things . Could the scribe who was doing it have skipped a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garion , " Belgarath said . " The new copy is always compared with the old one by somebody other than the scribe . We are fairly careful about things like that . " " Then what 's under the blot ? " Belgarath scratched his beard thoughtfully . " I ca n't quite recall , " he admitted . " Anheg 's here . Maybe he remembersp262or you can ask him to transcribe that part from his copy and send it to you when he gets back to Val Alorn . " " That 's a good idea . " " I would n't worry too much about it , Garion . It 's only part of one passage , after all . " " There are a lot of things in there that are only one passage , Grandfather , and they turned out to be sort of important . " " If it bothers you so much , chase it down . That 's a goodway to learn . " " Are n't you the least bit curious about it ? " " I have other things on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrepancy , so I 'll give you all the glory of exposing it to the world and working out the solution . " " You 're not being very much help , Grandfather . " Belgarath grinned at him . " I 'm not really trying to be , Garion . You 're grown up enough now to solve your own problems . " He looked over at the decanter . " I believe I 'll have just another little touch of that , " he said.  | " ... And they shall number twelve , for twelve is a number which is pleasing to the Gods . I know this to be true , for a raven once came to me in a dream and told me so . I have always loved the number twelve , and it is for this reason that the Gods have chosen me to reveal this truth to all the nations .... " Garion scowled at the musty-smelling book . There had been some hope in the earlier pages  --  some obscure references to Light and Dark and a tantalizing fragment which had stated quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the color of the sky , save only when it perceives great evil , and then will it burn hot with scarlet flame . " When he hadp264found that passage , he had read on avidly , convinced that he had stumbled across a genuine and hitherto undiscovered prophecy . The rest of the book , unfortunately , proved to be absolute gibberish . The brief biographical note at the beginning of the book indicated that its author had been a Drasnian merchant of some substance during the third millenium and that these secret jottings had been found only after his death . Garion wondered how a man with so disturbed a mind could have even functioned in a normal society . He closed the book in disgust and added it to the growing pile of ravings that was accumulating on the table in front of him . Next he picked up a slender volume that had been found in a deserted house in Arendia . The first few pages were devoted to the household accounts of a very minor Arendish nobleman . Then , on the fourth page , the mundane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall take up the sword and go in search of that which is hidden , " Garion read . This was immediately followed by a tediously detailed account of the purchase of a dozen or so pigs from a neighbor . Then once again the unknown writer jumped into prophecy . " The quest of the Child of Light shall be for one whose soul has been reft away , for a stone that is empty at its center and for the babe who will hold the Light in one hand and the Dark in the other . " That definitely seemed to be getting somewhere . Garion pulled one of his guttering candles closer and hunched over the book , reading each page carefully . Those two passages , however , proved to be the only ones in the entire volumethat did not speak of the day-to-day business of that forgotten farm somewhere in Arendia . Garion sighed , leaned back , and looked around at the dimly lighted library . The bound books stood in their dusty rows on the dark shelves , and the linen-covered scrolls lay along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two candles flickered , making the room seem almost to dance . " There has to be a faster way to do this , " he muttered . " Actually there is , " the dry voice in his mind said to him.  | " What ? " " You said that there had to be a faster way . I said that there is . " " Where have you been ? " " Here and there . " Garion knew this other awareness well enough by now to be certain that it would tell him only what it wanted him to know . " All right , " he said , " what is this faster way ? " " You do n't have to read every single word the way you have been doing . Open your mind and just leaf through the pages . The things I put in each book will sort of leap out at you . " " Are the prophecies always mixed right in with all this other nonsense ? " " Usually , yes . " " Why did you do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I did n't want the man who was doing the actual writing even to know what I was hiding in his book . Then , of course , it 's a good way to keep things from falling into unfriendly hands . " " And friendly ones too , for that matter . " " Did you want me to explain , or were you just looking for an excuse to make clever remarks ? " " All right . " Garion sighed , giving up . " I think I 've told you before that the word gives meaning to the event . The word has to be there , but it does n't have to be right out in the open where just anybody can find it . " Garion frowned . " Do you mean that you put all these things in all these books for just a few people to read ? " " The term ' a few ' is n't really accurate . Try one ' instead . " " One ? Who ? " " You , obviously . " " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through that again ? " " Are you trying to say that all of this was sort of like a personal letter  --  just to me ? " " In a manner of speaking , yes . " " What if I had n't gotten around to reading it ? "  |p266'Why  are you reading it now ? " " Because Belgarath told me to . " " Why do you think Belgarath told you that ? " " Because  --  " Garion broke off . " You told him to say it to me ? " " Naturally . He did n't know about it , of course , but I nudged him . All sorts of people have access to the Mrin Codex . That 's why I made it so cryptic . These personal instructions to you , however , should be fairly clear  --  if you pay attention . " " Why do n't you just tell me what I 'm supposed to do ? " " I 'm not permitted to do that . " " Permitted ? " " We have our rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to stay that way . We agreed only to act through our instruments , and if I intervene in person  --  with such things as telling you directly what you must do  --  then my opposite will also be free to step over the line . That 's why we both work through what are called prophecies . " " Is n't that a little complicated ? " " The alternative would be absolute chaos . My opposite and I are limitless . If we confront each other directly , whole suns will be destroyed . " Garion shuddered and swallowed hard . " I did n't realize that , " he admitted . Then an idea occurred to him . " Would you be permitted to tell me about that line in the Mrin Codex  --  the one that 's got the blotted word in the middle of it ? " " That depends on how much you want to know about it . " " What 's the word under the blot ? " " There are several words there . If you look at it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them . As for these other books , try reading them the way I told you to . I think you 'll find that it saves a lot of time  --  and you really do n't have all that much time to spare . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " But the voice was gone . The door to the library opened , and Ce'Nedra came in ,  |p267wearing  her nightdress and a warm robe . " Garion , " she said , " are n't you ever coming to bed ? " " What ? " He looked up . " Oh  --  yes . Right away . " " Who was in here with you ? " " Nobody . Why ? " " I heard you talking to someone . " " I was just reading , that 's all . " " Come to bed , Garion , " she said firmly . " You ca n't read the whole library in one evening . " " Yes , dear , " he agreed . Not long after that , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes behind the Citadel , the promised letter from King Anheg arrived . Garion immediatelytook the copy of that baffling passage in the Mrin Codex to the library to compare it with his copy . When he put the two side by side , he began to swear . Anheg 's copy was blotted in exactly the same place . " I told him ! " Garion fumed . " I told him specifically that I needed to see that particular spot ! I even showed him ! " Swearing angrily , he began to pace up and down , waving both arms in the air . Rather surprisingly , Ce'Nedra took her husband 's near-obsessionwith the Mrin Codex in stride . Of course , the little queen 's attention was almost totally riveted on her new son , and Garion was fairly certain that anything he said or did was only on the very edge of her awareness . Young Prince Geran was grossly overmothered . Ce'Nedra held him in her arms almost every minute that he was awake and frequently even when he was asleep . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's constant attention quite calmly and accepted all the cuddling and cooing and impulsive kisses with equanimity . Garion , however , felt that Ce'Nedra really overdid things just a bit . Since she insisted on holding Get-an constantly , it definitely cut into the time when he might be able to hold his son . Once he almost asked her when his turn was going to come , but decided at the last minute notp268to . The thing that he really felt was unfair was Ce'Nedra 's sense of timing . Whenever she did put Geran in his cradle for a few moments and Garion finally got the chance to pick him up , the little queen 's hands seemed almost automatically to go to the buttons on the front of her dress , and she would placidly announce that it was time for Geran to nurse . Garion certainly did not begrudge his son his lunch , but the baby really did n't look all that hungry most of the time . After a time , however , when he finally became adjusted to Geran 's undeniable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , musty library began to reassert itself . The procedure that had been suggested to him by the dry voice worked surprisingly well . After a little practice , he found that he could skim rapidly over page after page of mundane material and that his eye would stop automatically at the prophetic passages buried in the midst of ordinary text . He was surprised to find so many of these passages hidden away in the most unlikely places . In most cases it was obvious that the writers had not even been aware of what they had inserted . A sentence would frequently break off , leap into prophecy , and then take up again exactly where it had stopped . Garion was positive that upon rereading the text , the unconscious prophet who had inserted the materialwould not even see what he had just written . The Mrin Codex , however , and to a lesser degree the Darine , remained the core of the whole thing . Passages from other works clarified or expanded , but the two major prophecies put it all down in uncontaminated form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying each new passage with a number and then linking those numbers to the series of letter codes he had assigned to the paragraphs of the Mrin scroll . Each paragraph of the Mrin , he discovered , usually had three or four corroborating or explanatory lines gleaned from other works  --  all except that crucial blotted passage . " And how did the search go today , dear ? " Ce'Nedra asked brightly one evening when he returned , grouchy and out of sorts , to the royal apartment . She was nursing Geran at thep269time , and her face was aglow with tenderness as she held her baby to her breast . " I 'm just about to give it all up , " he declared , flinging himself into a chair . " I think it might be better just to lock up that library and throw away the key . " She looked at him fondly and smiled . " Now you know that would n't do any good , Garion . You know that after a day or so you would n't be able to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't break it down . " " Maybe I should just burn all those books and scrolls , " he said morosely . " I ca n't concentrate on anything else any more . I know there 's something hidden under that blot , but I ca n't find a single clue anywhere to what it might be . " " If you burn that library , Belgarath will probably turn you into a radish , " she warned with a smile . " He 's very fond of books , you know . " " It might be nice to be a radish for a while , " he replied . " It 's really very simple , Garion , " she said with that infuriatingplacidity . " Since all the copies are blotted , why don'tyou go look at the original ? " He stared at her . " It has to be somewhere , does n't it ? " " Well  --  I suppose so , yes . " " Find out where it is , then , and go look  --  or send for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously . It 's much more fun to rant and rave and be unpleasant about it . " " You know , that 's really a very good idea , Ce'Nedra . " " Naturally . You men always want to complicate things so much . Next time you have a problem , dear , just bring it to me . I 'll tell you how to solve it . " He let that pass . The first thing the following morning , Garion went down into the city and called on the Rivan Deacon in the Temple of Belar . The Rivan Deacon was a sober-faced , gentle man . Unlike the priests of Belar in the major temples on the con/tinent , who were frequently more involved in politics than in the care of their flocks , the leader of the Rivan Church concernedhimself almost exclusively with the well-being  --  physicalas well as spiritual  --  of the common people . Garion had always rather liked him . " I 've never actually seen it myself , your Majesty , " the Deaconreplied in response to Garion 's question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in that shrine on the banks of the Mrin River  --  between the edge of the fens and Boktor . " " Shrine ? " " The ancient Drasnians erected it on the site where the Mrin Prophet was kept chained , " the Deacon explained . " After the poor man died , King Bull-neck directed that a memorial of some sort be put up there . They built the shrine directly over his grave . The original scroll is kept there in a large crystal case . A group of priests is there to protect it . Most people would n't be allowed to touch it ; but considering the fact that you 're the Rivan King , I 'm sure that they 'll make an exception . " " Then it 's always been there ? " " Except during the time of the Angarak invasion during the fourth millenium . It was taken by ship to Val Alorn for safekeeping just before Boktor was burned . Torak wanted to get his hands on it , so it was felt wiser to get it out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Thank you for the information , your Reverence . " " Glad to be of help , your Majesty . " It was going to be hard to get away . This week was completely out of the question , since there was that meeting with the port authorities the day after tomorrow . And next week would be even worse . There were always so many official meetings and state functions . Garion sighed as he climbed back up the long stairs to the Citadel with his inevitable guard at his side . It somehow seemed that he was almost a prisoner here on this island . There were always so many demands onp271his time . He could remember a time , not really that long ago , when he started each day on horseback and seldom slept in the same bed two nights in a row . Upon consideration , however , he was forced to admit that even then he had not been free to do as he wished . Though he had not known it , this burden of responsibility had descended upon him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aunt Poi , Belgarath , and Durnik had crept through the gate at Faldor 's farm and out into the wide world that lay before them . " Well , " he muttered under his breath , " this is important too . Brand can manage here . They 'll just have to get along without me for a while . " " What was that , your Majesty ? " the guard asked politely . " Just thinking out loud , " Garion replied , a little embarrassed . Ce'Nedra seemed moody and out of sorts that evening . She held Geran almost abstractedly , paying scant attention to him as he played with the amulet at her throat with a look of serious concentration on his face . " What 's the matter , dear ? " Garion asked her . " Just a headache , that 's all , " she replied shortly . " And a strange sort of ringing in my ears . " " You 're tired . " " Maybe that 's it . " She arose . " I think I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she declared . " Maybe a good night 's sleep will make me feel better . " " I can put him to bed , " Garion offered . " No , " she said with a strange look . " I want to be sure that he 's safely in his cradle . " " Safe ? " Garion laughed . " Ce'Nedra , this is Riva . It 's the safest place in the world . " " Go tell that to Arell , " she told him and went into the smallroom adjoining their bedchamber where Geran 's cradle stood . Garion sat up and read until rather late that evening . Ce'Nedra 's restless moodiness had somehow communicated itself to him , and he did not feel ready for bed . Finally , hep272put aside his book and went to the window to look out across the moon-touched waters of the Sea of the Winds lying far below . The long , slow waves seemed almost like molten silver in the pale light , and their stately pace was oddly hypnotic . Finally he blew out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing restlessly in her sleep and muttering half-formed phrases  --  meaningless snatches of fragmentary conversation . Garion undressed and slipped into bed , trying not to disturb her . " No , " she said in a peremptory tone of voice . " I wo n't let you do that . " Then she moaned and tossed her head on the pillow . Garion lay in the soft darkness , listening to his wife talking in her sleep . " Garion ! " she gasped , coming suddenly awake . " Your feet are cold ! " " Oh , " he said , " Sorry . " She drifted almost immediately back into sleep , and the muttering resumed . It was the sound of a different voice that awoke him several hours later . The voice was oddly familiar , and Garion lay , still almost asleep , trying to remember exactly where he had heard it before . It was a woman 's voice , low and musical and speaking in a peculiarly soothing tone . Then he suddenly realized that Ce'Nedra was not in the bed beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to hide him so that they ca n't find him , " he heard Ce'Nedra say in a strangely numb voice . He tossed back the covers and slid out of bed . A faint light gleamed through the open door to the nursery , and the voices seemed to be coming from there . Garion moved quickly to that door , his bare feet making no sound on the carpet.  | " Uncover your baby , Ce'Nedra , " the other woman was saying in a calm , persuasive voice . " You 'll hurt him . " Garion looked through the doorway . Ce'Nedra was standing by the cradle in her white nightdress , her eyes vacant and staring , with another figure beside her . On the chair at the foot of the cradle was a great heap of blankets and pillows . Dreamily , the Rivan Queen was methodically piling the bedclotheson top of her baby . " Ce'Nedra , " the woman said to her . " Stop . Listen to me . " " I have to hide him , " Ce'Nedra replied stubbornly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ce'Nedra . You 'll smother him . Now take all the blankets and pillows out again . " " But  --  " " Do as I said , Ce'Nedra , " the woman said firmly . " Now . " Ce'Nedra made a little whimpering sound and began to remove the bedding from the cradle . " That 's better . Now listen to me . You must ignore him when he tells you things like this . He is not your friend . " Ce'Nedra 's face grew puzzled . " He is n't ? " " He 's your enemy . He is the one who wants to hurt Geran . " " My baby ? " " Your baby 's all right , Ce'Nedra , but you have to fight this voice that comes to you in the night . " " Who  --  " Garion started , but then the woman turned to look at him , and he broke off , his mouth agape with astonishment . The woman had tawny-colored hair and warm , golden eyes . Her dress was plain and brown , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once before on the moors of eastern Drasnia when he and Belgarath and Silk had been on their way to that dreadful meeting in the haunted ruins of Cthol Mishrak . Aunt Pol 's mother closely resembled her daughter . Her face had that same calm , flawless beauty , and her head that same proud , erect carriage . There was about this timeless face , how/ever , a strange , almost eternal kind of regret that caught at Garion 's throat . " Poledra ! " he gasped . " What  --  " Aunt Pol 's mother put one finger to her lips . " Do n't wake her , Belgarion , " she cautioned . " Let 's get her back to bed . " " Geran  --  ? " " He 's all right . I arrived in time . Just lead her gently back to bed . She 'll sleep now without any more of these adventures . " Garion went to his wife 's side and put his arm about her shoulders . " Come along now , Ce'Nedra , " he said gently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obediently went with him back into the royal bedroom . " Could you pull back that bolster for me ? " he quietly asked Poledra . She laughed . " As a matter of fact , I ca n't , " she said . " You forget that I 'm not really here , Belgarion . " " Oh , " he said . " I 'm sorry . It just seemed  --  " He pushed the bolster out of the way , carefully laid Ce'Nedra in bed , and pulled the coverlets up around her chin . She sighed and snuggled down to sleep . " Let 's get her into the other room , " Poledra suggested . He nodded and quietly followed her into the adjoining room which was still dimly lighted by the glowing embers of the dying fire . " What was that all about ? " he asked , softly closing the door . " There 's someone who hates and fears your son , Belgarion , " she told him gravely . " He 's only a baby , " Garion protested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not for what he is now . It 's happened that way before , you 'll recall . " " You mean when Asharak killed my parents ? " She nodded . " He was actually trying to get at you . " " But how can I protect Geran from his own mother ? I mean  --  if this man can come to Ce'Nedra in her sleep like that and make her do things , how can I possibly  --  ? "  | " It wo n't happen again , Belgarion . I took care of that . " " But how could you ? I mean , you 're  --  well  --  " " Dead ? That 's not altogether accurate , but no matter . Geran is safe for the moment , and Ce'Nedra wo n't do this again . There 's something else we need to discuss . " " All right . " " You 're getting very close to something important . I ca n't tell you everything , but you do need to look at the Mrin Codex  --  the real one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hidden there . " " I ca n't leave Ce'Nedra  --  not now . " " She 's going to be all right , and this is something that only you can do . Go to that shrine on the River Mrin and look at the Codex . It 's desperately important . " Garion squared his shoulders . " All right , " he said . " I 'll leave in the morning . " " One other thing . " " What ? " " You must take the Orb with you . " " The Orb ? " " You wo n't be able to see what you have to see without it . " I do n't quite understand . " " You will when you get there . " " All right , Poledra , " he said . Then he made a rueful face . " I do n't know why I 'm objecting . I 've been doing things I did n't understand all my life now . " " Everything will become clear in time , " she assured him . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said in a tone so like Aunt Pol 's that he answered automatically . " Yes ? " " You really should n't run around at night without a robe , you know . You 'll catch cold . " The ship he hired at Kotu was small , but well designed for river travel . It was a shallow-draft , broad-beamedp276little ship that sometimes bobbed like a chip of wood . The oarsmen were sturdy fellows and they made good time rowing against the sluggish current of the Mrin River as it meandered its slow way through the fens . By nightfall they were ten leagues upriver from Kotu , and the captain prudently moored his ship to a dead snag with one of the tar-smeared hawsers . " It 's not a good idea to try to find the channel in the dark , " he told Garion . " One wrong turn and we could spend the next month wandering around in the fens . " " You know what you 're doing , Captain , " Garion told him . " I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ale , your Majesty ? " the captainoffered . " That might not be a bad idea , " Garion agreed . Later , he leaned against the railing with his tankard in hand , watching the darting lights of the fireflies and listening to the endless chorus of the frogs . It was a warm spring night , and the damp , rich odor of the fens filled his nostrils . He heard a faint splash , a fish maybe , or perhaps a diving otter . " Belgarion ? " It was a strange , piping kind of voice , but it was quite distinct . It was also coming from the other side of the railing . Garion peered out into the velvet darkness . " Belgarion ? " The voice came again . It was somewhere below him . " Yes ? " Garion answered cautiously . " I need to tell you something . " There was another small splash , and the ship rocked slightly . The hawser that moored her to the snag dipped , and a scampering shadow ran quickly up it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shadow stood up , and Garion could clearly hear the water dripping from it . The figure was short , scarcely more than four feet tall , and it moved toward Garion with a peculiarly shuffling gait.  | " You are older , " it said . " That happens , " Garion replied , peering at the form as he tried to make out its face . Then the moon slid out from behind a cloud , and Garion found himself staring directly into the furry , wide-eyed face of a fenling . " Tupik ? " he asked incredulously . " Is that you ? " " You remember . " The small , furry creature seemed pleased . " Of course I remember . " The ship rocked again , and another furry shadow ran up the hawser . Tupik turned with irritation . " Poppi ! " he chitteredangrily . " Go home ! " " No , " she answered quite calmly . " You must do as I say ! " he told her , stamping his feet on the deck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are they all like that ? " he demanded of Garion . " All what ? " " Females . " Tupik said the word with a certain disgust . " Most of them , yes . " Tupik sighed . " Flow is Vordai ? " Garion asked them . Poppi made a peculiarly disconsolate whimpering sound . " Our mother is gone , " she said sadly . " I 'm sorry . " " She was very tired , " Tupik said . " We covered her with flowers , " Poppi said . " And then we closed up her house . " " She would have liked that . " " She said that one day you would come back , " Tupik told him . " She was very wise . " " Yes . " " She said that we should wait until you came and then we were to give you a message . " " Oh ? "  | " There is an evil that moves against you . " " I was beginning to suspect that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces and that the faces do not always agree , but that which is behind it all has no face and that it comes from much farther than you think . " " I do n't quite follow . " " It is from beyond the stars . " Garion stared at him . " That is what we were told to say , " Poppi assured him . " Tupik said it exactly as mother told it to him . " " Tell Belgarath about mother , " Tupik said then . " And tell him that she sent him her thanks . " " I will . " " Good-bye , Belgarion , " the fenling said . Poppi made a small , affectionate sound in her throat , pattered over , and nuzzled briefly at Garion 's hand . And then the two of them slipped over the side and vanished in the dark waters of the fens.  |p279It  was a dreary-looking place . The village huddled in the river bank at the edge of a flat , featureless plain covered with coarse , dark-green grass . The underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwholesome looking , and just beyond the wide bend in the Mrin River lay the endless green and brown expanse of the fens . The village itself consisted of perhapstwo dozen dun-colored houses , huddled all together about the square stone structure of the shrine . Rickety docks , constructed of bone-white driftwood , stuck out into the river like skeletal fingers , and fishing nets hung on poles , drying and smelling in the humid , mosquito-infested air . Tarion 's ship arrived about noon , and he went immediatelyp280up from the creaking dock along the muddy , rutted street to the shrine itself , walking carefully to avoid slipping , and feelingthe curious stares of the dull-eyed villagers directed at him and at the great sword of the Rivan King strapped to his back . The priests of Belar who guarded the shrine were obsequious , almost fawning , when he arrived at the tarnished bronze gates and requested entry . They led him through a flagstone-covered courtyard , pointing proudly at the rotting kennel and the stout , tar-smeared post with its fragment of heavy , rusting chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Within the shrine itself stood the customary altar with its great carved-stone bearhead . Garion noted that the interior of the shrine stood in need of a good cleaning and that the **25;15276;TOOLONG were rumpled and unwashed . One of the first manifestations of religious enthusiasm , he had noted , was a powerful aversion to soap and water . Holy places  --  and those who attended them  --  always seemed to smell bad . There was some small problem when they reached the vaulted sanctorum where the yellowed parchment scroll of the original Mrin Codex lay in its crystal case with two man-high candles flanking it . One of the priests , a wild-eyed fanatic whose hair and beard resembled a wind-ravaged strawstack , objected shrilly  --  almost hysterically  --  when Garion politely requested that the case be opened . The ranking priest , however , was enough of a polititian to recognize the pre-eminant claim of the Rivan King  --  particularly since he bore Aldur 's Orb  --  to examine any holy object he pleased . Garion realized once again that , in a peculiar way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Alorns . The fanatic at last retreated , muttering the word " blasphemy " over and over again . The crystal case was opened with a rusty iron key , and a small table and chair were brought into the circle of candlelight so that Garion might examine the Codex . " I think I can manage now , your Reverences , " he told themp281rather pointedly . He did not like having people read over his shoulder and he felt no particular need of company . He sat at the table , put his hand on the scroll , and looked directly at the little clot of priests . " I 'll call if I need anything , " he added. " l'heir expressions were disapproving , but the overpowering presence of the Rivan King made them too timid to protest his peremptory dismissal ; they quietly filed out , leaving him alone with the scroll . Garion was excited . The solution to the problem that had plagued him for all these months lay at last in his hands . With nervous fingers , he untied the silken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script was archaic , but gorgeouslydone . The individual letters had not so much been written as they had been meticulously drawn . He perceived almost at once that an entire lifetime had been devoted to the production of this single manuscript . His hands actually trembling with his eagerness , Garion carefully unrolled the scroll , his eyes running over the now-familiar words and phrases , searching for the line that would once and for all clear up the mystery . And there it was ! Garion stared at it incredulously , not believingwhat he saw . The blot was exactly the same as it was on all the copies . He almost screamed with frustration . With a sick feeling of defeat , he read once again that fatal line. : " And the Child of Light shall meet with the Child of Dark and shall overcome him , and the Darkness shall flee . But behold , the Stone which lies at the center of the Light shall  --  " And there was that accursed blot again. peculiar thing happened as he read it again . An odd sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he making such a fuss about a single blotted word ? What difference could one word make ? He almost rose from his chair with the intrntionof putting the scroll back in its case and leaving this foul-smelling place for home . Then he stopped quite suddenly , remembering all the hours he had spent trying to puzzlep282out the meaning of that blot on the page . Perhaps it would n't hurt to read it one more time . He had , after all , come a very long way . He started over again , but his distaste became so acute that he could hardly stand it . Why was he wasting his time with this nonsense ? He had traveled all this way to wear out his eyes on this moldering scrap of insane gibberish  --  this stinking , half-rotten sheet of poorly tanned sheepskin . He shoved the Codex away in disgust . This was sheer idiocy . He pushed back the chair and stood up , shifting Iron-grip 's great sword on his back . His ship would still be there , moored to that rickety dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at Riva within the week . He would lock the library once and for all and tend to his business . A king , after all , did not have time for all this idle , brainsickly speculation . Decisively , he turned his back on the scroll and started toward the door . As soon as he was no longer looking at the scroll , however , he stopped . What was he doing ? The puzzle was still there . He had made no effort to solve it . He had to find out . But as he turned back and looked at the scroll again , that same wave of insupportable disgust almost overwhelmed him . It was so strong that it made him feel faint . Once again he turned his back , and once again the feeling vanished . There was something about the scroll itself that was trying to drive him away . He began to pace up and down , carefully keeping his eyes away from the scroll . What had the dry voice in his mind told him ? " There are several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right kind of light , you should be able to see them . " What kind of light ? The candles in this vaulted room obviously were n't what the voice had meant . Sunlight ? That hardly seemed likely . Poledra had said that he must read the hidden words , but how could he , when the Codex literally drove him away each time he looked at it ? Then he stopped . What else had she said ? Something about not being able to see without . . . The wave of disgust which struck him was so strong thatp283he felt his stomach constrict . He spun quickly so that his back was toward that hateful document ; as he did so , the hilt of Iran-grip 's sword jabbed him painfully in the side of the head . Angrily he reached over his shoulder to grasp the handle and push it back , but instead , his hand touched the Orb . The feeling of revulsion evaporated instantly , and his mind became clear , and his thoughts lucid . The light ! Of course ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orb ' That is what both L'oledra and the dry voice had been trying to tell him . Awkwardly , he reached up and back , seizing the Orb . " Come off , " he muttered to it . With a faint click , the Orb came free in his hand . The sudden weight of the huge sword strapped across his back very nearly drove him to his knees . In astonishment , he realized that the seeming weightlessness of the great scapon had been the work of the Orb itself . Struggling under that gross weight , he fumbled with the buckle at his chest , unfastened it , and felt the enormous bulk slide free . Irongrip'ssword fell to the floor with a loud clatter . I folding the Orb in front of him , Garion turned and looked directly at the scroll . He could almost hear an angry snarl hovering in the air , but his mind remained clear . He stepped to the table and pulled the scroll open with one hand , holding the glowing Orb above it with the other . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated him for so long . It was not some random splotch of spilled ink . The message was there  --  all of it , but the words had all been written down on top of one another ! The entire prophecy lay in that one single spot ! By the blue , unwavering light of Aldur 's Orb , his eyes seemed actually to plunge down and down beneath the surface of the parchment , and the words , hidden for eons , rose like bubbles out of the substance of the rttnll . " Rut Behold , " the crucial passage read , " the Stone which was at the center of the Light shall burn red , and my voice untill speak unto the Child of Light and reveal the name of the Child of Dark . And the Child of Light will take up thep284Guardian 's sword and go forth to seek out that which is hidden . Long will be his quest , and it shall be threefold . And ye shall know that the quest hath begun when the Keeper 's Line is renewed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be no other . Guard it well , for should that seed fall into the hands of the Child of Dark and be taken to the place where the evil dwells , then blind choice alone can decide the outcome . Should the Keeper 's seed be reft away , then must the Beloved and Eternal lead the way . And he shall find the path to the place where the evil dwells in the Mysteries . And in each Mystery shall lie but a part of the path , and he must find them all  --  all  --  or the path will lead awry , and the Dark shall triumph . Hasten therefore to the meeting where the three-fold quest will end . And this meeting will come to pass in a place which is no more , and there will the choice be made . " Garion read it again , and then a third time , feeling an ominouschill as the words echoed and thundered through his consciousness . Finally he rose and went to the door of the candlelit , vaulted chamber . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest standing just outside . " And send someone down to the river . Have him tell the captain of my ship to get things ready . Just as soon as I finish here , I have to leave for Kotu . " The priest was staring wide-eyed at the incandescently glowing Orb in Garion 's hand . " Do n't just stand there , man , move ! " Garion told him . " The whole world 's hanging on this ! " The priest blinked and then scurried away . The following day , Garion was in Kotu , and about a day and a half later , he reached Aldurford in northern Algaria . As luck had it , a herd of half-wild Algarian cattle was being driven across that wide , shallow place in the mighty river on their way to Muros , and Garion went immediately in search of the herdmaster.  | " I 'm going to need two horses , " he said , skipping the customarycourtesies . " The best you have . I have to be in the Vale of Aldur before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce-looking Algar warrior in black leather , looked at him speculatively . " Good horses are expensive , your Majesty , " he ventured , his eyes coming alight . ' ' That 's beside the point . Please have them ready in a quarter of an hour  --  and throw some food in a saddlebag for nie . " Does n't your Majesty even want to discuss the price ? " Hie herd master 's voice betrayed his profound disappointment . " Not particularly , " Garion told him . " Just add it all up , and I 'll pay it . " The herd master sighed . " Take them as a gift , your Majesty , " he said . Then he looked mournfully at the Rivan King . " You do realize , of course , that you 've absolutely ruined my whole afternoon . " Garion gave him a tight , knowing grin . " If I had the time , good herd master , I 'd haggle with you for the whole day  --  right down to the last penny  --  but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head sadly . " Do n't take it so hard , my friend , " Garion told him . " If vuu like , I 'll curse your name to everyone I meet and tell them all how badly you cheated me . " The herd master 's eyes brightened . " That would be extremelykind of your Majesty , " he said . He caught Garion 's Amused look . " One does have a certain reputation to maintain , alter all . The horses will be ready whenever you are . I 'll select them for you myself . " Carion made good time as he galloped south . He kept his horses fresh and strong by changing mounts every two or three leagues . The long journey in quest of the Orb had taught him many ways to conserve the strength of a good horse , and he utilized them all . When a steep hill stood in his path , hep286slowed to a walk and made up the lost time on the long downhillslope on the other side . When he could , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was on the move again at first light in the morning . Steadily he moved south through the knee-high sea of wavingprairie grass lying lush and green under the warm spring sun . He avoided the man-made mountain of the Algarian Stronghold , knowing that King Cho-Hag and Queen Silar , and certainly Hettar and Adara , would insist that he stop over for a day or so . Regretfully , he also passed a league or so to the west of Poledra 's cottage . He hoped that there would be time later to visit Aunt Poi , Durnik , and Errand . Right now he had to get to Belgarath with the passage of the Codex he had so carefully copied and which now rode in the inside pocket of his doublet . When at last he arrived at Belgarath 's squat , round tower , his legs were so tired that they trembled under him as he swung down from his lathered horse . He went immediately to the large , flat-faced rock that was the door to the tower . " Grandfather ! " he shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! " There was no answer . The squat tower loomed silently up out of the tall grass , etched sharply against the sky . Garion had not even considered the possibility that the old man might not be here . " Grandfather ! " he called again . There was still no answer . A red-winged blackbird swooped in , landed atop the tower , and peered curiously down at Garion . Then it began to preen its feathers . Almost sick with disappointment , Garion stared at the silent rock that always swung aside for Belgarath . Although he knew that it was a serious breach of etiquette , he pulled in his concentration , looked at the rock , and said , " Open . " The stone gave a startled little lurch and swung obediently aside . Garion went in and quickly mounted the stairs , rememberingat the last instant to step up over the one wherep287the loose stone still lay unrepaired . " Grandfather ! " he called up the stairway . " Garion ? " the old man 's voice coming from above sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , " Garion said , coming up the cluttered , round room at the top of the stairs . " Did n't you hear me ? " " I was concentrating on something , " the old man replied . " What 's the matter ? What are you doing here ? " " I finally found that passage , " Garion told him . " What passage ? " " The one in the Mrin Codex  --  the one that was missing . " lielgarath 's expression grew suddenly tense , even wary . " W hat are you talking about , boy ? There 's no missing passage in the Mrin Codex . " " We talked about it at Riva . Do n't you remember ? It 's the place where there 's a blot on that page . I pointed it out toIUclgarath 's look grew disgusted . " You came here and interruptedme over that ? " His tone was scathing . Carion stared at him . This was not the Belgarath he knew . The old man had never treated him so coldly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with you ? This is very important . Somebody has somehow obscured a part of the Codex . When you read it , there 's a part you do n't see . " " But you can see it ? " Belgarath said in a voice filled almost with contempt . " You ? A boy who could n't even read until he was almost grown ? The rest of us have been studying that Codex for thousands of years , and now you come along and tell us that we 've been missing something ? " " listen to me , Grandfather . I 'm trying to explain . Whencome to that place , something happens to your mind . You do n't pay any attention to it because , for some reason , you do n't want to . " " Nonsense ! " Belgarath snorted . " I do n't need some rank beginner trying to tell me how to study . " " Wo n't you at least look at what I found ? " Garion begged ,  |p288taking  the parchment out of his inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgarath shouted , slapping the parchment away . " Take that nonsense away from me . Get out of my tower , Garion ! " " Grandfather ! " " Get out of here ! " The old man 's face was pale with anger , and his eyes flashed . Garion was so hurt by his Grandfather 's words that tears actually welled up in his eyes . How could Belgarath talk to him this way ? The old man became even more agitated . He began to pace up and down , muttering angrily to himself . " I have work to do  --  important work  --  and you come bursting in here with this wild tale about something being missing . How dare you ? How dare you interrupt me with this idiocy ? Do n't you know who I am ? " He gestured at the parchment Garion had picked up and was holding again . " Get that disgusting thing out of my sight ! " And then Garion suddenly understood . Whatever or whoever it was that was trying to conceal the words hidden in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgarathinto this uncharacteristic rage to keep him from reading the passage . There was only one way to break that strange compulsion not to see . Garion laid the parchment on a table , then coldly and deliberately unbuckled the heavy belt running across his chest , removed Iron-grip 's sword from his back , and stood it against the wall . He put his hand to the Orb on the pommel of the sword and said , " Come off . " The Orb came free in his hand , glowing at his touch . " What are you doing ? " Belgarath demanded of him . " I 'm going to have to make you see what I 'm talking about , Grandfather , " Garion said unhappily . " I do n't want to hurt you , but you have to look . " He walked slowly and deliberately toward Belgarath , the Orb extended before him.  | " Garion , " Belgarath said , backing away apprehensively , " lie careful with that . " " Go to the table , Grandfather , " Garion told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found . " " Are you threatening me ? " Belgarath demanded incredulously . " Just do it , Grandfather . " We do n't behave this way toward each other , Garion , " the old man said , still backing away from the glowing Orb . " ' Ile table , " Garion repeated . " Go over there and read . " Sweat was standing out on Belgarath 's forehead . Reluctantly , almost as if it were causing him some obscure kind of pain , he went to the table and bent over the parchment sheet . Then he shook his head . " I ca n't see it , " he declared , though burning candle stood right beside the sheet . " It 's too dark in here . " " I Jere , " Garion said , reaching forth with the glowing Orb , " I 'll light it for you . " The Orb flared , and its blue light fell across the sheet and filled the room . " Read it , Grandfather , " Gm-ion said implacably . Iiclgarath stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Read it . " liclgarath dropped his eyes to the page lying before him , and suddenly he gasped . " Where  --  ? How did you get this ? " " It was under that blot . Can you see it now ? " " Of course I can see it . " Excitedly Belgarath picked up the Orec and read it again . His hands were actually trembling . " Are you sure this is exactly what it said ? " " I copied it word for word , Grandfather  --  right off the originalscroll . " " How were you able to see it ? " The same way you are  --  by the light of the Orb . Somehow that stakes it clear . " " Astonishing , " the old man said . " I wonder  --  " He went quickly to a cabinet standing by the wall , rummaged aroundp290for a moment , and then came back to the table with a scroll in his hands . He quickly unrolled it . " Hold the Orb closer , boy , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Grandfather as the buried words slowly rose to the surface just as they had in the shrine . " Absolutely amazing , " Belgarath marveled . " It 's blurred , and some of the words are n't clear , but it 's there . It 's all there . How is it possible that none of us noticed this before  --  and how did you discover it ? " " I had help , Grandfather . The voice told me that I had to read it in a certain kind of light . " He hesitated , knowing how much pain what he had to say would cause the old man . " And then , Poledra came to visit us . " " Poledra ? " Belgarath spoke his wife 's name with a little catch in his voice . " Someone was making Ce'Nedra do something in her sleep  --  something very dangerous  --  and Poledra came and stopped her . Then she told me that I had to go to the shrine in Drasnia and read the Codex and she specifically told me to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I almost left . It all seemed so stupid somehow . Then I remembered what they had told me and I put it together . As soon as I started reading by the light of the Orb , that feeling that I was wasting my time disappeared . Grandfather , what causes that ? I thought it was only me , but it effected you , too . Belgarath thought a moment , frowning . " It was an interdiction , " he explained finally . " Someone at some time put his will to that one spot and made it so repulsive that " no one could even see it . " " But it 's right there  --  even on your copy . How is it that the scribe who copied it could see it well enough to write it down , but we could n't ? " " Many of the scribes in the old days were illiterate , " Belgarathexplained . " You do n't have to be able to read in orderp291to copy something . All those scribes were doing was drawing exact duplicates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was it you called it ? " " Interdiction . It 's a fancy word for what happens . I think eldin invented it . He 's terribly impressed by his own clevernesssometimes . " " The interdiction made the scribes pile all the words on top of each other  --  even though they did n't know what the words meant ? " Ielgarath grunted , his eyes lost in thought . " Whoever did this is very strong  --  and very subtle . I did n't even suspect that someone was tampering with my mind . " " When did it happen ? " " Probably at the same time the Mrin Prophet was speaking the words originally . " " Would the interdiction keep working after the person who caused it was dead ? " " No . " " Then  --  " " Right . He 's still around somewhere . " " Could it be this Zandramas we keep hearing about ? " " ' That 's possible , I suppose . " Belgarath picked up the sheet Garion had copied . " I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Apparently once you break the interdiction for somebody , it stays broken . " He carefully read the sheet again . " ' This is really important , Garion . " " I was fairly sure it was , " Garion replied . " I do n't understand it all , though . The first part is fairly simple  --  the part about the Orb turning red and the name of the Child of Dark being revealed . It sort of looks as if I 'm going to have to make another one of those trips . " " A long one , if this is right . " " What 's this next part mean ? " " Well , as nearly as I can make it out , this quest of yours  --  Nh.itcvcr it is  --  has already started . It began when Geran was dotn . " ' The old man frowned . " I do n't like this part that saysp292that blind choice might make the decision , though . That 's the sort of thing that makes me very nervous . " " Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Garion looked at him . Belgarath shrugged . " It 's a little ostentatious , " he admitted , " but some people do call me the Eternal Man '  --  and when my Master changed my name , he added the syllable Bel ' to my old one . In the old language Bel ' meant ' beloved . ' He smiled a bit sadly . " My master had a way with words sometimes . " " What are these mysteries it talks about ? " " It 's an archaic term . In the old days they used the word mystery ' instead of prophecy . ' As cryptic as some of them are , it sort of makes sense , I guess . " " Ho ! Garion ! Belgarath ! " The voice came to them from outside the tower . " Who 's that ? " Belgarath asked . " Did you tell anybody you were coming here ? " " No , " Garion frowned , " not really . " He went to the window and looked down . A tall , hawk-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lathered and exhausted-looking horse . " Hettar ! " Garion called down to him . " What 's the matter ? " " Let me in , Garion , " Hettar replied . " I have to talk with you . " Belgarath joined Garion at the window . " The door 's around on the other side , " he called down . " I 'll open it for you . Be careful of the stone on that fifth step , " he cautioned , as the tall man started around the tower . " It 's loose . " " When are you going to fix that , Grandfather ? " Garion asked . He felt the faint , familiar surge as the old man opened the door . " Oh , I 'll get to it one of these days . " Hettar 's hawklike face was bleak as he came up into the round room at the top of the tower.  | " What 's all the urgency , Hettar ? " Garion askrd . " I 've ncvcr seen you ride a horse into the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 've got to go back to Riva Immediately , Garion , " he said . Is something wrong there ? " Garion asked , a sudden chill coming over him. llcttar sighed . " I hate to be the one to have to tell you this , Garion , but Ce'Nedra sent word for me to get you as fast as I possibly could . You 've got to go back to Riva at once . " Garion steeled himself , a dozen dreadful possibilities arisingin his imagination . " Why ? " he asked quietly . " I 'm sorry , Garion  --  more sorry than I can possibly say  --  but Brand has been murdered . "  |p297Lieutenant  Bledik was one of those sober-minded young Sendarian officers who took everything very seriously . He arrived at the Lion Inn in the port city of Camaar promptly on time and was escorted upstairs by the aproned innkeeper . The rooms in which Garion and the others were staying were airy and well-furnished and looked out over the harbor . Garion stood at the window holding aside one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be possible to penetrate all those leagues of open water and see what was happening at Riva . " You sent for me , your Majesty ? " Bledik asked with a respectfulbow . " Ah , Lieutenant , come in , " Garion said , turning from thep298window . " I have an urgent message for King Fulrach . How fast do you think you can get to Sendar ? " The lieutenant considered it . One look at his sober face told Garion that the young man always considered everything . Bledik pursed his lips , absently adjusting the collar of his scarletuniform . " If I ride straight through and change horses at every hostel along the way , I can be at the palace by late tomorrow afternoon . " " Good , " Garion said . He handed the young officer the folded and sealed letter to the Sendarian king . " When you see King Fulrach , tell him that I 've sent Lord Hettar of Algaria to all of the Alorn Kings to tell them that I 'm calling a meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him there as well . " " Yes , your Majesty . " " And tell him that the Rivan Warder has been murdered . " Bledik 's eyes widened , and his face went pale . " No ! " he gasped . " Who was responsible ? " " I do n't know any of the details yet , but , as soon as we can hire a ship , we 're going across to the island . " " Garion , dear , " Polgara said from her chair by the window , " you explained everything in the letter . The lieutenant has a long way to go , and you 're delaying him . " " You 're probably right , Aunt Pol , " he admitted . He turned back to Bledik . " Will you need any money or anything ? " he asked . " No , your Majesty . " " You 'd better get started then . " " At once , your Majesty . " The lieutenant saluted and went out . Garion began to pace up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plain blue traveling gown , continued to mend one of Errand 's tunics , her needle flashing in the sunlight streaming through the window . " How can you be so calm ? " he demanded of her . ' " I 'm not , dear , " she replied . " That 's why I 'm sewing . "  | " What 's taking them so long ? " he fretted . " Hiring a ship takes time , Garion . It 's not exactly like buying a loaf of bread . " " Who could possibly have wanted to hurt Brand ? " he burst out . He had asked that same question over and over in the week or more since they had left the Vale . The big , sad-faced Warder had been so totally devoted to Garion and the Rivan " Throne that he had possessed virtually no separate identity . So far as Garion knew , Brand had not had an enemy in the world . " That 's one of the first things we 'll want to find out when we get to Riva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm yourself . Pacing about does n't accomplish anything and it 's very distracting . " It was almost evening when Belgarath , Durnik , and Errand returned , bringing with them a tall , gray-haired Rivan whose clothing carried those distinctive smells of salt-water and tar that identified him as a sailor . " This is Captain Jandra , " Belgarath introduced him . " He 's agreed to ferry us across to the Isle . " " Thank you , Captain , " Garion said simply . " My pleasure , your Majesty , " Jandra replied with a stiff how . " Have you just come in from Riva ? " Polgara asked him . " Yesterday afternoon , my Lady . " " Have you any idea at all about what happened there ? " " We did n't get too many details down at the harbor , my Lady . Sometimes the people up at the Citadel are sort of secretive  --  no offense , your Majesty . There are all kinds of rumors going about the city , though  --  most of them pretty farfetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Warder w as attacked and killed by a group of Chereks . " " Chereks ! " Garion exclaimed . " Everyone agrees on that point , your Majesty . Some people sa ' that all the assassins were killed . Others say that therep300were some survivors . I could n't really say for sure , but I know that they did bury six of them . " " Good , " Belgarath grunted . " Not if there were only six to begin with , father , " Polgara told him . " We need answers , not bodies . " " Uh  --  pardon me , your Majesty , " Jandra said a little uncomfortably . " It might not be my place to say this , but some of the rumors in the city say that the Chereks were officials of some kind from Val Alorn and that they were sent by King Anheg . " " Anheg ? That 's absurd . " " That 's what some people are saying , your Majesty . I do n't put much stock in it myself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want going much further . The Warder was well-liked in Riva , and a lot of people have taken to polishing their swords  --  if you take my meaning . " " I think I 'd better get home as soon as possible , " Garion said . " How long will it take us to get to Riva ? " The captain thought it over . " My ship is n't as fast as a Cherek warship , " he apologized . " Let 's say three days  --  if the weather holds . We can leave on the morning tide , if you can be ready . " " We 'll do that , then , " Garion said . It was late summer on the Sea of the Winds , and the weather held clear and sunny . Jandra 's ship plowed steadilythrough the sparkling , sun-touched waves , heeling to one side under a quartering wind . Garion spent most of the voyage pacing moodily up and down the deck . When , on the third day out from Camaar , the jagged shape of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kind of desperate impatiencecame over him . There were so many questions that had to be answered and so many things that had to be done that even the hour or so that it would take to reach the harbor seemed an intolerable delay . It was midafternoon when Jandra 's ship rounded the head/land at the harbor mouth and made for the stone quays at the foot of the city . " I 'm going on ahead , " Garion told the others . " Follow me as soon as you can . " And even as the sailors were making fast the hawsers , he leaped across to the salt-crusted stones of the quay and started up toward the Citadel , taking the steps two at a time . Ce'Nedra was waiting for him at the massive main doors of the Citadel , garbed in a black mourning dress . Her face was pale , and her eyes full of tears . " Oh , Garion , " she cried as he reached her . She threw her arms about his neck and began to sob against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ce'Nedra ? " he asked , holding her in his arms . " Hettar did n't have too many details . " " It was about three weeks ago , " she sobbed . " Poor Brand . That poor , dear man . " " Do you know where I can find Kail ? " " He 's been working at Brand 's desk , " she replied . " I do n't think he 's slept for more than a few hours any night since it happened . " " Aunt Pol and the others should be along shortly . I 'm going to talk with Kail . Would you bring them as soon as they get here ? " " Of course , dear , " she replied , wiping her eyes with the back of her hand . " We 'll talk later , " he said . " Right now I 've got to find out what happened . " " Garion , " she said gravely , " they were Chereks . " " That 's what I 'd heard , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottom of this as quickly as possible . " The corridors of the Citadel were muted and oddly silent . As Garion strode toward that group of rooms in the west wing from which Brand had always conducted the day-to-day business of the kingdom , the servants and functionaries he encounteredbowed soberly and stood aside for him . Kail was dressed in deepest black , and his face was gray with fatigue and deep sorrow . The orderly stacks of docu/ments on the top of Brand 's heavy desk , however , gave evidence that despite his grief he had been working not only at his own duties but at his father 's as well . He looked up as Garion entered the room and started to rise . " Do n't , " Garion said . " We have too much to do for formalities . " He looked at his weary friend . " I 'm sorry , Kail , " he said sadly . " I 'm more sorry than I can possibly tell you . " " Thank you , your Majesty . " Garion sank into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weariness coming over him in a wave . " I have n't been able to get any details , " he said . " Could you tell me exactly what happened ? " Kail nodded and leaned back in his chair . " It was about a month ago , " he began , " not long after you left for Drasnia . A trade deputation from King Anheg arrived . All their credentialsseemed to be in order , but they were a bit vague about exactly what the purpose of their visit was . We extended them the customary courtesies , and most of the time they stayed in the rooms we assigned them . Then , late one night , my father had been discussing some matters with Queen Ce'Nedra and was on his way back to his own quarters when he encountered them in the corridor leading to the royal apartments . He asked if he could help them , and they attacked him without any warning whatsoever . " Kail stopped , and Garioncould see his jaws tightly clenched . He drew in a deep breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty , my father was n't even armed . He did his best to defend himself , and he was able to call for help before they cut him down . My brothers and I ran to his aid  --  along with several of the Citadel guards  --  and we all did our best to capture the assassins , but they absolutely refused to surrender . " He frowned . " It was almost as if they were deliberately throwing their lives away . We had no choice but to kill them . " " All of them ? " Garion asked with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach . " All but one , " Kail - replied . " My brother , Brin , hit himp303across the back of the head with the butt of an axe . He 's been unconscious ever since . " " Aunt Pol 's with me , " Garion said . " She 'll wake him  --  if anybody can . " His face went bleak . " And when he does wake up , he and I are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers , too , " Kail agreed . He paused , his face troubled . " Belgarion , they carried a letter from King Anheg . That 's why we let them into the Citadel . " " I 'm not sure there 's a logical explaination . " " I have the letter . It 's over his seal and his signature . " " I 've called a meeting of the Alorn Council , " Garion told him . " As soon as Anheg gets here , we 'll be able to clear this up . " If he comes , " Kail added somberly . The door opened quietly , and Ce'Nedra led the others into the room . " All right , " Belgarath said crisply , " Let 's see if we can sort this out . Did any of them survive ? " " One , Ancient One , " Kail replied , " but he 's unconscious . " " Where is he ? " Polgara asked . " We put him in a room in the north tower , my Lady . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been able to revive him yet . " " I 'll go at once , " she said . Errand crossed the room to where Kail sat and wordlessly laid a sympathetic hand on the young Rivan 's shoulder . Kail 's jaws clenched again , and tears suddenly welled up in his eyes . " They had a letter from Anheg , Grandfather , " Garion told the old man . " That 's how they got inside the Citadel . " " Do you have the letter anywhere ? " Belgarath asked Kail . " Yes , Ancient One . It 's right here . " Kail began to leaf through a stack of documents . " That seems to be the best place to start , " the old man said . " The entire Alorn alliance is hanging on this , so we 'd better get it straightened out fast . " It was late evening by the time Polgara completed her ex/amination of the lone surviving assassin . When she came into the royal apartment where the discussions had been continuing , her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely nothing I can do with him , " she reported . " The entire back of his skull has been crushed . He 's ony barely alive ; if I try to wake him , he 'll die immediately . " " I need some answers , Aunt Pol , " Garion said . " How long do you think it 's going to be until he wakes up ? " She shook her head . " I doubt that he ever will  --  and even if.he does , it 's unlikely that he 's going to be able to say anythingcoherent . About all that 's holding his brains together right now is his scalp . " He looked at her helplessly . " Could n't you  --  " " No , Garion . There 's nothing left of his mind to work with . " Two days later , King Cho-Hag , Chief of the Clan-Chiefs of the Algar horsemen , arrived , accompanied by Queen Silar and Adara , Garion 's tall , dark-haired cousin . " A very sad occasion , " Cho-Hag said to Garion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quay . " It seems lately that about the only time we all get together is to attend funerals , " Garion agreed . " Where 's Hettar ? " " I think he 's at Val Alorn , " Cho-Hag replied . " He 'll probablycome here with Anheg . " " That 's something we 're going to have to talk about , " Garionsaid . Cho-Hag lifted one eyebrow . " The people who killed Brand were Chereks , " Garion explainedquietly . " They had a letter from Anheg . " " Anheg could not have had anything to do with it , " ChoHagdeclared . " He loved Brand like a brother . There had to be somebody else behind it . " " I 'm sure you 're right , but there 's a great deal of suspicion here in Riva right now . There are some people who are even talking war . " Cho-Hag 's face went grim.  | " That 's why we have to get to the truth in a hurry , " Garion told hirn . " We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely out of hand . " The next day King Fulrach of Sendaria arrived in the harbor ; with him on their stout , broad-beamed ship was the onearmedGeneral Brendig , the ancient but still-vigorous Earl of Seline , and , surprisingly , Queen Layla herself , the lady whose fear of sea travel had become almost legendary . That same afternoon , Queen Porenn , still in deepest mourning for her husband , disembarked from the black-painted Drasnian vesselthat had carried her from Boktor , along with her son , the boy-king Kheva and the bone-thin Margrave Khendon , the man known as Javelin . " Oh , my dear Garion , " Porenn said , embracing him at the foot of the gangway . " I can not tell you how sorry I am . " " We 've all lost one of our dearest friends , " he replied . He turned to Kheva . " Your Majesty , " he said with a formal bow . " Your Majesty , " Kheva replied , also bowing . " We heard that there 's some mystery surrounding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good at clearing up mysteries . " " Margrave , " Garion greeted the Drasnian Chief of Intelligence . " Your Majesty , " Javelin responded . He turned and extendedone hand to a young woman with honey-blond hair and soft brown eyes who was coming down the gangway . " You do remember my niece , do n't you ? " " Margravine Liselle , " Garion greeted her . " Your Majesty , " she replied with a formal curtsy . Although she was probably not even aware of it , the hint of a dimple in each of her cheeks gave her expression a slightly impish cast . " My uncle has pressed me into service as his secretary . He pretends failing eyesight , but I think perhaps it 's just an excuse to avoid giving me a genuine assignment . Older relativestend to be overprotective sometimes , do n't you think ? "  |p306Garion  smiled briefly . " Has anyone heard from Silk ? " he asked . " He 's at Rheon , " Javelin replied , " trying to gather information about the activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes he can be hard to find . I expect he 'll be along soon , though . " " Has Anheg arrived yet ? " Queen Porenn asked . Garion shook his head . " Cho-Hag and Fulrach are here , but there 's no word from Anheg yet . " " We 've heard that some people suspect him , " the little blond queen said . " It simply can not be true , Garion . " " I 'm sure he 'll be able to explain everything as soon as he arrives . " " Did any of the assassins survive ? " Javelin asked . " One , " Garion told him , " but I 'm afraid that he wo n't be much help to us . One of Brand 's sons bashed in his head . It does n't appear that he 's ever going to wake up . " " Pity , " Javelin murmured briefly , " but a man does n't always have to be able to talk in order to provide information . " " I hope you 're right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later that evening were subdued . Though no one stated it openly , they were all reluctant to speak of the bleak possibility which faced them . To raise that question without Anheg 's being present might have solidifiedthe doubts and suspicions and given the entire meetinga tone none of them were willing to assume . " When is Brand 's funeral to be held ? " Porenn asked quietly . " As soon as Anheg arrives , I guess , " Garion replied . " Have you made any decisions concerning his office ? " Fulrachasked . " I do n't quite follow you . " " The position of Warder originated a long time ago in order to fill the vacuum that existed after the Nyissans murdered King Gorek and his family . Now that you occupy the throne , do you really need a Warder ? "  | " To be honest with you , I had n't really thought about it . Brand 's always been here . He seemed as permanent as the stones of the Citadel itself . " " Who 's been doing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silvery haired old Earl of Seline asked . " His second son , Kail . " " You have many other responsibilities , Belgarion , " the Earl pointed out . " You really do need someone here to manage the day-to-day details  --  at least until the present crisis has passed . I do n't think , however , that any final decision about the post of Warder needs to be made just now . I 'm sure that if you asked him , Kail would continue to perform his father 's duties without a formal appointment . " " He 's right , Garion , " Ce'Nedra said . " Kail 's absolutely devoted to you . He 'll do anything you ask him to do . " " If this young man is doing an adequate job , it 's probably best to let him continue , " Seline suggested . Then he smiled briefly . " There 's an old Sendarian adage that says , If it is n't broken , do n't try to fix it . ' " The following morning an ungainly-looking ship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously top-heavy spread of sail . Garion , who stood atop the battlements of the Citadel talking quietly with Javelin , frowned as he looked down at it . " What kind of ship is that ? " he asked . " I do n't recognize the construction . " " It 's Arendish , your Majesty . They feel the need to make everything look like a castle . " " I did n't know that the Arends even had any ships . " " They do n't have very many , " Javelin replied . " Their vesselshave a tendency to capsize whenever they encounter a stiff breeze . " " I guess we 'd better go down and see who it is . " " Right , " Javelin agreed . The passengers aboard the clumsy Arendish vessel proved to be old friends . Mandorallen , the mighty Baron of Vo Mandor , stood at the rail , gleaming in full armor . At his side stoodp308Lelldorin of Wildantor , and with them were their wives , Nerinaand Ariana , both ornately gowned in dark , rich brocades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of thy tragedy , Garion , " Mandorallen shouted across the intervening water as the Arendish crew laboriously maneuvered their awkwardship toward the quay upon which Garion and Javelin waited . " Duty and affection , both for thee and they foully murdered Warder , impell us to aid thee in thy rightful search for vengeance . Korodullin himself would have joined us but for an illness which hath laid him low . " " I suppose I should have expected this , " Garion murmured . " Are they likely to complicate matters ? " Javelin asked quietly . Garion shuddered . " You have no idea . " It was not until two days later that the Seabird , with Barak at the tiller , rounded the headland and sailed into the harbor . The rails were lined with burly Cherek warriors in chain-mail shirts . Their faces were alert , and their eyes were wary as Barak steered his ship up to the quay . When Garion reached the foot of the long flight of stone steps leading down from the Citadel , a sizeable crowd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most of the men who stood there with grim faces had weapons at their sides . " It looks as if we 've got a situation on our hands here , " Garion said quietly to Kail , who had accompanied him . " I think we 'd better try to put the best face on this meeting . " Kail looked at the angry faces of the townspeople pressing toward the wharves . " Perhaps you 're right , Belgarion , " he agreed . " We 're going to have to put on a show of cordiality when we greet Anheg . " " You ask a great deal , Belgarion . " " I hate to put it this way , Kail , but I 'm not asking . Those Chereks along the rail are Anheg 's personal bodyguard . If any/thing starts here , there 's going to be a lot of bloodshed  --  and probably the beginning of a war that none of us wants . Now smile , and let 's go welcome the King of Cherek . " To give it the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck of Barak 's ship so that his meeting with King Anheg could take place in full view of the angry crowd . Barak , clad in a formal green doublet and looking even larger than he had the last time Garion had seen him , strode down the deck to meet them . " This is a very bleak time for us all , " he declared as he shook hands first with Garion and then with Kail . " Anheg and Hettar are below with the ladies . " " Ladies ? " Garion asked . " Islena and Merel . " " You 've heard the rumors ? " Garion asked him . Barak nodded . " That 's one of the reasons we brought our wives . " " Good idea , " Garion said approvingly . " A man who 's comingsomeplace to pick a fight does n't usually bring his wife along , and we all want to give this the best possible appearance . " " I 'll go down and get Anheg , " Barak said , casting a quick glance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . King Anheg 's brutish , black-bearded face was haggard and drawn when he emerged from belowdecks in his usual blue robe . " Anheg , my friend , " Garion said in a voice intended to carry to the crowd . He hurried forward and caught the Cherek king in a rough embrace . " I think we should smile , " he whispered . " We want to let those people know we 're still the best of friends . " " Are we , Garion ? " Anheg asked in a subdued voice . " Nothing has changed at all , Anheg , " Garion said firmly . " Let 's get on with this , then . " Anheg raised his voice . " The royal house of Cherek extends its condolences to thevan Throne in this hour of grief , " he declared formally . " Hypocrite ! " a voice from the crowd bellowed.  |p310Anheg  's face went bleak , but Garion moved quickly to the rail , his eyes angry . " Any man who insults my friend insults me , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to say anything to me ? " The crowd drew back nervously . Garion turned back to Anheg . " You look tired , " he said . " I 've been tearing the palace apart  --  and most of Val Alorn as well  --  ever since I heard about what happened , but I haven'tbeen able to find a single clue . " The black-bearded Cherek king stopped and looked straight into Garion 's face . His eyes had a pleading look in them . " I swear to you , Garion , upon my life , that I had nothing whatsoever to do with the death of Brand . " " I know that , Anheg , " Garion said simply . He glanced at the still-angry crowd . " Maybe we 'd better get Hettar and the ladies and go on up to the Citadel . The others are all there , and we want to get started . " He turned to Kail . " As soon as we get there , I want you to send down some men to disperse these people . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want any trouble here . " " Is it that bad ? " Anheg asked very quietly . " Just a precaution , " Garion said . " I want to keep things under control until we get to the bottom of this . "  |p311The  funeral of Brand , the Rivan Warder , took place the following day in the Hall of the Rivan King . Garion , dressed all in black , sat on the basalt throne with Ce'Nedra at his side as the Rivan Deacon delivered the eulogy to the crowded Hall. ' he presence of King Anheg of Cherek at that sorrowful ceremony caused an angry undertone among the members of the Rivan nobility , and it was only their profound respect for Brand and Garion 's flinty gaze that prevented the whispers at the back of the Hall from becoming open accusations . Anheg , wated between Porenn and Cho-Hag , remained **25;15303;TOOLONG the services and he left the Hall immediately upon their conclusion . " I 've never seen him like this , " Barak said quietly to Garion after the ceremony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he does n't know how to deal with it . " " No one 's accusing him now , " Garion replied quickly . " Turn around and look at the faces of your subjects , Garion , " Barak said sadly . " There 's an accusation in every single eye . " Garion sighed . " I do n't have to look . I know exactly what they 're thinking . " " When do you want to start the meetings ? " " Let 's wait a bit , " Garion decided . " I do n't particularly want Anheg going through the corridors of the Citadel while all these mourners arc drifting about with daggers in their belts . " " Sound thinking , " Barak agreed . They gathered about midafternoon in the blue-draped council chamber in the south tower . As soon as Kail had closed the door , Anheg rose and faced them . " I want to state right at the outset that I had absolutely nothing to do with what happened here , " he declared . " Brand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cut off my arm before I 'd have hurt him . You have my word for that  --  both as a king and as an Alorn . " " No one 's accusing you of anything , Anheg , " Cho-Hag said quietly . " Ha ! I 'm not nearly as stupid as I look , Cho-Hag  --  and even if I were , I still have ears . The people here in Riva have done everything short of spitting in my face . " The silvery-haired Earl of Seline leaned back in his chair . " I think perhaps that all of these suspicions  --  totally unfounded , of course  --  stem from that letter the assassins presentedwhen they came here . Might it not be the quickest way to proceed to begin by examining that document ? "  | " Not a bad idea , " Garion said . He turned to Kail . " Could we see the letter ? " " Ah  --  Ancient Belgarath has it , Sire , " Kail said . " Oh  --  that 's right , " Belgarath said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gray tunic , drew out a folded parchment , and handed it to the old Sendarian nobleman . " It looks more or less in order , " the Earl mused after he had read it . " Let me see that , " Anheg demanded . He held the documentdistastefully , scowling as he read . " That 's my signature , all right , " he admitted , " and my seal , but I certainly did n't write this . " Garion had a thought . " Do you always read everything they bring you to sign ? " he asked . " I know that there are times when they bring me whole stacks of things to sign , and I just write my name at the bottom of each one . What I 'm getting at is  --  could someone have slipped this into a pile of other documents so that you signed it without knowing what it said ? " Anheg shook his head . " That happened to me once , " he said . " Now I read everything before I sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put my name to . That way I know it says exactly what I want it to say . " He thrust the letter toward Garion . " Look at this , " he said , pointing at the second paragraph . " Foreasmuch as trade is the lifeblood of both our kingdoms  --  ' and so on . Blast it , Garion ! I 've never used the word foreasmuch ' in my entire life . " " How do we reconcile this , then ? " the Earl of Seline asked . " We have authenticated the signature and seal . King Anheg declares that he not only reads everything he signs but that he also dictates every letter and proclamation personally . And vet we find textual inconsistencies in the document . " " Seline , " Anheg said acidly , " did you ever dabble in law ? You sound a great deal like a lawyer . " The Earl laughed . " Merely trying to be concise , your Majcsty , " he said.  | " I hate lawyers . " The damning letter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing was resolved . Garion went wearily to bed that night as confused and filled with doubts as he had been when they started . He slept badly and woke late . As he lay in the canopied royal bed , still trying to sort out his thoughts , he could hear voices coming from the adjoining room . Almost idly he began to identify those voices . Ce'Nedra was there , of course , and Aunt Pol . Queen Layla 's giddy laugh made her easily identifiable . Nerina and Ariana , because of their Mimbrate dialect , were as easy . There were others as well , but the individuality of their voices was lost in the general chatter . Garion slowly sat up , feeling almost as if he had not slept at all . He pushed the down-filled comforter aside and swung his feet to the floor . He did not really want to face this day . He sighed and stood up . Briefly he looked at the solid black doublet and hose he had worn the day before , then shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure way be taken as a silent accusation . That must be avoided at all costs . The situation involving King Anheg was so delicate at the moment that the slightest hint could push it into crisis . He crossed to the heavy wardrobe where he kept his clothes , selected one of his customary blue doublets , and began to dress . The conversation in the adjoining room broke off suddenly at the sound of a knock on the door . " Am I welcome here ? " he heard Queen Islena ask in a subdued voice . " Of course you are , " Aunt Pol replied . " I had thought that  --  " Islena faltered , then began again . " Considering everything , I had thought that perhaps it might be better if I stayed away . " " Nonsense , " Queen Layla declared . " Do come in , Islena . " There was a general murmur of agreement . " I swear to you all that my husband is innocent of this atrocity , " Islena said in a clear voice.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Aunt Poi replied quietly . " Not openly perhaps , but there are ugly suspicions everywhere . " " I 'm certain that Garion and the others will get to the bottom of it , " Ce'Nedra said firmly . " Then everything will be cleared up . " " My poor Anheg did not sleep at all last night , " Islena told them sadly . " I know that he looks brutish , but inside he 's really very sensitive . This has hurt him deeply . Once he even cried . " " Our lords will requite the tears thy husband hath shed upon the body of the foul villain who lurks behind this monstrousact , " the Baronness Nerina declared . " And the foolish men who doubt his true fidelity shall be covered with shame for their lack of trust , once the truth is out . " " I can only hope that you 're right , " Islena said . " This is a mournful topic , ladies , " Garion 's cousin Adara told the rest of them , " and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all here . " " And what reason is that , gentle Adara ? " Ariana asked . " The baby , Ariana , " Adara replied . " We 've come to see your baby again , Ce'Nedra . I 'm sure he 's not still sleeping , so why do n't you bring him in here so that we can- all fuss over him ? " Ce'Nedra laughed . " I thought you 'd never ask . " The council meeting began about midmorning . The kings and their advisors gathered once more in a blue-draped council chamber . The golden sunlight of a late summer morning streamed in through the windows and a gentle sea breeze stirred the draperies . There was no particular formality in these sessions , and the monarchs and the others lounged comfortably in the velvet-upholstered chairs scattered about the room . " I really do n't think we 'll accomplish too much by chewing ern that letter for another day , " Belgarath began . " Let 's agree that it 's obviously a forgery of some kind and move on . " Hep316looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on the island ? " he asked , " Someone wealthy enough and powerfulenough to hire Cherek assassins ? " Kail frowned . " No one can go through life without stepping on a few toes , Ancient One , " he replied , " but I do n't think anybody was holding that kind of grudge . " " In truth , my friend , " Mandorallen told him , " some men , when they feel that they have been offended , will nurture their rancor in silence and with dissembling guise conceal their enmity until opportunity doth present itself to revenge themselves . The history of Arcndia is replete with stories of such acts . " " It 's a possibility , " King Fulrach agreed . " And it might be better if we start close to home before we begin to go further afield . " " A list might be useful , " Javelin suggested . " If we write down the name of every man on the Isle of the Winds whom Brand might possibly have offended , we can start eliminating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can start investigating . If the man behind this is a Rivan , he 'd either have had to visit Cherek or had some contact with Chereks sometime in the recent past . " It took the remainder of the morning to compile the list . Kail sent for certain documents , and they all considered each of the decisions Brand had made during the past five years . Since the Warder had functioned as the kingdom 's chief magistrate , there had been many decisions and usually a winner and a loser in each case . After lunch , they began the winnowing process , discarding the names of those men without sufficient wealth or power to be able to obtain the services of paid assassins . " It 's narrowing down a bit , " Javelin said as he struck off another name . He held up the list . " We 've got this down to almost manageable proportions . " There was a respectful knock on the door . One of thep317guards posted there spoke briefly with someone outside , then came over to Barak and murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , and followed him from the room . " How about this one ? " Javelin asked Kail , pointing at another name . Kail scratched at one cheek . " I do n't think so , " he replied . " It was a dispute over land , " Javelin pointed out , " and some people get very intense where land is concerned . " " It was only a pasture , " Kail recalled , " and not a very big one . The man has more land than he can keep track of anyway . " Why did he go to the law , then ? " " It was the other man who brought the matter to my father . " Barak came back into the room . " Anheg , " he said to his cousin , " Greldik 's here . He 's got something fairly important to tell you . " Anheg started to rise , then looked around . " Have him come in here , " he said shortly . " I do n't want anybody thinking that I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anheg , " Queen Porenn murmured . " My situation is somewhat peculiar , Porenn . " He pushed his dented crown back into place from where it had slipped down over one ear . The bearded and fur-clad Greldik pushed past the guards and came into the chamber at that point . " You 've got trouble at home , Anheg , " he growled bluntly . " What kind of trouble ? " " I just came back from Jarviksholm , " Gredlik replied . ' They 're very unfriendly there . " " There 's nothing new about that . " " " They tried to sink me , " Greldik said . " They 've lined the tops of the cliffs on both sides of the inlet leading up to the itv with catapults . The boulders were coming down like hailstonesfor a while . "  |p318Anheg  scowled . " Why would they do that ? " " Probably because they did n't want me to see what they 're doing . " " What could they be doing that they 'd want to keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anheg shrugged . " Lots of people build ships in Cherek . " " A hundred at a time ? " " How many ? " " I was busy dodging boulders , so I could n't get an exact count , but the entire upper end of the inlet is lined with yards . The keels have all been laid , and they 're starting on the ribs . Oh , they 're working on the city walls , too . " " The walls ? They 're already higher than the walls of Val Alorn . " " They 're even higher now . " Anheg scowled . " What are they up to ? " " Anheg , when you build a fleet and start strengthening your fortifications , it usually means that you 're getting ready for a war . And when you try to sink the ship of a man known to be friendly to the crown , that usually means that the war is going to be with your king . " " He does have a point , Anheg , " Barak said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Garion asked curiously . " The Bear-cult , " Anheg said in disgust . " They 've been filtering into the town from all over Cherek for the past ten years . " " This is very serious , Anheg , " Barak said . " It 's also totally out of character , " Javelin pointed out . " The cult has never been interested in confrontational politics before . " " What kind of politics ? " Anheg asked . " Another way of saying open war with the crown , " the Drasnian Chief of Intelligence explained . " Say what you mean , man . " " An occupational peculiarity , " Javelin shrugged . " Alwaysp319before , the cult has tried to work from within  --  trying to gather enough support to be able to coerce the kings of the Alorn nations to follow their policies . I do n't think they 've ever even considered open rebellion before . " " There 's a first time for everything , I guess , " Hettar suggested . Javelin was frowning . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and it 's a direct reversal of a policy they 've followed for the past three thousand years . " " People change sometimes , " General Brendig said . " Not the Bear-cult , " Barak told him . " There is n't room enough in a cultist 's mind for more than one idea . " " I think you 'd better get off your behind and get back to Val Alorn , Anheg , " Greldik suggested . " If they get those ships in the water , they 'll control the whole west coast of Cherek . " Anheg shook his head . " I have to stay here , " he declared . " I 've got another matter that 's more important right now . " Greldik shrugged . " It 's your kingdom , " he said , " at least for the time being . " " Thanks , Greldik , " Anheg said drily . " You have no idea how that notion comforts me . How long will it take you to get to Val Alorn ? " " Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the tides at the Bore . " " Go there , " Anheg told him . " Tell the fleet admirals that I want them to move out of Val Alorn and take up stations off the Halberg straits . I think that when this council is over , I 'll want to take a little journey up to Jarviksholm . It should n't take much to burn out those shipyards . " Gredlik 's answering grin was positively vicious . After the council adjourned for the evening , Kail caught up with Garion in the torchlit corridor . " I think there 's something you should consider , Belgarion , " he said quietly . " Oh ?  --  " This moving of the Cherek fleet concerns me . " " It 's Anheg 's fleet , " Garion replied , " and his kingdom . "
