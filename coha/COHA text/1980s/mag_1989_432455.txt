 | Joel Rosenman hated the phrase " An Aquarian Exposition " : what did fish have to do with anything ? Rosenman was one of the four organizers of the Woodstock Music and Arts Festival ; he and business partner John Roberts , whom he 'd met on a Long Island golf course , were the money guys . They had a clearer slogan : " Three Days of Peace and Music . " Eventually both got used . Woodstock began as an outdoor concert by the biggest folk and rock acts of the day . That simple . But who knew what it would turn into ? " Aquarian Exposition " was Michael Lang 's idea . Lang , ex-head-shop owner and manager of a moribund band called Train , and Artie Kornfeld , exCapitol Records VP who 'd been the brains behind the Cowsills , were the music guys . They needed money for their real dream : a recording studio in Woodstock , N.Y. , near where stars like Dylan went to rusticate . The festival ended up in White Lake , 45 miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an " exposition " was right on the money , though not because it showcased the counterculture 's best music and art . Few people remember Woodstock had arts and crafts , and the music , despite the names ? Hendrix , Joplin , the Who , the Band , the Airplane , the Dead ? was n't as good as you recall . ( Do n't believe it ? Rent the movie . ) Overcrowding and underplan ning turned Woodstock into a demonstration of communal living for folks back home . " You wanted to show them that there was some model here , " Abbie Hoffman told Joel Makower , editor of " Woodstock : The Oral History " ( 336 pages . Doubleday . $21.95 ) . " Some ideas that could be used to save the planet . " These days it 's easier to poke fun at the incongruities . That Woodstock was n't in Woodstock . That its best-known song , about getting back to the Garden ? Crosby , Stills and Nash sing it on the movie soundtrack ? was never heard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea that somebody dreamed up Woodstock to make money . ( Even with the movie and record deals , it took until 1980 to break even . ) Or the famous imbroglios : Pete Townshend prodding Hoffman off the stage with his guitar , the trying-hard-not-to-be ominous announcement that " the brown acid now circulating among us is not specifically too good . " Remember the guy in the movie who was filmed getting naked with a ladyfriend in the tall grass ? He sued for a million bucks : being exposed as heterosexual , he claimed , was ruining his hairdressing business . Why even try to suppress a smirk when talking about Woodstock ? The hippie craze , of which it was either the purest emanation or the last gasp , now seems less a spiritual awakening than the result of social dislocations in a boom economy . Vietnam made a peaceable , pleasure-centered life seem even more than usually desirable ; easy money made it temporarily feasible . In 1969 you really could make your rent by clerking part time in a bookstore ? or buying pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you were n't picky about living quarters . If you had no kids to feed . If you had nothing better to do . Woodstock provided three days of respite from even the minimal economic necessity of hippie life . Crews did n't get the fences up in time , so they stopped collecting the $18 tickets on Friday and announced ( redundantly ) that the festival was now free to all corners . On Sunday morning Wavy Gravy ( ne Hugh Romney ) told the crowd to stay in their sleeping bags ; he and his fellow Hog Farm communards , recruited to help out with provisions and security , were serving " breakfast in bed for 400,000 . " When the locals heard that the food was running out , they made sandwiches and hardboiled eggs . ( Which had to be helicoptered in ; all roads had turned into parking lots sometime Friday . ) Like a middle-class parent , Sullivan County clucked its tongue , but did n't cut off the allowance . These weekend Aquarians posed little threat to the American Way . Ask Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anybody that ever has a Woodstock or festival like that , " he advises today , " remember one thing you want to buy : peanut butter and jelly . That 's the first thing I run out of . I should have put 50 cases of peanut butter and 50 cases of jelly . I found out later that peanut butter is very good for you . " Serious hippies did turn up ; a nurse recalls one barefoot girl with calluses like " crepe-rubber soles . " But each of the 60 or so pay phones had a hundred-foot line of kids waiting to call home . Only by their own choice had hippies become , as Janis Joplin said onstage , " a whole new minority group . " This was self-flattery ; Woodstock was for white kids . Those who talk about Woodstock as the greatest outdoor party since the miracle of the loaves and fishes mean mostly this : that 400,000 people did n't tear one another to pieces . One died of a drug overdose ; another was run over by a tractor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe because they had the sense not to hire @#  | Hells Angels to handle security . ( Altamont , four months later , lends weight to that theory . ) Maybe it was just drugs : how can you riot when you ca n't determine whether you 're staring down at a nest of serpents or your own wiggling toes ? But the simplest explanation is that these kids were too well brought up to turn vicious without a few more days of tight space and short rations . They were saved , too , by their sense of irony . Nothing was dumber than a dumb hippie , granted ; but smart hippies had a subversive comic genius . Wavy Gravy 's breakfast in bed , served as a crew member read the funnies over the sound system , affectionately parodied Sunday mornings back home . Life was theater , and people like Wavy Gravy observed their own performances with bemused lucidity . " I was wearing that cowboy hat , " he says , recalling his work in the tent set up to shelter those on bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole in it that had been eaten by some guy . . . and I had taken a rubber pig and stuck it through the hole , and I had no teeth ; it was before my rainbow bridge . And I was supposed to tell these doctors what to do about crazy people . " The freakout tent was Woodstock at its most disastrous ? and most successful . The Hog Farmers taught that you helped yourself by helping others . " You see that sister coming through the door with her toes in her nose ? " Wavy would tell a still-shaky cosmonaut . " That was youthree hours ago . Now you 're the doctor . " They created ad hoc cops , too , deputizing kids into a " Please Force . " The badge was an armband with a winged-pig emblem ; the secret password was I forget . " Security came from inside , " a friend of the Hog Farmers recalls ; Woodstock was made safe by " telling people that they 're not governed by police . " Try telling that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside because of crack dealers ' cross fire . Who still believes that people can be trusted to police themselves ? It 's not just bad people who need to be kept in line : veterans of the Woodstock era , working harder for more money that buys less , have come to recognize their own cutthroat instincts . And even to take pride in them . What we 've got by way of a 20th-anniversary celebration are " Woodstock Moments " on MTV , a couple of new books and a bunch of crass merchandising schemes . Which is fine . Because when we think of Woodstock we feel , most of all , a suspiciously fierce urge to ridicule it . What did it mean , a bunch of naked hippies in the mud ? Meant nothing . " If we ca n't all live together and be happy , " Artie Kornfeld ? the Cowsills guy ? told an interviewer in the " Woodstock " movie , " if you have to be afraid to walk out in the street , if you have to be afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a way is that to go through this life ? " What a relief to read , in " Woodstock : The Oral History , " that he 'd taken psilocybin and later had to be " Thorazined down . " Otherwise we might still , after all these years , have to take this inconvenient question seriously .
