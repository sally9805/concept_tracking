" A Hornets game is where it ' s at , " explained a delighted Kelly Tripucka , who is the team ' s leading scorer with a 23. 7-point average . " If you ' re not there , or you haven ' t been to a game , or you don ' t talk about it , you ' d better move out of town. " // Twenty-five games into their inaugural N.B.A. season , the Hornets have this 1. 1 million-person metropolitan area in their thrall . Playing in a new 23 , 500-seat arena , Charlotte , once considered a long shot to be an N.B.A. club , leads the league in attendance with more than 20 , 000 a game. // // Seven Victories // While Miami , the league ' s other new franchise , struggled mightily for 18 games until finally winning , the Hornets , coached by Dick Harter , have won seven times , more than two established teams. // On Monday , they lost a close game to the Houston Rockets , but last Friday , they defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Jordan . Tonight , they play at Cleveland. // Situated in the heart of the Atlantic Coast Conference region , Charlotte has long been enamored of college basketball . But while its fans are knowledgeable about the professional game , few have been exposed to the N.B.A. , until now. // Recalling his team ' s visit to the Carolinas ' largest city in mid-November , Harry Weltman , the general manager of the Nets , said : " People were tremendously involved and excited about the team . They cheered timeouts . They cheered the quarters . They cheered the ballboys . It was absolutely wonderful . I think they propelled the players . " <> <> ' Glimpse Into Its Future ' // So enraptured is Charlotte with the team and its surprising early success that the city ' s daily newspaper , The Charlotte Observer , published a front-page story headlined " Winning Streak ! " when the Hornets won back-to-back games . " Charlotte got a glimpse into its future as an N.B.A. franchise Thursday night at Charlotte Coliseum , " wrote the sports columnist Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 1 . " Gosh , is it gon na be fun . " " There ' s an early warmth and passion for this team that exceeds anything I ' ve ever encountered , " said Carl Scheer , the team ' s vice president and general manager . Scheer previously was the general manager of the Los Angeles Clippers , and of the Denver and Carolina teams in the American Basketball Association . In 1986 and 1987 , he was president of the Continental Basketball Association. // " I think everyone in the league is generally surprised not at the level of interest , but at the intensity of interest , " he said. // Careful marketing , visible team involvement in the community and unstinting financial support from George Shinn , the team ' s owner , and the Charlotte city government helped the fledgling franchise attract attention . So did a summer mishap in which the coliseum ' s massive overhead scoreboard was demolished when it came crashing to the floor ; no one was hurt. // But few could have predicted the reaction of the Hornets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly unquenchable thirst for their new team . After the team ' s opening , 40-point loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers , those on hand gave the home team a standing ovation . The next time the collection of rookies and castoffs played at Charlotte , on Election Day , nearly 19 , 000 people showed up to see a contest with the lowly Los Angeles Clippers . " That ' s when I knew we had something going , " said Scheer . <> <> Home Cooking for Reid // When Robert Reid , a 10-year veteran acquired from the Rockets , publicly mentioned that he missed home cooking , he was swamped with dinner invitations . Harter , who was an assistant with the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons for the past five seasons , can ' t walk a city street without being stopped by fans . And during games , the noise and the level of crowd participation have a palpable effect even on grizzled N.B.A. veterans. // " I ' ve never seen anything like it in my life , " said Tripucka , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself as a player watching the fans . It ' s crazy. " // Key to that enthusiasm has been the Hornets ' uptempo offensive style , hard-nosed defense and all-round hustle. // " You can ' t take the night off against us , because I guarantee you ' ll be fighting for your life in the fourth quarter , " Tripucka said . " For us it never changes . We ' ve got to play our best basketball to win. " // Reid describes the group of role players and youngsters as " a summer all-star-league-type team , " which prospers by working hard , playing smart and confounding opponents ' expectations. // " I would say this team ' s type of game is like the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , " he said . " Come out of the clouds , get the job done , and get out of there before they know what went wrong. " // On average the smallest team in the league , and the lightest , the Hornets have remained competitive with a starting lineup of the 6-foot-11-inch rookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former Los Angeles Laker , at forward and a backcourt of Reid and Michael Holton , a fifth-year pro . <> <> Bogues a Key Reserve // Among the key reserves are Tyrone Bogues , a 5-3 playmaker , and Tim Kempton , a rookie free-agent center who made the team after playing well in a tryout camp during the summer . The team ' s top pick in the expansion draft , Dell Curry , broke his wrist early in preseason practice and has only recently returned to action. // Charlotte ' s most prominent reserve has been its first choice in the college draft , Rex Chapman , the shooting guard who left the University of Kentucky after his sophomore season. // Chapman has missed several recent games because of a back injury , but he is scheduled to return against the Knicks on Friday night. // Predictably , given his inexperience , Chapman ' s shot selection has been a source of concern . " He ' s been given the green light probably from first grade up , " Harter said . " One day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t think he has a clue. " // The 57-year-old Harter , a college coach at Penn , Oregon and Penn State before moving to the N.B.A. in 1983 , said he prepared for handling an expansion squad by reading about others ' experiences and by speaking with Dick Motta , former coach of the Dallas Mavericks. // " I didn ' t anticipate going 82-0 ; people have always said , ' If you win 15 games , it ' ll be a miracle , ' " Harter said . " It ' s a five-year project to be a winner . " <> <> Help From the Veterans // Charlotte has gotten a headstart on that project in large part because of the leadership and skills of the team ' s veterans , Harter explained . " You can ' t play with all babies in this league and get away with it , " he said . " That ' s too traumatic. " // Foremost among those leaders has been Tripucka , whose once-promising career lapsed into near-invisibility during two years with the Utah Jazz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stint with Utah as " the worst possible , " although he concedes that life on the bench did have its salutary effects . " I realize how precious it is to be on the floor again , how much fun it is , " said Tripucka. // Said Harter of the Hornets ' good fortune and popularity : " I don ' t know if it ' s a honeymoon . Besides , there are some honeymoons that turn into a permanently good thing. " //
