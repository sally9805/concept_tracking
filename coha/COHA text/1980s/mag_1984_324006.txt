As France 's 1,250-man contingent of the Multi-National Force withdrew from the city last week , the Reagan Administration announced that the U.S. Sixth Fleet , including the battleship New Jersey , would leave the area altogether . With the Italians and British gone , and most remaining U.S. troops aboard the ships , it was the end of Western attempts to help resolve the fratricidal Lebanese conflict . <P> But even before the pullout was completed , the sound of artillery shells and rockets once again shattered the precarious cease-fire that was negotiated in Lausanne , Switzerland , three weeks ago . The first salvos caught many people in the streets of West Beirut . There was panic as motorists and pedestrians raced to get home or to basement shelters . More than 30 people were killed and scores of others injured , making March 28 the worst single day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent consultations among Lebanon 's warlords , and President Amin Gemayel convened the first meeting of the security commission created at the Lausanne conference .

Along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean , dice clatter across wooden backgammon boards , as groups of men , each with one hand nervously working worry beads , cluster to watch . The clinking of delicate china cups announces the arrival of a coffee vendor proffering thick , black Turkish brew . As Sunday fishermen impatiently flick their lines , a water-skier waves from behind a small boat skimming across the blue-green sea . <P> Suspending belief is the best way a Beirut resident can stay sane . Peace has broken out so many times , only to be shattered again , that few dared hope that the latest cease-fire would be anything more than a brief respite . " If you had told us ten years ago that we could expect a decade of war , we would have thrown up our hands , " says Jana Tamer , publisher of a Middle East newsletter . " Tell us now that it will go on for another ten years , and I guess we would just shrug . We are numb . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
