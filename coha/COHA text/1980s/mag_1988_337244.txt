" We thought it was over , " says Blaise Congeni , chief of infectious diseases at Children 's Hospital in Akron . " Now all of a sudden , it 's back . " The object of Dr. Congeni 's concern : rheumatic fever , the fearsome scourge that killed or crippled thousands of American children annually during the first half of the century . Last year doctors reported hundreds of cases of a disease that had all but disappeared from the U.S. more than a decade ago . First spotted in Utah in 1985 , the new miniepidemic has hit cities in Ohio and $ western Pennsylvania , as well as Denver , Boston and Dallas . At two hospitals in Salt Lake City , doctors who normally see only six new cases each year have treated 150 youngsters in the past 24 months . Worse , physicians , who have never fully understood what causes rheumatic fever , have few clues to explain its re-emergence . The culprit could be an unfamiliar strain of bacteria  --  or simply relaxed vigilance against a forgotten foe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous than ever . The disease can scar heart valves , with fatal results . Years ago about half of rheumatic-fever victims developed heart problems ; the current illness seems to attack cardiac muscle more frequently . Doctors can minimize the damage by giving patients steroids to ease the inflammation . However , in about 50% of cases , scarred valves must be surgically repaired . <P> Moreover , rheumatic fever now often strikes without warning . In the past the disease followed within weeks of painful streptococcal throat infections . But the majority of recent victims have experienced only mild symptoms of strep throat , if any . Thus parents have not become alarmed until after the persistent fever and tender joints characteristic of rheumatic fever begin . " If children do n't have a clinical sore throat , no one thinks of strep , " says Pediatrician Ellen Wald at Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh . As a result , youngsters have gone untreated even though doctors can usually prevent rheumatic fever with penicillin . Warns Jane Schaller , chief pediatrician at New England Medical Center in Boston : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be a simple cold . " <P> Searching for an answer , researchers have focused on the bacterial strains that cause strep throat . They isolated bacteria whose presence coincided with the renewed outbreaks of rheumatic fever . The microbes proved to be mucoid strep , a form that was prevalent more than 20 years ago . " It seemed that this may be an important clue , " says Edward Kaplan , professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota Medical School . " We had n't had much rheumatic fever , then we get these mucoid strains . Maybe they were responsible . " There was a problem , however : the mucoid strains also showed up where there was no rheumatic fever . <P> Because there is no vaccine or cure for the disease , prevention is still the best bet . " I 'd recommend that any sore throat be cultured , " New England 's Schaller says . Other experts are worried that parents and doctors too young to remember the rheumatic-fever wards of the past may not recognize the warning signs of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
