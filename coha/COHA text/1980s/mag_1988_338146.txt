To the impoverished peasants of Chile 's rural Seventh Region , the arrival in 1961 of los alemanes ( the Germans ) seemed at first like a godsend . The 60 or so blond , blue-eyed settlers of Colonia Dignidad ( Dignity Colony ) quickly set to work constructing what they called an " educational and benefactory society " on the site of an old ranch near Parral , 250 miles south of Santiago . Before long the newcomers had built a model community that offered many of the area 's 20,000 residents access to employment , trade , free hospital services , an elementary school and , eventually , even a European-style restaurant on the nearby highway . <P> In recent years that utopian vision has gradually given way to a darker , more sinister image . According to accounts provided by former Colonia Dignidad residents , the colony , which now numbers about 350 , has become a virtual prison camp under the control of its founder and leader , Paul Schafer , 66 . A self-proclaimed psychologist , Schafer fled Germany in 1961 with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had sexually abused two boys . <P> Schafer has also been accused by former colony residents of engaging in the illegal importation and manufacture of light arms . Most chilling , perhaps , are accusations by victims and ex-agents of Chile 's dreaded intelligence service , DINA ( renamed CNI in 1977 ) , that Colonia Dignidad has been involved in the torture of leftist opponents of the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte . " These are gruesome matters , " says Hugo Baar , a colony co- founder and a former associate of Schafer 's , who calls the colony a " group that has become poisoned with lies . " <P> The first sign that something was seriously amiss came in 1966 when Wolfgang Muller , then 20 , escaped from Colonia Dignidad for the third time and begged the West German embassy in Santiago not to send him back for fear he would be killed . Muller , who now lives in West Germany under a different name , claimed that Schafer had molested him when he was twelve . He told of regular beatings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and described Schafer as a dictator who condones drug experiments and torture and enforces hard labor from sunup to sundown . <P> The colony again became the object of international attention in 1976 , when a United Nations human rights commission report identified the camp as one of Chile 's detention centers . The next year the West German branch of Amnesty International denounced Colonia Dignidad as a DINA torture center . The colony responded by launching a defamation suit in West Germany against Amnesty International , a legal dispute that continues today . <P> Last February four former Colonia Dignidad members went before a Bonn parliamentary subcommittee and described their lives as regimes of terror . Lotti Packmor , 55 , who left the colony with her husband in 1985 and now lives in Canada , said she had seen young boys given injections in their testicles and described Schafer as having beaten a young girl until " blood spurted from her nose . " Added Georg Packmor : " No one dares even to think of escaping . " A colony spokesman denied the charges and said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
