All wars , it is said , are fought for the benefit of future generations . This is a story of how those generations are responding . The responses vary , as you would expect . The five war zones represented here are quite different from one another , and the children in each place have their differences as well . Nor do those within a single war zone necessarily react in the same ways to the terrors around them . What all these children do have in common is a fierce will to survive-a will that sometimes takes the form of revenge , and at other times , of an abiding serenity . But no matter how they assert themselves , there is an essential good-heartedness in almost all these children , a generosity of nature that transcends and diminishes anything they have suffered . <P> <P> The question one asks is : When do these qualities disappear ? Assume that the children of our modern wars are like those of any time . Why then does the institution of war continue to do so well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them eager to make and keep the peace . If their nations were handed over to them right now , it would be pleasing to think that peace would follow . Of course , nothing will be handed over to them until they are ready , and by that time they will be grown up like us , and changed like us , who supposedly fight for their benefit . For the moment their power is purely potential . So they go about their business-riding bikes , playing ball , dreaming , doing what they are told , and watching with great care all that is being done for them . <P> <P> BELFAST <P> Nothin 's Worth Killing Someone <P> Our fathers and ourselves sowed dragon 's teeth . Our children know and suffer the armed men . - Stephen Vincent Bent <P> If you want the full account of Frank Rowe 's murder , it will not be provided by Paul . Paul is 13 now , was seven at the time , yet he can still only get so far into the story-to the point where " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next house " - before he starts crying . He has a woman 's face , still dimpled , along with the absolutely blue eyes of most Belfast children , and brown hair parted carelessly down the middle : the sort of face the old masters sought . His school tie hangs cockeyed ; it was knotted in a hurry . <P> " What do you feel about your father 's death now ? " <P> His friend Joseph answers for him . Joseph , also 13 , has a small , tight head , a high , clear voice , and his ambition is to grow up and join the Provos . " Revenge . That 's what you want . Is n't it , Paul ? " Paul says nothing . <P> " I 'd want revenge , " says Joseph , looking again to Paul . <P> Paul eventually nods ; then says faintly : " Aye . Revenge . " As if to make his case forever , Joseph thrusts his face toward the American stranger . " You . You 'd take revenge too , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
