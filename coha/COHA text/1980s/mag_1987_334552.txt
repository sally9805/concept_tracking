The Dragon Lady in the now defunct comic strip Terry and the Pirates was voluptuous and deadly . Neither of those adjectives applies to Nancy Reagan . But after she was widely credited with organizing a coup by telephone against former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan , the First Lady was depicted last week as a power-hungry manipulator more devious than any cartoon creature . <P> The most vitriolic attack came from New York Times Columnist William Safire . He wrote of Mrs. Reagan 's " extraordinary vindictiveness " in dumping Regan and called her an " incipient Edith Wilson , " referring to Mrs. Woodrow Wilson 's control of the White House after her husband was incapacitated by a stroke in 1919 . Nancy Reagan , rasped Safire , is " unelected and unaccountable , presuming to control the actions and appointments of the Executive Branch . " <P> The furor grew after the Miami Herald quoted a remark by new Chief of Staff Howard Baker that when Mrs. Reagan " gets her hackles up , she can be a dragon . " A front-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady intended to increase her involvement in White House affairs , including the effort to reach an arms-control agreement with the Soviets . <P> The First Lady added to the hubbub with a doozy of a double entendre that may have been an innocent reference to her childhood but was interpreted as a parting shot at Regan . Appearing at a convention in Washington of the American Camping Association , she told the audience of her girlhood camping experiences : " I do n't think most people associate me with leeches or how to get them off . But I know how to get them off . I 'm an expert at it . " <P> The speculation about his wife 's overreaching made the President angrier than any other aspect of the controversy over the Tower report . Reagan was so irked at the Dragon Lady image that he broke his rule of silence during a photo session to denounce the Nancy stories as " despicable fiction " by people who " should be ashamed of themselves . " Friends rushed to the First Lady 's defense . " Rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press accounts . The First Lady shrugged off the accusations as " ridiculous . " Indeed , while she is by no means bashful about offering advice to her husband , the evidence indicates that she is not quite so all-powerful as the Regan affair suggested . The President resisted sacking his chief of staff until the end of February despite Regan 's all too public feud with Nancy . Her influence , though , is unquestionably special . Last Wednesday , which happened to be the Reagans ' 35th wedding anniversary , the President said , as he often does when people ask him his age , " My life began 35 years ago . " And only Nancy could promise former Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , as she once did , that she would whisper " peace " in Ronald Reagan 's ear each night .
