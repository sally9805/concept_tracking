Sitting is one of the most common positions during waking hours . It also happens to be one of the worst for the back . Choose a chair that provides firm support , especially of the lower back . Keep feet slightly elevated . Get up occasionally , stretch and walk around to relieve the strain . A special tip to men : do not keep a bulging wallet in the back pocket . During long intervals of sitting , it can press on the sciatic nerve , sending shooting pains down the leg . <P> When picking up or lifting things , do not bend from the waist . Squat , keeping the back straight . That reduces pressure on the lumbar area , site of most backaches . <P> Poor sleep posture is a sure invitation to backaches . Use a firm mattress . Lie on the side with a bend to the knees . Avoid lying on the belly , a position that increases the spine 's lumbar curve , causing that familiar sagging called swayback . <P> High-heeled shoes may be in fashion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of line , tilt the pelvis and can lead to trouble . Try hard to resist them . <P> Driving long distances can be a sure pain in the back . Some remedies : get out of the car every hour and walk around for a few minutes ; position the seat forward so that knees are bent ; place a cushion at the small of the back ; if the tilt of a car 's seats can be adjusted , change the angle slightly every so often .

Prolonged standing in one place may not only be dull ; it puts great pressure on the spine . Shifting the weight from one foot to the other also helps relieve the strain of standing in place . At a bar do what experienced patrons have long done : always keep a foot on the rail or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skintight jeans . <P> If they are worn for any length of time , the abdominal muscles , a key prop for the spine , are likely to weaken , and the chances of back injury may increase . <P> Even toting a shoulder bag , attache case or photographic gear can be risky . <P> <P> Heavy loads should be balanced on both shoulders . If the package can not be divided , it should occasionally be switched from side to side to relieve the lopsided pressure . <P> Mother was right : stand up straight . Keep the body relaxed but erect , although not in the ramrod West Point style . Throw back the shoulders , keep the abdomen pulled in . As a check , stand with heels , buttocks , shoulders and head pressed firmly against a wall . If you can barely slip your hand between the wall and the small of the back , mother should have no reason to complain .
