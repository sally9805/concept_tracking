Wait , wait . Wait ! Do n't go away yet . " I think , " laughs Cyndi Lauper , " we all need a break from me . " <P> Oh . <P> " I think she 's a victim of overexposure , " says Freddy DeMann . Freddy manages Madonna , not Cyndi , and frets  --  is , in fact , " absolutely worried "  --  that all the p.r . heat might burn out his client . Now , then . While the ladies play tag with the limelight , a few thoughts occur . <P> Cyndi Lauper 's She 's So Unusual , for anyone without access to electric entertainment of any form , has become the first debut album in history to rack up four top-five singles . Name those tunes and , very likely , you can sing a chorus , along with all the Lauper loopies who cover the age spectrum , from dress-alike five-year-olds to grannies gone groovy : All Through the Night ; She Bop , which inverted Gene Vincent 's classic Be-Bop-a-Lula into a thoroughly unapologetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girls Just Want to Have Fun , a kind of antic feminist anthem that helped get Cyndi on the cover of Ms. as one of its women of the year . No other woman has made an album at any point in her career that launched so many heavy hits . <P> Lauper is nominated for five Grammies , including Best New Artist . She is also a ) nice to her mom , with whom she frequently appears in photos and whom she cast in three of her wacky videos ; b ) tireless , until very recently , in her pursuit of media exposure ( appearances during the past six months have included telethons and Dr. Ruth Westheimer 's TV sex-advice show ) ; and c ) a wrestling fan , who has shown up at ringside to bait her sometime buddy , Captain Lou Albano , with a rush of feminist banter and a fan 's hortatory impertinence . <P> Cyndi Lauper is the manic outsider in every high school class  --  brassy and sensitive , dippy and shrewd  --  whose hair seems to have been colored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of duds gypsies might wear if they had proms . Part Piaf , part Little Peggy March , she also has a razzle- dazzle , multi-octave range , a voice that can coax a broken promise out of a ballad or pin a rocker right to the mat . She has the whole package . But Madonna has the look . <P> Madonna  --  or Madonna Louise Ciccone , as her birth certificate reads in Bay City , Mich.  --  has an action-packed body , always prominently on display , and doleful , knowing eyes that seem to encourage every male fantasy of lust with no limits . " Baby Dietrich ! " exclaimed Glamour Photographer Francesco Scavullo as he shot a fashion layout of the abrasively photogenic young ( 24 ) woman . If she could get her voice around a song the way she moves her shape for the camera , she would be pure nitro.
