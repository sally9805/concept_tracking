txt TOUGH , BITTER WORDS Friday apparently ended any hopes for an imminent solution to the baseball strike that has now wiped out 100 games in eight days . Some of the toughest words came from federal mediator Ken Moffett , who called Friday 's session In New York a " charade " and ended the meeting between representatives of owners and the players ' union after just 80 minutes . Moffett said the talks were " stalemated ... absolutely useless ... a futile , stupid , charade . " No future negotiations were set . Moffett , also involved in trying to head off Monday 's threatened strike of airline traffic controllers , said he will not call for a resumption of the baseball talks over the weekend . Baltimore Orioles shortstop Mark Belanger , representing the players ' union in Friday 's brief talks , said they were conducted in an atmosphere that was " sullen , orchestrated , organized . We 're tired of that . " Ray Grebey , chief negotiator for the owners , agreed that no progress had been made over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boone , the National League player representative , called Friday 's session " fruitless . " " We asked if they had any questions or problems , areas to discuss in the proposals on the table , " Boone said . " They said , ' No , we have nothing for you . ' Until something is forthcoming from the owners , we 're willing to meet , but there are no other scheduled meetings . " And Cincinnati pitcher Tom Seaver , who characteristically tries to find something positive to say , could n't . " I 'd like to say something constructive , " he said , " but the position Ray Grebey takes is absolutely destructive . " To go up there and find out that he ( Grebey ) has nothing to say leads me to believe the strike was forced , was planned by the owners , " Seaver said . " The fact that they bought strike insurance aids that view . It 's a destructive , very disturbing situation . " Seaver referred to the owners ' strike insurance , which next Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike . Owners have been receiving $72,000 per game from their emergency strike fund . RUSTY STAUB OF the New York Mets , . another union representative a Friday 's abbreviated talks , said , " No matter how much they ( owners ) say they do n't want a strike , and they are not trying to break up the Players ' Assocla // Stalemated strike talks break down // tion , it certainly does n't look that way . They knew this was a strike issue . " Grebey indicated before Friday 's meeting that the owners might have a new proposal for free agent compensation . The owners previously asked that compensation be paid for 90 per cent of free agents and the price be as high as the 16th player off the rosteitof the team gaining the free agent . The union wants compensation for only 10 per cent of players and wants to " freeze " the top 36 players on rosters , keeping them from the compensation pool . " I had some indication that there would be some movement today , " Moffett said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no point in this charade . It is absolutely useless if there is nothing to talk about . " " The proposal they put on the table 18 months ago is still on the table , " Belanger said . " We rejected it then , and we reject it now , and until it is removed , we are on strike . " INSTEAD OF GETTING closer on the compensation issue , the two sides could split on additional issues , such as whether days lost to the strike will count toward players ' seniority and pension time . " We will never consider a settlement which counts strike days as major league service time , " Grebey said . " It is our understanding that this lost time is good time , " said Don Fehr , a union lawyer . " There will be no settlement without that being written into the final agreement . " Service time is important because it counts toward a. player 's gaining free agent status as well as his pension status . On another front Friday , an administrative law judge 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices by the owners has been postponed again . The hearing. , originally scheduled for June 15 but then postponed to Monday , has been moved back to June 29 . The postponement came at the owners ' insistence , according to Tom Miller , an NLRB spokesman . lie would not elaborate . The NLRB charges in its suit that the owners have n't been bargaining in good faith ( by refusing to open their books to the players ) .
