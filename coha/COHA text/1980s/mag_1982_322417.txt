The home box has a sparkling new season of music and drama <P> " I want to hear a warm , thrilling voice cry out , Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! I 'm alive ! " So spoke Jimmy Porter , the cold , cauterizing antihero of John Osborne 's 1956 play Look Back in Anger . And so might an American viewer today appraise the three major TV networks , where the individual voice tends to get lost in the Valium murmur of a hundred soap sellers , newscasters and tough private eyes . For the unique noise of a writer 's whirring mind or an actor 's seductive rhetoric , one could only turn in gratitude to PBS and its Great Performances and Theater in America series . Now there is another venue : cable . In their early years , the pay-movie networks dropped an occasional stage hit into their feature-movie schedules . Recently , with the proliferation of culture systems like CBS Cable and Hearst/ABC 's ARTS , the trickle of musicals and drama has turned into a flood . As long as viewers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable is here to stay . <P> This month alone The Entertainment Channel is offering a splendid re-creation of Stephen Sondheim 's Sweeney Todd , starring Angela Lansbury and George Hearn ; Showtime has Paul Osborn 's 1939 comedy Morning 's at Seven , with four stars from its recent Broadway revival ; and Home Box Office is airing Camelot , with Richard Harris as King Arthur in the throes of male menopause . Other transplanted Broadway shows will follow later this year : Lanford Wilson 's Fifth of July ( Showtime ) , Medea with Zoe Caldwell and Judith Anderson ( CBS Cable ) and Long Day 's Journey into Night with Ruby Dee and a trio of black actors as Eugene O'Neill 's black Irish Tyrones ( ARTS ) . <P> The lure of the legit is strong enough to have attracted star actors who might otherwise be making much more money in Hollywood movies .

And Malcolm McDowell captured the fury , if not the poetry , of angry young Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger ( Showtime ) . <P> Ever since the electronic eye 's infancy , TV and the stage have been infrequent , fractious partners . The 1950s are remembered as television 's golden age of drama , and for good reason : not only was a new generation of playwrights creating intimate drama for the anthology series like Kraft Television Theater and Studio One , but Broadway stars were bringing familiar plays into a million homes . Noel Coward and Lauren Bacall struck a happy medium in Blithe Spirit ; Katharine Cornell exhumed The Barretts of Wimpole Street . But in a decade when just about every new Broadway hit was sold to the movies , producers had little interest in " settling " for TV 's small money , tiny screen and no prestige . Today , few Broadway plays except Neil Simon 's make it to Hollywood . Naturalistic drama of the sort that translates easily to movies is out of fashion among the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience would be bored by all talk and no action . So theater is searching out a new audience : the middleaged , upper-middle-income subscribers to cable .
