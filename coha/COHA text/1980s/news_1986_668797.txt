Ivan Boesky , one of Wall Street ' s biggest players , agreed Friday to pay a $50 million fine and give up an additional $50 million in illegal profits he and his companies made trading on inside information obtained from Dennis Levine . Boesky also agreed to plead guilty to one criminal charge in connection with the insider trading scheme and he will be barred from future trading . Federal authorities said Boesky is cooperating in the ongoing criminal investigation . Boesky ' s fine  --  the largest in the history of Wall Street  --  was the result of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission announced at a press conference here . Simultaneously , the U.S. attorney ' s office in New York released a statement that Boesky has agreed to plead guilty to an unspecified criminal count in the future . A source close to the ongoing investigation by prosecutors and the SEC said that additional people are expected to be implicated as a result of the cooperation of Boesky and Levine . Boesky , who has accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles , is the most prominent figure yet to be caught up in the biggest scandal of recent Wall Street history . He was chief executive officer of Ivan F. Boesky and Co. , which specialized in risk arbitrage , banking , venture capital and investment management . The SEC complaint said Boesky ' s companies made profits of " at least $50 million " by trading on takeover stocks on the basis of inside information provided by Levine between February , 1985 , and last April . Boesky agreed to pay Levine up to 5 percent of his profits on the trades , but Levine was arrested May 12 , before he could receive any money , according to the SEC . Rumors about Boesky ' s involvement with Levine had been circulating on Wall Street for several weeks and there had been widespread speculation that he had been selling off his assets recently . The SEC and criminal cases were not made public until after the stock markets closed Friday . It is certain to send further shock waves across Wall Street , which has been reeling from insider-trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It ' s clear that the bringing of the Levine case has had an effect on people ' s conduct , " said Gary Lynch , the SEC enforcement chief . " It appeared that there was less information being tipped and I would assume that the Boesky case will have a similar effect . " Levine , a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker making more than $1 million a year , was charged with earning $12. 6 million in illegal profits by trading stocks on the basis of private , inside information for the last five years . Levine pleaded guilty on June 5 in a deal with prosecutors and enforcement officials from the SEC in which he agreed to return illegal profits and other assets totaling $11. 5 million and implicated other members of his ring of insiders . Boesky was the sixth person implicated since Levine began cooperating . Ira B. Sokolow , a former investment banker at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. , was sentenced to a year and a day in prison last week for providing inside information to Levine . Three others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to plead guilty soon . Another investment analyst has been implicated but has not been charged yet . In a prepared statement , Boesky said , " I deeply regret my past mistakes and know that I alone must bear the consequences of those actions . " Boesky consented to being barred permanently from associating with any brokers or dealers in the future . But the SEC said he can have until April 1 , 1988 , to dispose of his assets in an attempt to avoid financial damage to any companies with which he is affiliated . The consent agreement that Boesky signed with the SEC provided yet another glimpse at how Levine ' s insider-trading operation worked . The previous people implicated had provided Levine with inside information , which he used to make his trades . But the SEC said that Levine provided inside information to Boesky in return for an agreement to pay him up to 5 percent of Boesky ' s profits . The complaint said Levine sought Boesky out in February , 1985 , and " began to cultivate a relationship with Boesky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint said that Levine provided Boesky with inside information on a range of stocks and Boesky used that information to make trades through several of the companies that he controlled . John Sturc , assistant director of enforcement at the SEC , said Boesky will be required to pay the $50 million fine and return the $50 million " out of his own pocket , " although much of the profit was earned by companies with which he is affiliated . The money will go to the U.S. Treasury . When asked whether the settlement will wipe Boesky out financially , his attorney , Harvey Pitt , said , " This really does it to him.
