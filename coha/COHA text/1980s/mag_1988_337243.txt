Physicist Edward Teller has a reputation for thinking big : during World War II , as other Manhattan Project scientists were racing to build the first atom bomb , the Hungarian-born Teller was already working on the hydrogen bomb . While the H-bomb was both a technological tour de force and a hellishly effective weapon , however , one of Teller 's more recent enthusiasms  --  the X- ray laser  --  could turn out to be an expensive dud . That possibility has ignited a fire storm of accusations that has set off a federal investigation into recent goings-on at the University of California 's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , one of the country 's two weapons-development centers . <P> The problem , charges Roy Woodruff , the former director of weapons research at Livermore , is that Teller oversold the X-ray laser , a proposed Star Wars device under development at the lab , to President Reagan . Not only were some of Teller 's statements " technically incorrect , " claims Woodruff , but " the optimistic schedules proposed by Dr. Teller for deployment of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have split the lab into bitter factions ; they have also cast doubt on the scientific integrity of Livermore , a facility founded with Teller 's support in 1952 , and cast a shadow over Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative . <P> Tensions over the development of the X-ray laser might have remained behind closed doors if Woodruff had not been demoted by Livermore Director Roger Batzel in what Woodruff claims was retaliation for trying to put a lid on Teller . Prior to his transfer , Woodruff was responsible for proposed SDI weapons like the X-ray laser , a device that was supposed to channel the intense X rays from a nuclear bomb into a beam of radiation . In theory , the X rays would be capable of destroying enemy ICBMs in mid-flight . But tests showed that although such devices work on a small scale , there was little evidence that they could be made powerful enough to work as effective antimissile weapons . <P> Woodruff questions whether Teller passed along such doubts to the President or his aides . In 1983 , he points out , Teller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keyworth saying the laser was ready for " engineering phase "  --  implying that only a few details remained to be worked out before the weapon could be built . And as late as 1987 , Lowell Wood , a manager of weapons development at Livermore and Teller 's protege , told a House subcommittee how " X-ray lasers can be used to destroy any type of platforms in space , including defensive platforms , so the counterdefensive role is being explored extensively , and it is this role in which X-ray lasers might be expected to first come into play . . .
