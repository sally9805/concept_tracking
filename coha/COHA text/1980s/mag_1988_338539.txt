" Hey , Senator , " somebody once shouted at Howard Baker , " who do you get to rumple your suits ? " The slightly wilted Baker grinned and replied that he handled wrinkles himself . He knew a message of affection when he heard it . <P> Tommy Griscom , 38 , Baker 's loyal aide , came in for his share . " Tommy , did somebody press the down button on your elevator shoes ? " He was another Tennessee boy who could roll with it , even at 5 ft. 6 in. , and with quick wit he traveled through the Washington jungle unscathed . " You know , " whispered a former White House staffer last week , " we sometimes joked that Tommy was the most powerful man in the country . He had a President who was disengaged . Baker was not an administrator . Tommy paid attention to the details . " <P> Now Baker and Griscom are both going off from the White House . It seems unfortunate to lose such good men when scandal is rampant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to be made . Baker and Griscom came to help Ronald Reagan in his worst time , and they steadied the Administration and nudged it off again in the right direction . There are too many rascals to count right now in Washington , but we too often lose sight of the fact that the city has many more good folk who step up and serve honestly and honorably . Most of these are unheralded . <P> Take Reagan 's Moscow summit , which in all likelihood would have been a flop had it not been for a determined group of writers thumping away in the Old Executive Office Building . They provided the President with speeches that soared around the world , eloquent statements about freedom and democracy and glory of the individual . By the measure of the day , Chief Writer Tony Dolan , 39 , along with Josh Gilder , 34 , Peter Robinson , 31 , Clark Judge , 40 , and Mark Klugmann , 28 , should have been out riding the bull market or selling their kiss-and-tell memoirs . Instead they were busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified finish to his presidency . <P> Those young men went back to a dusty stack of Reagan 's old speeches , all written by the actor-Governor himself decades ago . They revived the themes that have been the hallmark of his career : of looking at people as individuals rather than as masses , of insisting that political power must come from the people up , not the government down . They battled for the right to let Reagan be Reagan behind a great Moscow pulpit . It was mind over protocol . <P> When the bureaucrats from State and the National Security Council moved in to dampen the rhetoric , Griscom was there . The call to the Soviets to " tear down the Berlin Wall and all barriers between Eastern and Western Europe " stayed in the text . Griscom dispelled the worry that Reagan would offend his hosts by championing the dissidents gathered around him in Moscow . He never noted the alarm that Reagan might walk through Red Square arguing with Mikhail Gorbachev about whether the world was tilting East or West . Rolling debate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasnost as anything . <P> The Reagan Moscow testament will ring out for years , thanks to those good men . Yes , Griscom is taking his leave , and so is Gilder , who is off to do speeches for George Bush . But that is the way in this Government . Sometimes it does hurt , but often it brings its own special strength . Renewal .
