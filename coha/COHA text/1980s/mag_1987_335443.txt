The nominating convention was a week away . The election would not be held for months . But in the authoritarian political system of South Korea , the vote that counts most is that of President Chun Doo Hwan , 56 . Last week Chun gave his official blessing to the man who will likely be South Korea 's next President : Roh Tae Woo , 54 , a retired army general and chairman of the ruling Democratic Justice Party . <P> The South Korean leader made his long-awaited choice of a successor before a dinner at Blue House , the presidential residence , attended by the 29-member central executive committee of the D.J.P. Though party officials burst into cheers , the President 's own praise of his designated successor was understated . Chun said merely that Roh would make a good President because he is " knowledgeable in security affairs and has wide experience in national administration . " <P> Once he is officially chosen as the government 's candidate , Roh will stand for election before a college of electors that is expected to be dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boycott the vote , which should come next winter , and have called for direct presidential elections . Under the existing electoral-college system , Chun , who will step down in February , won 92% of the vote in 1981 . <P> South Korea has been plagued in recent months by student-led demonstrations demanding direct elections . Chun intensified the opposition to his regime by declaring on April 13 that no constitutional reform would be considered until after the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul . Though Roh has a reputation as a conciliator , the opposition Reunification Democratic Party dismissed his selection by Chun as " just another act in the political script of the ruling party designed to extend power . " <P> The modest and somewhat bookish Roh is one of Chun 's oldest associates and few close friends . They graduated together from the Korean Military Academy in 1955 , and both served with the South Korean military contingent during the war in Viet Nam . After President Park Chung Hee was assassinated by the head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency in 1979 , Roh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brought Chun to power . <P> Since he retired from the military in 1981 , Roh has held several posts in Chun 's Cabinet . From 1984 to 1986 he was chairman of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee . But until recently , his nomination for the presidency was by no means assured . Within Chun 's inner circle , Roh vied for power with Prime Minister Lho Shin Yong and Chang Se Dong , head of the Agency for National Security Planning , successor to the KCIA . Of the three , Chang , also a former general , seemed to wield the most power . But two weeks ago , both Chang and Lho were knocked out of the race when Chun dismissed them from office as part of a Cabinet reshuffle brought on by the torture death of a student and the subsequent cover-up scandal .
