" Happy Ramadan , " said the caller , a close friend . " And don ' t touch that tea ! " Miss Leheta ruefully set aside her teacup . " I hated the world that morning , " she recalled . For many Egyptians besides Miss Leheta , the start of Ramadan , the Moslem holy month during which the faithful refrain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset , came unexpectedly early. // Egyptians had expected the month , which follows a lunar calendar , to begin Sunday , June 12 . Moslem leaders here had even planned a ceremony Saturday evening to celebrate the spotting of the new moon , which signals the start of Ramadan. // But Saudi eyes - more modern methods of observation are shunned - were sharp . Sky watchers in Saudi Arabia said they saw the thin crescent of new moon on Friday evening and they declared Saturday , June 11 , the first day of Ramadan . Egypt acquiesced , but not without protest . <> <> ' Ramadam Is So Generous ' // " Each Ramadan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' which means ' Ramadan is so generous , ' explained Miss Leheta . " It ' s like saying ' Merry Christmas . ' But Christians have an advantage . They know when Christmas is coming. " // Official complaints followed the Saudi proclamation of Ramadan . " Our calculations are extremely precise , as we monitor the birth of the moon every month . Saudi Arabia only watches the birth of the Ramadan moon , " asserted Sheik Abdel Latif Hamza , the Egyptian mufti , or key religious interpreter , in an article in Al Ahram , the Cairo daily. // The decision that Ramadan had begun was made well after midnight , when most people were asleep . Before dawn , police cars equipped with loudspeakers cruised the streets broadcasting the warning that Ramadan had already begun. // Some residents said they were awakened by the police . Others heard the firing of a cannon at the Citadel , the traditional signal for the start and end of the fast each day . <> <> People Warn Others by Phone // Some Moslems took it upon themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaring my relatives to death by calling so late . But I decided I had to call to warn them to get up and eat something before dawn , " said Amany el-Khatib , a graduate student. // " But lots of people had the same idea , " she added . " The phone lines were hopelessly jammed . I hardly reached anyone . " For the religious among the world ' s 350 million Moslems , Ramadan is among the most demanding manifestations of devotion . From the first light of day to the last , Islam forbids not only eating but also drinking - even water - smoking , gambling and sex. // Mohammed , Islam ' s founder , provided for some exceptions : old people , the sick , pregnant women , mothers nursing babies , travelers and people who perform exceptionally hard labor are exempt. // Travelers are permitted to postpone their fast . Ramadan , which occurs at different months in the Western calendar because of its lunar schedule , has come this year during a particularly harsh , hot time , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this might account for the rather large number of friends and fellow workers , especially in Government , who have suddenly taken to the road . <> <> Fasting Deforms Way of Life // Ramadan transforms the tempo and character of this city . Egyptians arrive at work late and leave early , usually to snooze until the sun sets. // Gone are the ubiquitous tiny cups of tea and thick coffee that seem so essential to life . Hotel managers report that tourism and visits by businessmen during Ramadan are down sharply . " We ' re at 50 percent capacity , " said Hussam G. Tantawi , sales manager of the 900-room Ramses Hilton . " Productivity of the entire staff , even those who don ' t fast , is way down. " // " We ' re present physically , but we ' re not here . We listen , but we don ' t comprehend . We ' re a very peaceful lot , because we haven ' t the energy to bicker. " // Perhaps . But other Egyptians criticize what they say is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudeness as the day wears on. // While fasting is intended to teach humility and the pain of hunger - so the plight of the poor can more fully be appreciated - Egyptians , officials say , consume far more food during Ramadan than at any other time . <> <> Extra Food Is Imported // Several hundred tons of cheese and meat are imported for the month , some of which is sold at below-market rates . At Groppi ' s , a popular pastry and coffee shop downtown , throngs of middle-class Egyptians besiege sales clerks for desserts to be eaten at Iftar , the meal that breaks the fast. // " Many Egyptians get positively fat during Ramadan , " said a physician . Iftar is a study in contrasts . On a straw mat spread across a patch of sand on a bank of the Nile , a poor family squats in a circle to eat pita and a traditional bean dish . A stone ' s throw away , waiters in black tie dash back and forth at an Egyptian Navy outdoor club , serving lavish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at wealthy and poor tables alike , no food is served before sunset. // As fast turns to feast , Cairo becomes festive . Green neon lights highlight minarets of the city ' s many mosques , which blare tape recorded prayers five times a day . Lanterns and strings of multicolored bulbs decorate shops . The streets are full of families , strolling after their meals . <> <> Christians Try to Be Tactful // Non-Moslems are also affected by Ramadan . Many of the country ' s Coptic Christian minority , a tolerated but politically uneasy group , refrain from eating in the presence of Moslems. // No alcohol is served in most restaurants . Egyptian law permits banning the sale of alcohol in all but a few designated tourist areas . Even in hotels , where alcohol is available , Egyptians , even Copts , can not be served. // " Sometimes Egyptians get very mad about this , " said Nabil Moustafa , manager of the Ibis Cafe , a trendy restaurant in the Nile Hilton . " But I remind them that Moslems aren ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the law. " // Not all restaurant operators are enchanted by the stricter laws that many provincial governors have adopted . The Governor of Giza , a section of Cairo on the west side of the Nile , has forbidden restaurants to sell alcohol even to foreigners. // The maitre d ' hotel of the Swiss Air Restaurant , among the city ' s most fashionable , sadly informed two foreigners one night that he could not sell a bottle of wine with their dinner . The foreigners suggested a compromise : Would it be legal , since they lived nearby , to bring their own wine concealed in a brown paper bag ? // " Unfortunately not , " the manager replied , after some consultation , " the Governor is very strict . " " How about room service ? " the visitors pressed . Could he deliver the dinner to their apartment ? The Egyptian beamed . He had never done that before , he allowed with a sly smile . But yes , it was legal . Everyone appeared contented . The foreigners had their wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had beaten the Ramadan blues. //
