Reagan caps his revolution with the country 's largest tax cut <P> Champagne corks were popping merrily in the Oval Office late Wednesday afternoon when the call came from the vanquished to the victor . " Well , Mr. President , you 're tough , " said Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee . " You beat us . " Indeed he had , and with surprising ease . In the final legislative battle over Ronald Reagan 's economic program , 48 House Democrats had deserted their party to help the President win a 238-to-195 victory on a vote for a bill that provides the largest tax cut in U.S. history . The same day the Republican-controlled Senate endorsed a similar measure , 89 to 11 . House and Senate conferees then stayed up all night smoothing out differences between the two versions , and the President could sign the final bill this week . Reagan will also get to put his signature on the other key part of his economic program : a budget that will slash nearly $140 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> " We have made a new beginning , " exulted the President . If not a revolution . Not since the first six months of Franklin Roosevelt 's Administration has a new President done so much of such magnitude so quickly to change the economic direction of the nation . Reagan not only won 90% of his economic program , but did so with a display of political organization and savvy that left his opponents reeling in disarray . For a President supposedly untutored in the ways of Washington and suspected by some of lacking the acumen and the energy that the Oval Office demands , Reagan has proved to be astonishingly sure-footed and dynamic . As House Majority Leader Jim Wright of Texas told him in a congratulatory phone call : " We can see you 're ready for the big time . " <P> Reagan transformed an election victory that was largely a repudiation of his opponent into a mandate to revitalize the economy and reverse the trend toward ever greater reliance on federal handouts . He adroitly utilized the wave of sympathy that followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having won that confrontation , he built upon it for the showdown over taxes . <P> For all the potential ramifications of the tax bill , last week 's battle was essentially a struggle for power between the White House and the leadership of the House , and politics more than principle was involved . In negotiations last June to produce a bipartisan bill , the Democrats had agreed to accept many of the basics of Reagan 's plan , including a massive , multiyear tax cut and accelerated depreciation for businesses . " We have won the tax debate , " said White House Chief of Staff James Baker after hearing of the concessions made by Rostenkowski 's committee . Nonetheless , the Administration decided to hang tough for everything it wanted . Said one top Reagan adviser : " All the Democrats achieved by compromising was to undercut their own arguments against our position . "
