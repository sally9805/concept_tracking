This may not seem like a major artistic event . But it is seen in Hollywood as part of mounting evidence that the world of entertainment has begun to reflect new attitudes of sexual responsibility in film , TV , and theater fare . These changing attitudes go along with the more obvious concern for victims of AIDS indicated by the many show-business fund-raising events in their behalf. // In previous James Bond movies , the spy character played by Sean Connery and Roger Moore was noted for frequent amorous affairs . This time , says Mark Locher , a Screen Actors Guild spokesman close to the project , ' ' there was a conscious effort to portray the new Bond as not someone who sleeps with every woman he meets , and as one who values monogamy . There was the feeling the public wouldn ' t stand for it otherwise. ' ' // // This is but one example of how the makers of entertainment recognize the key role of consumers in demanding socially responsible portrayals in the all-pervading media of the day . Votes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunked down for a cinema ticket. // ' ' We have already seen a shift in values about commitment , marriage , and sexual situations in the society at large , ' ' says George Dessart , vice-president of program practices at CBS. // ' ' My expectation is that that trend will continue , and will be mirrored in much more thoughtful attitudes toward sex and relationships in all the entertainment media. ' ' // A number of related themes emerge in conversations with writers , directors , and producers across the country - against the backdrop of recent nationwide reports about the ravages of AIDS in the creative community. // ' A question of realism ' // One such theme is that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and ' 70s has turned the corner , entering a new era of caution and restraint in both heterosexual and homosexual contexts , among those married as well as single . Under the general maxim ' ' art imitates life , ' ' this new caution is percolating into the screenplays , sitcoms , soap operas , and dramas now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t mean you ignore the implied sexual relationships in , say , a classic play like ' Hamlet , ' ' ' says Bill Bushnell , director of the Los Angeles Theater Center . ' ' But if you are dealing with a contemporary play that deals with casual sex and don ' t put it in a 1987 context of caution about AIDS , chances are the entire play would ring false. ' ' // The new caution is not a formal directive from those in decisionmaking roles - such as studio heads for films , program directors in TV - either for increased ' ' relevance ' ' or ' ' social responsibility ' ' or increased ratings . It is rather the reflection of attitudes ' ' growing from the bottom up , creators being true to the things they care about , ' ' as one writer put it. // ' ' It wasn ' t so much that we were thinking consciously about being socially responsible , ' ' says Terry Louise Fischer , co-creator of NBC ' s ' ' L.A. Law , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the use of a condom to a friend as a means of preventing the spread of AIDS. // ' ' It was a question of realism . These are the concerns real people are having , and to ignore that on a socially conscientious show just wouldn ' t wash. ' ' // The new attitudes are taking hold not just because it is the social subset of artists , writers , and performers who have heretofore been documented as the most visible victims . The perception has grown , with increasing accounts of heterosexuals diagnosed as having AIDS , that the wider population considers the disease more than a problem unique to homosexuals and drug addicts. // ' ' This is the advent of the new sexual revolution , ' ' says Harvey Fierstein , a prominent author of plays dealing with homosexuality . ' ' There are new rules that have to be learned by everyone. ' ' // In a recent episode of the television series ' ' Valerie , ' ' the title character openly advises her son against having premarital sex . The use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ' ' Those kinds of specifics were not talked about in prime-time TV until recently , ' ' says Barbara Brogliatti , senior vice-president for communications at Lorimar Telepictures , producers of ' ' Valerie , ' ' ' ' Dallas , ' ' and ' ' Falcon Crest . ' ' ' ' ( Those specifics ) will increase in coming seasons , ' ' she adds. // Debate continues on whether such specifics , however well intended , may encourage promiscuity among young viewers . But the trend is evident. // Theater is first to reflect concern // The theater took the lead among forms of entertainment in dealing specifically with AIDS . Such plays as ' ' The Normal Heart ' ' and ' ' As Is ' ' dramatized the effects of the disease on individual lives . Just last week ' ' Beirut ' ' opened in New York . It is a cautionary tale , dealing in part with both ignorance of the disease and the dangers of overreaction . It is also the first heterosexually oriented play concerned with AIDS. // But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest jump in concern over AIDS. // ' ' For a long time all we could write about was coming out , ' ' says Michael Kearns , an openly homosexual actor and director , who has produced or directed six AIDS-related plays in the last two seasons. // ' ' AIDS has completely rejuvenated our writers with whole new realms of concern . ' ' And although those concerns - love , death , separation , abstinence , precaution - have been working their way into the popular media , some say those media have not gone far enough. // ' ' All of the news shows , ' 60 Minutes , ' ' 20/20 , ' etc. , have dealt with the problem in depth , ' ' remarks Mark Thompson , associate cultural editor of The Advocate , a national biweekly gay newsmagazine . ' ' But when was the last time you saw a TV movie dealing with the problem ? ' ' // ' ' I would like to see more concern reflected in the daily diet of soap operas , sitcoms , and allegedly socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the Alliance for Gays and Lesbian Artists in the entertainment industry. // ' ' There ' s been much progress , but we still have a long way to go before casual sex is eliminated from our general TV and movie fare. ' ' // TV and film are more cautious // Not that television drama has ignored the problem of AIDS . The award-winning TV movie ' ' An Early Frost ' ' told of a son admitting his homosexuality to his parents as well as informing them that he had AIDS . Programs such as ' ' St. Elsewhere , ' ' ' ' Hill Street Blues , ' ' and ' ' Hotel ' ' have dealt with the disease . In the season ' s recent cliffhanger episode of ' ' Dynasty , ' ' oil magnate Blake Carrington admonishes his homosexual son to be careful in his sexual relations. // Mass-market movies have been the medium that so far has stayed away from direct reference to AIDS. // ' ' The lag time between start and finish is such that producers are very concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can ' t predict , ' ' says Saul David , producer of ' ' In Like Flint ' ' and its spy sequels starring James Coburn . He says the concern about the disease instead manifests itself in new caution over sex scenes. // ' ' There is quite a lot of discussion among agents and screenwriters about approaches to these scenes that there didn ' t used to be , ' ' he says. // ' ' An agent is likely to read a script nowadays and say , ' Gee , there ' s a lot of indiscriminate bed-hopping going on here that might get us in trouble - can you put something else in there ? ' ' ' // Part of the reason television and movies have yet to reflect more explicitly the societal concerns about sexually transmitted diseases , say producers and programmers , is that both media are still seen essentially as fiction and fantasy-oriented entertainments , not forums for documentary. // ' ' Let ' s face it , people often use TV and movies to get away from the nitty-gritty details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV writer says . ' ' To the extent they don ' t want that encroachment , we spare them. ' ' // //
