txt Sudan 's normally sleepy capital is taking on the frantic air of a city preparing for war . Military guards are posted on major oads and bridges , and sandbags have been hurriedly placed around certain public buildings . Police roam the streets in a campaign of mass arrests against suspicious vagrants that has netted about 10,000 people during the past month . In the local markets . zealous price controllers use harsh tactics to maintain order : recently , for Instance , a man accused of selling overpriced grape juice was sentenced to 25 lashes . Sudan is the new cockpit for Middle East confrontation , following the assassination last week of Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat . From Tripoli , Libyan radio blares constant propaganda here that Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiri will be the next pro-Western leader to go . It is still mostly a war of words . But Libyan forces on the western border have staged several air raids on Sudanese towns during the past month . And persons believed to be Libyan agents have been discovered inside Sudan with large caches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are preparing ourselves for a more dangerous act from Libya , " says President Nimeiri in an interview . Already , he argues , " Libya is in a war with Sudan and Egypt ... a kind of war of terrorism . " The Sudanese leader warns that he plans to retaliate in kind , using his agents within Libya to destroy " the regime of Qadhafi and Qadhafi himself . " For U.S. leaders shaken by the murder of President Sadat . Sudan has become a test of America 's ability to support its friends in the turbulent Middle East . A U.S. military delegation is in Sudan working out details of Secretary of State Alexander Haig 's pledge Sunday to provide emergency military assistance to Mr. Nimeiri . This military aid , says a senior State Department official in Cairo , " will be meaningful , and immediate . " Despite U.S. anxiety about the Libyan threat to Sudan , the prospects for a fullscale invasion across Sudan 's western desert are slim . Col. Qadhafi 's troops and Soviet-bloc advisers already have their hands full in Chad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that a direct strike against Sudan would probably trigger a punishir , g Egyptian invasion of Libya . Even Mr. Nimeiri , in his eagerness for U.S. aid , concedes that the Libyans ' campaign " wo n't be " direct . They will work with terrorists in Sudan and say that they are helping the Sudanese people to liberate their country . " Unfortunately for the U.S. , Sudan has severe internal problems that make this country a risky place in which to demonstrate either U.S. reliability or America 's ability to help stop the Libyan advance in Africa and the Middle East . Sudan is like an engine that is running out of gas . After a decade of extravagant plans for economic and political development , the country entered the 1980s with many unpaid bills and a restless populace . " Politically , this regime appears to be nearly exhausted . " argues one Western diplomat . And even a friendly Egyptian concedes that " there Is a general feeling of unrest " in the country . Sudan 's basic problem Is simple : It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to afford the linported consumer and capital goods to which It became addicted during the 1970s , The gap between exports and Imports totaled roughly $1 billion last year  --  putting Sudan at the mercy of its foreign creditors . Without emergency assistance from the Intotnational Monetary Fund to Finance its balance ? of ? payments deficit , Sudan could be driven into what would amount to national bankruptcy , Foreign exchange is In such short supply that the country has trouble paying even the interest on about $4 billion in debt . Indeed , hard currency is so scarce here that a former Sudanese finance minister is having trouble renewing his magazine sub scription to the Economist . Khartoum itself , crowded with people who have left Sudan 's agricultural villages , Is a measure of the country 's disarray , Even In the center of town , paved roads and autos quickly give way to dusty side streets and long-eared goats . Frequent power failures hamper many enterprises . And the population explosion here has produced a crime wave . The house of one American diplomat has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To deal with the threat of Libyan subversion . President Nimein will have to move quickly to revive the country . But Sudan has so many economic , political and military problems that it 's hard to know where to begin : ? Agriculture , the key to the country 's prosperity , has been devastated . The collapse stems largely from Sudan 's drive during the 19705 to introduce capital-intensive methods ? such as heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides  --  that it could n't afford . Per acre production of cotton , the leading cash crop , has declined by roughly 505 since 1976 . And earnings from cotton exports fell from about $300 million in 1976 to an estimated 5140 million this year . ? A " brain drain " of skilled workers and managers has enfeebled the country . As Sudan 's economic problems worsened in recent years . as many as one million of its 17 million people emigrated to jobs in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere . Sudanese officials complain that as soon as a worker learns a skill here , he is tempted to flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . The Belal family in the city of Omdurman produced four talented sons : a pharmacist , an engineer , a bacteriologist , and a mechanic . All four made off for Saudi Arabia . At a local hotel , the bartenders are said to turn over every several months ? as guests offer them jobs in other countries . And at one government agency . the desperate general manager has decided to stop training workers for specialized jobs , hoping to prevent them from developing exportable skills . ? Political fragmentation threatens to split Sudan . the largest African country in hind area , into feuding regions . In 1972. three years after taking power . Mr. Nimein negotiated a truce in the 17-year conflict between the Moslems of northern Sudan and the Christians in the south . This truce now looks shaky . and there have been reports recently of violent attacks in southern cities against visiting northerners . Perhaps worse . the Darfur region on Sudan 's western front ? bordering Libya and Chad  --  has shown signs of disaffection with the central government recently , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed from Khartoum . A Backward Defense ? The Sudanese military , though manned by brave officers and soldiers , is short of modern equipment . U.S. advisers estimate that only 2S " the ships in Sudan 's small navy are sound . A team of U S. experts due here next year will find that it has to help create a logistics system from scratch ? since " the concept of numbered parts in numbered bins completely unknown here . " according to a Western official . Sudan 's immediate problem is beefing up its defense against Libyan raids In the west . The Sudanese have six U.S. C-130 transports to ferry troops to the western front , but there are no airfields there where the planes can land . Lacking any modern radar , Sudanese troops in the west are trying to track high-speed Libyan fighters with binoculars . Western experts add that because the Sudanese have n't any modern antiaircraft mtsstles , they are nearly defenseless against Libya 's highflying MiG23s . The emergency aid package promised by Secretary Haig probably will focus on these air-defense needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. military aid credits to Sudan . to $100 million in the fiscal year beginning this month . The new U.S. credits will go largely for M60 tanks . F5 fighters and naval assistance . Libya has skillfully exploited Sudan 's difficulties in recent months . The Libyans maintain a constant stream of often-fanciful propaganda through their radio and news service  --  hoping to convince the Sudanese that President Nimein 's government is on its knees . During one week last June , for example . the Libyan news agency carried a bulletin every day on what it described as the deteriorating situation in Sudan . One story asserted that life in Khartoum " is totally paralyzed " : another trumpeted that " famine is spreading in many parts of the country " : a third announced that " a general discontent prevails in the Sudanese armed forces . " Unsettling Propaganda This week . notes President Nimein. the Libyans are broadcasting that Egyptian and Sudanese troops are locked in street battles with opposition forces in Khartoum . The Sudanese president laughs at this fabricated claim . But it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in remote regions of Sudan . The Libyans also are seeking to recruit a network of Sudanese agents inside the country . According to a Western diplomat here , the Libyans have approached a number of young Sudanese traveling in Europe and in the Arab world and offered them large sums of money to work for Col. Qadhafi 's revolution . Sudanese workers living in Libya also are being drafted into a brigade known as " army of salvation . " The Libyan campaign may . ironically . prove something of a blessing for this troubled country . For it appears to be persuading the Reagan administration to drop one of its pet themes  --  the need for austerity in U.S. aid to Third World countries  --  and to treat Sudan as a special case because it is threatened by the administration s favorite villain , Libya 's Col. Qadhafi . " I think we need billions , not millions . and we need it now , " says Mustafa Amin , the director of Sudan 's government news agency . " When the security of Sudan is threatened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is threatened . "
