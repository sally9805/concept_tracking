We need a feel of the building , of the people who made the collections , and of the way in which they are presented . We need to say to ourselves , " I ' d hate to miss that museum . " Conversely , we need to be warned off a long slow journey across town that will yield nothing to our particular purpose. // Given the volatility that is now demanded of museums , this is more than ever a difficult thing to do . But it has been done with conspicuous success in the Blue Guide " Museums and Galleries of London , " just published here by W.W. Norton &; Co. at $12. 95 . Written by Malcolm Rogers , curator of 17th-century paintings at the National Portrait Gallery in London , this presents an insider ' s view of the museum world. // A great mass of information is set out in lucid , engaging and thoroughly professional style . The subject matter can fairly be called omni-comprehensive , ranging as it does from the British Museum , the National Gallery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lawn Tennis Museum at Wimbledon , the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden , the Anna Pavlova Memorial Museum and the Musical Museum , housed in a disused 19th-century church in Brentford , where the visitor can see and hear the Hapfield Phonoliszt-Violina and many another mysterious instrument. // By nature no toady , Mr. Rogers is remarkably tart when it seems to him that tartness is called for . At the National Gallery " even the grandest paintings are hung as if to be viewed by dwarfs . " At the Tate gallery , " the displays are most inadequately labeled . " Of the National Portrait Gallery , on the other hand , he says quite rightly that " there is still no more fascinating place in which to study English history in outline and , more important , to communicate with the personalities who made it " . // Like every other modern museum man , Mr. Rogers is attendance-conscious . To be almost alone in a great gallery is bliss , as we all know . But the curator of the gallery in question feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not rise year by year . Why is it , Mr. Rogers wonders , that the Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art in Gordon Square racks up no more than 140 visitors a week , when the visitor can count on finding there " an experience of almost meditational intensity " in the company of Chinese ceramics of the highest order ? // His book will help to change all that , so ably does he detail the charms of some 160 London museums , many of which will be unfamiliar to most of us . In fact the only museum that he doesn ' t describe is the one that few or no visitors can hope to get into - the legendary and horrendous " black museum " at Scotland Yard , long reputed to house the world ' s most terrifying collection of forensic souvenirs , from Jack the Ripper up and down. // Now in his 83d year , Jean Dubuffet is generally regarded as the most original French artist to have come to maturity in the second half of this century . Though kindness itself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tangle with . He may indeed be the most redoubtable living controversialist , and one whom even a snapping turtle would be well advised not to provoke. // Nine years ago the president of Renault Automobiles commissioned from Jean Dubuffet a monumental ensemble of sculptures that was to cover an area 200 feet long and 133 feet wide in the center of the new corporate headquarters of Renault at Boulogne-Billancourt on the outskirts of Paris. // It was a visionary enterprise - the individual sculptures were to run as tall as 15 , 18 and even 25 feet - but Dubuffet went to work with an energy that not every artist can summon up in his middle 70 ' s . Within a year the project was well advanced . But then there was a change of regime at Renault Automobiles . The incoming president canceled the project , covered everything that had been done to date with a smooth new lawn and gave orders that the big resin sculptures should be junked. // If he thought that Dubuffet would stand for that , he mistook his man . Dubuffet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 the courts found against him . He brought a second suit on appeal . This too was thrown out . He then brought suit in a higher court , and in July 1981 he won his case. // Renault Automobiles was ordered to start construction all over again and complete the monument . In their turn , they appealed against the decision . After nearly eight years of almost continuous litigation , the appeals court upheld the decision of July 1981 and on March 16 of this year ruled in favor of Dubuffet and ordered that construction should be resumed. // A happy outcome for the artist , one might think , though one that few would have had either the determination or the financial reserves to pursue for nearly a decade . But that is not how Jean Dubuffet sees it . It is not in his nature , he said the other day , to force people to build something that they don ' t want to have , even if the law has authorized him to do so. // The " Salon d ' Ete " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a particular place and a particular community . " It would make no sense , " Dubuffet said , " unless the people who would use it were happy to have it . That is why I now , in my turn , and not without sadness , say ' No ' to Renault Automobiles " . // It ' s a moral tale , anyway . And the New Yorker whose business takes him to the Wall Street area can look at the big Dubuffet sculpture outside the Chase Manhattan headquarters and guess what kind of a year-round carnival the staff of Renault Automobiles might have had for themselves in Boulogne-Billancourt. // When just about every square inch of a museum has been put to use , there ' s always the stairwell . And when the stairwell has gone - well , there ' s always the elevator . And when you have the largest passenger elevator in New York City , as seems to be the case with the Whitney Museum , then it ' s a pity not to use that too. // That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Whitney ' s big elevator from 5 P.M. to 8 P.M. on Tuesday . While going about its normal business the elevator will be decked out in disco style with a stage , psychedelic lights and mylar on the walls. // The performance will be by Ann Magnuson , and she is scheduled " to re-create her role as an All-American cocktail lounge chanteuse in ' Upwardly Mobile II , ' a celebration of Muzak . " She will sing along with tapes by Peter Nero , Percy Faith , Mantovani and others . She did it last fall in the elevator of Danceteria , and everyone had a good time . Perhaps it should be added that thanks to a grant from Mobil , the museum will be open free from 6 P.M. to 8 P.M. , as it is every Tuesday evening. //
