GHOSTBUSTERS Directed by Ivan Reitman Screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis <P> Armageddon is not , at first glance , the most promising subject for farce : too big , too scary . Visions of expensively expansive comedies like 1941 and The Blues Brothers , where the jokes got buried under the weight of excessive hardware and special effects , dance in one 's head . And Ghostbusters , which deals with nothing less than a mass rising of the unseen world , murderously disgusted with civilization as we know it , especially around New York City . Clearly the movie intends to go after most of the marbles rolling around in the addled modern mind . <P> The first sign that the end is drawing nigh occurs when a perfectly normal and respectable young woman ( Sigourney Weaver ) opens her refrigerator door to stow the celery . Instead of confronting yesterday 's quiche , she finds herself face to face with the hound of hell , all red-eyed and snappish , with a dreamscape hinting of unspeakable mysteries stretching out behind him . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the annual summer giggle fit for the old Saturday Night Live crowd . <P> Ghostbusters is actually the trade name for a trio of rogue parapsychologists kicked out of academe for conduct unbecoming to scholarship and forced to set up shop as exorcists for hire . Lucky for them that they launch their venture just as the ectoplasmic underworld is about to go on a rampage . Unlucky for them that the Environmental Protection Agency , meddling with their facility for storing captured spirits , lets the damnable things loose . Panic in the streets ! And glorious opportunities for political as well as paranormal satire ! <P> <P> Of the ghost wranglers , the pair played by Writers Aykroyd and Ramis are sweetly earnest about their calling , and gracious about giving the picture to their co-star Bill Murray . He obviously ( and wisely ) regards Dr. Peter Venkman as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop fully his patented comic character . <P> Shrewd and stupid , sly and blustering , but always coolly gliding to some strong rhythm only he can hear , Venkman is a brilliantly observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver , representing the reality principle , informs him that he seems less a scientist than a game-show host . But he is a far more amusing figure . He is , in fact , some ultimate Yuppie , seemingly stoned on fern-bar manners , mores and folk wisdom . His utter imperviousness to anything that can not be comprehended in those basic materialist terms is finally a more potent weapon than all the atomic gadgetry he and his friends carry into their battles with the forces of darkness .
