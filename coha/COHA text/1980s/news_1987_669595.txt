This is just one of the unique complications that accompany the fastest-growing population in American prisons . The number of incarcerated women has increased 138 percent in the last 10 years. // // The fast growth is ' ' the result of harsher sentencing , ' ' says prison historian Nicole Hahn Rafter . ' ' What formerly a woman would get probation for , now is jail time. ' ' // The United States Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 1986 there were 26 , 610 women in federal or state custody , an increase of about 15 percent from the year before . The female prison population has grown at a faster rate than the male population every year since 1981. // Typically , women are arrested for relatively minor crimes such as larceny , welfare fraud , prostitution , receiving stolen property , and shoplifting . In many instances , these crimes are connected to drug and alcohol abuse . The violent crimes women go to prison for are most often murder or manslaughter of spouses who have abused them over a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafter , author of ' ' Partial Justice , ' ' a history of the women ' s prison system , says that the nature of the crimes committed by most women convicts and the backgrounds of the women do not warrant them being in prison . ' ' Most of them don ' t belong there , ' ' she says. // But they are there , and because women inmates are not usually discipline problems , once they are in , they tend to be forgotten about , says Charlotte Nesbitt , former warden of a women ' s prison in Illinois . Ms. Nesbitt adds that women prisoners ' special needs often are not attended to and that they do not get programs and services that are on a par with those for male prisoners. // Rafter says there is ' ' no conspiracy , ' ' but historically women have ' ' been shoved in a corner of a male prison . ' ' She says any consideration given them is an afterthought , largely because of their low numbers in proportion to male convicts. // Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now a record high of 546 , 659 . In placing men , penal authorities have options in terms of degree of security and rehabilitative needs. // In most states there is only one facility for female offenders . This does not begin to address the array of special needs of incarcerated women , correction experts say . One of those needs is child care . Many women convicts are single parents who have been the only providers for their families. // ' ' Five or six years ago we had 700 women in New York prisons ; now we have 1 , 500 , ' ' says Ruth Cassell , a lawyer for Prisoner ' s Legal Services , a state organization set up for inmates . ' ' Families totally disintegrate when women go to prison . ' ' Family life is further eroded by the location of most women ' s facilities in rural areas . ' ' We aren ' t incarcerating rich people . These people are on public assistance . They don ' t have a budget to pay for a day-long bus ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' These kids are five times more likely to get in trouble , ' ' says Louise Bauschard , founder and executive director of the Women ' s Self-Help Center , a private program which helps incarcerated women in St. Louis. // Clinical psychologist Lenore Walker , who has done extensive interviewing of female inmates in Colorado , Wyoming , and Missouri , says many of these women ' s children are left in the care of relatives who abuse them . Dr. Walker estimates that 70 to 80 percent of the imprisoned women themselves are incarcerated for crimes they were forced by men to commit in order to escape physical abuse . Walker says imprisoned women receive little or no job training and that what training is available is in traditionally stereotyped ' ' women ' s work , ' ' such as cosmetology . She says much of the therapy or counseling is provided by ' ' people who have no knowledge of the psychology of women. ' ' // Experts have found that many of the women who commit violent crimes have been abused . A New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice , ' ' chronicles testimonies of 12 women whose physical abuse led to the killing of their spouses . Three of the women were given life sentences ; average maximum sentence for the others was 15 years. // The New York report concluded , ' ' The nature of their crimes and the existence of a very low recidivism rate for those who have committed murder and manslaughter provide substantial evidence that these women and others like them are not a danger to society . The wisdom of imprisoning them at all is certainly questionable. ' ' // David Leven , author of a report issued by the Campaign for Common Sense in Criminal Justice , says a high percentage of women convicts were abused as children . The New York Department of Corrections says 21 percent of the women it surveyed were physically abused , and 17 percent were sexually abused as children. // Mr. Leven maintains that ' ' community service , restitution or intensive supervision with appropriate substance abuse and emotional counseling ' ' will lift a financial burden off the state as well as lower the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of these women with foster care. // The issue of community service has been addressed in the recent publication , ' ' Public Policy for Corrections : A Handbook for Decision-Makers . ' ' The work is the result of the American Correction Association , which asked thousands of people working in corrections to draft observations on women in the system. // Endorsed by Attorney General Edwin Meese III , the handbook points out that because the majority of women are arrested for property crimes , few of the offenders pose a risk to society . ' ' Community placement - whether on pre-adjudicated release or probation , in a residential program , or on parole - can provide the level of structure and support needed by many female offenders . At the same time , community placement considerably reduces the cost burden to the taxpayers . ' ' Substance abuse , according to the handbook , is also a significant problem for female offenders . It recommends treating this ' ' in the kinds of programs that generally are available in the community but not in traditional institutions. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female offenders varies widely . Budgets range from $200 , 000 in New Mexico to $21. 3 million in California , according to the National Institute for Corrections . The average budget for women is about 5 percent of a state ' s total prison-related budget. // While advocates push community service or help for inmates ' children , their cause is overshadowed by another major problem : overflowing prisons . Forty states are under court order to address the crowded conditions . Women ' ' spending a large part of their productive lives in prison isn ' t a good use of jail space , ' ' says Cassell , the lawyer for the Prisoners ' Legal Services , which is preparing a legislative package for New York. // //
