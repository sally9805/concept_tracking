A study seeks a middle ground for hawks and doves <P> Living with nuclear weapons is our only hope . It requires that we persevere in reducing the likelihood of war even though we can not remove the possibility altogether . <P> On that realistic note , a group of Harvard University scholars is raising a new possibility in the persistent U.S. nuclear arms control debate . Their theme : something less than a dramatic change or restructuring in the U.S.-U.S.S.R. nuclear balance may be the best and most feasible way for the U.S. to reduce the possibility of a nuclear holocaust . Their conclusion : the most consequential actions in nuclear arms control may be those " modest but real steps toward unproved safety that can be taken now . " This thought comes at an auspicious moment for the U.S. : the Reagan Administration is showing signs , however slight , of progress in its own efforts to strike a nuclear bargain with Congress . <P> Last week , praising what he called a " bipartisan consensus " on Capitol Hill over the arms control issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to release $625 million in funding for the controversial MX missile , in return for presidential acceptance of arms control measures contained in the Administration 's own Scowcroft report . <P> Meanwhile , the tense and polarized public debate over arms control strategy continues . One side-typified by the grass-roots nuclear-freeze movement-argues that a sudden halt to development and production of nuclear weapons by both superpowers will markedly reduce the possibility of global nuclear war . The other side , led by the Reagan Administration , champions " deep cuts " in the nuclear arsenals as the basis for Strategic Arms Reduction Talks between Washington and Moscow . But it argues that a substantial further U.S. buildup is necessary to make the Soviets accept reductions . <P> Both of these divergent perspectives come in for heavy criticism by the Harvard scholars in their new study on the dilemmas of nuclear arms negotiation . Their collective effort , to be published next week under the title Living with Nuclear Weapons , is billed by its authors , the Harvard Nuclear Study Group , * as an exercise in ideology-free education , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nuclear arms race . As if addressing the current congressional maneuvering over nuclear weapons , the authors reject both a comprehensive freeze on nuclear weapons development and the drastic cuts proposed by Reagan . <P> Both approaches , say the authors , are " atomic escapism . " Adopting a nuclear-freeze policy would necessitate elaborate negotiations with the Soviets that would require at least several years . Besides , argues the group , " the danger of nuclear weapons lies in their use , rather than their existence , " and a freeze does not impose constraints on existing weapons .
