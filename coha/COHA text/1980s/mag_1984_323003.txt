Geraldine Ferraro tells Democrats the party is not over <P> Ever since Election Day , when Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro took a memorable drubbing at the polls , political pundits have been analyzing how the Democratic Party should reposition itself for the future . Last week , in her first speech since the campaign , Ferraro offered her own analysis , cautioning the party not to lose sight of its " core " belief in equal opportunity as it strives to attract new voters . Said Ferraro : " The last thing this country needs is two Republican parties . " <P> Ferraro , who delivered her address at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , was the second participant in TIME 'S Distinguished Speakers Program , which twice a year sponsors lectures by the magazine 's cover subjects at a college of his or her choice . President Reagan , who spoke last February at Eureka College in Eureka , Ill. , his alma mater , was the first speaker in the series . <P> Looking tanned and relaxed after a postelection vacation in the Virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rejected the popular perception that the Democratic ticket lost because it clung to the gospel of Big Government . " Read the speeches , " she said . " We did n't call for massive new federal jobs programs , but for more responsible monetary , fiscal and trade policies to promote and strengthen the private sector . " In the course of her half-hour address , Ferraro spelled out her vision of the party 's future . Some excerpts : <P> " In security matters , we are told that we Democrats must prove that we are tough ... Of course the next Democratic President will use force , if necessary , to protect America 's vital interests . In the campaign we said that . The Democrats believe that the United States should always try negotiation before confrontation . In my opinion , it 's better to send in the diplomats before we send in the Marines . <P> " I hear people say that we must not let our party be dominated by the narrow agendas of special-interest groups ... But when the critics get around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually name blacks , teachers , women and unions . And never mention oil interests , the banks , the right-wing PACs or the apostles of religious intolerance . And then in the next breath the reappraisers tell us to appeal to whites , to the middle class and to men . In other words , the objection to our party is not that we speak to special groups , but that we are speaking to the wrong groups of people and that we must begin appealing to groups with more clout , with more money , with more votes . Now if there ever was a soulless solution to a party 's problems , that 's it ... and I wo n't go along . <P> " If there was one thing my campaign stood for this fall , it was the great idea of equal opportunity for every American ... <P> Above all , a party must stand for something . We have taken our stand on principles . The last thing we need to do is trim them now .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
