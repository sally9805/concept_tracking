He lives in a 12-ft. - square concrete cubicle , entombed beyond the reach of daylight in a special solitary-confinement corridor of the fortress-like maximum-security U.S. Penitentiary at Marion , Ill . There , behind a steel door slotted for the passage of meal trays , Prisoner No. 08237054 spends his days peering at a tiny black-and-white television set , watching with fascination the proceedings of the Iran-contra hearings in Washington . <P> Prisoner No. 08237054 is Edwin P. Wilson , 59 , the freebooting former CIA agent who has served five years of a 52-year sentence for providing arms and explosives to Libyan Ruler Muammar Gaddafi and plotting to kill his federal prosecutors . One reason for his absorption with the TV spectacular is that he knows so many members of the cast and has such a definite opinion about them . Many of his former associates , says Wilson , ought to be exactly where he is . <P> The isolated cell block holds just six other prisoners ( one of them is former Soviet Spy Christopher Boyce ) . With a roughhewn , 6-ft. 5-in. physique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement . He is eager to talk about what he claims were his professional and commercial ties with several of the individuals implicated in the sub-rosa schemes run by Lieut . Colonel Oliver North . In particular , Wilson mentions retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord and former high-level CIA Officials Thomas G. Clines and Theodore G. Shackley . All of them , he says ( and has said previously to prosecutors who did not believe him ) , were partners of his in deals carried out by Eatsco ( for Egyptian American Transport &; Services Co. ) , which he financed for Clines and the others in 1978 in order to reap millions in Middle East arms deals . <P> Subsequent investigations by the Department of Defense Inspector General 's office and the Justice Department established that Eatsco had skimmed some $8 million in unearned profits from the weapons sales . The company paid over $3 million in penalties , and Clines , who ran Eatsco , paid $110,000 in fines for filing false invoices with the Pentagon . Secord and Shackley , who Wilson claims were silent partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secord , then Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East , was briefly suspended from duty in 1982 ; he was reinstated but soon resigned his commission because , as he told the Iran committee , " the fact that I was cleared did n't seem to make any difference to anyone . " <P> ) Although the Iran-contra hearings are not directly concerned with Eatsco 's operations , committee investigators have privately interviewed Shirley Brill , a former CIA administrator and companion of Clines ' . Brill informed the investigators last week that Clines told her that Wilson , Secord , Shackley and Erich von Marbod , a former Defense Department official , were partners with him in Eatsco . Von Marbod , who retired from the Pentagon in 1981 at the same time that the Eatsco inquiry began , has not been implicated in the Iran-contra scandal .
