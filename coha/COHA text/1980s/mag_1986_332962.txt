A woman finds a little dog in Tijuana , and when she discovers that the animal 's eyes are runny , takes it to the vet . His diagnosis : " First of all , it 's not a dog  --  it 's a Mexican sewer rat . And second , it 's dying . " <P> If you believe that really happened , you , like thousands of other gullible Americans , have been taken in by one more of the hundreds of urban legends that regularly make their spoken way across the country . " The Mexican Pet " is nevertheless , the authentic title story of Jan Harold Brunvand 's third collection of whoppers . Together , these new wives ' tales merge as an American picaresque , a compilation of myths that keep the telephone wires humming and cocktail parties doubly fueled . <P> A believable urban legend , argues Brunvand , must have a combination of active ingredients in anecdotal form : currency , anonymity ( " Guess what happened to a friend of a friend of mine " ) , an ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation combined with a seductive plausibility . The hardiest perennials include " The Choking Doberman , " a gruesome tale synthesized from two old legends : " The Witch and the Telltale Wound " and " The Misunderstood Pet . " In the modern version , a woman returns home to find her Doberman choking . After two severed fingers are discovered in the dog 's throat , the police are summoned . In a closet they find a cowering burglar trying to stanch the flow of blood from his mutilated hand . <P> Some of these stories are cautionary : the child who is missing at the supermarket only to turn up in the rest room , where two kidnapers have cut the girl 's hair and changed her clothes . Some are funny , like the student survey that " discovers " that green M &M's; are an aphrodisiac , and some maliciously lead to racial stereotyping . Brunvand , a professor of English at the University of Utah , sees little humor or truth in the 1980 rumor that Southeast Asian immigrants in California were capturing and eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could run ads with the Super Bowl broadcast saying that the latest hot legends are pure folklore , " says Brunvand , " and still some people . . . would pass on the story itself rather than the expose .
