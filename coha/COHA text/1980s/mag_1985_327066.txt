These volumes assemble , for the first time , all of the literary essays , criticism and reviews of Henry James ( 1843-1916 ) . Their publication is surprising for two reasons . Given the scholarly industry that has been applied to James ' work over the past several decades , it is astonishing to learn that nearly a thousand of these pages , roughly one-third of the total , have never before been issued in book form . What is more , the appearance now of this unfamiliar material reveals the Old Master in a new light : a great American novelist who wrote more superb criticism than any compatriot , before or since . <P> James ' enormous output owed something to both his energy and his generous life span ; he reviewed regularly for 51 years , and was able to comment on a new novel by Charles Dickens ( Our Mutual Friend ) in 1865 and a posthumous collection of letters by Rupert Brooke in 1916 . Also , his career happened to coincide with an expanding market for his skills . Literacy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications in the U.S. and England rushed into life to meet the demand for reading matter . James profited from this development , but he also , with characteristic hedging , deplored it : " The great newspaper movement of the present moment has , we suppose , its proper and logical cause , and is destined to have its proper and logical effect ; but its virtues need to be manifold , assuredly , to palliate the baseness and flimsiness of much of the writing to which daily and weekly journals serve as sponsors . " <P> To his credit , James never wrote down to his periodical readers , even though he knew they included " that great majority of people who prefer to swallow their literature without tasting . " Instead , he aggressively savored books in print , waging a constant campaign on behalf of his conviction that the novel is " the most magnificent form of art . " James was not entirely alone in this belief . But unlike his contemporary critics and champions of fiction , he refused to lay down rules and precepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which in advance we may hold a novel , without incurring the accusation of being arbitrary , is that it be interesting . That general responsibility rests upon it , but it is the only one I can think of . The ways in which it is at liberty to accomplish this result ( of interesting us ) strike me as innumerable , and such as can only suffer from being marked out or fenced in by prescription . " <P> That theory , put into practice , made James an extraordinarily subtle and supple critic . He could extol writers like Balzac and Dickens , whose narrative methods struck him as awkward but whose stories enchanted him all the same ; he could meticulously detect aesthetic flaws in the works of George Eliot and Anthony Trollope and still commend their unique achievements .
