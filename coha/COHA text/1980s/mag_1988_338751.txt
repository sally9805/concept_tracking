If that sounds like slow progress , it is more than anyone expected when talks first convened in May . <P> After secret meetings mediated by Chester Crocker , U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs , on Governors Island in New York harbor , the three nations announced they had signed a document outlining the " principles " under which Cuban and South African troops would be withdrawn from Angola and under which the territory of Namibia , which South Africa controls in defiance of United Nations resolutions , would gain its independence . <P> Crocker maintained " there is still a lot of hard work to do " before actual timetables for these events are set .
