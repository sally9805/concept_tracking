Even before there was a nuclear arms race , there were visionary plans afoot to end it . In 1946 , while the U.S. still had a monopoly on the revolutionary new weapons , Washington proposed creating an international agency that would take control of all nuclear weapons and material , after which the U.S. would relinquish its arsenal . " We are here to make a choice between the quick and the dead , " declared former Wall Street Financier Bernard Baruch in presenting the plan to the fledgling United Nations . Moscow 's Ambassador , a youthful Andrei Gromyko , put forth a Soviet counterproposal : a ban on the construction of atomic weapons and the destruction of the U.S. arsenal , with no provisions for inspection or enforcement . The cold war was just getting under way , and no compromise was reached . Three years later the Soviets successfully tested a bomb of their own . <P> Through the years , both nations have often proclaimed their fealty to a world without nuclear weapons and occasionally presented vague plans with phrases like those used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American delegate to the U.N . Disarmament Commission , offered a set of guidelines that included " the dead " of all instruments adaptable to mass destruction .

" The phrase became a staple of Soviet pronouncements and a regular item on the U.N . agenda , though the U.S. and U.S.S.R. have never quite been able to agree on what it means , much less how to achieve it . <P> Ronald Reagan came into office proclaiming that his goal would be significant reductions rather than merely limits on nuclear weapons , as his predecessors had attempted through the SALT process . ( Carter had proposed the same idea in 1977 , but backed away when the Soviets balked . ) Moscow walked out on the negotiations in late 1983 in reaction to the U.S. deployment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe , but spurred by the desire to prevent Reagan from proceeding with his Strategic Defense Initiative , it returned to Geneva early last year to open a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides have shown a propensity for publicly unveiling sweeping new proposals on the eve of important talks , partly as propaganda . Gorbachev 's latest gambit follows in this vein . It also follows in the thus far fruitless tradition of proclaiming the goal of total nuclear disarmament . But the goal is no less worthy than when Baruch spoke of the choice facing the world at the dawn of the atomic age 40 years ago .
