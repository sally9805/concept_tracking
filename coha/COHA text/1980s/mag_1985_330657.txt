The mood has changed abruptly from the soporific to the macabre . And yet despite some grisly testimony , Polish public reaction to the trial of four Polish secret policemen for the abduction of Father Jerzy Popieluszko remains subdued . Poles have grown accustomed to switching on the state-controlled radio broadcast at 10:30 every night and listening to the latest installment of death and deception as defense attorneys and prosecutors alike in Torun 's Courtroom 40 continue to tolerate a flood of contradictions from the witness stand . Perhaps to divert attention from Torun , early last week Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski paid an unprecedented visit to the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk , where the banned trade union Solidarity had its roots . There he talked with workers about high food prices while hunching over work benches , shaking hands and kissing women 's cheeks . <P> Jaruzelski 's trip notwithstanding , there was no shortage of drama at the trial . General Zenon Platek , 58 , the suspended official of the Interior Ministry assigned to monitor church activities , made the surprising claim that the ministry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his 1983 visit to Poland and that several people with explosives were arrested . A Vatican spokesman said last week that he was not aware of such a plot , as did Warsaw 's official spokesman , Jerzy Urban . Platek also claimed that just before Popieluszko 's murder , the priest was to be dispatched to Rome . Vatican officials denied the statement . <P> Center stage last week , however , belonged to Dr. Maria Byrdy , a retired pathologist who conducted the autopsy on Popieluszko after his body was pulled from the Vistula River reservoir . Speaking to a rapt audience , Byrdy , 75 , stated that contrary to her previous opinion , she found it impossible to determine specifically what had been the cause of Popieluszko 's death . <P> The forensic expert testified without emotion that the activist priest died from a combination of severe beating , shock , strangulation by the nylon cord with which he had been trussed and from his inability to expel the blood and vomit that flooded through his respiratory system after the attack . Dispassionately , Byrdy held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Popieluszko 's attackers had forced into their victim 's mouth . <P> Byrdy 's testimony shattered the defense of Grzegorz Piotrowski , the leader of the three secret policemen who admit to having beaten and bound the priest . Although in his testimony he made no attempt to conceal his own part in the kidnaping and killing , Piotrowski has based his hope to escape the death sentence on the earlier autopsy conclusion that the priest had strangled on his bonds . Popieluszko was trussed by Piotrowski 's assistants , co-defendants and former secret police officers Leszek Pekala and Waldemar Chmielewski . By suggesting that the savage beating contributed to Popieluszko 's death , Byrdy may have destroyed Piotrowski 's only defense .
