Noble cities like the provincial capital of Bayonne , dazzling Biarritz , and even the seacoast town of St. Jean-de-Luz radiate fleeting flirtations with royalty and the dust of roaming civilizations . Also amply visible are the ravages of seasonal tourism . From the lilt of their ' ' bonjour ' ' to the splendor of their monuments , these towns look and feel French . But off the beaten track , in the villages of Itaxssou , Itsurits , Oxecelhaya , Sare , and St. Jean-Pied-de-Port , the echo of ancient times defies outside influences. // Here , enfolded by a landscape harsh one moment and soft the next , tiny communities of whitewashed farmhouses roofed with red tile cling to the sides of mountains or snuggle in valleys wide enough for a stream and a one-lane road . Here , supposedly , lives the oldest intact culture on earth , where songs still eulogize the strongest men , the most beautiful women , and the supremacy of a race. // The Basques call themselves Eskualdunak and refer to their land as Eskual-Herria ( a name some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) . These names are part of a language , with different dialects , that resembles no other . Almost unpronounceable combinations of sounds look like a mixed-up bag of letters , full of double and triple consonants , ' ' z ' s ' ' and ' ' x ' s , ' ' that don ' t seem to know where to fall into place. // All of this , ethnologists speculate , could be the result of the Basques ' origins : as desdendents of wandering Berbers , Icelandic , Welsh , or Scottish tribes ; the last of a Stone Age people ; or even survivors of the lost continent of Atlantis. // Whatever their origin , the Basques who live here claim that the purity of their language and customs has remained intact because of the peace of their valleys , the isolation of their hills , and the fact that even the few Basques who leave always return. // Certainly this region of contradictions and flashbacks , challenges and resignation , is like nowhere else in the world . It is a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of their lives by beret-hatted men who - as in centuries past - are sheepherders , fishermen , and farmers. // Every now and then the world ' s attention focuses on border skirmishes in the Basque tussle for independence . But since this most often occurs over the Spanish border , things go on as usual in France , with nothing really changing the enchantment of the landscape or the tempo of its inhabitants. // On one hand , it is pleasant to come here in the warm , flower-filled months of summer , when only the tallest peaks are crowned with snow . But it is an unforgettable experience to visit when most outsiders have departed , the crops are harvested , the sheep have returned from the high meadows , and the Atlantic buffets the land with foaming seas. // In Bayonne , famous for mouthwatering hams and exquisite chocolates , one encounters a melange of Basque , Spanish , and Gascon cultures . Hotels , like the Chateau de Larraldia ( 22 super-deluxe rooms ) or the Grand ( first class ) , offer comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among these are musts : the Basque Museum of folklore and Basque life ; the Connat Museum , which includes one of France ' s most complete collections of the works of Tintoretto , El Greco , Goya , and Bonnard ; and the Gothic Cathedral of Sainte-Marie. // Biarritz , made famous by the attention of Empress Eugenie , Queen Victoria , and Edward VII , is a jewel that represents the ultimate in great resorts . No visit here is complete without a stroll along the magnificent promenade that extends from the super deluxe Hotel du Palais to the Cote des Basques . If you choose the lower promenade along the Boulevard du Prince de Galles , your walk will surely be rewarded with a seemingly endless view of crashing , foaming breakers . Farther down the strand , a handful of outstanding , simple seafood restaurants stand ready to sate your appetite with some of the coziest ambiance and most memorable food in the province. // On the other hand , if a visit to the sea appeals but glitter does not , plan to spend a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) from the intimate and often photographed fishing village of St. Jean-de-Luz . The harbor almost always features a fleet of colorful Basque boats with hulls of green , bright blue , and crimson. // There are more small hotels and guest houses in St. Jean-de-Luz than you can count , and such an abundance of gingham-curtained restaurants that it would take a month to try them all . Some travel buffs claim that the Chantaco at the Chantaco Golf Club ( deluxe ) is the best hotel in town , but I prefer the inns around the bustle of the harbor and the sea . Here one can watch the 40-foot tides in the Bay of Biscay rise and fall dramatically . In November , visitors join Basque families on the quay to bid farewell to the fleet as it departs for the African coast to follow the annual run of the tuna . All year round local markets offer wonderful handcrafted baskets and wickerware , rope-soled espadrilles , and pottery . Although the sea is inexorably entwined with the life of the Basques , perhaps the purest essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This never changes - but in the quietude of fall and winter , visitors stand the best chance of becoming immersed in a way of life they will never forget . That chance is enhanced if you know at least one Basque - somewhere in the world. // We didn ' t know anyone when we arrived in St. Jean-Pied-de-Port for the first time . But there were two things in our favor : We planned to stay in the wonderful chateau of a friend for a few days , and it was off-season . We were steeled for legendary Basque reserve . We were totally unprepared for what actually happened. // A dark , cold rain that obliterated the mountaintops not only greeted us in St. Jean-Pied-de-Port , it made navigating into the foothills impossible . We drove in circles , searching for a road that would lead us to the chateau . After our fifth turn around the town , we paused for another look at the map . Within seconds there was a tap on the window . ' ' Lost ? ' ' the woman queried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seat and directed us to our destination ! // The next day , a salesgirl in the market where we bought picnic supplies called a friend who spoke English to tell him there were Americans in town . From Josef ( who rushed to the store to meet us ) we learned that one of the oldest Basque bellmakers lived in the neighboring village of St. Jean-le-Vieux. // Jean Baptiste Bera , a subdued , rather shy man , explained that his family had been making bells for 180 years . ' ' Look at these , ' ' he gestured , taking down a piece of leather hung with dozens of bells . ' ' They vary in size and pitch from the smallest tinkle for the lambs to the biggest clang for the cows . ' ' Each was embellished with the traditional Basque heart. // ' ' Now with so many trucks transporting our sheep , they do not wear bells . It is only the sheep that live in the mountains and graze in the high meadows for six months who need my bells , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there ? ' ' we asked . ' ' You must know someone , a guide . Find Lerissa . He ' ll show you. ' ' // Jean-Paul Lerissa found us , peering into the windows of an ancient chapel in Ahaxe , another village in the valley . Since he had worked as a sheepherder , then as a landscape gardener in America for 28 years , his English was almost flawless . ' ' Would you like to see the chapelle ? ' ' he shouted. // Before we could answer , a bent old woman in tall , black rubber boots shuffled through the adjoining graveyard into the clearing where we stood . She carried an oversize key . Through our self-appointed interpreter , she informed us that the 400-year-old building was called the ' ' Chapel of St. Andre ' ' and that she , Marie-Louise Cadiou , had been its bell-ringer for 35 years . ' ' When it is bad weather , ' ' she says , ' ' I ring the bells to scare away the sleet and snow. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings , she pointed out that men always sit in the balconies of the aisleless Basque churches , while the women and children occupy the pews on the main floor . ' ' This is because it bothers the men to sit with the women , ' ' she explains , ' ' so they are happier upstairs. ' ' // By midafternoon of the next day we were deep in the mountains with Jean-Paul and his wife , Anne-Marie . Our car climbed higher into the hills of heath , wild mint , fern , and bracken , past fat green fields , trim little apple and cherry orchards , and thick groves of pine and oak . Then rather abruptly the landscape became barren and rocky , the sun faded from the sky . Mist swirled from the deep , now-invisible valleys . ' ' I ' m sorry to tell you that we now must walk , ' ' Jean-Pierre announced as he silenced the motor and held open the door . He strode away. // We followed behind , almost blinded by the ferocity of the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted meadows were crisscrossed by necklaces of undulating gray stone walls . In the distance a sheepherder ' s cottage hunched between converging slopes . We headed for it. // Once under the eaves of its deeply sloping roof - enough to protect the entire flock - Jean-Pierre reaches under a cobwebby beam for the key and unlocks the rough plank door. // We are in one room . A flat stone in the center bears the ashes of a recent fire ; a wooden bed with thick , yellow straw stands in a corner . There is nothing more than a blue kerosene lamp that hangs from the ceiling , one worn book , and three or four pots on the only shelf. // ' ' The Basques are sheepherders , ' ' says Jean-Pierre . ' ' This is how a man lives for over six months of the year . His only companions are his dog , his trusty walking stick , and his flock . ' ' Then he added : ' ' This is where I was forced to come to tend our sheep when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . I think there are too many noises in the night . Now , it ( is ) my brother ' s turn. ' ' // Jean-Paul Lerissa and his far-flung family passed us on from one to another . We watched the ancient ritual of the palombiere , in which enormous nets are strung in the passes of the Pyrenees to trap the pigeons that fly south for the winter . We hiked the high peaks and overnighted in utterly charming hotels like Arraya in Sare and the Argi-Eder in Ainhoa . We picnicked on crusty dark bread and Basque brebis cheese ; dined on local gastronomic favorites like chipirones ( stuffed Cuttlefish ) , fresh salmon , trout , and luscious piperade omelettes filled with ham , potatoes , peppers , and cheese. // We learned that Basque reserve is merely a myth of self-preservation . If you go , they will welcome you with smiles , open doors , and invitations . They will look deeply into your eyes and ask the most personal questions : ' ' Are you happy ? Do you have children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But most of all they will entreat you never to forget that a friend of one Basque is a friend of them all . Forever. // //
