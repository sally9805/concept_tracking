By Anne Raver y landlady wears an old pink waitress dress all the time . She used to make banana splits behind the Woolworth ' s counter downtown , but they laid her off when the Dairy Queen opened right across the street . She still has the little plastic name tag that says , " Hi . My name is Sue " in black letters . We live upstairs and they live down . In the evenings , she stands out back by the bird feeder , watching her husband work in the garden . " The peppers look wonderful , Eddie , " she says , her voice high anduncertain . He ignores her and keeps on pulling weeds , or adjusting the illegal sprinkler . But if she turns towards the house , he ' ll look up and say , " Bring that little rake over here , Susie-Q , " and she will , trotting over and back like a little dog . Loretta Hobbs is right next door . She has two boys and a girl , and all she seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lugs the Rubbermaid basket up and down the cellar steps and scuffs across the yard in her slippers . Their house must be stuffed with dirty socks and underwear , musty blue jeans and mildewed towels . She hangs up the wet clothes , and when the lines are sagging , the pants legs brushing the grass , she rests at her picnic table , nibbling daintily on a bag of Cheetos until there ' s only one left . Then she looks around the yard and yells , " Here , Rascal ! " and this old fat spotted mutt drags himself out from beneath the truck to eat his Cheeto . She pats him on the head so hard he blinks . Loretta always wears black stretch pants and a man ' s shirt , shirttail out , to hide her motherly shape . I wear my old prom dress - because of the heat . Blue satin strapless , with a heart-shaped top . " I really wish you ' d take that dress off , " Sam , my husband , says . I just smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It ' s the heat , " I tell him . " This dress is the coolest thing I have . " At dinnertime , we listen to the weathermen talking about inversions . Heat just sitting there on top of us , stale air , like an electric blanket your husband turns on and you can ' t turn off because there ' s only one control . At night , lying next to Sam , I feel short of breath . I keep thinking he ' s takin all the oxygen and leaving me the carbon dioxide , but that kind of thought is what John , the weatherman , is talking about when he says , " This heat has a way of blowing things all out of proportion . Drink plenty of liquids and let things go until the weather breaks . " I tried to remember that the other night when Sam ' s arm came flying across the bed . He ' s a fitful sleeper , always tossing and turning , replying to his dreams . " You bet ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and landed on my windpipe . I threw it back , thinking how husbands could kill their wives without even waking up . I know it ' s just the heat , but these thoughts keep creeping in . I couldn ' t get back to sleep . The sheets were sticky and the air smelled like hot Mazola . Loretta was popping corn across the drive . Then I heard the hiss of Eddie ' s sprinkler . There ' s a water ban on , so he drags the hose over his parched lawn after midnight , and I lie in bed listening , thinking of my own limp lettuce and beans . In the morning , I wake to the sound of his clippers . Snip , snip , snip , he ' s out there before breakfast , clipping the hedge . I told him we ' d take care of our side , but he can ' t keep his hands off . The other day I watched him just standing there , in his big blue Keds , glaring at the bunch of weeds I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach down over the hedge when I put my face to the screen and said in a low voice , " Don ' t touch the weeds , Eddie . " He almost fell on his face . I moved back so he wouldn ' t see me in the prom dress . I don ' t want people getting the wrong idea . It ' s just the heat , that ' s all . ur landlady knows how hot it is up here . She comes up when we ' re not around , to check on things , on her walls and floors and bathroom fixtures . She thinks they ' re hers , even though we ' re paying rent . We ' ll come home to find the cheap soap dish glued back onto the shower wall , the cracked plastic toilet seat replaced . I imagine her standing in my house , at the window , slumped in her old pink dress , staring miserably out at her husband . It ' s as if she ' s crawled inside of me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when she ' s downstairs , I can hear her moving from room to room , opening the refrigerator door , turning on the water , calling to Eddie . When I take my dress off at night , it stands up at the foot of the bed , like some kind of messenger waiting for permission to speak . Its whole front is stained with grease , tomato sauce , curry - traces of all the meals I cook for Sam . When I pull it on in the morning , I don ' t think about the way it looks ; I just feel the thin cool satin against my skin . I go into the kitchen and put on the coffee , fry the bacon . Loretta waves to me from her kitchenwindow . I found the dress in a bag in the back of the closet when I was looking for one of Sam ' s stray socks . Usually I push the bag back to get at them , but this time I pulled down the zipper , and the crinoline hatched out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking up half the bedroom - all it needed was a pair of arms and a head . I put it on and headed for the bathroom mirror . It swished , like senior year , when we ' d drift away from the boys in the gym to walk down the long hall and listen to that sound . All night long , the ladies ' room was filled with girls admiring themselves . We congregated there , edging one another from the center of the long mirror by the door , pinning and repinning our hair . We were in love with ourselves , and who could blame us ? I pinched my cheeks and pinned up my hair . I stuck a nasturtium over my ear . I can still see my orchid , cold from the refrigerator where my date must have stuck it on top of his mother ' s leftovers , entombed in its cellophane , inside the white satin box . But when he took it out and pinned it to my dress with his clumsy fingers , it drooped . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we floated on the arms of our awkward escorts , indiscriminate fragrant blossoms , dying to be picked . We believed we were meant for someone and when a certain face appeared around the corner , we dissolved into liquid sugar . t was so hot , I just left the dress on . I put on my red red lipstick and played a Billie Holiday record . I vacuumed , crooning old love songs . I liked the way the dress rustled as I wandered about the apartment , the skirt knocking over empty beer bottles by Sam ' s chair . He watches the game every night and I ' ve grown to hate that voice that follows the ball as it dips and curves and fouls over the diamond . That voice won ' t shut up . It fills up the living room and carries over the flow of the water as I wash the dishes ; it comes in beneath the bedroom door as I sit in the middle of the bed , trying not to hear . But I might as well be in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair , leaning forward as one of those tiny figures runs across the screen and bounces manfully off the outfield wall , mitt outstretched , straining for the impossible catch . " Woof ! " Sam yells , just as I get back to my book , and I sit up in bed , my heart leaping . I don ' t know why it ' s been getting on my nerves so much lately . I ' m sure it ' s the heat . At first I ' d wait until Sam went upstairs to his studio , and then I ' d put the dress on , singing " My Last Affair " and whirling around the living room with my arm resting on the shoulder of my tall handsome partner . But I keptbumping into things and Sam would ask me what all the noise was . I ' d say it was my Royal Canadian exercises . " It ' s very distracting , " he would say in his annoyed voice , and I knew he was wishing I ' d gone shopping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam is a sculptor , and the attic is slowly filling up with a family of figures he will soon present to the world . They almost look alive and Sam is very excited about them . Every evening he invites me upstairs . " Would you like to see my family ? " he asks . And I say , " Of course , " but lately , I don ' t know why , I find it hard to share his excitement . It ' s the heat again , I ' m sure . I climb the stairs and stand there , an intruder on an intimate scene . Sam likes sculpt scenes from daily life . They ' re watching a ball game on TV and dinner is simmering on the stove . The woman sits slightly apart from her husband , and the man ' s arm stretches out across the couch , his hand fingering a spring that sticks out of the old upholstery . You can tell that he wants her to move closer , to put her head on his shoulder , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there now , but Sam doesn ' t even notice . The whole room gives me the most horrible feeling , as if Sam has sucked our life up through the ceiling and frozen it there . It ' s the little things that go , one by one . The frog on the windowsill . He has made it a turtle , a geranium growing out of its back , but it ' s really the frog planter I won as a child , pitching pennies at a carnival . The expression on the turtle ' s face is a thinly disguised version of the frog ' s - leering , slightly malevolent . And inside the cupboard in Sam ' s kitchen are things from my kitchen - Sunmaid raisins , a fat old rolling pin , a wooden potato masher . When we first met , he looked at the masher and said , " What ' s that ? " Even the pot on the stove contains a part of me - kale cooking for hours with a piece of smoked ham , stringy acrid leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You should see how he sneaks about in my family home , sniffing around my mother ' s pantry , breathing deep when he opens up the little canisters and tins . I wanted to ream when he found the cookie cutters - I knew the camel would show up in one of the drawers upstairs . He tries to pretend he ' s not looking for things as he sits at the drop-leaf table , arguing with Father and smoking a cigarette . But he ' s watching all the time , how my cushiony-bottomed mother stands at the counter , rolling the pie dough . When her shoes show up on some doll , I ' ll kill him . " Well , what do you think ? " he asks me , watching my face so closely I wish I could view the sculptures from behind one of those rubber Halloween masks . He knows the minute I ' m lying , so I have to tell the truth . Usually , I ' m generous with my praise . " This is amazing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really can feel that woman ' s mood . . . " and so on . But now - since the heat set in - I don ' t like to comment on Sam ' s family circle . I resent them , up there taking up so much space . " They should pay rent , " I told Sam last week . " Ha , ha , " he said , waiting . " Well ? " " They ' re great . Wonderful , " I said , wanting to go outside where I could breathe . " Great . Wonderful . I spend a week on her and that ' s all you can say . Do you like her or not ? " I looked at the woman . I hated the way she just sat there , watching the game without seeing , fending off the expansive air of her husband with those hunched shoulders of hers . " Why is she on the couch ? " I found myself saying . " I don ' t think she should be on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t like baseball , " I said . He closed his eyes . " this one does , " he said . " Can ' t you just look at who she is , react to something without thinking about yourself ? " I looked at her again , trying to be fair . She was smiling , but it seemed so forced , a little strained . But maybe that was just me . I felt so hot , I thought I was going to smother . " You ' re not even interested , " Sam said , and his voice was sad . " No ! That ' s not true ! " I said , but you know how the heat turns everything sour . And you get so tired and listless , you can ' t fight it anymore . " That was before he caught me in the dress . I was vacuuming and the crinoline got caught in the nozzle of the Electrolux . The motor began to whine and then to shriek . Sam rushed downstairs and pulled the plug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was ten in the morning . Billie was crooning a smoky night song . I felt so foolish , my pale shoulders rising out of the heart , my housewife hands clasped virginally over the netting of the skirt . I held out my arms . " Want to dance ? " " Sure , " he said reluctantly , and whirled me about like a doll . He is big , with the arms of a carpenter , the bones wide at the wrist and traveling up to beautifully planed forearms . He wears his shirts rolled up to just before the elbow , to show them off . He ' s very vain , and in the morning he takes a long time combing his moustache and the fine curls that are beginning to be flecked with grey . I suspect him of rubbing my beauty cream on his cheeks , because his skin looks so soft when he comes out of the bathroom . It was all wrong the way he took the lead . I smiled at him , but his eyes were alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go , giving me a little married kiss , like a stamp on a check . I fell into the chair and put a foot on his leg , trying to catch his eye and look at him the way I used to . But he looked away , nervously , and went to get some flour to mix paste . The woman ' s expression wasn ' t quite right , he said . " I ' m going to put on another layer of mache and start over . " y husband ' s eyes are amber , fiery with light , the color of ponds in winter . When we first met , I ' d lie in his big old bed , head propped on my hand , gazing down into them , trying to see the bottom . And he would let me , keeping them open , looking back up into mine , which are more like the sky . But now , if I stare at him from my chair , he looks up uneasily from his book . " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rocking violently , willing him to pat the couch beside him and look back at me with that odd expression he used to have , as if he ' d found some strange shell on the beach and stopped for a better look . But I know what happens to those shells . Sam puts them in his pocket - and then they end up tiny sculptures , arranged on top of the fake TV . " Where is your book ? " he says , wriggling his toes inside his socks . I pick it up again , trying to concentrate . " I ' m going into the other room , " I say . And he says , " No , don ' t go , " hating to be abandoned . He likes me there , holding my book in the same room , an audience for his throat clearings andchuckles , the flaring of his match as he lights a cigarette and inhales luxuriously , drawing more air from the room . I hear him exhale and try not to watch the blue cloud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again . And then , when some dark mood passes between the page and his eyes , he closes them and squeezes the bridge of his nose , or leans way back and stares at the ceiling . " Can you smell all the dead bugs in that light ? " he might say . Or , more likely , he says nothing , waiting in silence . I try , as long as I can , not to notice , not to say , " What ' s wrong , Sam ? " I try to appear as if I ' ve forgotten myself , as if I ' m not wired to his every twitch and rumble . I know it ' s the heat that exaggerates , but I find the very weight of him so distracting - the way he sits at the table , eating . He changes the light that comes in over the sink . I stand there alone , before he gets up , feeling the bright green of the geraniums and their gaudy red faces against the screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water stirring in its bottom . But when Sam comes in , I feel such a heaviness to the air , I strain to catch my breath . " Jane , dunk your donut , " he says . And I say no , I don ' t like to dunk . He shakes his head , his pleasure diminished by my refusal . Our first bed had an ocean view . In the mornings , I ' d lie on my side and watch a pinpoint of orange punch a hole in the pastel horizon . If I moved an inch backward , I ' d feel his hairy big-boned knee against my back , and then I reveled in his solidity . The bed was a soggy ship of overstuffed pillows and sheets , laden with salt air , and we made it creak and sway in the night . When the sun rose , my nose was always cold . I ' d pull up the mothball blankets and turn to look at him and his eye would open like an owl ' s , silently considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the eye would close . I ' d think of getting up and making him something , pancakes , to eat piping hot with coffee . I learned to eat them all in a stack , the way Sam does . Not like my father insisted , one at a time . As a child , I watched him sitting at the head of the table , his knife taking a generous pat of butter and brushing it briskly over the single cake . Taking up his fork , he would slice it like a tender piece of veal , cut a piece of sausage just the right size , and fork both into his mouth . He chewed so purposefully . When men eat , it looks so delicious , I strive to imitate them . " Mary , " Father would say to Mother at the stove . " Have a pancake ! " And she would say , " No thank you . " She would have her poached egg on toast . And his face would glower over the jelly jar as she ate her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first visit home , watching Sam eat his , stacked four at a time , his pat of butter thrust between the fhird and fourth , to settle in a warm pool that oozed out over the sides and unsettled my father , who stared with a stolid air at his own cake , growing cold on the Willoware plate . And when I joyfully forked four onto mine , he looked at me like a traitor . " How can you do that ? " he said . " How can you taste anything in all that mess ? " But I just shrugged , and Sam nodded agreeably , his mouth full . I could taste the flavor exploding over his tongue , the syrup flooding his teeth , the warm dough sliding down his throat , and I smiled , loading on the butter , pouring on the syrup . My father scraped his chair from the table . I thought he was a wonderful man . I knew other women envied me . At parties , they ' d laugh delightedly at his wit , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them how surprisingly soft those bristly hairs are , traveling from my lips to their favorite places , but I ' d say nothing , hiding my smile in my drink . And when we left , I ' d put my arm around his shoulders and we ' d run to our car like Harpo and Groucho . He would drive , and I ' d watch him driving , flipping the radio stations , turning up the volume , singing along at the top of his lungs . Sometimes he would look at me , opening his mouth wider , acting out his rock star fantasy , and I ' d open my mouth really wide , playing the groupie , dress up to her crotch , spangles on her eyelids . made pancakes this morning , but in this heat , they lay heavily on my stomach , and I wished I ' d eaten them one at a time , or had an egg . Sam ate voraciously , squinting at the ingredients on the syrup bottle , and I took my coffee into the other room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam . Whenever I had that empty feeling , I ' d make some fabulous meal . But now , I can ' t even watch when he eats . I sat down in the rocker , picking at the dried bits of dough on the front of my dress . I know I should wash the whole thing out , but I ' m afraid it ' ll just turn to shreds , like a memory you scrub too hard with your mind , asking questions until it dissolves . Phoop ! Sam took a sip of coffee . Glunk . He set the heavy mug back down . I waited for him to swallow and then for the chair to scrape as he moved it out a bit to cross his legs . I don ' t have to be in there to see the sun burnishing the coppery hairs on his hands as they rattle the paper , bending it around and over to his favorite sports column , where he lives the game all over again in print . Snort . He cleared a stubborn place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothed it back down . I sat perfectly still in the other room , wondering why he didn ' t get worried about me , suddenly suspect that I ' d fainted or even died . I like to take pictures , and Sam says I should get a job as a photographer . It would be something to do and keep my mind off him . But that kind of photography doesn ' t interest me . I keep wanting to take dumb pictures , snapshots of Sam and me , of all the things we never get around to . " Here we are pulling up our socks on the Appalachian Trail . . . There ' s Sam getting scrambled by a wave . . . " And later , " Here ' s me , just after Joey , our first baby , was born . " We don ' t have one yet , but we talk about it sometimes . My hair would be flat and greasy-looking from the labor , our faces blurredbecause Sam would be so excited he ' d forget to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them - Joey crawling after the cat , holding a rabbit , riding a brand new tricycle , blowing out candles on a cake , his birthday hat held on by a rubber band . " What do you want to do ? " Sam keeps asking . And I feel silly trying to say it ' s all these little things that don ' t seem to amount to much . The Hobbs family loves to have pictures taken . Loretta puts every shot I give her on top of the TV , in one of those plastic cubes . A couple of days ago , she dug out an old wrinkled color picture of herself and Fred , decked out for their prom . She ' d seen me in the dress when I went out to empty the garbage . " Janie , what the hell - ha ! Playing dress-up , or what ? " Her face was a big blur behind the back screen door . " It ' s the heat , " I said automatically . " Turn around , " Loretta said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a figurine on a cake , and Loretta kept saying , " Oh wow . " Then she told me to wait right there , and disappeared . I lay down on the chaise , thinking Sam would love me with a tan , but the bugs started crawling up my skirt . Loretta ' s back door slammed and she came scuffing across the grass , holding a wrinkled snapshot . " See ? Mine was just like yours , only yellow , " she said . I sat up and looked . " Brucie owes his life to that dress , " she said . Brucie ' s her oldest . I used to look down on girls like Loretta , but now I think she knew what the prom was all about , climbing over the back seat with Fred . " You and Sam ever going to have kids ? " she asked me . And I said , " Oh yes . Sam is working on that . " She snorted , and I felt her bulk beside me , like a big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , but it ' s comfortable . I didn ' t tell her what I really meant . " I ' ve created a new figure , " Sam had said at breakfast that morning . " A baby named Igor . He ' s a great big boy , always into everything . Yesterday , he swung the cat by its tail . " For a crazy instant , I thought he ' d seen the snapshots of Joey , but then I realized we don ' t have any yet . I was struck by the pride in Sam ' s voice . He sounded like one of those boring mothers who can ' t stop talking about how brilliant and precocious her child is . And all I could think was , I didn ' t want to see Sam ' s baby . And I hadn ' t , until tonight . I made Sam his favorite dinner - crab cakes , corn on the cob , fresh tomatoes so juicy they dripped over my hands as I sliced them . I watched his mouth open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed , savoring the delicate touch of mustard . " Oh God , " he said . He took a big bite of corn bread , loaded with butter , and licked the honey off his fingers . " Have some more tomatoes , " I urged , waiting for him to notice the fresh basil in the dressing . " What did you put in this dressing ? " he asked , and I wanted to leap across the table , drag him into the bedroom . We could turn on the fan . Then he started talking about his work again . " I don ' t know just when I realized they needed a baby ! But they ' re the kind of people who just keep reproducing themselves , like those couples who collect more and more glassware by eating the right kinds of cereal , and buying cartons of lightbulbs from those women who call on the phone . " I told Sam he should make a baby that could cry , and he threw me that maybe-you ' ve-got-something-there look . But then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that again . " Like I said , we keep talking about it , but not doing much . Sam keeps saying , " Let ' s wait , okay ? I ' m on the verge of a breakthrough ... besides , Janie , think about it . All the dirty diapers and the getting up in the night and the baby talk . it fills up your mind and pretty soon you don ' t have any ideas anymore . . . " So I wasn ' t surprised when Sam started making a baby upstairs . I got up and scraped the plates . Loretta looked up - she was drinking her Kahlua and cream at the picnic table . Rascal ' s feet stuck out from beneath the truck , and James , the youngest , was tickling them with a stick . " Stop torturing the dog , James , " Loretta would say every time Rascal ' s feet twitched , but James just kept right on . Fred was in this old bathtub down at the end of his garden . He fills it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old red gym shorts . That ' s the way they are - just taking life as it comes , living with the heat . But tonight , we were all trying to ignore the little drama going on over the hedge . " I ' m not going to can those lousy tomatoes , " Sue was saying . " You can just do it yourself . " Eddie ' s back stayed bent over the staked plants , so she said a little more . " I hate gardening . I always have . If you made any money , I ' d buy everything frozen and just stick it all in the Frigidaire . I ' d get one of those combination-types , you know , where one whole side is a freezer - " She ' d been staring up at the blackening sky , and she didn ' t see Eddie ' s palm until it hit her , right against the ear . We all quickly pretended to do something else . Loretta turned on the transistor . I turned on the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat - getting to all of us. fter I washed the dishes , I decided to take a bath . I left the dress in a heap by the bed and in the tub , I thought of fall - waking up to a cool wet morning with fog creeping up the river and onto the lawns , feeling sea salt on my lips . Somewhere , where the heat has broken , people are alive out there , thriving , working in their gardens , jackhammering roads , climbing the steps of museums , reading newspapers on rattling subway cars . Just thinking about it made me feel better , and when I got out of the bath , I put on some clean clothes and decided to ask Sam to go for a walk . The TV was on , but his chair was empty and I knew he had gone upstairs . Iwent up and found him hard at work on his latest idea . What are you doing ? " I yelled , though I saw perfectly well . He was trying to pull the skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips , but they were too wide , and I said , " Look out ! You ' re going to rip it . " Sam looked up . " Hi ! Should I try over the head ? Aren ' t I a genius ? Doesn ' t this give her just the edge she needed ? A kind of irony ? Do you like her now ? " " No ! " I yelled , and grabbed for the dress . I tugged on her legs , surprised at how light and brittle they felt . I keep forgetting it ' s just papier mache . " Are you crazy ? " Sam said , holding on to her bare shoulders . " Give me my dress back ! " I hissed , and we struggled , pulling on her . Her face didn ' t change at all , and I realized I ' d seen people like her before - in the tomb rooms in Mexico . Brown waxy-looking bodies , as dry as insect shells , stacked up against the walls . Some of them still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions of their former selves . I yanked harder and this time she came apart . I was holding onto two hollow legs and a couple yards of old satin skirt . Sam had her under the arms and he was saying softly , " Look at what you ' ve done . You ' ve torn her in half . I can ' t believe this . " " But you ' ve ruined my dress , " I said , trying not to cry . " You call this a dress ? " asked Sam . " It was an old rag when you put it on . " The sky rumbled , and Sam said dully , " It ' s going to rain . " I just stood there , wondering if Sam was right , if I was getting all upset over nothing . Then I saw the baby on top of the TV . Round and rosy and perfect , but a little too pink . " I think I ' ll take a walk , " I said , and picked him up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Don ' t worry . I know how to hold them , " I said . I walked downstairs and turned towards the river , hoping it would be a little cooler there . He was so light in my arms , not like a real baby lying against your breast , with those little feet that push and kick against your hand . Mothers say it ' s like that inside the womb - the foot kicks so powerfully and then , after they ' re born , that same pink heel hits your palm . It ' s like a memory , connecting the inside to the out . I just stood there , longing for a breeze , and I thought at first that nothing was moving . But then I saw a little spider drifting on the current , and without even thinking , I just tossed him in , and watched him float away . I forgot , papier mache doesn ' t sink . He drifted around the bend and out to sea , and I just watched him go , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you can ' t stand the heat anymore , there ' s a crack of thunder in the sky.CENTS B07809515
