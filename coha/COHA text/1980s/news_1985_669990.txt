I confess a partiality for amphibious spy fiction , the novel of intrigue that moves between fact and imagination , and has secrets to convey about the real world . But this is a risky exercise , and few writers have both the inside knowledge and the literary craft to do it well . In " The Man Who Loved Mata Hari " ( Donald I. Fine , 352 pages , $17. 95 ) , spy novelist Dan Sherman has picked one of the most romantic subjects conceivable for a novel of this genre . This is both his opportunity and his problem . What can he tell us about the great seductress that a dozen biographers and romancers haven ' t told us already ? How , as entertainer , can he vie with what Greta Garbo did for the dancer-courtesan in her 1930s movie ? The publisher makes some bold claims for the novel . According to the dust jacket blurb , it " brings to light for the first time the shocking truth behind the legend of ' Mata Hari . ' " The author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and announces himself , in a letter sent out by his publisher ' s publicists , as " the world ' s current expert " on Mata Hari . Hyperbole of this sort affects me much the same way as hay fever , but I decided to give Mr. Sherman the benefit of the doubt . I had read one of his previous thrillers , " Prince of Berlin , " and enjoyed it as pure entertainment . The thesis of " Mata Hari , " it emerges , is that the temptress was not a spy , but a scapegoat . She was supposedly tried and executed by the French in 1917 as a German agent on the basis of a frame-up arranged by British Intelligence , which ( we are given to understand ) wanted someone to blame for the slaughter on the Somme the previous year . Now , the real Mata Hari was no great shakes as a spy . Allen Dulles , who knew something about espionage , didn ' t include any of the accounts of her adventures in his collections of " Great True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she didn ' t belong in that league . The French would probably not have shot her but for the war hysteria gripping Paris in 1917 . Mr. Sherman ' s claim to authority on these matters is punctured early on in his yarn , when he starts to lecture his readers on British Intelligence . We ' re told , for example , that the Secret Intelligence Service was founded in 1905 , and that its chief was " the legendary Mansfield Cummings . " As a matter of fact , the Secret Service Bureau ( as it was then described ) was set up in 1909 ; and in 1905 its first chief , Commander Mansfield Smith-Cumming ( who shortened his name later to Cumming , not Cummings ) was working for the Navy in Southhampton . Mr. Sherman could have checked these and other highly pertinent details in a number of recent non-fiction works , including Nigel West ' s much-discussed " MI-6 . " Had he done so , he might have avoided such howlers as a description of British spymasters handing out " four-figure checks " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Service Budget was under 50 , 000 pounds . It hardly seems excessive to ask that the author be accurate about such facts when he asks the reader to believe that he is telling the " truth " about something for which there is no evidence  --  that the British " set up " Mata Hari . Not only does this book misinform , it also fails to entertain . Most of the narrative is couched in the subjunctive , depriving the reader of any sense of urgency or immediacy . The characters almost never have anything to say to each other : " They had run out of things to say . " The author really should have studied the dialogue in those marvelous , breathy spy films of the 1930s . Remember the Austrian spychief ' s opening shot to Marlene Dietrich , the call girl-agent in " Dishonored " ( 1931 ) ? " I need a woman who knows how to deal with men . " And he ' s convinced she ' s the right woman when she says coolly , " I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of death either . " Mr. Sherman also has little feeling here for time or place . Two characters meet regularly in Paris " in one of the more atmospheric cafes along the Left Bank . " The hero  --  the English painter Gray , the man who loves Mata Hari  --  goes to Rome , where he " admired the architecture . " We aren ' t shown the magic of Mata Hari ' s dancing . We never see why Gray , the victim of love , waits for her year after year , through betrayals and absences . He ' s an artist , and that should allow the author to tell his story through a fresh , visual perspective . Instead , we ' re shown Gray doing sketches from life in the first chapters . Then , halfway through the book , he ' s described as an abstract painter , without explanation . Even the sex scenes are vapid . As Mr. Sherman describes the German spymaster ' s first love-making with Mata Hari : " He was on her like a white scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown talent before , and I am sure will do so again . But the best that can be said about " The Man Who Loved " is that it does succeed in making Mata Hari mysterious . If this book were your only guide , it would be impossible to understand why anyone succumbed to her charm.  --  - Mr. Moss is the author of four spy novels.
