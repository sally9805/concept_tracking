He urged teachers to support an array of measures that he said would help them achieve greater status , decision-making power and job satisfaction. // " Collective bargaining has been a good mechanism , and we should continue to use it , " Mr. Shanker told the annual convention of the New York State United Teachers at the Niagara Falls International Convention Center . " But now we must ask whether collective bargaining will get us where we want to go. " // // Offers Several Ideas // Mr. Shanker , president of the American Federation of Teachers , a union in the A.F.L.-C . I.O. , warned that if teachers " continue working away only at collective bargaining , " they would find themselves with little additional professional status in 10 or 15 years. // The proposals he urged teachers to support included these : // * A national examination to limit entry into teaching. // * A system that would allow students freedom to choose the public schools they attended so they would no longer be " captive clients. " // * Impartial panels of experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladders that lead to supervision by experienced teachers of the development of novices. // * A restructuring of education to encourage bright young people to enter teaching even if they intend to remain only five or six years . <> <> Effort at Revitalization // Mr. Shanker ' s proposals come as the quality of teaching in elementary and secondary schools is under intense scrutiny across the nation . Spurred by a series of critical reports , most states are trying to revitalize teaching at the very time that the field faces a shortage of qualified applicants. // Two years ago in a speech to the same group , Mr. Shanker asked teachers to be open to change . In what seemed to be a continuation of that tone , Mr. Shanker today maintained that unless teaching took on the qualities of a profession such as medicine or the law , it would be impossible to raise standards or attract first-rate candidates. // " We won ' t get the best and the brightest students to become teachers if we continue to be treated like workers in a factory , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 teachers from throughout New York State. // Mr. Shanker , who announced last week that he was running for his last two-year term as president of the local United Federation of Teachers in New York City , said a key to making teaching more fully a profession is for teachers to obtain a major role in setting educational policy . He asserted that school boards , superintendents and principals now reserve for themselves authority that should be shared or handed over entirely to teachers. // " A professional is not a person who just follows orders , " Mr. Shanker said . " A professional is permitted to operate independently , make decisions , is not tightly supervised , is trusted and is generally well compensated . " <> <> Unexpected Conclusion // He said that when teachers began negotiating labor contracts two decades ago , they expected officials to resist salary demands and to be open to giving teachers authority instead. // But the opposite happened , according to Mr. Shanker , who said that it had turned out that " professional issues were not subject to negotiation. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are limits to what can be achieved through collective bargaining . It was a conclusion that few would have expected from Mr. Shanker in past years , when he seemed to be telling teachers that the negotiating table was the best place to make gains. // Mr. Shanker said , in effect , that teachers ' unions could enhance their professional standing by taking actions outside of those called for in their contracts . For example , he said a union could refuse to admit as members teachers who had not passed a specific test. // Another such move Mr. Shanker envisioned is the creation of review panels that would support the dismissal of incompetent teachers if the panel agreed with the findings of administrators. // Mr. Shanker ' s speech was well received by the federation members , who in the last year have grown accustomed to hearing their national leader stake out surprising positions in response to the widespread demands for educational reform. // " He ' s usually way ahead of his time , " said Shirley Swanson , past president of the union in Guilderland Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when collective bargaining was necessary for keeping our heads above the water . But , ultimately , you don ' t get to be a professional at the negotiating table . Doctors and lawyers didn ' t do it that way. " // Another teacher , Vincent Giglio , first vice president of the union in the Middle Island district of Suffolk County , said that he agreed with Mr. Shanker , but that the progress toward professionalism might be slow. // " School boards and others will not readily give up authority , " said Mr. Giglio , a teacher of learning-disabled youngsters . " I don ' t think this kind of professionalism will be possible to attain in the near future . " <> <> Speech by Cuomo // A foundation for Mr. Shanker ' s comments today was laid Friday in speeches by Governor Cuomo and Gordon M. Ambach , the State Education Commissioner . Both called for new measures that would upgrade the status of teachers. // The Governor pledged to help raise teachers ' salaries across the state. // " If we really value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our future as everybody says it is , then we have to make teaching a more attractive career , enabling teachers to support themselves and their families , to live decently ; frankly , to secure the respect which - right or wrong - our society attaches to how much a person earns , " Mr. Cuomo said to rousing applause . He promised to ask the Legislature next year to provide funds to local school districts for increases in teachers ' salaries. // Mr. Ambach urged the state to provide money for internships in which first-year teachers throughout the state would be supervised by master teachers , a step that ties in with a proposal made by Mr. Shanker today. // Mr. Shanker said that , if more choice among public schools were offered , supporters of public education would be able to argue more persuasively against the idea of tuition-tax credits for families of youngsters who attend nonpublic schools. // " You choose a lawyer or doctor , " he said , urging that the same be possible in public education. //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
