Previously , the Iowa housewife held down a good job as an executive secretary . Returning to the job market after several years , she was dismayed to discover that her skills and experience were no longer marketable because of the ' ' information revolution . ' ' So she is working as a supermarket checker. // Mrs. Buckingham ' s experience is becoming increasingly common as new computer and information technologies transform the workplaces of America . In some cases , whole professions are being gradually eliminated and new ones created. // ' ' I feel very inadequate because of these new machines . They are very fascinating , but they scare me because I don ' t know a thing about them , ' ' Mrs. Buckingham admits. // Her experience and feelings underscore some of the central points of a report issued this week by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment ( OTA ) . Titled ' ' Informational Technology and Its Impact on American Education , ' ' this study discusses the considerable challenges that these revolutionary machines present to America ' s educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might play in meeting them. // ' ' Modern society is undergoing profound technological and social changes brought about by what has been called the information revolution . . . . The impacts of this revolution affect individuals , institutions , and governments - altering what they do , how they do it , and how they relate to one another . If individuals are to thrive economically and socially in a world that will be shaped , to a large degree , by these technological developments , they must adapt through education and training , ' ' the OTA report observes // These developments are creating major new demands for education and training in the United States . Literacy is being redefined to include the ability to use computers and information systems . And the penalties for illiteracy in these areas are increasing , as Mrs. Buckingham ' s case illustrates. // A key element in these new educational needs , the OTA finds , is ' ' that they will constantly change . In a rapidly advancing technological society , it is unlikely that the skills and information base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same job a few years later . Lifelong retraining is expected to become the norm for many people. ' ' // This challenge comes at a time when America ' s educational system is undergoing serious reevaluation . More than any other nation , the United States has considered education a ' ' public good ' ' that should be available to everyone . As Alexis de Tocqueville noted in 1831 , ' ' ( Americans ) agree in thinking that the diffusion of knowledge . . . is absolutely necessary for a free people like their own , where there is no property qualification for voting or for standing for election . ' ' On this premise , Americans established a whole range of public institutions : elementary and secondary schools , four-year and community colleges , libraries , and museums. // Today , however , this concept is under attack from those who argue that education and information should be treated as a commodity to be distributed by the marketplace . Information technologies are sharpening this debate because they are making it ' ' easier to produce and distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out. // Seymour Papert , one of the leaders in the field of artificial intelligence , favors this move away from the traditional approach to education . In a 1979 essay on computers and learning , he stated that , with the explosion of privately owned computers , for the first time there will be ' ' a viable alternative to schools and the possibility that education will once more become a private act . ' ' While acknowledging a ' ' sinister possibility ' ' that computer learning will be appropriated by an elite class , Mr. Papert argues that this need not happen , that ' ' the computer has the potential of serving everybody. ' ' // If computers and other social forces lead to the increasing privatization of education , ' ' individuals and groups that can afford to buy educational services may be more satisfied . . . . But fewer social resources may be made available to support . . . the public benefits of education , ' ' the OTA study comments . It also notes that ' ' a serious social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and those who do not have access to , and the ability to use , information systems. ' ' // Skeptics point out that past technologies , such as television , were expected to transform education but failed to do so . However , the demands for education and retraining being created by the new technologies themselves may be so great that they can only be met by computer-aided instruction. // ' ' If properly employed , information technology has certain characteristics which suggest it will be invaluable for education , ' ' the OTA reports . It will allow access to education and training in all parts of the country and any time of the day or night . Its services can be provided at home or at work , where and whenever needed. // Still , some educators warn that the long-term implications of relying heavily on computers in the classroom are not sufficiently understood. // The federal government has a number of different courses of action open to it , if it wishes to address these issues , the OTA suggests . These include : // * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . This would decrease the signficant cost of ' ' wiring ' ' the nation ' s schools , but might lock them into obsolete computer systems. // * Subsidizing development of educational software , which is currently limited in both quality and quantity. // * Directly funding computer acquisition by the schools . This would attract manufacturers and software writers into the educational field , but may promote premature and unwise purchases. // * Increasing federal support for research and development of education technology , particularly in the areas of learning strategies , methods for production of software , and the long-term impact of technology-based education. // Currently , these issues have not achieved much political prominence . The process of forming a federal policy is still in the earliest , most formative stage. // OTA researchers report that they ' ' found strong support not only among economists but also in the business community for the view that the availability of literate , well-educated workers is an important determiner of productivity and economic growth. ' ' // Other experts have pointed out that nations lagging behind in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgoing increased productivity. // //
