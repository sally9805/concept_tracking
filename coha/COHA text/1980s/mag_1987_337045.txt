The over-the-counter stock market has not had many good days lately . So when prices were going up last Wednesday , the last thing traders needed was an unexpected 82-minute shutdown of the computerized NASDAQ system that provides quotations on over-the-counter stocks . The mysterious malfunction helped reduce that day 's trading volume to 82.5 million shares , just over half the average activity . <P> If any traders smelled a rat , they were not far wrong . The problem was traced to a squirrel that is thought to have scampered onto a power line in Connecticut while carrying a piece of aluminum foil . That caused a power failure that cut off electricity to more than 2,000 area homes and businesses  --  and knocked out NASDAQ computers in Trumbull , Conn . Traders may have lost a chance to make money , but at least their problem was only temporary . The squirrel was electrocuted.
