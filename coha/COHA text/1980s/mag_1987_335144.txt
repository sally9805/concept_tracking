Many a Protestant parson caught up in scandal has quietly been found guilty by an ecclesiastical panel and has then slipped from view . But last week a double defrocking was proclaimed to the world by the national head of the ministers ' denomination . The ousted preachers are Jim Bakker , who confessed to adultery last March and then gave up his multimillion-dollar PTL television network and theme park at Fort Mill , S.C. , and his former top executive , Richard Dortch , who was accused of orchestrating a cover-up of Bakker 's lapse . <P> District officials of the Assemblies of God , a Pentecostal denomination with 2.3 million U.S. followers , reached the decision on the two clergymen during two days of discussions in Fayetteville , N.C. Their findings were endorsed in a telephone conference by the national denomination 's 13-member Executive Presbytery and announced at Assemblies headquarters in Springfield , Mo . <P> The Assemblies expelled Bakker not only for committing adultery with Jessica Hahn , a former church secretary from West Babylon , N.Y. , but also for " alleged misconduct involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence in Palm Springs , Calif. , Bakker declared to reporters , " I 'm not a homosexual . " However , sources familiar with the Assemblies investigation of PTL ( for Praise the Lord or People That Love ) reported that incriminating testimony came from witnesses who claimed to have participated in such sexual activity with Bakker . <P> G. Raymond Carlson , general superintendent of the Assemblies of God , said " many people " were willing to confront Bakker and Dortch with their charges but the accused clergymen declined to participate in the investigation . " There is a very large file on this , " said Carlson . " Other evidence could be used , " but the officials " felt this was sufficient . " Church observers noted that adultery alone justified defrocking . The homosexual charge may have been put on the record so that Bakker would have to respond to it if he ever sought to regain ministerial credentials . Under Assemblies bylaws , a minister ousted for adultery can apply for reinstatement after two years , but homosexual activity brings permanent banishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its TV show until he was forced out last month . Dortch was found guilty of failing to notify church leaders of Bakker 's misconduct and of subsequent deceit ( the two men arranged hush-money payments of $265,000 to Hahn and her advisers ) . Dortch 's downfall after 33 years in the ministry was especially awkward . He had been the Illinois superintendent for the denomination and had served 14 years on the very body that ordered his defrocking . Bakker and Dortch , who had no immediate response to the action , have 30 days to file an appeal to the Executive Presbytery , although that is considered unlikely . <P> Badly shaken by the scandals , PTL last week put its debt at $65 million and began laying off 220 of its 2,000 employees . Assemblies Superintendent Carlson said the scandal " has been most painful , very difficult , embarrassing and humiliating " for his group , the fastest-growing Protestant denomination in the U.S. The Assemblies have ordered a special day of prayer and fasting for all 10,886 congregations on May 17.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
