I saw William Buckley talk about Overdrive on the David Letterman show last month . ( As you must know by now , the book is a journal , a week 's worth of his opinions , judgments , activities , tastes , appreciations , retaliations and self-justifications . ) He began , he told David , from the assumption that one can say something interesting about anything , cited Steinbeck on a turtle and Joyce on Leopold Bloom , added a quick half-sentence disavowing equality with either and concluded that one can learn a great deal about the times by examining small events closely . Well , I thought , at least he 's cannier than Jimmy Breslin , who used to counter critics of his lurid Son of Sam columns by declaring in his friend-of - boxers-andboozers way that " Shakespeare , Marlowe , great poets through the ages " wrote about murderers . I watched Buckley with interest , since many who dislike his politics have written at some length about his personal charm . A gracious man , they say , a generous friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've often thought he must be like one of those period hostesses called charming in memoir after memoir and wearisome by reader after reader . That evening I ? saw flickers of charm , mostly , in dumbshow : the darting tongue , the widened eyes , the ' eyebrows edging upward then together , the careful movement of hand to chin , the lip preparing to curl disdainfully , the general air of vigilant languor were held in check . Still , the tone liberal admirers take toward Buckley is nervously effusive ; I wonder if they are n't suffering from tokenism ( " . . . the only articulate conservative who valued vulnerability at least as much as principle " ; " Citizenship for most of us is a hobby ; for him it is a calling " ) . Anyone who has ever been liberal about anything has suffered from tokenism : you exclaim suddenly over ' qualities you 'd take for granted anyplace else ; you benefit from what Margo Jefferson 's work has appeared in The Village Voice , Grand Street , Ms. and other magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token has to offer ( access to a dif- ferent world ) ; you retain all the comforts of home ( that warm glow o amiable condescension ) ; you emer with a heightened sense of your soc a standing and versatility . Anglophilia must play a part : Buckley 's manner and diction bask in it while trying to best it . ( In his thriller Saving the Queen , golden C.I.A . boys wrest glory , honor , bon mots and phallic panache from inbred Englishmen with titles , sadistic streaks and communist leanings . ) And perhaps his references and Latin maxims please some adults the way knowing all the - answers on College Bowl used to please some students . But I do n't think his charm needs high praise or close scrutiny . Would n't you be gay and companionable if your politics were based on nostalgia and self-congratulation buttressed by personal wealth ? And if you took pride in your intellectUal sophistication , would n't you cultivate charm and gobd manners ? They 're useful for proselytizing , and if one takes a Calvinist line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of grace . BuckleyV enjoys himself and his life ; charm is part of his job as a professional entertainer . But when he 's a host on Firing Line , that amiability gives way to sneers ; it 's as though once the business of selling books is done , only the deserving receive charity , that is genuine courtesy . He 's mastered a road-show version of patrician rudeness  --  you do n't lose your temper , you display it . Phrases like " witty insolence " and " lofty eloquence " are meant to spring to mind when we watch W.F.B. They do , since they 're cliched descriptions of a style cribbed from the basic British statesman and man of letters model . I do n't say this style ca n't be effeiy tive ; for one thing , Buckley was shrewd enough to adapt it to journalism and not , say , poetry . It 's coarsened over the years , and it was always garish . ( I often like garishness , but not when it believes so in gentility  --  a lapsed Philadelphian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalling the Main Line parvenus of her youth . ) But he 'll have his place in television history as a polysyllabic farceur , the M.C. of sophistry . Buckley is a professional and recreational snob ( snob : n obs. snob member of the lower classes , fr . E dial. , shoemaker ) . He 's bootblack to the powerful , plying his trade in full view of the media-tuned middle classes , hosting PBS 's " Brideshead Revisited " with a grave and reverent air meant to suggest his intimacy with the ways of the Flyte world . Still , is n't it possible that a book like C erdrive might reveal another Buck- , ? ? a man of easy elegance , like Black -- ford Oakes , dashing hero of Saving the Queen , who is " without affectation , with the possible exception that he never labored to conceal his intelligence which is so much the accepted thing to do that acting naturally , intelligence sometimes , becomes suspect as affectation " ? Well , no . First of all , it 's not a journal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckley tells us that an earlier book written in the same form , Cruising Speed , " had in my judgment succeeded in exploring an unusual device for autobiographical introspection  --  easier to execute , and in some ways more revealing than the more comprehensive conventional treatments . " Each busy day of Overdrive holds ' Icij-ities , reminiscences and anecdotes ; ' , : i'Oawords for friends ( John Kenneth Galbraith , David Niven ) , sharp ones for offenders ( Gore Vidal , Vassar students who protested his giving their commencement address ) ; excerpts from speeches , letters , Firing Line transcripts and columns . There are nice moments , as when he describes his mother or Wanda Landowska . And I did n't mind the media-management details of his career and image  --  they had the brisk , functional self-absorption you find in show business autobiographies , also the quick , vivid plunges from geniality to vindictiveness and the compulsion to set every appearance right . This works when it 's a question of acerbic letters to delinquent editors . But with more complicated issues , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misbehavior is proved , IT'while the company 's financial rectitude is not . Then there is the matter of vanity . Was it wise of W.F.B. to reprint a dispute with columnist Herb Caen over whether Evelyn Waugh had been serious when he called Buckley a bore ? Here 's the disputed portion of Waugh 's 1960 letter to writer Tom Driberg : " Can you tell me : did you in your researches come across the name of Wm . F. Buckley Jr. , editor of a New York , neoMcCarthy magazine named National Review ? He has been showing me great &; unsought attention lately &; your article made me curious . Has he been supernaturally ' guided ' to bore me ? It would explain him . . . . If anything can . " Here , presented as opposing evidence , is part of a letter Waugh wrote Buckley two years later . " Very many thanks for Rumbles . Some of the essays were familiar to me from National Review . I reread them with the same zest as those which were new . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in controversies in which he has no direct concern . I con- gratulate you on the collection . At your best you remind me of Belloc ; at your second best of Randolph Churchill . " Waugh , Buckley tells us , wrote two pieces for N. R. Given Waugh 's publish- ing savvy , his well-known duplicity and his artful dodger 's malice , is n't a liter-ary bread-and-butter note a rather barbed laurel to rest on ? I certainly do n't think Buckley should feel obliged to note that his son was of-fered a job as speech writer for George Bush " based on his past writings for Es-quire . " Bush and Buckley pere are among the twenty-six members of Hill-billies , " our little club in the Bohemian grove " ; all three men are Yale alumni . Preferential treatment or affirmative ac- tion based on school and family ties is similar in form if not content to that based on sex or race . Both are meant to protect qualified job applicants : from open competition in the first case and from open discrimination in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited for his job and would do it well . It would have been nice , amid all this , to find pithy esthetic judgments scattered through Overdrive . Much has been made of Buckley 's gifts as an amateur musi-cian and of his taste in general . But it 's all book jacket and billboard talk ? Hugh Kenner is " perhaps the supreme arbiter of literary taste living today " ; Nicholas Nickleby was " surely the most captivating theatrical experience I 've ever had . " There are a few glimpses of Rosalyn Tureck , but for the most part music calls up the same old public do- main words used by audiences and amateurs the world over : " breath- catching , " " marvelous , " " horrifyingly difficult . " And why claim that Bach is such a rarefied taste ? Buckley once did a program called " Why Are They So Afraid of Bach ? " ; I 'd like to do one called " Why Are ' They ' So Afraid Bach is Easy to Love ? " I was mildly curious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sends up a - tuna sandwich with cheese-something she has read about somewhere , she clutters up the harpsichord with photos , she talks on the phone for hours and of- fers to record the 7 o'clock news , except that she 's forgdtten whether the video- cassette antenna switch should be off or on . At the week 's end she sets a splendid table for a luncheon honoring Georr Bush , which causes her husband to reflect , " Men tend not to focus on the amount of time these things take . " He also notes that she is in " one of those permanent international best-dressed women categories , " but again he fails to focus on the value of her achievement . Those who have followed Mrs. Buckley in the pages of fashion magazines might have noticed that her militant opulence ( stockpiled waves of hair , clusters of jewels , voracious ruffles and furs ) is the visual equivalent of his verbal style . My nominations for the worst sentences in Overdrive are as followS . For content based on specios reasoning and bogus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather the burglary , however reprehensible , had succeeded , than that Watergate and - the collapse of a foreign policy should have happened . Put it this way : if the Scotch tape at Watergate had stuck , maybe there would n't have been any boat people " ; and " It is much easier to convey the image of a single child or mother blasted to eternity as the result of the bombing in Vietnam than successfully to communicate the quality of life of Ivan Denisovich , multiplied by a factor of ten to fifteen million , in a camp to which CBS cameras have no access . " For poor prose without redeeming social value , I chose " The feeling , after lecturing , on regaining the occupancy of one 's room is a delight whose resonances have been insufficiently sung . " The best writing belongs to scholar Sophie Wilkins for her letter to W.F.B. debunking National Review editor Jef7P frey Hart 's sycophantic account of a reading T.S . Eliot gave at Columbia . " The Great Dead Poet , " she wrote , " looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress uniform ( penguins ) : Jacques Barzun to the right of him , Lionel Trilling to the left of him . . . . Not one living word came out of him , in that dead voice ( the poet was dead , the man had probably never been so happy , and I did not begrudge him that ; he had certainly earned it ) . But to read Jeffrey Hart 's pious conclusion , ' Eliot was the West that night . ' Yes indeedy , but if so , tion of The Rivals , Buckley 's speech rhythms could do wonders with Mrs. Malaprop 's linguistic pratfalls . But finally , I believe his style belongs to popular culture . He might ? be placed , for instance , in the tradition of Adolphe Menjou , who brought his greased and oiled worldliness first to movies , then to Senator McCarthy . But what I 'd really like to do is stage a minstrel show for Buckley . No hiding behind burnt cork  --  my minstrels would show the skins they were born with . Just Buckley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rhythm of tambo and bones . -
