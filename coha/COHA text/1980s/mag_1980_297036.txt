Halloween in Houston <P> Before the 70 first-graders at Stephens Elementary School north of Houston could perform a Halloween pageant for their families last week , Democratic Congressman Bob Eckhardt and Republican Challenger Jack Fields , 28 , put on their own show . <P> Fields , a vice president of his family 's cemetery company , started by declaring : " Eckhardt represents everything that is wrong with this country . He would destroy the free enterprise system and destroy the work ethic . " Charged Fields of the seven-term incumbent : " He voted nine times for busing to desegregate schools . He voted against the B-l bomber . He voted for gun control . He voted to give tax dollars to Communist countries . " <P> Eckhardt , 67 , looking like a rumpled professor in his tweed suit and bow tie , but sounding like a Southern populist , replied that many of the charges were false . Said he : " I have never voted for a statute that would call for forced busing . I have never been for gun control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He claimed that the campaign ( " the dirtiest I 've ever encountered " ) was the work of ghosts hovering behind the scenes . Said he : " The $600,000 raised by oil companies for Fields is being used to repeat absolute lies . They 're not concerned with gun control and these other things . They 're concerned about their pocketbooks . " <P> Eckhardt has long tilted at the oil companies , fighting for continued price controls on some categories of oil and for a strong windfall-profits tax . This year these positions have come back to haunt him . Oil executives and many of the Sunbelt migrants to his district dislike Eckhardt 's liberalism . But in east Houston , where most of his district 's 30% blacks and Hispanics live , Eckhardt has strong backing from those who work in the huge refineries . As he said last week at a union hall while introducing Senator Edward Kennedy , who was on a Texas swing for President Carter : " My supporters make the riches but do n't share in the profits . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out four pairs of shoes while knocking on 20,000 doors in 18 months . He has got strategic and financial help from the national Republican Party , including prepackaged issue papers designed to appeal to conservatives on matters like school prayers ( favored ) and abortion ( opposed ) . <P> Fields , who claims that only 20% of his money comes from oil-related contributions , will outspend Eckhardt by $600,000 to $150,000 . " I 've got a hell of a race on my hands , " admits Eckhardt . " In the past , I 've beaten a challenger who outspent me 3 to 1 , and now I 'll see if I can beat one who 'll outspend me 4 to 1 . " <P> Star Wars in Los Angeles <P> Only in the land of Tinsel Town could there be such a race . The Republican incumbent , Robert Dornan , 47 , is a former B-movie actor and Emmy-winning TV talk show host . His challenger is Democrat Carey Peck , 31 , son of Gregory Peck and a former Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that includes the Los Angeles suburbs of Santa Monica , Venice and Marina del Rey . Voters run the gamut from Ronald Reagan to Jane Fonda . Allows a Republican official : " The district is eccentric . "
