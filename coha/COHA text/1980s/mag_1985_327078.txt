Alfred Drake , Zachary Scott , Herbert Lom , Farley Granger and Ricardo Montalban have all played the role , but for 34 years Yul Brynner has been the first and only King of Siam  --  an Oriental patriarch who is also a gigolo in jade . He is onstage perhaps half as much as the actress who plays Anna , the Englishwoman who educates the King 's children ; and of the half-dozen songs that still elate the memory ( Hello , Young Lovers , Getting to Know You , I Whistle a Happy Tune , etc. , etc. , etc. ) , the King sings none . It matters not . By dint of dogged charisma , Brynner has identified himself with a role more than any other actor since Bela Lugosi hung up his fangs . Last week , when his " farewell " tour opened to packed , enthusiastic houses on Broadway , he was incarnating the King for the 4,434th time . <P> Since 1983 Brynner has been bravely and publicly fighting cancer . Knowledge of this battle gives added poignance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live another day . . . Every day I do my best for one more day . " But his strength as a performer , if not as a presence , seems sapped . The music in each line of dialogue has become a jingle , a sentiment not so much spoken as marketed ; then comes a pause for laughter or applause or just mute admiration . In the show 's wonderfully discreet mating ritual , Shall We Dance ? , his new Anna ( Mary Beth Peil ) looks nearly to be carrying Brynner around the stage . They are working gamely to erase ( or is it only to evoke ? ) the memory of some beloved ghosts : Gertrude Lawrence and Deborah Kerr as Anna , and the vital , young Yul Brynner . Long live that King .
