To be or not to be ? That was the question , whether American Actor-Director &lt; Sam Wanamaker ( Raw Deal ) was going to realize his 30-year-old dream of rebuilding Shakespeare 's Globe Theater . That hallowed arena on the south bank of the Thames probably held the first productions of King Lear and Macbeth before it burned to the ground in 1613 . Wanamaker first visited the site in 1949 , found only a brass plaque on a wall beside the debris-strewn riverbank and felt , " well , outrage . " Over the years he and his Shakespeare Globe Trust faced the slings and arrows of competition from other restoration drives and a local borough council more interested in low-income housing ( its deputy leader called the Bard " a lot of tosh " ) . After the council pulled out of a 1981 deal with a development company that would have guaranteed the site ( " political vandalism , " in Wanamaker 's view ) , the Trust sued . Late last month the sea of troubles finally ended in an out-of-court settlement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak theater . All 's well that ends well .
