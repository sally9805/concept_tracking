Already considered a prohibitive favorite for his party ' s Presidential nomination , Mr. Dukakis strengthened his claim with a better than 2-to-1 victory , the largest of the Democratic campaign . It was his second straight victory in a major industrial state , following his triumph in New York a week ago , and it set him up for what are expected to be further triumphs in Ohio and Indiana next Tuesday. // At a Boston news conference , Mr. Dukakis declined to claim the nomination , noting that Walter F. Mondale had won New York and Pennsylvania in 1984 " and then lost a whole string of primaries . " But he described his victory here as " very , very important to us , particularly in a state that has often been a bellwether. " // Mr. Jackson , who according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll failed to stimulate the high turnout among black votlers in this state that he generated in earlier contelsts , seemed subdued as he told a labor rally in Toledo , Ohio , that he was engaged not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Later , in a conversation with reporters in a Cincinnati hotel , Mr. Jackson said he would carry on . But he spoke less of winning the nomination than about spreading his message. // " In many ways we are winning every day , " Mr. Jackson said . " In many ways between now and June 7 , this race will be about the direction of the party . " June 7 is the last day of the primary season , with contests in California and New Jersey. // Gerald Austin , Mr. Jackson ' s campaign manager , said the Jackson effort in Pennsylvania had been badly organized and that the candidate spent too little time in the state . Speaking in an interview in Youngstown , Ohio , where the Chicago civil rights leader campaigned today , Mr. Austin added , " If we want to beat Dukakis , we will have to get substantially more white votes than we ' ve been getting. " // " To throw in the towel at this time , " Mr. Austin said , seeming to do something very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A discussion of the issues with Jesse Jackson will not hurt anybody . His campaign is not divisive . Dukakis may find Jesse Jackson good training for George Bush. " // In separate balloting to select delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta this July , the Massachusetts Governor was capturing at least two-thirds of Pennsylvania ' s 178 delegates , the fourth largest state block . Coming into this state he had gathered 1 , 080 delegates to Mr. Jackson ' s 842 , with 2 , 081 needed for nomination . Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee has 419 delegates and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois has 173 ; both of them have suspended their campaigns . A total of 627 are undecided or uncommitted. // With 90 percent of the precincts reporting , the Democratic primary vote was : // Dukakis . . . 910 , 662 ( 67% ) // Jackson . . . 387 , 900 ( 28% ) // Gore . . . 41 , 603 ( 3% ) // Simon . . . 9 , 839 ( 1% ) Although Mr. Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city ' s 22 delegates , he ran weakly in the rest of the state , according to the Times/CBS News poll of 1 , 688 voters leaving their polling places . Mr. Dukakis took more than two-thirds of the vote in the Philadelphia suburbs , in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , in the industrial belt in the northeast and in the largely rural remainder . <> <> Dearth of Black Voters // Nearly 1. 5 million Democrats voted in the primary , at least 10 percent less than in 1984. // The Chicago clergyman was hampered here by the relative dearth of black voters , who have formed the core of his support even when he has succeeded in winning strong white backing as well . Almost one Democratic primary voter in four was black in New York . Not quite one such voter in five was black in Pennsylvania. // In addition , the voting was as heavily polarized along racial lines as in any contest this year . The Times/CBS News survey indicated that Mr. Jackson won 95 percent of the black vote , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh , and that Mr. Dukakis won the votes of 85 percent of white Catholics . <> <> Full-Employment Democrat // Mr. Jackson failed in his efforts to capitalize on the economic malaise in the small cities in the Allegheny , Monongahela and Ohio River valleys near Pittsburgh . Voters across the state said unemployment was the most important issue to them , according to the poll , but that did not help Mr. Jackson . Indeed , Mr. Dukakis appeared to have neutralized the issue by identifying himself as closely with the issue of jobs as Mr. Jackson had. // " Make no mistake about it , " the Massachusetts Governor said again and again on the stump in an effort to put previous problems with blue-collar Democrats behind him . " I ' m a dyed-in-the-wool , true-blue , full-employment Democrat. " // Mr. Jackson ' s strategists had not thought , after losing New York , that their candidate had any real chance here . Nor do they consider him likely to do well in Ohio and Indiana , which resemble Pennsylvania demographically . But they are expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Tuesday , and are hoping to spring an upset in California . <> <> Warming to Dukakis // As for Mr. Dukakis , he got as big a victory as he had hoped for . He had feared complacency among his supporters , warning in his final campaign appearances on Monday that " pollsters don ' t vote . " But in beautiful spring weather , the Dukakis troops marched to the polls as he had urged. // The Times/CBS poll suggested that as Mr. Dukakis ' s nomination becomes ever more probable , Democrats are warming up to him . In the early going , few of his backers said they stood strongly behind him , but by last week in New York 43 percent said they did and today 53 percent said the same thing. // There was also evidence that many Democrats in Pennsylvania - the kind of state the party needs to carry to win in November - were unenthusiastic about Mr. Jackson and his stance on the issues . For example , 42 percent said their overall opinion of Mr. Jackson was unfavorable and 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among Dukakis voters , 47 percent faulted the Chicagoan on the grounds that his policies were too liberal. //
