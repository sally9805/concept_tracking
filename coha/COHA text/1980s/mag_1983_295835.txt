Classified love ads are a booming business <P> At a few dollars or so per line , they are the natural outlet of the discreet , the sincere and the sensitive , all seeking kindred spirits for meaningful relationships . Classified love ads , once relegated primarily to nonmainstream papers like New York City 's Village Voice and the sex magazines , are now blossoming almost everywhere . In the ad columns of at least 100 magazines and newspapers , even in dailies like the Chicago Tribune , armies of hopeful DWMs and SWFS seek mergers as POSSLQs ( translation : divorced white males and single white females wish to unite as persons of the opposite sex sharing living quarters ) . <P> Analysts and advertisers seem to agree that love ads are now an important part of the mating game . ' ' Your Aunt Susan is n't going to find anyone for you , " complains Philadelphia Businesswoman Cari Lyn Vinci , who has met 25 men by using ads . Adds Edwin Roberts , manager of classifieds for New York magazine : " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hear a lot of frustration .

Once the natural home of kinks and losers , the classified personals now attract people known to advertisers as " upscale . " Even the Village Voice , which handles about 50,000 replies to love personals each year , says its audience is " mid-30s , affluent , with many professionals . " <P> Some of the publications do have taboos . The Chicago Tribune , which runs love ads Mondays and Fridays , does a brisk business among the divorced , but takes no marrieds . Most large newspapers and city magazines turn down blatantly kinky ads , but a few slip by the censors in disguise . " I love wearing makeup " is a semisubtle hint at transvestism . At the Voice almost anything goes .
