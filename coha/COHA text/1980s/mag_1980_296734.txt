The guests had plowed through Hearts of MacArthichoke d'Inchon and toyed with their Filet de Sole au Yalu River . They had survived bowls of kimchi , the mouth-searing concoction of pickled cabbage , hot peppers and garlic that is Korea 's national dish . And now , with the speeches over , here they are , clustered around a piano in the Marriott Key Bridge Hotel , singing . Except for the gray in the hair , and a sagging of chests toward the belt line , the scene suggests ( as it is meant to ) a press billet in the city of Taegu , say , three decades ago when the United Nations forces were trying to hold the Pusan perimeter . <P> The melodies are old favorites like The Battle Hymn of the Republic , with not-so-old words . <P> Mine eyes have seen the censor <P> With my copy on his knee <P> He was crossing out the passages <P> That mean the most to me .. <P> About 70 war correspondents , out of perhaps 400 who covered the Korean War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come June 25 it will be 30 years since the forces of North Korea 's Kim II Sung rolled south over the 38th parallel and started the first hot war of the cold war period . Everybody present ( wives excepted ) is over 50 . Most are over 60 and several over 70 ; most celebrated among them , Novelist James Michener . <P> The name tags they wear identify them by the publications they used to work for . And in some ways this is a sadder reminder than age of the wear and tear in the newspaper business since Korea . Gone the New York Herald Tribune ( d. 1966 ) and the Chicago Daily News ( d. 1978 ) . Gone is Hearst 's old International News Service , merged in 1958 with the United Press to form U.P.I. ( United Press International ) . <P> In Korea the rival agencies used to fight for headlines with newsbeats about hills taken or Chinese hordes repelled . ( " How many Chinese in a horde ? " the gag used to be . ) With Wirephotos from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; television cameramen had to ship their film halfway round the world to San Francisco , a 36-hour flight in those prop-driven days . <P> The Korean War 's three biggest reporting stars could not appear . In 1951 they shared the Pulitzer Prize . One , Keyes Beech , of the Chicago Daily News , was in Bangkok . At 66 , he is charging around Asia again , now for the Los Angeles Times . Homer Bigart , 72 , of the defunct Herald-Trib , sent a message of regret . He was , he explained , temporarily toothless : " I am capable of putting down the martini , but I ca n't handle the olives . " The third , Marguerite Higgins , who worked with Bigart on the Trib , died in 1966 at age 45 , of a tropical bug caught in Viet Nam . These days , when reporters with pretty faces are all over the TV news , Maggie Higgins might not be the sensation she was in 1950 . ( In the new journalism neither might Bigart ; he stutters . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though unkind ( or envious ) colleagues accused her of using feminine wiles to get stories she might not have otherwise got . To silence this still famous argument at the reunion , one correspondent snaps : " Damn it , Maggie did it on ability . She was just a woman before her time . "
