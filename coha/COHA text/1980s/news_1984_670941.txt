In many cases , Jackson partisans are angry at those blacks who worked for the Presidential nomination of the former Vice President rather than the civil rights leader . Some black Mondale supporters holding elective office are finding themselves politically threatened by Jackson followers ; State Senator Julian Bond of Georgia beat back such a challenge in a primary earlier this month. // In other cases , Jackson supporters are locked in opposition to party leadership more than ever on issues of local concern. // The infighting is an additional burden for the Mondale campaign as the Democratic candidate works to mend fences with Mr. Jackson in a region where the black vote could be the difference between winning and losing in November . Mr. Jackson and other black political leaders meet Tuesday with Mr. Mondale over the extent to which they will campaign for the ticket. // // // Offices and Influence at Stake // // The problems are especially notable in Mississippi , South Carolina and Alabama . At stake are party positions , political offices and influence. // Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekend , took note of the division among black Southerners . It was not only the lingering strains growing out of the Jackson campaign that accounted for the division , he said , but also old rivalries between those who emphasize civil rights approaches to problems and those who pursue conventional political avenues. // Although Mr. Young said he thought that many of the problems would pass and that blacks would unite against the Reagan Administration in support of the Democratic ticket , he said the divisions did not augur well for an election that he thought the party could win with a 60 percent turnout of black voters in the South. // Many people , like Mr. Young and City Councilman John Lewis of Atlanta , feel that the hard edges of anger will soften after the meeting Tuesday , when Mr. Jackson assumes a clear role in the campaign , and as the election approaches. // But others are not as sure . They talk of the higher political expectations of blacks not only in the South but elsewhere , a development that led many established black political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some leaders , such as Jack Gravely , executive secretary of the Virginia branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , point out that Mr. Jackson , through his unwillingness in the primary season to compromise and his relentless attack on some party practices , has so changed the standards against which black political leadership is measured that things may never be the same . <> <> Challenge in Mississippi // // One sign of disunity is in Mississippi , where Johnnie E. Walls Jr. is threatening to run as an independent for the United States Senate . Mr. Walls , who is 39 years old , has the support of a number of blacks in the state , which is nearly 40 percent black. // " It ' s a continuation and an extension of the Jackson campaign , " Mr. Walls said in his law offices in Greenville , Miss. , just northwest of here . " Having come away from the convention with nothing that quenches their thirst , blacks know something has to happen. " // The race is now between former Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thad Cochran , a Republican . Most observers say Mr. Winter is fighting an uphill battle against his well-financed opponent and would be seriously hurt if a black candidate drew away votes. // The situation has caused anguish even among Jackson supporters , such as Leslie McLemore , who was elected Hinds County Democratic leader this spring on the strength of Mr. Jackson ' s strong showing in the state ' s caucuses. <> <> 17 Demands Were Made // Mr. McLemore has criticized the tactics adopted by Mr. Walls in trying to make the state Democratic leadership more responsive to blacks . For instance , Mr. Walls said he would scrap his plan to run if the state party acceded to 17 demands. // Mr. McLemore had no objection to the demands themselves , which he said would find favor with nearly all black Democrats in Mississippi . But he said that Mr. Walls , by trying to force the hand of the state party , had " a lot of people agonizing over how to be good Democrats while not betraying the aspirations of blacks. " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " he said . " I believe we should not sacrifice a national political victory for our local issues . " <> <> Concern Over Ramifications // // In many ways , it is a disagreement on tactics that is without rancor , but staunch Mondale supporters among blacks , such as State Senator Douglas Anderson of Mississippi , are concerned that it will hurt both the Mondale ticket and the role of blacks in state politics . For one thing , he says , Mr. Walls and others are sending a signal to white candidates that they can not expect black votes . Mr. Anderson says this will make it easier for white politicians to keep being sluggish in delivering votes for black candidates. // Such a result would have particular consequences for the Congressional candidacy of Robert Clark , who enjoys almost universal support among blacks . No black has been sent to Congress from Mississippi since 1888 , and his bid represents both the symbol and substance of political progress for blacks in the state. // " If blacks don ' t feel obligated to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black Congressional candidate ? " Mr. Anderson asked . " We are the only ones who lose in this because whites will still have a white President , a white Senator , and we won ' t have a black Congressman. " // Mr. Anderson said much of the support for Mr. Walls and for his demands came from former Jackson supporters who are trying to " recoup the losses " from the national convention and " who are not about the business of compromise . " <> <> Dispute in South Carolina // // In South Carolina , James Clyburn , the State Human Rights Commissioner , who is head of a network of people who support black candidates in the state , muses over what he will do about a call from a black State Senate candidate in Charleston. // It seems that the candidate , State Representative McKinley Washington , who was a Mondale delegate to the national convention , was finding indifference among many black Jackson supporters in his race against a white incumbent to represent a newly apportioned district that is 54 percent black. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially the Jackson supporters because they are talking about not supporting him and just sitting it out , " said Mr. Clyburn , who is black . Mr. Clyburn served as an uncommitted delegate to the national convention and is thought to have credibility with the Jackson forces. // Complicating the South Carolina situation is anger among many blacks over a plan to redistrict the State Senate . The state ' s N.A.A.C.P. , which plans to sue over the plan , says not enough districts were created in which a black could win . <> <> Jackson Joined Rally // // More importantly , the N.A.A.C.P. attracted one of the state ' s newer residents , Mr. Jackson , to a rally early this month on the steps of the State Capitol in support of its position . A result was that 15 of the 18 black legislators switched positions and voted against the remapping. // South Carolina exhibits both the new aspirations of the Jackson supporters and the old disputes over tactics. // " You have to know when to hold and when to fold , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of attempts two years ago to create a predominantly black Congressional district in the state : " We and the N.A.A.C.P. held fast then and lost. " // But John Harper , a lawyer and political activist who was a Jackson alternate to the convention , suggests that such arguments , at least now , have little impact on the heightened expectations of blacks. // " Many of us just see more clearly that there are blacks afflicted with the ' thirsty man on the desert ' syndrome , " he said . " They are willing to accept a mud puddle. " // And from the standpoint of the N.A.A.C.P. , said Dr. William Gibson , president of the state chapter : " We will go forward regardless of what others see as politically expedient . " <> <> Optimism in Alabama // // In Alabama , some people who watch politics point to the defeat of black candidates for Mayor and City Council president in Selma last month as a sign of trouble . The city , a landmark of the civil rights era , is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jackson drew the most votes and the most support from black elected officials in the primary. // But J. L. Chestnut , vice chairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference , was cheered about the prospects for the Democratic ticket and the role blacks would play in his state . He said he had initially been troubled by the possibility of strains after the Jackson campaign , but they were " dissipated by the threat of a Reagan re-election. " // Mayor Young said , moreover , that Alabama appeared to him to be an island of black political unity in the region ' s sea of difficulties . Mr. Mondale narrowly won the state ' s Democratic Presidential primary as he successfully challenged Mr. Jackson for the black vote with the endorsement of the statewide Alabama Democratic Conference . There was no such statewide black leadership in Georgia or in many other states , Mr. Young said. // " The Alabama Democratic Conference has been able to negotiate some things out for blacks here , and the group ' s leadership has merged the old civil rights movement with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Mondale backer . <> <> Looking for Practical Gains // // Mr. Chestnut , a lawyer , sees the Alabama Democratic Conference as now free to motivate and organize blacks to defeat Mr. Reagan as well as help beat back strong Republican challenges to candidates like Senator Howell Heflin. // Such efforts , they believe , will be a strong show of their determination to reward their political friends , to punish political enemies , regardless of race , and to reap practical benefits . Senator Heflin , for example , is credited with strong backing of efforts in the Carter Administration that led to the appointment of two black Federal judges in the state. // " Perhaps we have synthesis of the civil rights approach and the political approach here in Alabama , " said Mr. Chestnut , commenting on the tension between the two elsewhere . " We have learned that it takes all of these approaches , and I guess we keep a foot in both camps .
