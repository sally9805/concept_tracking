Information was being passed <P> No one in the White House is twisting in the wind . " <P> With that self-inflicted reminder of the Watergate era-echoing advice by John Ehrlichman to John Dean that L. Patrick Gray should be left to " twist slowly , slowly in the wind " rather than be quickly confirmed by the Senate as FBI director-President Reagan last week tried to reassure anxious former campaign aides . He was suggesting that none will be fired from his present position because of the tempest over how his staff secured Jimmy Carter 's debate briefing book in 1980 . <P> According to Reagan 's friend Senator Paul Laxalt , the President had specifically said in a private meeting that James Baker , his chief of staff , was " secure " in his job . Baker has admitted seeing the briefing papers . Other White House sources said that the President also retains his confidence in Budget Director David Stockman , who used the Carter book to rehearse Reagan for the debate . Just where that leaves CIA Director William Casey , Reagan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers to Baker , as Baker claims he did , was not as clear . Washington press pundits continued to speculate last week that either Baker or Casey , who represent rival political factions among Reagan 's top advisers , will have to be sacrificed after FBI and congressional investigators complete their separate probes of the briefing-book caper . One top aide , perhaps self-protectively , predicted , however , that " everyone will keep his head . " <P> Despite news reports that Reagan 's staff was " paralyzed " by preoccupation with the Carter papers fuss , Baker in particular was carrying out a busy schedule of normal White House business last week . Indeed , the staff was settling back into a state of near normality . In the Reagan Administration , however , it is normal for the Baker-Stockman wing of advisers and those led by Casey , Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese and National Security Adviser William Clark to eye each other with considerable suspicion . <P> Actually , the heat may now shift from Baker to Casey . TIME has learned that , as rumored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Reagan campaign . But it was not simply a casual use of retired military officers asked to stay alert for any U.S. aircraft moves that might signal the Reagan camp that Carter was about to gain the freedom of the U.S. embassy hostages in Iran-the " October surprise " that Reagan 's political aides feared . Instead , cooperative former agents of both the FBI and the CIA were used to gather political information from their colleagues then still active in the two agencies . However it may have happened , Carter , in his first substantive comment on the affair , said last week that the Reagan camp got hold of " the most sensitive political documents we had , " revealing " the essence of our campaign .
