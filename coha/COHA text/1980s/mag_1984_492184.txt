more women than men are going to vote in the November election . That 's why women 's organizations , polarized by their " pro " and " anti " Reagan stands , are campaigning as vigorously as the presidential candidates themselves . The women 's vote may well decide who will be inaugurated as President on January 20 . You can bet your favorite campaign button that a spirited war will be fought among women about which candidate , Mondale or Reagan , should get their vote in 1984 . Women account for 53 percent of the voting-age population . In 1980 , 49.3 million women voted , considerably more than the 43.8 million men . The gap is expected to widen in 1984 . Since 1976 , the percentage of women registering to vote has been going up , while the percentage of men doing so decreased . Women are pouring into universities and professional schools . Some 53 percent of college students are women , and the number of women seeking medical degrees has tripled in recent years . Women constitute nearly half the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for the numbers . What about the people ? Women are playing an increasingly larger role in life outside the home  --  at work and in government and public affairs . Once , most women worked out of necessity . Today , the majority of women say they prefer to work , even it ' money is n't an issue . The roles of American women have shifted dramatically . Today , they are better educated , more active and account for a fast-growing share of business and professional positions . Despite the demonstrable change and improvement in the lives of women , there is still plenty of hollering out there . Radical feminists cry doomsday and have zoomed in on an opportune target  --  the nation 's leading political figure , President Reagan . The militants love to cite the " gender gap " as proof positive that Reagan must go  --  the " gender gap " being the marked difference between women and men in how they rate Reagan in approval surveys . Reagan was savaged at the Democratic convention as the greatest living enemy of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokespersons for radical feminist groups during the past few years . Kathy Wilson , chairperson for the National Women 's Political Caucus , repeatedly denounced Ronald Reagan as " the worst President in history for women . " Wilson , who calls herself a Republican though her home state , Virginia , requires no registration by party , drew big attention to herself when she shouted in front of the national media : " Mr. President , one term is enough ! " and urged him to step down . To appreciate the full wrath of Ms. Wilson , one must listen to her words or listen to her . " Ronald Reagan is the only American President to be elected on the basis of an ideology that has been frozen in his head for a quarter of a century , " she declared at her national convention . Though acknowledging Reagan 's " unremitting congeniality , " Wilson concluded that his " . . . superficial performing skills can not conceal the hard fact that for American women Ronald Reagan is a dangerous man . " Under Ms. Wilson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization for Women , a group that would dearly love'to barbecue Reagan on a spit . NOW 's leadership has denounced Reagan so many times and with such scathing language that superlatives seem flat . During their last convention in July , the NOW delegates routinely condemned Reagan as the " single greatest threat to women 's rights . " NOW was among the first to endorse Walter Mondale and gave him its approval in late 1983 , before the exhausting primary-caucus season began . In February 1984 , Betty Heitman , cochairman of the Republican National Committee , decided she had had enough . She went to work and formed the National Women 's Coalition , dedicated to the re-election of Ronald Reagan . " I just did it , " Heitman says . " I did n't need any approval . I have been active with women 's groups for 20 years and knew there were many achieving women across the country who were concerned with women 's issues , yes , but more concerned that there be a strong economy so that women would have expanding opportunities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak out . We want to remind people that the majority of women in this country do support President Reagan and are aware of what he has done for women . " I was looking for successful leaders , not just political leaders . We had no trouble recruiting Republicans and Democrats , blacks , Hispanics and all minorities  --  but all women who had achieved . " This organization is partisan to the idea of re-electing the President . But there is no narrow agenda to measure up to . Our women are not required to have a given view on ERA , abortion or federal programs . // Our women have different views on those issues , and they are certainly tolerated . That is n't the case with NWPC or NOW . " We took a show of hands at our first leadership meeting of 24 women on ERA . Twelve were for , and 12 against . " Among the first to sign on were Paula Hughes , vice president of a New York brokerage firm ; Pam Shriver , the tennis pro ; Barbara Rawls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration , Carnegie-Mellon University ; Mary Singletary , a Planned Parenthood official and immediate past president of the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women 's Clubs ; Linda J. Wachner , the president of Max Factor and Company ; Moya Lear , the chairman of Lear Avia Corporation ; Susan G. Fisher , a senior vice president of Marine Midland Bank ; Rose Elder , who heads her own consultant firm and is the wife of Lee Elder , the famous black professional golfer ; and Ninfa Laurenzo , a Hispanic who rose after being widowed , went on to build Rio Grande Food Products in Houston and a string of II restaurants in Texas . These 100 accomplished women do n't all agree with Reagan on so-caned " women 's issues , " but , says Betty Heitman , " They want to speak out to ensure that all Americans , especially women , understand the opportunities and maximize the benefits created by the Reagan administration . " " I completely disagree with President Reagan on abortion , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERA are fundamental issues , but there is no more important issue than the economy . " Connie Austin owns a battery company in Orlando , Florida . She says : " The notion that all women care about is ERA and abortion is grossly unfair to women . We 're in the work force , too . I 'm a businesswoman and a single parent . It 's easier to do business now than it was four years ago . I do n't want to go back . " Karen Margulies , a housewife working for the National Women 's Coalition in Hollywood , Florida , remarked : " I want to dispel the myth that all Jewish women in Broward County are liberal Democrats . I 'm an American , Jewish , very active in national Jewish organizations , and I 'm a Republican who is very upbeat about my President . " Many women who joined Betty Heitman 's coalition worked their way up from poverty . Cochairman Paula Hughes is a case in point . She won the Horatio Alger award in 1984 and is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no gender gap , " she says . " It 's a communications gap , a misperception fostered by the Democrats and liberal Democrat-led organizations such as NOW . I want to remind women that if they want a job , a car , a salary increase , food on the table or education for their children , their best friends in politics really are President Reagan and the Republicans . " The conventional wisdom is that there is not a black person left in the Republic who is for Reagan , but Heitman has a number as coalition leaders . She also has such nominal Democrats as Ellen Sills Levy , an executive vice president and partner of Englehard and Associates ; Gloria Portela , a Cuban-American who became a successful lawyer in Houston , Texas ; and Mabel H. " Muffy " Brandon , president of the Washington , D.C. , office of Rogers and Cowan , the nation 's fourth-largest privately owned public-relations firm . " We got these outstanding women because they know the President has a good story to tell , and they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in American history , three women are in the cabinet ( Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole , Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler and U.N . Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick ) . That 's a Republican woman sitting on the Supreme Court , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , not a Democrat . " Despite all the cries from the opposition , the facts are that the tax credit for child care was nearly doubled in 1981 , and estate taxes were virtually eliminated so that widows do n't have to sell the family farm or business , " says Heitman . Mrs. Heitman also cites these Reagan initiatives as helping women : reducing the " marriage penalty " tax ; job-training programs for single heads of households ; and new Small Business Administration job-training seminars geared to women 's needs . " Our leadership women are not afraid to go into the lion 's den against Bella Abzug , Gloria Steinem and Kathy Wilson , " says Heitman . " When they try to distort the President 's record , our speakers will speak up and audiences will like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is soft-spoken but direct . Her voice is accented by her Arkansas birthplace and her married life at Baton Rouge , Louisiana . Her early career was as a dietician , but she soon found herself busy rearing four children . Her husband , Dr. Henry Heitman , is a pediatrician . By the late ' 60s , when her children were growing up , she had begun a political career that carried her to the top of the Republican party . She is a loyalist of the old school and believes people should show their true colors . Much is made in the press about Kathy Wilson 's being a Republican feminist who has launched a crusade against Ronald Reagan because of his alleged bias against women . Heitman says this about Wilson : " I question her Republicanism . Kathy Wilson says she voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980 , though she had the option of voting for John Anderson if she did n't like Reagan . Kathy Wilson calls herself a Republican , but she acts , talks and votes like a Democrat . " Indeed , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraldine Ferraro . As her organization opened its annual convention in September , it appeared likely that for the first time , it would endorse a presidential ticketMondale-Ferraro . " We are telling our Republican women who have reservations that it 's time to put sex ahead of party , " says Wilson . " I voted against Reagan in 1980 because I knew then what all women know now  --  that he is the most antiwoman politician in American history . " We would n't have endorsed Reagan under any circumstances , even if ' he chose a woman to run with him . His credibility gap is too big . We have no problem if some of our members who are elected Republicans are for him  --  people like congresswomen Claudine Schneider , Lynn Martin and Olympia Snowe . These women are excellent on our issues , and that 's what counts . " We are bipartisan , you know , 35 percent of our members being Republican . We are very aware that half the women running for the U.S. Senate this year are Republicans . As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. " For years , we went along with Margaret Heckler when she was in Congress because of her strong stand for ERA . But when she ran against Barney Frank , we went with him because he was prochoice and Margaret was n't " Abortion is a relentless issue and is nonnegotiable . You know that NOW passed a resolution designed to prevent Congresswoman Rose Mary Okar from bringing prolife speakers to their meetings . She has been a strong feminist , especially on economic issues like pay-equity . " We would n't drum anybody out of the caucus just for holding an anti-choice view . But if a member were active and visible in a prolife organization , we would have to take some action . " We get involved some with issues other than women 's rights  --  like the environment  --  but we ca n't fragment ourselves . For instance , some of our people believe in a nuclear freeze , but we voted down the idea of making this a major feminist issue . " Our issues really are ERA , reproductive rights and federal funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half of Congress on these , and have done very well on child care , economic equity , pensions , abortion and insurance-equity issues . " NWPC boasts 77,000 members , 300 local chapters and a $2 million annual budget . It spent $50,000 at the Democratic convention to boost Ferraro and $10,000 at the Republican gathering in Dallas to promote an alternative platform proposal . Since Wilson has occupied the " chair " at NWPC , it has become much more visible in the media and increasingly militant . Though Bella Abzug was among the founders , NWPC has attracted many prominent Republicans , such as Jill Ruckelshaus , whose husband has been named to high positions in the Nixon and the Reagan administrations ; Mary Louise Smith , former chairman of the Republican National Committee ; seasoned party workers like Pat Hutar , Patricia Bailey and Mary Dent Crisp ; and a half-dozen congresswomen . There are also personalities : actor Edward Asner ; actresses Ellen Burstyn and Mario Thomas ; Francis T. " Sissy " Farenthold , first woman to be placed in nomination for vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black ; TV producer Norman Lear ; Gloria Steinem , the feminist ; and William Winpisinger , the president of the International Union of Machinists . Wilson , 32 , was elected unanimously to the chair in 1981 and 1983 . She is a tireless soul  --  she traveled 42 states on behalf of women candidates in 1982 and spent much time lobbying Reagan 's key advisors . She has a B.A. in special education and an M.A. in counseling psychology  --  both from the University of Missouri . The Ladies ' Home Journal named her one of America 's " 100 Most Important Women . " " I am a Republican , " she says . " My father is a conservative Republican . I adore him , but we have argued for years . When I am on a national TV show , he calls afterwards and says , ' Sug her nickname , what are you doing , talking like that ? ' My father is a Reagan man , is outspoken and funny . He just ca n't understand what 1 am doing with the caucus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in discussion and debate this fall  --  no doubt about it . Mrs. Heitman will lament that the Democratic strategy is to divide people into groups  --  blacks , Hispanics and women  --  because " they love to hyphenate Americans . " Heitman is confident that once she and her legion of women 's leaders crisscross the country with the message , Ronald Reagan will get the majority of women 's votes this fall , as he did in 1980 against Jimmy Carter . Kathy Wilson is completely sold on the idea that women must forget party and vote for Mondale-Ferraro  --  to vanquish the " antiwoman " President , Ronald Reagan , and to elect the first woman vice president . It is clear these two views perceive vastly different agendas . Heitman 's women agree that feminist issues are important , but less so than how the country will be run in the next four years . Wilson 's followers believe that the feminist agenda is paramount and that only the Mondale-Ferraro team will address it . Both see a tough , tight race . Wilson , aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women will vote in droves against Reagan is naive . We 've got a lot of work to do . "
