The root of the problem may be a failure to communicate . Washington 's message of rising frustration , and even anger , over Japan 's trade practices is being received in Tokyo with chagrin and incredulity . The reason for the perplexed reaction is that the flurry of Japan bashing in the U.S. comes at a time when the Japanese feel they have made historic changes for the better in their restrictive and protectionist policies . Japanese politicians and business leaders insist that the old ways have been replaced by an expanding spirit of openness and global neighborliness . Kokusai-ka , the Japanese term for internationalization , has become a watchword at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry , which led Japan 's industrialization and trade drives and once was instrumental in blocking foreign goods from Japan . <P> While most Americans believe Japan 's trading manners are still dangerously one-sided , the Japanese offer some impressive evidence that they are trying to play fair . Japan has the lowest average tariffs of any developed country , will rank as the world 's largest foreign-aid donor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. firms that have captured a profitable share of its market . In some businesses  --  fast food , soft drinks , razors , cancer insurance and disposable diapers  --  American companies control the largest shares in the Japanese marketplace . IBM , the biggest U.S. business in Japan , posted sales of $9.3 billion there last year , up 12% over fiscal 1987 . Says Takeshi Isayama , director of the Americas division of MITI : " The U.S. Government tends to listen to those who fail in Japan rather than all those who succeed . " <P> Japan has moved a long way from its closed-door past . For much of the postwar era , Japanese politicians built on their resource-poor nation 's sense of vulnerability as a rationalization for outright protectionism and discrimination against foreign goods . When the economy was still a fragile blossom sprouting in a war-devastated landscape , that was tolerated by Western countries . At the same time , Japan developed a socioeconomic system that guaranteed full employment  --  there was neither the money nor the will to finance a public dole  --  by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Western free-market ideas . The Japanese way of doing things included subsidies for employers , a complicated system for distributing goods , and government-enforced product standards that foreigners found impossible to meet . <P> By the mid-1980s , however , that one-way trading mentality had fostered such huge financial imbalances with the U.S. and other countries that Washington pressured Tokyo into adopting a blueprint for economic change . The plan , under which Japan pledged to stimulate domestic spending so that exports would no longer lead the economy , has achieved dramatic results . During 1988 , imports rose 33.4% over the previous year , to $187.4 billion . Japan increased imports of auto parts , electronic products , medical equipment and pharmaceuticals . Purchases of foreign-built cars last year rose 37.1% over 1987 , to $3.1 billion . Toyota 's domestic sales went up 13% , while its exports grew a mere 2.5%.
