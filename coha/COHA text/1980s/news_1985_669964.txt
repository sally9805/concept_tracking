Marx and Lenin are firmly enshrined as the gods of Soviet communism , but to truly understand the Soviet Communist Party and how it works , you have to look to a lesser-known progenitor . He was born in 1877 to a Polish-Lithuanian land-owning family and died in 1926 . His name was Felix Dzerzhinsky . Here was a revolutionary . While Lenin was in Western Europe writing manifestoes , Dzerzhinsky was in Russia tangling with the Okhrana , the dreaded czarist secret police . Even in prison , where he spent 14 years , he outsmarted the Okhrana by organizing his underworld companions into groups that could threaten dangerous uprisings . When Lenin in 1918 asked him to organize the intelligence and security arm of the Bolshevik Party , he melded both former prisoners and former Okhrana men into his secret-police cadre . These hard-nosed " Chekists " propelled Lenin to power , preserved the party after Lenin ' s death in 1924 and laid the groundwork for the later Stalinist terror . The remarkable Dzerzhinsky was , in short , the founder of what we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The KGB is as vital to the party today as was Dzerzhinsky ' s " Cheka " to the Bolsheviks . In " The New KGB : Engine of Soviet Power " ( Morrow , 560 pages , $19. 95 ) two former U.S. intelligence officers , William R. Corson and Robert T. Crowley , detail the evolution of this incredible organization from Dzerzhinsky to the present . Their startling and provocative conclusion : The Soviet Communist Party , which controls the world-wide Soviet empire , is itself controlled by the KGB . That must be , at the very least , an oversimplification . To be sure , Yuri Andropov made the KGB his vehicle for attaining supreme power . And the present KGB chief , Viktor Chebrikov , became a full Politburo member in April , meaning that even with Andropov in his grave , the Politburo has two KGB men , Mr. Chebrikov and a former regional chieftain , Gaidar Aliyev , in its 13-man membership . But the new party leader , Mikhail Gorbachev , had not yet taken over when this book went to press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latest Kremlin shake-up , which ousted Grigory Romanov , made Andrei Gromyko president and elevated Eduard Shevardnadze to foreign minister , displayed no heavy KGB footprints . But though it may be extreme to say that the KGB controls the party , it is in no way extreme to say that the party ' s grip on power depends upon the KGB . As the authors observe , the agency guards the borders and the missile forces , squelches dissidence ( with particular attention to the armed forces ) and mans the prison camps . It is the country ' s most effective instrument of foreign policy , commanding the secret services of satellite nations , controlling political front groups , spreading propaganda , infiltrating international agencies , stealing technological secrets for use in Soviet weapons programs , and  --  a subject of some interest to Americans today  --  operating ( usually through third parties ) terrorist training camps . The Soviet economy may be sagging and internal morale may be low . But the KGB is alive and well , using its elite forces to raise hell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a history of brute power , chock-full of horror stories in which the Soviet secret police played a role , such as the massacre of an estimated 15 , 000 Poles in and around the Katyn forest in 1939 . The book ' s appendices describe among other things the activities of the Soviet trading company , Amtorg Corp. , which has been operating in the U.S. for more than 60 years , both buying and spying , the authors say . Unfortunately , the writing in this book is heavy going . The authors skip quickly from subject to subject and era to era . But they have done prodigious research and easily make their case that the KGB is far more than just another spy agency , a mere Soviet counterpart to the CIA . It is the primary tool of government and foreign policy for an entrenched political party . Its underworld ancestry is still evident in its capacity for deception and the delivery of sudden death . Each new attempt to describe the KGB , however , raises yet more questions . How does it maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland , Bulgaria or Cuba ? How much direction does it give to terrorists ? Hardly anyone has failed to notice that Aeroflot planes seem strangely immune to hijacking . There have been KGB defectors , but they have supplied only limited knowledge of a vast enterprise . Secrecy and deception are as natural to Soviet life as unbidden soul-baring has become to the American experience . Russians have a common gesture , putting one ' s forefinger to the side of one ' s nose , to show that someone is eavesdropping on a conversation . Tough little Felix Dzerzhinsky is a bona fide hero of Russia ' s Communist Party elite . Dzerzhinsky Square in Moscow is named for him . The party ' s members know what they owe him . But in pinning their hopes on the " sword and shield " he created , they have themselves become prisoners to its impulses for repression and destruction . Russia ' s economic stagnation and moral decay reflect a truism : Great nations are not built by thugs and spies . That , however , can be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves joining the Soviet-dominated peoples in having to cope with the legacy of Felix Dzerzhinsky.  --  - Mr. Melloan is deputy editor of the Journal ' s editorial page.
