In an executive order issued in Trenton , Mr. Kean directed that $6. 7 million in uncollected fines be wiped off the books of water companies and that $2. 2 million more in surcharges already paid by penalized customers be applied as credits against future bills. // Mr. Kean acted after Monday ' s rainfall , following winter ' s abundant rain and snow , pushed the northern half of the state ' s 12 reservoirs to the brims of the dams or to overflowing. // New York City ' s 18 upstate reservoirs are also full . Water-use restrictions in the city were lifted in January. // // Jersey Now Has Master Plan // To correct future supply shortages and leaky pipelines in urban areas , New Jersey has a new water supply authority , a new statewide water master plan and $350 million in voter-approved bond money . But major work probably will not start for some months , if not years. // The only major project under way is a 17-mile pipeline that the Hackensack Water Company began building in February to provide water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wanaque Reservoir west of Hackensack ' s watershed. // Officials of the two replenished systems said both had fully recovered from the situation of early 1981 , when the reservoirs of both North Jersey and New York were about a quarter filled. // However , few , if any , supply changes have been made to prevent a recurrence of the shortages . Officials caution that water still should be conserved despite the now-bountiful supplies . <> <> Byrne ' s Reasoning Rejected // Mr. Kean ' s precedessor , Gov . Brendan T. Byrne , who imposed rationing in September 1980 , had said he was confident that the surcharges for illegal overuse would be collected . He had argued that any forgiving of the fines would weaken the state ' s credibility and undermine its authority to enforce mandatory rationing in any future shortages. // The collection policy and the entire surcharge program , however , eventually came to be considered administrative nightmares . Some water companies bridled at the notion of serving as the state ' s policemen and collecting fines for it . Those that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them to court when they refused to pay. // Carl Golden , Mr. Kean ' s press secretary , said the Governor issued the amnesty because some companies had enforced the rationing edict strictly while others had not. // " Enforcement was incredibly spotty , " Mr. Golden said . " In fairness , it was felt it was best to forgive everyone . " At one point during rationing , about $22 million in surcharges were on the books of major North Jersey water companies . Of that , $15. 9 million had been assessed by the Hackensack Water Company , New Jersey ' s biggest water supplier and the one most prone to shortages. // Of the total , however , nearly $13 million was forgiven by the water companies because of billing errors , leniency toward businesses that would be harmed financially by deep cuts in water use , and concerns about the health of some residential users. // The bulk of the surcharges still owed are $2. 9 million to the Passaic Valley Water Commission , $2 million to the Newark Water Department and $1. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $2. 1 million already paid - $1. 8 million. // All fines collected had been placed in a special account for the state . It is now expected that the money will be withdrawn and used as credits , as Mr. Kean ordered . <> <> One Company ' s Problems // The Hackensack Water Company , which is privately owned and profitable , has been prone to shortages for years . It regularly brings in water from other supply systems . At the height of the recent shortage , it was allowed to take water from lakes belonging to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in New York State. // In addition , a 2. 1-mile pipeline was built across the George Washington Bridge a year ago to permit Hackensack Water to bring in 20 million gallons a day from New York City ' s pipeline system . That pipeline , which cost New Jersey $3. 5 million , was never used . Under Mr. Kean ' s directive yesterday , it will be dismantled and stored. // Officials said it could be rebuilt in a week if another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate supply problems were prompted by the shortage . But New York City has no plans to expand its sprawling reservoir system . <> <> Relies on Conservation // John Cunningham , a spokesman for the city ' s Department of Environmental Protection , said that shortages usually developed in 15-year cycles and that New Yorkers had always overcome them with their responses to conservation appeals. // Water use in the city has been averaging about 1. 35 billion gallons daily recently , about 200 million gallons less than before the shortage. // As Mr. Kean took his action yesterday , the Delaware Commission also ended the drought emergency it had declared in the 13 , 000-square-mile basin on Jan. 15 , 1981 . That edict had covered portions of New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania and Delaware within the river ' s basin. // Both actions were little more than legal technicalities . The stiffest restrictions on water use in homes and businesses in New York and northern New Jersey were canceled months ago. // Until Mr. Kean acted , only three restrictions remained from a long list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrne had imposed on 372 communities in 17 of New Jersey ' s 21 counties . The regulations that had remained until yesterday had outlawed serving water to restaurant patrons unless requested , prohibited washing of sidewalks , driveways , roads , or other paved areas , and limited use of automatic lawn sprinklers to between 7 P.M. and 9 P.M. // Water rationing in New Jersey , which once covered 192 of the 372 towns , was phased out in stages between April 16 , 1981 , and May 18 , 1981 . Under rationing , families were allowed 50 gallons a day per person , and businesses were told to cut usage by 25 percent. // In New York , Mayor Koch ' s drought emergency plan , implemented on Jan. 19 , 1981 , and toughened on April 1 , 1981 , was eased somewhat last June to permit lawn watering and pool filling . The plan and its myriad restrictions were lifted completely on Jan. 18 , 1982. //                   @ @
