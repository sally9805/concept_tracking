Sharon Kowalski has always been a maverick . While her brother and sister stayed close to home  --  the Iron Range of northern Minnesota  --  Sharon struck out on her own . She worked her way through college , found a teaching job , bought a house with a friend and developed her passions for photography , cross-country skiing and motorcycling . " I used to tell her I got a new gray hair every time she took off for somewhere , " recalls her mother Della . " Kids do lots of things you do n't like , but you still love them . " In short , a willful young woman . <P> Now that very will is the object of a legal and ethical battle in the Minnesota courts . Five years ago , a drunk driver crashed into Sharon 's car , killing her niece and leaving Sharon brain damaged and in a coma . She regained consciousness some weeks later , but could not speak and could move only her right hand . With the help of her roommate , Karen Thompson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , Sharon , then &; 27 , struggled to learn to sip from a glass , comb her hair , communicate with a typewriter . " We learned to play again , to laugh again , " Thompson recalls . <P> Sharon 's parents were initially encouraged by their daughter 's progress . But when Karen announced that she and Sharon had been lovers before the accident , the Kowalskis forbade her to visit anymore and eventually moved their daughter to a nursing home 180 miles away . In 1985 , after a yearlong legal battle over custody and visitation rights , the court awarded Sharon 's father full guardianship . The Kowalskis ' lawyer maintains that Thompson 's visits left Sharon depressed . Moreover , he argues that Sharon has the mind of a six-year- old and can not express her wishes reliably . Thompson denies these claims and points to Sharon 's typewritten responses to a neutral questioner indicating her desire to return to St. Cloud and have Karen as a guardian . <P> Last week disabled- and gay-rights advocates in 21 cities held rallies demanding that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore buttons proclaiming BRING SHARON HOME . Thompson 's supporters argue that as an adult , even a severely handicapped one , Sharon should be free to control her own destiny . " We are asked to let you rest in peace , Sharon , " declared Disabled Rights Activist Jaime Becker at the Minneapolis rally , " but you are not dead . You are alive ! And next year you will be free . " <P> Gay-rights activists compared the case with that of the lover of an AIDS patient who finds himself ignored or reviled by the victim 's family . Thompson says she thinks the Kowalskis " would rather see their daughter a vegetable than a lesbian . " Thompson recalls that Sharon once told her that homosexuality was practically a " hanging offense " on the Iron Range . <P> For their part , the Kowalskis continue to deny their daughter is gay . Della says she once asked Sharon if she was a lesbian . " And you know what she does ? She just laughs and shakes her head no . " Della also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon " when she does n't have the ability to do what any of us can . "
