It is customary for poets ' reputations to be revalued downward after their deaths . John Berryman is no exception to the rule : ten years after his suicide , his place among the poets of his time is unsettled . It would be pleasant to believe that John Haffenden 's biography will turn the attention of readers back to Berryman 's brilliant , problematic works , but the story it tells is so monumentally depressing that it may scare off more readers than it wins for its unruly , ravaged subject . The Life of John Berryman is an attempt at that intimidating thing , a definitive biography  --  if accumulation of data can make an account definitive . " I have been partial less to explanation than to information , " Haffenden remarks in his introduction ; and the pile of facts that , follows is something like an African anthill , overblown and teeming and uncomfortable for anyone but ants to be inside . Before detailing my misgivings , I must grant that on a basic level the book is bound to prove essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more complete version of the often traumatic events ' of Berry-man 's childhood and early youth , which reverberated in his writing to . the end . Haffenden is equally punctilious in tracing the balance of Berryman 's life , and here , too , the sheer mass of information is imposing . What Haffenden has written is in this way less a book than a " source " to be rifled by notecardshuffling graduate students . Robert B. Shaw teaches in the English department at- Yale University and is the author of a collection of poetry , Comforting the Wilderness ( Wesleyan ) . ? One wonders , however , what those students will make of the peculiar orchestration Haffenden 's style gives to his cheerless mass of facts . Although capable of plain , serviceable prose , he is prone to lurch without warning into murky grandiloquence . Referring to the strains that drove Berryman 's father to shoot himself , he writes , " Registering an inevitable sense of disengagement , Smith 's state of mind rapidly deteriorated . " Berryman 's maternal grandmother , deserted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades . " A colleague of Berryman 's , after discovering that the , poet had attempted to seduce his wife , followed him home and " traduced , him for the affront . " ( The reader almost feels like translating : " told him off " would do nicely here . ) In the course of defending his preference for information over explanation , Haffenden sniffs at biographers who select facts to fit paradigms : " I have often felt that determinative interpretations of a biography are postulated on the supposition that the dense pattern of a real life should yield to meaning as simple as a rhumb ; they sell the reader short by trimming texture to a thesis . " As simple as a what ? I 'm all for preserving the texture of whatever life is under discussion , but a biography 's verbal texture is another matter , and Haffenden 's bargain-basement Henry James effects could have been trimmed severely , to the distinct advantage of his narrative . Once one gets past Haffenden 's disinclination to give his material much shape and his breathtaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbing one . It is also relentlessly disturbing . When Berryman was 12 , his father escaped from money worries and an impending divorce by shooting himself beneath his son 's bedroom window . " Thereafter , " as the poet put it in one of his Dream Songs , " nothing fell out as it might or ought . " While Haffenden duly notes Berryman 's triumphs  --  his scholarly honors at Columbia and Cambridge , the Pulitzer Prize and other awards and fellowships that his poems finally brought him  --  the record seems chiefly one of difficulties , many of which were magnified by a habitually despondent outlook . Berryman was bullied at prep school to the point where he attempted to throw himself in front of a train . Emotional conflicts ravaged him : as a young man , he would drop to the floor in a faint during moments of stress . ( At least one doctor diagnosed him as an epileptic , but Berryman eventually recognized his blackouts as hysterical symptoms . ) His professional life was insecure ; he was over 40 when he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the erratic behavior induced by his neuroses merged with that induced by alcohol and drugs . His alcoholism brought with it a host of , physical ailments , not to mention its toll on his brain . Two of his three marriages ' failed , and the third was severely tried ; the distractions of his compulsive adulteries did not much lessen his distress . Several of his closest friends , admired fellow artists , died prematurely , making him " cross with god who has wrecked this generation , " But the worst thing Berryman had to endure was the enchaining attention of his mother . Her smothering affection delayed his emotional development , and she seems , despite her son 's violent efforts to assert his independence , to have remained the dominant woman in his life . After his return from Cambridge , heedless of his psychological discomfort , she capitalized on her youthful appearance by introducing him to her business associates as her brother . Her incessant talk when they were together sparked histrionic quarrels ; when they were apart she carried on their love-hate relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses his patience in discuSsing them ; he describes one as " five single-space typewritten sheets of apologetics : melodramatic , specious , proud and pained . " Her husband 's suicide , of course , was as disturbing for her as for her son , and lay behind much of her emotional exploitation of him . To the last , she insisted that the death was an accident , not a suicide , and the guilt she refused to'accept for contributing to her lips-band 's despair her son bore Vicariously for her . In answer to Berryman 's queries about his father 's death she burdened and bewildered him with contradictory , ever more embroidered versions of his last days . Haffenden 's wariness of explanation goes out the window in regard to Berryman 's mother . He thinks the poet 's self-lacerating mythologizing of his father 's death far in , the past was a way of deflecting his attention from his hostile feelings toward his mother , which were all too present throughout his life . Inescapable , she was living across the street from him in Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word on her implies that her lifelong conduct toward her son , if not her proximity at the end , was a major force among the many that led to his jump from the bridge : " She had exploited his feelings for her own private causes , one of which must have been an unconscious wish to take revenge upon her husband . Berryman , the agent of her compensation , became its victim . " One closes this book thinking it was miraculous that Berryman made it to 57 . He might have withstood his misfortunes even more successfully if he had not trapped himself in the agonizing role of pate maudit . He was such a connoisseur of disaster that he was largely incapable of spontaneous or lasting delight . According to Haffenden , his voluminous diaries dwell on gloom and apprehension , even at times when he had genuine cause for happiness . As Haffenden puts it , " His cast of mind construed affliction as a creative stimulant , " i.e. , he had to be miserable in order to write . He seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A brief but dismaying stint selling encyclopedias door to door in Harlem while he was between academic jobs led him to reflect , once he had been hired at Princeton , that he had gained " the authority of suffering . " After augmenting that authority over more than twenty years , he was still willing to say in an interview , " I do feel strongly that among the greatest pieces of luck for high achievement is ordeal . . . the artist is extremely lucky who is , presented with the worst possible ordeal which will not actually kill him . " To which one is tempted to add : Until it does , when the luck has run out . This is an appalling , ruinous belief , and the later poems in which it is expressed with no saving irony are not Berryman 's better ones . - I wish Haffenden had more to say about the poems , both the good ones and the not so good . He confines himself mostly to the poet 's themes , in order to show that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , the theme of childbearing in Homage to Mistress Bradstreet to Berryman 's ambivalence toward the possibility of parenthood during his first , childless marriage . Again , as many critics have done , he discusses the " irreversible loss " that plagues Henry , Berryman 's alter ego in The Dream Songs , in relation to the death of the poet 's father . But since these were not concerns Berryman had to hunt for  --  he lived with them daily  --  it would be more interesting to know how he developed the craft to give them such amazing lyrical and dramatic embodiment . Berryman was not by any means precocious as a stylist ; his early poems are stiff and derivative . To have sustained the controlled , ceremonious rhetoric of a poem the length of Homage to Mistress Bradstreet was for him an extraordinary feat . Even more extraordinary was his creation of the utterly original idiom of The Dream Songs , an elastic argot that equally accommodates Paterian elegance and minstrel-show sass . How did a man near 40 transform himself from an earnest versifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most important part of life for Berryman , and a biographer who fails to scrutinize his stylistic development has shirked a primary responsibility . James Atlas 's book on Berryman 's doomed and gifted friend Delmore Schwartz is one model of how art and life can be brought meaningfully together in a literary biography . It is not that one wants the biography to have been a critical commentary ( Haffenden has in fact already published such a book ) but that the life story seems impoverished and opaque without a close view of Berryman 's growing strength and individuationi as an artist . It is clear , for example , that Berryman 's handling of language gained freedom and force as he discovered the manifold uses of personae : first Anne Bradstreet , the pioneer poet of the inhospitable New World , and next , nearer to him , Henry , " a white American in early middle age sometimes in black-face , who has suffered an irreversible loss . " The earliest hints of this discovery lie as far back as " The Nerv- , ous Songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed characters , about which Haffenden could have said a good deal more . Berryman 's fine essay of 1949 on Pound , in which he discusses the older poet 's use of personae to explore his principal subject , " the life of the modern poet , " is surely relevant as well . In the same essay he praised Pound as " one of the wittiest poets who ever wrote , " and it may be that Berryman 's serious use of his own ferocious comic gift contributed as much as anything to his poetic advance . Berryman 's range of comic effect in The Dream Songs is as broad as that of his language . It moves from the buffoonery of sexual farce to the skewed wit , heartbreaking when analyzed , of dreams that mock the conscious mind 's defenses . Has anyone suf-ficiently complimented Berryman for having written the one American long poem that is fun to read ? His biographer tells us that for Berryman , " it took only the slightest shift of mind for brilliant gaiety to gall . " If that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell 's phrase , " this great Pierrot , " at once evoking tears and laughter , represents a heroic reach of imagination . Haffenden never met Berryman , and it is thus not his fault that his frequent references to the poet 's charm and funniness are overshadowed . by the darker aspects of his character . Misbehavior , of course , makes for more memorable anecdotes than does courtesy or kindness , and Haffenden is dependent on other people 's memories . It is good that Berryman 's first wife , Eileen Simpson , should have recently published her memoir , Poets in Their Youth , which brings a generous warmth to its portrayal of Berryman . ( To judge from the notes on sources , Haffenden seems not to have talked with Simpson , and their two books do not significantly overlap . ) Some things Haffenden has done quite well . He rightly stresses the large place academics had in Berryman 's life . Teaching was not for him the peripheral activity it is for many poets but a passion he indulged to riveting effect in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims as a Shakespearian scholar , and his book on Stephen Crane is something of a cornerstone . His occasional criticism , collected in The Freedom of the Poet , attests to his acumen in explicating texts , at times with an intensity that matches that of his mentor , R. P. Blackmur . If one overlooks the irritating stateliness of Haffenden 's prose , it is moving to read of Berryman 's love for his children , of his too-belated effort to cure himself of alcoholism and of his recovery , shortly befort his death , of the religious faith he had lost when his father killed himself . " I am a closet of secrets dying , " Berryman wrote in Homage to Mistress Bradstreet . Now that this biography has brought so many of those secrets to light , one can see that the rag and bone shop of this poet 's heart was no fouler than most . It is enough to say that his kindness , often lavished on others , did not extend to himself . The secrets of his art are more elusive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIVIDED WORKERS : The Historical Transformation of Labor in the United States . By David M.
