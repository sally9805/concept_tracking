The prospect is intoxicating . By mapping and manipulating tiny genes , man . could conceivably conquer diseases , improve upon his natural abilities and perhaps even control his own destiny . But just because miracles might someday be possible does not necessarily mean that they should all be performed . The tools of molecular biology have enormous potential for both good and evil . Lurking behind every genetic dream come true is a possible Brave New World nightmare . After all , it is the DNA of human beings that might be tampered with , not some string bean or laboratory mouse . To unlock the secrets hidden in the chromosomes of human cells is to open up a host of thorny legal , ethical , philosophical and religious issues , from invasion of privacy and discrimination to the question of who should play God with man 's genes . <P> The opportunities and dilemmas created by the new genetic knowledge begin even before birth . It is already possible , through a variety of prenatal tests , to determine whether a child will be a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of some fatal genetic disorder . The question of what to do with that information runs squarely into the highly charged issue of abortion . Many could sympathize with a woman who chooses to terminate a pregnancy rather than have a baby doomed to a painful struggle with , say , Tay- Sachs disease or Duchenne muscular dystrophy . But what about the mother of three daughters who wants to hold out for a son ? Or the couple that one day may be able to learn whether an unborn baby has a minor genetic blemish ? Only the most hardened pro-choice advocate would argue that prospective parents have the right to abort fetus after fetus until they get the " perfect " baby . <P> Complicating such decisions is the fact that genetic prognostication will probably never be an exact science . Technicians may someday be able to determine that a fetus has a predisposition to heart disease , certain cancers , or a variety of psychiatric illnesses . But they will not be able to predict precisely when  --  or even if  --  the affliction will strike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life the baby can expect . As scientists learn to detect ever more minute imperfections in a strand of DNA , it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between genetic abnormalities and normal human variability . " We have n't thought much about how to draw the line , " admits Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota . " It is going to be one of the key ethical challenges of the 1990s. "
