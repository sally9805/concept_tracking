With a decent layer of snow on the ground , it is easy to forget that Massachusetts has just passed through one of the driest years in memory . Among the few who have not forgotten are officials who must look after the water supplies and they are very much aware that 1980 was an unlucky year for water . It fell 13.13 inches short of normal precipitation . Huge reservoirs , such as the Quabbin and the Wachusett , show only a minor drop , being very large , but small reservoirs were especially affected . The one in Pembroke that serves the city of Brockton is still 15 feet below its normal level . Not since the record drought of 1965 , when even Quabbin was down to alarmingly low levels , has so little rain fallen . The precipitation in 1965 was only 23.71 inches . Last year it was 29.39 inches , making it the fourth driest year in 163 years of record- keeping . That 1980 has been a dry year is shown in statistics compiled by retired climatologist Robert Lautzenheiser , statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , despite sweltering days in July and August . It is only necessary to think back to June when most of the month was downright chilly , with clowds lowering all the time but shedding little rain . It was that kind of a year . Ski resort operators , and skiers , for that matter , need not be reminded , for example , of the year ' s beginning . In fact , they prefer not to talk about it . January was not very cold , but it was nearly snowless . That was also the month when on the 17th a freezing rain glazed over streets and highways , bringing car accidents and many broken legs from falls . February was even drier , and unusually sunny , Lautzenheiser ' s records show . Not since 1901 had February had so little precipitation , only .88 of an inch . Normally it can be expected to have 3.54 . March on the other hand was wet , bringing 5.37 inches , or 1.36 above normal . It was one of three months in which there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a total of 4.14 inches , or 1.12 above normal , and April , which with its sweet showers , is supposed to pierce the drought of March to the root . April had 4.36 inches , or .87 above normal . May was , as it should be , balmy , but quite dry , with 1.17 fewer inches of rain than it should have brought . It also had 11 foggy days , three of them with thick fog , and two days , the 13th and the 24th , when there was both fog and thunder . This unusual combination happened again on June 4 and 29 , a month that had more than its share of foggy days , all of them clammy and dismal . July and August had light fogs , and their proper share of days with thunder , but both of them came up dry , especially August which should have 3.46 inches of precipitation , but offered only 1.55 , or 1.91 below normal - less than half of what may be expected . July is expected to be dry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast keeping most low-pressure rain- bearing air masses out , but it was even worse than usual , having only 2.2 inches of rain , .54 below normal . Most of it fell in frustratingly small amounts , drying up at once with no benefit to grass and crops . The two months also brought hot and muggy days , with the high being reached on July 21 , when it hit 99 along the seashore and in the 100s in some inland locations . It was the hottest day of the year . The coldest followed five months later , when minus 20 was recorded on Christmas day in some inland locations . The only thing that made these temperatures bearable , besides the apparent lower-than-usual humidity , were the news reports from Texas and other parts of the Southwest where the mercury went over 100 for 56 days , bringing death and disaster to people , animals and crops . September was almost as dry as February , getting only .82 inches of rain when it should have 3.16 , about a fourth of its normal share . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dry year , and some towns were asking their residents to go easy on water . Rains in October appeared to break the dry spell , but after the land was drenched with 1.84 inches in nine hours during a southeaster on the 25th , the month did not offer much else . Without that one storm , it , too , would have been drier than normal . November reverted to the predominant pattern , bringing in only 3.01 inches of rain , or 1.5 fewer than can be expected of that traditionally rainy month . November also brought the earliest season snowfall since 1894 , when it dropped 2.4 inches of snow on the 18th . It stayed for several days . December , as most people can remember easily , was cold and dry . It began quite mild , but as Christmas approached , the mercury headed down and on Christmas day some inland locations recorded 20 below zero . There was snow to gladden the skiers ' hearts , 5.6 inches . It was 2.3 inches below what aDecember normally has , but nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry year has had its effect . Besides the shrinking water supply , some farmers had to spend money trying to keep their crops healthy . Says Angelo Arena , who grows vegetables in Concord , " These past two years , and last year especially , have been way out of line from what you would expect . Even in the summer , people forget now , but we had these hot muggy days , and we had to take all sorts of measures to protect our crops . It all came down to a lot of extra expense . " However , his fellow Concordian , Stephen Verrill , a dairy farmer , said he made out all right . " The dry year gave us a chance to drain some of the water out of the ground that had been in there from the years before . We did get enough hay and silage . If there had been any losses , it would have shown in the dairy yield . " The cool dry years may be here to stay until the late 1980s or early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prof. Emeritus Hurd C. Willett of MIT says that his study of the sun ' s cyclical behavior convinces him that we are in for a cool decade . Such cycles have been carefully plotted since 1900 and the long- range weather patterns have always followed the sun ' s activity , he says .
