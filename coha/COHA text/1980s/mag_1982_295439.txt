No need to make your own weapons today : the world is filled with arms merchants who are happy to oblige any customers . Argentina is a classic example of a country with a modest arms industry of its own but a large and potent , if somewhat obsolescent , arsenal of weapons purchased almost exclusively from Western nations . Ironically , virtually all of Argentina 's main weapons have been supplied by Britain or Britain 's NATO allies . No major orders have gone to the Soviet Union . <P> From the U.S. The core of the Argentine air force and navy consists of old , but updated and well-maintained American-made planes and ships . The air force has 68 versatile A-4P Skyhawk attack aircraft . In addition , Argentina has 14 A-4Q navy Skyhawks ; seven C-130 transports ; two KC-130 tankers ; and some 20 Hughes and Bell helicopters . The navy 's only cruiser , the General Belgrano , was commissioned in 1939 and bought from the U.S. in 1951 for $7.8 million . Six Argentine destroyers are U.S.-built World War II vintage vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Guppy-class submarines and two torpedo boats . The army is equipped with 60 M-4 Sherman tanks and 250 M-l 13 armored personnel carriers . <P> From Britain . The flagship of the navy is the 1945 aircraft carrier , the Veinticinco de Mayo , sold first to the Dutch , who later resold it to the Argentines . The navy also includes two guided missile destroyers ( one built in Argentina under British supervision ) and six coastal minesweepers . The army is equipped with Tigercat surface-to-air missiles ; the air force flies nine Canberra medium bombers . <P> From France . The armed forces have 21 Mirage IIIs , still among the world 's best fighters , five Super Etendard aircraft ( a carrier-based equivalent of the Mirage ) , 120 AMX-13 light tanks , 16 Roland surface-to-air missiles , 32 MS-760A Paris II ground-support fighter bomber planes and three corvettes . <P> From West Germany . Argentina acquired two patrol boats , two conventional Type 209 ( Salta ) submarines and 125 TAM medium tanks . <P> From Israel . The weaponry includes 26 Daggers ( modified Mirages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Argentina makes small arms , but most of these are through licensing arrangements with the Belgians . Example : the 7.62 rifle , a standard NATO <P> weapon . The Argentines produce their own 30-ton tanks and armored personnel carriers using a common chassis , but the design was copied from the West Germans , who make the main gun , the fire-control equipment and the engine and transmission . <P> The confrontation with Britain has at least temporarily stopped Argentina from shopping the world 's best markets for more weaponry . At the urging of Britain , West Germany is holding up the sale of four frigates , six corvettes and six submarines , and France has halted shipment of Crotale surface-to-air and Exocet surface-to-surface missiles . Britain itself has withheld sale of Sea Dart missiles , the same kind that were on the fleet last week heading to-Carrier Veinticinco de Mayo ward the Falkland Islands .
