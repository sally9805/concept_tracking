DEDICATION . To the President , Vice President , Directors and Members of the Busker Hill Monument Association . Gentlemen : It has ever been a chief aim , in civilized people , to honor the memory of those who may have fallen in defence of their country . The object of your Association is , therefore , grand and noble , since its design is the laudable one , to remind posterity , of an engagement , the most celebrated in the annals of America , as well as to preserve to your community an evidence of those exalted ideas of Liberty , which warmed the bosoms of their Fathers . Elevated notions of individual RIGHT , could , alone , have impelled those fathers ( contrary to their well-known affection for a parent soil ) to take up arms , and exhibit unexampled display of courage , in a long and arduous encounter , with troops accustomed to ' war 's alarms . ' Another meritorious aim in civilized people , has been , to entertain respect for intrepid antagonist , whether conquering or conquered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seldom hesitated to indulge this amiable regard for valor  --  many acknowledgments of which are to be found on tablets erected to the manes of your fallen heroes . Neither has a similar veneration for English valor been wanting to be expressed in the United States ' community . It is an action , the opposite of ignoble , that the members of two great countries should fight hard , and vie with each other , to commend the bravery with which the contest has been supported . Permit , therefore , a lover of Freedom ( who would keep the talented virtues of the Fathers of your nation in perpetual view ) to dedicate a drama to your Association , which alludes to those , in honor of whom that Association has been formed . Your country , by her prosperity , astonishes civilized Europe ; her prosperity is accounted for , in her free institutions ; to insure the preservation of those institutions , as well as to keep alive the ( as yet unfaded ) spirit of American Representative Liberty ; it is thought the means lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the public , for public cheers , that their cool minds  --  warm hearts  --  great actions , and love of ' Native Land ' may never be forgotten . In this sentiment , behold the origin of the Patriot Drama ; a drama intended to confer merited eulogiums on all , whom your citizens confess , it will ever be your nation 's glory , to have in affectionate remembrance . That your country may never cease to be prosperous  --  may continue to increase in splendor and importance  --  prove a blessing to her own people  --  to Europe  --  and the world , is the wish of , Gentlemen , An humble admirer of your nation 's enterprise . THE AUTHOR . United States , October , 1834 . Prologue . Scene .  --  A Landscape , with a finger-post marked one way , ' Boston ' the other ' Bunker HIll , '  --  a violent Carpenter 's knocking heard . Enter Dramaticus . Silence , ye knaves  --  stop that noise and clatter ; I come to relate what 's going to be the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a story About brave creatures , fond of fame and glory . ( roll of a drum . ) Strike not that dreadful hurley-burley drum ,  --  Macbeth-like tyrants ne'er shall hither come ! Once on a time there liv 'd  --  and still lives on , In a small island a few furlongs long  --  A mighty Lion , whose dominions grew Till , far and near , her ships protection threw ; Her young were rich , and some , advent'rous , fled To seek more treasures ' mong a nation red ; There they endured long , and struggled sore , And num'rous ills and trying hardships bore  --  But  --  like the Lion from whose lions they came  --  Hardships and trials found them still the same  --  Courageous  --  brave  --  magnanimous and bold , Their honor neither to be bought nor sold ! In course of time , the mother Lion saw These young increase , and ev'ry season draw From young at home , a mass of pretty things , Hose  --  clothing  --  paper  --  fardingales and rings ! By traffic still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mother Lion 's foes : Affection sway 'd them , and with ready hand , They 'd smite the inj'rer of their parent land ! It chanced , howe'er , the Lion mother slept , And her strict justice-sway to mongrels Footnote : 1Kb left ; And these , while she in dreams soft slumb'rings lay , From justice , ' rule of right ' soon went astray  --  Heedless , the mother 's righteous laws relax 'd  --  And ' gan these young abroad , unask 'd , to tax . ' Gainst taxes they petition 'd  --  but in vain  --  Still they petitions wrote  --  and wrote again , And pray 'd redress ! at last , some few , resisted  --  And then , another few , that few assisted : The flame-burst forth , and o'er the tranquil soil Commotion , in each breast , began to boil . The mongrel rulers ( guiding Lions true ) Forgot these young abroad , were Lions too ; For lo ! they thought the mighty rise to crush , By sending hirelings o'er their lands to rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lion and Lion gave as close a hug . Long was the conflict  --  hardy , too , the strife In which these Lions sought each others ' lives . One Noble Creature  --  seldom seen on earth  --  In public virtue rich and private worth , Led the defending host  --  vict'ry sat upon his plume , While his mild bearing did that host illume : The Lion mother from her dream awoke , And found these young had cast aside her yoke ! Since then , these young , likeyoung at home , have grown A Lion state , where all in Freedom roam . ' T is said  --  I know not if't be truth or fiction 'd story  --  That each is jealous of the other 's glory : Jealous !  --  what of  --  I them and all beseech ? Both lands are ' fair  --  love company  --  are free of speech , ' Then wherefore jealous ' saith the dusky Moor ? Mutual are Lion wants on every friendly shore ! ' T is here the fable ends  --  and new , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ' shew ' to-night , Then ' list  --  O  --  list ! '  --  One of that Lion Land ' Gainst which your Lion Fathers made a stand , Would keep those heroic men in constant view , From whom your soil her Institutions drew : Loving all Liberty  --  he gladly sees , Your magic cities rise ' mid forest trees ; And , with esteem , surveys your growing power , Destin 'd content o'er western vales to shower : He  --  scorning prejudice  --  with kind delight , Anticipates your country 's FUTURE MIGHT ; Nor can a reason find , nor reason 's cause , Why some should seek to lesson your applause : So , with frank pen  --  has ta'en that very blaze ( Or Lion fury which the world amazed ) For subject , and written on it , just three acts Of Patriot views , and no less Patriot facts  --  But hush  --  , the prompter ' strikes upon the bell .
