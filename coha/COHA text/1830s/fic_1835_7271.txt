THE LINWOODS ; OR , " SIXTY YEARS SINCE " IN AMERICA . BY THE AUTHOR OF " HOPE LESLIE , " " REDWOOD , " &c.; The Eternal Power Lodged in the will of man the hallowed names Of freedom and of country . Miss Mitford . IN TWO VOLUMES . VOL . I. NEW-YORK : PUBLISHED BY HARPER &; BROTHERS , NO. 82 CLIFF-STREET , AND SOLD BY THE PRINCIPAL BOOKSELLERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES . 1835 . Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1835 , By Harper &; Brothers , In the Clerk 's Office of the Southern District of New-York . PREFACE . The titleof these volumes will render their readers liable to a disappointment , from which a few prefatory words may save them . It was chosen simply to mark the period of the story , and that period was selected as one to which an American always gratefully recurs , and as affording a picturesque light for domestic features . The writer has aimed to exhibit the feeling of the times , and to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the condition of their country at the most  --  the only suffering period of its existence , and by means of this impression to deepen their gratitude to their patriot-fathers ; a sentiment that will tend to increase their fidelity to the free institutions transmitted to them . Historic events and war details have been avoided ; the writer happily being aware that no effort at " A swashing and a martial outside " would conceal the weak and unskilled woman . A very few of our " immortal names " have been introduced , with what propriety the reader must determine . It may be permitted to say , in extenuation of what may seem presumption , that whenever the writer has mentioned Washington , she has felt a sentiment resembling the awe of the pious Israelite when he approached the ark of the Lord . For the rest , the author of these volumes is most happy in trusting to the indulgent disposition which our American public constantly manifest towards native literature . It has been suggested , that the title might be deemed ambitious ; that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since in America " would take place with the " sixty years since " of the great Master . I have not yet forgotten the literature of my childhood  --  the fate of the ambitious frog . To those who know me , I need not plead " not guilty " to a charge of such insane vanity , and those who do not will believe me when I say , that the only moment when I could wish the benefactor of the universal reading public to be forgotten , is when my humble productions are under perusal . Dedication TO LOUISA MINOT , These volumes are inscribed by their author , as an expression of that friendship which was begun in youth , and has increased with every added year of life . Main text THE LINWOODS.  --  CHAPTER I. " Un notable exemple de la forcene curiosit de notre nature , s'amusant se proccuper des choses futures , comme si elle n'avoit pas assez faire dsirer les prsentes. "  --  Montaigne . Some two or three years before our revolutionary war , just at the close of day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the rear of a stately mansion which fronted on Broad-street , that being then the court-end of the city  --  the residence of unquestioned aristocracy  --  ( sic transit gloria mundi ! ) whence royal favour and European fashions were diffused through the province of New-York . The eldest of the two girls had entered on her teens . She was robust and tall for her years , with the complexion of a Hebe , very dark hair , an eye ( albeit belonging to one of the weaker sex ) that looked as if she were born to empire  --  it might be over hearts and eyes  --  and the step of a young Juno . The younger could be likened neither to goddess , queen , nor any thing that assumed or loved command . She was of earth 's gentlest and finest mould  --  framed for all tender humanities , with the destiny of woman written on her meek brow . " Thou art born to love , to suffer , to obey ,  --  to minister , and not to be ministered to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a black servant in livery . The elder pressed forward as if impelled by some powerful motive , while her companion lagged behind ,  --  sometimes chasing a young bird , then smelling the roses that peeped through the garden-paling ; now stopping to pat a good-natured mastiff , or caress a chubby child : many a one attracted her with its broad shining face and linsey-woolsey short-gown and petticoat , seated with the family group on the freshly-scoured stoops of the Dutch habitations that occurred at intervals on their way . " Come , do come along , Bessie , you are stopping for every thing , " said her companion , impatiently . Poor Bessie , with the keenest sensibility , had , what rarely accompanies it , a general susceptibility to external impressions ,  --  one might have fancied she had an extra set of nerves . When the girls had nearly reached St. Paul 's church , their attendant remonstrated ,  --  " Miss Isabella , you are getting quite out to the fields  --  missis said you were only going a turn up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A pretty long turn , " muttered Jupiter ; and after proceeding a few paces further , he added , in a raised voice , " the sun is going down , Miss Isabella . " " That was news at 12 o'clock , Jupiter . " " But it really is nearly set now , Isabella , " interposed her companion Bessie . " Well , what if it is , Bessie ?  --  it is just the right time  --  Effie is always surest between sundown and dark . " " Mercy , Isabella ! you are not going to Effie 's . It is horrid to go there after sundown  --  please Isabella , do n't . " Isabella only replied by a " pshaw , child ! " and a laugh . Bessie mustered her moral courage ( it required it all to oppose Isabella ) , and stopping short , said , " I am not sure it is right to go there at all . " " There is no right nor wrong in the matter , Bessie ,  --  you are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , and with a tremulousness of voice that indicated she was not indifferent to the cardinal points in her path of morality , she added ,  --  " why do you think it is not right , Bessie ? " " Because the Bible says , that sorcery , and divination , and every thing of that kind , is wicked . " " Nonsense , child ! that was in old times , you know . " Isabella 's evsion might have quieted a rationalist of the present day , but not Bessie , who had been bred in the strict school of New-England orthodoxy ; and she replied , " What was right and wrong in old times , is right and wrong now , Isabella . " " Do n't preach , Bessie  --  I will venture all the harm of going to Effie 's ; and you may lay the sin at my door ; " and with her usual independent , fearnaught air , she turned into a shady lane that led by a cross-cut to " Aunt Katy 's garden " ,  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chatham-street theatre has since occupied the same spot  --  that theatre is now a church . Isabella quickened her pace . Bessie followed most unwillingly . " Miss Belle , " cried out Jupiter , " I must detest , in your ma 's name , against your succeeding farther . " " The tiresome old fool ! " With this exclamation on her lips , Isabella turned round , and drawing her person up to the height of womanhood , she added , " I shall go just as far as I please , Jupe  --  follow me ; if anybody is scolded it shall be me , not you . I wish mamma , " she continued , pursuing her way , " would not send Jupe after us ,  --  just as if we were two babies in leading-strings . " " I would not go a step farther for the world , if he were not with us , " said Bessie . " And pray , what good would he do us if there were danger  --  such a desperate coward as he is ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has the form of one  --  Jupe , " she called out ( the spirit of mischief playing about her arch mouth ) , pointing to a slight elevation , called Gallows hill , where a gibbet was standing , " Jupe , is not that the place where they hung the poor creatures who were concerned in the negro-plot ? " " Yes , miss , sure it is the awful place : " and he mended his pace , to be as near as might be to the young ladies . " Did not some of your relations suffer there , Jupiter ? " " Yes , miss , two of my poster'ty  --  my grandmother and aunt Venus . " Isabella repressed a smile , and said , with unaffected seriousness , " it was a shocking business , Bessie  --  a hundred and fifty poor wretches sacrificed , I have heard papa say . Is it true , Jupe , that their ghosts walk about here , and have been seen many a time when it was so dark you could not see your hand before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle . Them that 's hung onjustly always travels . " " But how could they be seen in such darkness ? " " ' Case , miss , you know ghosts have a light in their anterior , just like lanterns . " " Ah , have they ? I never understood it before  --  what a horrid cracking that gibbet makes ! Bless us ! and there is very little wind . " " That makes no distinctions , miss ; it begins as the sun goes down , and keeps it up all night . Miss Belle , stop one minute  --  do n't go across the hill  --  that is right in the ghost-track ! " " Oh do n't , for pity 's sake , Isabella , " said Bessie , imploringly . " Hush , Bessie , it is the shortest way , and " ( in a whisper ) " I want to scare Jupe . Jupe , it seems to me there is an odd hot feel in the ground here . " " There sarten is , miss , a very onhealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you feel a very , very slight kind of a trembling  --  a shake  --  or a roll , as if something were walking in the earth , under our feet ? " " I do , and it gets worser and worser , every step . " " It feels like children playing under the bed , and hitting the sacking with their heads . " " Oh , Lord , miss  --  yes  --  it goes bump , bump , against my feet . " By this time they had passed to the further side of the hill , so as to place the gibbet between them and the western sky , lighted up with one of those brilliant and transient radiations that sometimes immediately succeed the sun 's setting , diffusing a crimson glow , and outlining the objects relieved against the sky with light red . Our young heroine , like all geniuses , knew how to seize a circumstance . " Oh , Jupe , " she exclaimed , " look , what a line of blood is drawn round the gibbet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " And , dear me ! I think I see a faint shadow of a man with a rope round his neck , and his head on one side  --  do you see , Jupe ? " Poor Jupe did not reply . He could bear it no longer . His fear of his young mistress  --  his fear of a scolding at home , all were merged in the terror Isabella had conjured up by the aid of the traditionary superstitions with which his mind was previously filled ; and without attempting an answer , he fairly ran off the ground , leaving Isabella laughing , and Bessie expostulating , and confessing that she did not in the least wonder that poor Jupe was scared . Once more she ventured to entreat Isabella to give up the expedition to Effie 's , for this time at least , when she was interrupted and reassured by the appearance of two friends , in the persons of Isabella 's brother and Jasper Meredith , returning , with their dogs and guns , from a day 's sport . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of day ? " asked her brother . " I am sure Bessie Lee has not come to Gallows hill with her own good will . " " I have made game of my goose , at any rate , and given Bessie Lee a good lesson , on what our old schoolmaster would call the potentiality of mankind  --  but come , " she added , for though rather ashamed to confess her purpose when she knew ridicule must be braved , courage was easier to Isabella than subterfuge , " Come along with us to Effie 's , and I will tell you the joke I played off on Jupe . " Isabella 's joke seemed to her auditors a capital one , for they were at that happy age when laughter does not ask a reason to break forth from the full fountain of youthful spirits . Isabella spun out her story till they reached Effie 's door , which admitted them , not to any dark laboratory of magic , but to a snug little Dutch parlour , with a nicely-sanded floor  --  a fireplace gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ornamented with storied tiles , that , if not as classic , were , as we can vouch , far more entertaining than the sculptured marble of our own luxurious days . The pythoness Effie turned her art to good account , producing substantial comforts by her mysterious science ; and playing her cards well for this world , whatever bad dealings she might have with another . Even Bessie felt her horror of witchcraft diminished before this plump personage , with a round , good-humoured face , looking far more like the good vrow of a Dutch picture than like the gaunt skinny hag who has personated the professors of the bad art from the Witch of Endor downwards . Effie 's physiognomy , save an ominous contraction of her eyelids , and the keen and somewhat sinister glances that shot between them , betrayed nothing of her calling . There were , as on all similar occasions , some initiatory ceremonies to be observed before the fortunes were told . Herbert , boylike , was penniless ; and he offered a fine brace of snipe to propitiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augured well for the official response he should receive . Jasper 's purse , too , was empty : and after ransacking his pockets in vain , he slipped out a gold sleeve-button , and told Effie he would redeem it the next time he came her way . Meanwhile there was a little by-talk between Isabella and Bessie ; Isabella insisting on paying the fee for her friend , and Bessie insisting that " she would have no fortune told ,  --  that she did not believe Effie could tell it , and if she could , she would not for all the world let her . " In vain Isabella ridiculed and reasoned by turns . Bessie , blushing and trembling , persisted . Effie at the same moment was shuffling a pack of cards , as black as if they had been sent up from Pluto 's realms ; and while she was muttering over some incomprehensible phrases , and apparently absorbed in the manipulations of her art , she heard and saw all that passed , and determined that if poor little Bessie would not acknowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulous , and therefore the boldest , first came forward to confront his destiny . " A great deal of rising in the world , and but little sinking for you , Master Herbert Linwood  --  you are to go over the salt water , and ride foremost in royal hunting-grounds . " " Good !  --  good !  --  go on , Effie . " " Oh what beauties of horses  --  a pack of hounds  --  High ! how the steeds go  --  how they leap  --  the buck is at bay  --  there are you ! " " Capital , Effie !  --  I strike him down ? " " You are too fast , young master  --  I can tell no more than I see  --  the sport is past  --  the place is changed  --  there is a battle-field , drums , trumpets , and flags flying  --  Ah , there is a sign of danger  --  a pit yawns at your feet . " " Shocking ! " cried Bessie ; " pray , do n't listen any more , Herbert . " " Pshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves snipe too well to leave me the wrong side of that . " Effie was either offended at Herbert 's intimation that her favours might be bought , or perhaps she saw his lack of faith in his laughing eye , and , determined to punish him , she declared that all was dark and misty beyond the pit ; there might be a leap over it , and a smooth road beyond  --  she could not tell  --  she could only tell what she saw . " You are a croaking raven , Effie ! " exclaimed Herbert ; " I 'll shuffle my own fortune ; " and seizing the cards , he handled them as knowingly as the sibyl herself , and ran over a jargon quite as unintelligible ; and then holding them fast , quite out of Effie 's reach , he ran on  --  " Ah , ha  --  I see the mist going off like the whiff from a Dutchman 's pipe ; and here 's a grand castle , and parks , and pleasure-grounds ; and here am I , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the cards , he turned and kissed Bessie 's reddening cheek , saying , " Let others wait on fortune , Effie , I 'll carve my own . " Isabella was nettled at Herbert 's open contempt of Effie 's seership . She would not confess nor examine the amount of her faith , nor did she choose to be made to feel on how tottering a base it rested . She was exactly at that point of credulity where much depends on the sympathy of others . It is said to be essential to the success of animal magnetism , that not only the operator and the subject , but the spectators , should believe . Isabella felt she was on disenchanted ground , while Herbert , with his quizzical smile , stood charged , and aiming at her a volley of ridicule ; and she proposed that those who had yet their fortunes to hear should , one after another , retire with Effie to a little inner room . But Herbert cried out , " Fair play , fair play ! Dame Effie has read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is but fair I should hear yours . " Bessie saw Isabella 's reluctance , and she again interposed , reminding her of " mamma  --  the coming night , " &c.; and poor Isabella was fain to give up the contest for the secret conference , and hush Bessie , by telling Effie to proceed . " Shall I tell your fortin and that young gentleman 's together ? " asked Effie , pointing to Jasper . Her manner was careless ; but she cast a keen glance at Isabella , to ascertain how far she might blend their destinies . " Oh , no , no  --  no partnership for me , " cried Isabella , while the fire which flashed from her eye evinced that the thought of a partnership with Jasper , if disagreeable , was not indifferent to her . " Nor for me , either , mother Effie , " said Jasper ; " or if there be a partnership , let it be with the pretty blue-eyed mistress of Herbert 's mansion . " " Nay , master , that pretty miss does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  poor thing ! " she added , with an ominous shake of the head . Bessie 's heart quailed , for she both believed and feared . " Now , shame on you , Effie , " cried Herbert ; " she can not know any thing about you , Bessie ; she has not even looked at your fortune yet . " " Did I say I knew , Master Herbert ? Time must show whether I know or not . " Bessie still looked apprehensively . " Nonsense , " said Herbert ; " what can she know ?  --  she never saw you before . " " True , I never saw her ; but I tell you , young lad , there is such a thing as seeing the shadow of things far distant and past , and never seeing the realities , though they it be that cast the shadows . " Bessie shuddered  --  Effie shuffled the cards . " Now just for a trial , " said she ; " I will tell you something about her  --  not of the future ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time comes  --  but of the past . " " Pray , do not , " interposed Bessie ; " I do n't wish you to say any thing about me , past , present , or to come . " " Oh , Bessie , " whispered Isabella , " let her try  --  there can be no harm if you do not ask her  --  the past is past , you know  --  now we have a chance to know if she really is wiser than others . " Bessie again resolutely shook her head . " Let her go on , " whispered Herbert , " and see what a fool she will make of herself . " " Let her go on , dear Bessie , " said Jasper , " or she will think she has made a fool of you . " Bessie feared that her timidity was folly in Jasper 's eyes ; and she said , " she may go on if you all wish , but I will not hear her ; " and she covered her ears with her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Isabella ; Isabella nodded assent , and she proceeded . " She has come from a great distance  --  her people are well to do in the world , but not such quality as yours , Miss Isabella Linwood  --  she has found some things here pleasanter than she expected  --  some not so pleasant  --  the house she was born in stands on the sunny side of a hill . " At each pause that Effie made , Isabella gave a nod of acquiescence to what she said ; and this , or some stray words , which might easily have found their way through Bessie 's little hands , excited her curiosity , and by degrees they slid down so as to oppose a very slight obstruction to Effie 's voice . " Before the house , " she continued , " and not so far distant but she may hear its roaring , when a storm uplifts it , is the wide sea  --  that sea has cost the poor child dear . " Bessie 's heart throbbed audibly . " Since she came here she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there you are out , " cried Herbert , glad of an opportunity to stop the current that was becoming too strong for poor Bessie . " She can best tell herself whether I am right , " said Effie , coolly . " She is right  --  right in all , " said Bessie , retreating to conceal the tears that were starting from her eyes . Isabella neither saw nor heard this  --  she was only struck with what Effie delivered as a proof of her preternatural skill ; and more than ever eager to inquire into her own destiny , she took the place Bessie had vacated . Effie saw her faith , and was determined to reward it . " Miss Isabella Linwood , you are born to walk in no common track , "  --  she might have read this prediction , written with an unerring hand on the girl 's lofty brow , and in her eloquent eye . " You will be both served and honoured  --  those that have stood in kings ' palaces will bow down to you  --  but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a dark day  --  trouble when you least expect it  --  joy when you are not looking for it . " This last was one of Effie 's staple prophecies , and was sure to be verified in the varied web of every individual 's experience . " You have had some trouble lately , but it will soon pass away , and for ever . " A safe prediction in regard to any girl of twelve years . " You 'll have plenty of friends , and lots of suiters  --  the right one will be  --  " " Oh , never mind  --  do n't say who , Effie , " cried Isabella , gaspingly . " I was only going to say the right one will be tall and elegant , with beautiful large eyes  --  I ca n't say whether blue or black  --  but black , I think ; for his hair is both dark and curling . " " Bravo , bravissimo , brother Jasper ! " exclaimed Herbert ; " it is your curly pate Effie sees in those black cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " replied Jasper , with an arch smile , that caught Isabella 's eye . " I do not , " she retorted  --  " look again , Effie  --  it must not be curling hair  --  I despise it . " " I see but once , miss , and then clearly ; but there 's curling hair on more heads than one . " " I never  --  never should like any one with curling hair , " persisted Isabella . " It would be no difficult task for you to pull it straight , Miss Isabella , " said the provoking Jasper . Isabella only replied by her heightened colour ; and bending over the table , she begged Effie to proceed . " There 's not much more shown me , miss  --  you will have some tangled ways  --  besetments , wonderments , and disappointments . " " Effie 's version of the course of true love never does run smooth , ' " interposed Jasper . " But all will end well , " she concluded ; " your husband will be the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , and great ; and take you home to spend your days in merry England . " " Thank you  --  thank you , Effie , " said Isabella , languidly . The " beauty , riches , and days spent in England " were well enough , for beauty and riches are elements in a maiden 's beau-ideal ; and England was then the earthly paradise of the patrician colonists . But she was not just now in a humour to acquiesce in the local habitation and the name which the " dark curling hair " had given to the ideal personage . Jasper Meredith had not even a shadow of faith in Effie ; but next to being fortune 's favourite , he liked to appear so ; and contriving , unperceived by his companions , to slip his remaining sleeve-button into Effie 's hand , he said , " Keep them both ; " and added aloud , " Now for my luck , Dame Effie , and be it weal or be it wo , deliver it truly . " Effie was propitiated , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his future destiny ; but the opportunity was too tempting to be resisted , to prove to him that she was mastered by a higher power : and looking very solemn , and shaking her head , she said , " There are too many dark spots here . Ah , Mr. Jasper Meredith  --  disappointment ! disappointment !  --  the arrow just misses the mark  --  the cup is filled to the brim  --  the hand is raised  --  the lips parted to receive it  --  then comes the slip ! " She hesitated , she seemed alarmed ; perhaps she was so , for it is impossible to say how far a weak mind may become the dupe of its own impostures  --  " Do not ask me any farther , " she added . The young people now all gathered round her . Bessie rested her elbows on the table , and her burning cheeks on her hands , and riveted her eyes on Effie , which , from their natural blue , were deepened almost to black , and absolutely glowing with the intensity of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasper ; " if fortune is cross , I 'll give her wheel a turn . " " Ah , the wheel turns but too fast  --  a happy youth is uppermost . " " So far , so good . " " An early marriage . " " That may be weal , or may be wo , " said Jasper ; " weal it is , " he added , in mock heroic ; " but for the dread of something after . " " An early death ! " " For me , Effie ? Heaven forefend ! " " No , not for you ; for here you are again a leader on a battle-field  --  the dead and dying in heaps  --  pools of blood  --  there 's the end o n't , " she concluded , shuddering , and throwing down the cards . " What , leave me there , Effie ! Oh , no  --  death or victory ! " " It may be death , it may be victory ; it is not given to me to see which . " Jasper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a destiny so uncertain , when a deep-drawn sigh from Bessie attracted the eyes of the group , and they perceived the colour was gone from her cheeks , and that she was on the point of fainting . The windows were thrown open  --  Effie produced a cordial , and she was soon restored to a sense of her condition , which she attempted to explain , by saying she was apt to faint even at the thought of blood ! They were now all ready , and quite willing to bid adieu to the oracle , whose responses not having been entirely satisfactory to any one of them , they all acquiesced in Bessie 's remark , that " if it were ever so right , she did not think there was much comfort in going to a fortune-teller . " Each seemed in a more thoughtful humour than usual , and they walked on in silence till they reached the space , now the park , then a favourite play-ground for children , shaded by a few locusts , and here and there an elm or stinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect figure of a man , who seemed just declining from the meridian of life , past its first ripeness and perfection , but still far from the decay of age . " Ah , you runaways ! " he exclaimed , on seeing the young people advancing . " Belle , your mother has been in the fidgets about you for the last hour . " " Jupiter might have told her , papa , that we were quite safe . " " Jupe truly ! he came home with a rigmarole that we could make nothing of . I assured her there was no danger , but that assurance never quieted any woman . Herbert , can you tell me what these boys are about ? they seem rather to be at work than play . " " What are you about , Ned ? " cried Herbert to a young acquaintance . " Throwing up a redoubt to protect our fort , " and he pointed as he spoke to a rude structure of poles , bricks , and broken planks on an eminence , at the extremity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort for , my lad ? " asked Mr. Linwood . " To keep off the British , sir . " " The British ! and who are you ? " " Americans , sir ! " A loud huzzaing was heard from the fort  --  " What does that mean ? " asked Mr. Linwood . " The whigs are hanging a tory , sir . " " The little rebel rascals !  --  Herbert !  --  you throwing up your hat and huzzaing too ! " " Certainly , sir  --  I am a regular whig . " " A regular fool !  --  put on your hat  --  and use it like a gentleman . This matter shall be looked into  --  here are the seeds of rebellion springing up in their young hot bloods  --  this may come to something , if it is not seen to in time . Jasper , do you hear any thing of this jargon in your schools ? " " Lord bless me ! yes , sir ; the boys are regularly divided into whigs and tories  --  they have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the whigs are three to one . " " You are loyal then , my dear boy ? " " Certainly , sir , I owe allegiance to the country in which I was born . " " And you , my hopeful Mr. Herbert , with your huzzas , what say you for yourself ? " " I say ditto to Jasper , sir  --  I owe allegiance to the country in which I was born . " " Do n't be a fool , Herbert  --  do n't be a fool , even in jest  --  I hate a whig as I do a toad , and if my son should prove a traitor to his king and country , by George , I would cut him off for ever ! " " But , sir , " said the imperturbable Herbert , " if he should choose between his king and country  --  " " There is no such thing  --  they are the same  --  so no more of that . " " I am glad Herbert has his warning in time , " whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is right for all , " replied Bessie . So arbitrarily do circumstances mould opinions . Isabella seemed like one who might have been born a rebel chieftainess , Bessie as if her destiny were passive obedience . We have thus introduced some of the dramatis persone of the following volumes to our readers . It may seem that in their visit to Effie , they prematurely exhibited the sentiments of riper years  --  but what are boys and girls but the prototypes of Page 033 men and women  --  time and art may tinge and polish the wood , but the texture remains as nature formed it . Bessie Lee was an exotic in New-York . The history of her being there was simply this . New-England has , from the first been a favourite school for the youth from the middle and southern states . Mr. Linwood sent Herbert ( who had given him some trouble by early manifesting that love of self-direction which might have been the germe of his whiggism ) to a Latin school in a country town near Boston . While there , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most respectable farmer , who had acquired his title and some military fame in the campaign of forty-five against the French . Herbert remained a year with the Lees , and he returned the kindness he received there with a hearty and lasting affection . Here was his first experience of country life , and every one knows how delightful to childhood are its freedom , exercises , and pleasures , in harmony ( felt , long before understood ) with all the laws of our nature . When Herbert returned he was eloquent in his praises of Bessie  --  her beauty , gayety ( then the excitability of her disposition sometimes appeared in extravagant spirits ) , her sweetness and manageableness ; a feminine quality that he admired the more from having had to contend with a contrary disposition in his sister Isabella , who , in all their childish competitions , had manifested what our Shaker friends would call a leading gift . Isabella 's curiosity being excited to see this rara avis of Herbert ( with her the immediate consequence of an inclination was to find the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send for Bessie to come to New-York , and go to school with her . Mrs. Linwood , a model of conjugal nonentity , gave her usual reply , " just as your papa says , dear . " Her father seldom said her nay , and Isabella thought her point gained , till he referred the decision of the matter to her aunt Archer . " Oh dear ! now I shall have to argue the matter an hour ; but never mind , I can always persuade aunt at last . " Mrs. Archer , as Isabella had foreboded , was opposed to the arrangement  --  she thought there would be positive unkindness in transplanting a little girl from her own plain , frugal family , to a luxurious establishment in town , where all the refinements and elegances then known in the colony were in daily use .

" I see none , my dear , but what relates to Bessie herself . If her happiness would on the whole be diminished by her coming , you , my dear generous Belle , would not wish it .

" Isabella perceived her aunt would no longer oppose her wishes . The invitation was sent to Bessie , and accepted by her parents ; and the child 's singular beauty and loveliness secured her friends , one of the goods Isabella had predicted . She did not suffer precisely the evil consequences Mrs. Archer rationally anticipated from her residence in New-York , yet that , conspiring with events , gave the hue ( bright or sad ? ) to her after life . Physically and morally , she was one of those delicate structures that require a hardening process  --  she resembled the exquisite instrument that responds music to the gentle touches of the elements , but is broken by the first rude gust that sweeps over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all men 's lives , Figuring the nature of the times deceased ; The which observed , a man may prophesy , With a near aim , of the main chance of things , As yet not come to life . " CHAPTER II . " This life , sae far 's I understand , Is a ' enchanted fairy-land , Where pleasure is the magic wand , That , wielded right , Makes hours like minutes , hand in hand , Dance by fu ' light . "  --  Burns . As soon as Mr. Linwood became aware of his son 's whig tendencies , he determined , as far as possible , to counteract them ; and instead of sending him , as he had purposed , to Harvard University , into a district which he considered infected with the worst of plagues , he determined to retain him under his own vigilant eye , at the loyal literary institution in his own city . This was a bitter disappointment to Herbert . " It is deused hard , " he said to Jasper Meredith , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " that you , who have such a contempt for the Yankees , should go to live among them ; when I , who love and honour them from the bottom of my heart , must stay here , play the good boy , and quietly submit to this most unreasonable paternal fiat . " " No more of my contempt for the Yankees , Hal , an ' thou lovest me , " replied Jasper ; " you remember sop 's advice to Croesus at the Persian court ? " " No , I am sure I do not . You have the most provoking way of resting the lever by which you bring out your own knowledge on your friend 's ignorance . " " Pardon me , Herbert ; I was only going to remind you of the Phrygian sage 's counsel to Croesus , to speak flattery at court , or hold his tongue . I assure you , that as long as I live among these soidisant sovereigns , I shall conceal my spleen , if I do not get rid of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They need only to be seen at their homes to be admired and loved . " " Loved ! " " Yes , loved ; to tell you the truth , Jasper , " Herbert 's honest face reddened as he spoke , " it was something of this matter of loving that I have been trying for the last week to make up my mind to speak to you . You may think me fool , dunce , or what you please ; but , mark me , I am serious  --  you remember Bessie Lee ? " " Perfectly ! I understand you  --  excellent ! "  --  " Hear me out , and then laugh as much as you like . Eliot , Bessie 's brother , will be your classmate  --  you will naturally be friends  --  for he is a first-rate  --  and you will naturally  --  " " Fall in love with his pretty sister ? " " If not forewarned , you certainly would ; for there is nothing like her this side heaven . But remember , Jasper , as you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . I spoke first , ' as the children say ; I have loved Bessie ever since I lived at Westbrook . " " Upon my soul , Herbert , you have woven a pretty bit of romance . This is the very youngest dream of love I ever heard of . Pray , how old were you when you went to live at farmer Lee 's ? " " Eleven  --  Bessie was six  --  I stayed there two years ; and last year , as you know , Bessie spent with us . " " And she is now fairly entered upon her teens ; you have nothing to fear from me , Herbert , depend o n't . I never was particularly fond of children  --  there is not the slightest probability of my falling into an intimacy with your yeoman friend , or ever , in any stage of my existence , getting up a serious passion for a peasant girl . I have no affinities for birds of the basse cour . My flight is more aspiring  --  birds of a feather flock together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love must be such a one as my lady aunts in England and my eagle-eyed mother will not look down upon . So a truce to your fears , dear Herbert . Give me the letter you promised to your farmer , scholar , friend ; and rest assured , he never shall find out that I do not think him equal in blood and breeding to the King of England , as all these Yankees fancy themselves to be . " Herbert gave the letter , but not with the best grace . He did not like Jasper 's tone towards his New-England friends . He half wished he had not written the letter , and quite , that he had been more frugal of his praise of Jasper . With the letter , he gave to Jasper various love-tokens from Isabella and himself for Bessie . The young men were saying their last parting words , when Herbert suddenly exclaimed , " Oh , I forgot ! Isabella sent you a keepsake , " and he gave Jasper a silk purse , with a dove and olive-branch prettily wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed Jasper , " had you forgotten this ! " He pressed it to his lips . " Dear , dear Belle ! I kiss your olive-branch  --  we have had many a falling-out , but thus will they always end . " Then slipping a ring from his finger , on which was engraven a heart , transfixed by an arrow  --  " Beg Isabella , " he said , " to wear this for my sake . It is a pretty bauble , but she 'll not value it for that , nor because it has been worn by all our Capulets since the days of good Queen Bess , as my aunt , Lady Mary , assured me ; but perhaps she will care for it for  --  pshaw . " He dashed off an honest tear  --  a servant announced that his uncle was awaiting him , and cordially embracing Herbert , they parted . As Herbert had expected , Eliot Lee and Meredith were classmates , but not , as he predicted , or at least not immediately , did they become friends . Their circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discordant . Meredith had been bred in a luxurious establishment , and was taught to regard its artificial and elaborate arrangement as essential to the production of a gentleman . He was a citizen " of no mean city , " though we now look back upon New-York at that period , with its some eighteen or twenty thousand inhabitants , as little more than a village . There was then , resulting from the condition of America far more disparity between the facilities and refinements of town and country than there now is ; and even now there are young citizens ( and some citizens in certain illusions remain young all their lives ) who look with the most self-complacent disdain on country breeding . Prior to our revolution , the distinctions of rank in the colonies were in accordance with the institutions of the old world . The coaches of the gentry were emblazoned with their family arms , and their plate with the family crest . If peers and baronets were raroe aves , there were among the youths of Harvard " nephews of my lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These were , naturally , Meredith 's first associates . He was himself of the privileged order and , connected with many a noble family in the mother country , he felt his aristocratic blood tingle in every vein . A large property , which had devolved to him on the death of his father , was chiefly vested in real estate in America , and his guardians , with the consent of his mother , who herself remained in England , had judiciously decided to educate him where it would be most advantageous for him finally to fix his residence . The external circumstances  --  the appliances and means of the two young men , were certainly widely different . Eliot Lee 's parentage would not be deemed illustrious , according to any artificial code ; but graduated by nature 's aristocracy ( nature alone sets a seal to her patents of universal authority ) , he should rank with the noble of every land . And he might claim what is now considered as the peculiar , the purest , the enduring , and in truth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendant from one of the renowned pilgrim fathers , whose nobility , stamped in the principles that are regenerating mankind , will be transmitted by their sons on the Missouri and the Oregon , when the stars and garters of Europe have perished and are forgotten . Colonel Lee , Eliot 's father , was a laborious New-England farmer , of sterling sense and integrity  --  in the phrase of his people , " an independent , fore-handed man ; " a phrase that implies a property of four or five thousand dollars over and above a good farm , unencumbered with debts , and producing rather more than its proprietor , in his frugal mode of life , has occasion to spend . Eliot 's mother was a woman of sound mind , and of that quick and delicate perception of the beautiful in nature and action , that is the attribute of sensibility and the proof of its existence , though the possessor , like Eliot 's mother , may , from diffidence or personal awkwardness , never be able to imbody it in graceful expression . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it ; such as many of our ladies , who have been taught by a dozen masters , and instructed in half as many tongues , might well envy . With all this , she was an actual operator in the arduous labours that fall to the female department of a farming establishment  --  plain farmer Lee 's plain wife . This is not an uncommon combination of character and condition in New-England . We paint from life , if not to the life : our fault is not extravagance of colouring . It is unnecessary to enter into the details of Eliot Lee 's education . Circumstances combined to produce the happiest results  --  to develop his physical , intellectual , and moral powers ; in short , to make him a favourable specimen of the highest order of New-England character . He had just entered on his academic studies , when his father ( as our friend Effie intimated in her dark soothsaying ) was lost while crossing Massachusetts Bay during a violent thunder-storm . Fortunately , the good colonel 's forecast had so well provided for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable position of his family without recalling her son from college . There , as many of our distinguished men have done , he made his acquisitions available for his support by teaching . Meredith and Eliot Lee were soon acknowledged to be the gifted young men of their class . Though nearly equals in capacity , Eliot , being by far the most patient and assiduous , bore off the college honours . Meredith did not lack industry  --  certainly not ambition ; but he had not the hardihood and self-discipline that it requires to forego an attractive pursuit for a dry study : and while Eliot , denying his natural tastes , toiled by the midnight lamp over the roughest academic course , he gracefully ran through the light and beaten path of belles-lettres . They were both social  --  Meredith rather gay in his disposition . Both had admirable tempers ; Meredith 's was partly the result of early training in the goodly seemings of the world , Eliot 's the gift of Heaven , and therefore the more perfect . Eliot could not exist without self-respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly preferred a real to a merely apparent elevation ; but experience could alone decide whether he were willing to pay its price  --  sustained effort , and generous sacrifice . Both were endowed with personal graces . Neither man nor woman , that ever we could learn , is indifferent to these . Before the young men had proceeded far in their collegiate career they were friends , if that holy relation may be predicated of those who are united by accidental circumstances . That they were on a confidential footing will be seen by the following conversation . Meredith was in his room , when , on hearing a tap at his door , he answered it by saying , " Come in , Eliot , my dear fellow . My good , or your evil genius , has brought you to me at the very moment when I am steeped to the lips in trouble . " " You in trouble ! why  --  what is the matter ? " " Diable ! matter enough for song or sermon . Not a trouble abroad but it lights o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note from our reverend Proeses . Mr. Jasper Meredith , junior class  --  you are fined , by the proper authority , one pound ten , for going into Boston last Thursday night , to an assembly or ball , contrary to college laws  --  as this is the first offence of the kind reported against you , we have , though you have been guilty of a gross violation of known duty , been lenient in fixing the amount of your fine . '  --  Lenient , good Prses !  --  Take instead one pound ten ounces of my flesh . My purse is far leaner than my person , though that be rather of the Cassius order .  --  Now , Eliot , is not this a pretty bill for one night 's sorry amusement  --  one pound ten , besides the price of two ball tickets , and sundry confections . " " How , two ball tickets , Meredith ? " " Why , I gave one to the tailor 's pretty sister , Sally Dunn . " " Sally Dunn !  --  Bravo , Meredith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have escorted Sally Dunn to a ball . " " My service to you , Eliot !  --  do not fancy I have been enacting a scene fit for Hogarth 's idle apprentice . Were I so absurd , do you fancy these Boston patricians would admit a tailor 's sister within their taboed circle ?  --  No  --  no , little Sally went with company of her own cloth , and trimmings to match ( in her brother 's slang )  --  rosy milliners and journeyman tailors , to a ball got up by her compeers . I sent in to them lots of raisins and almonds , which served as a love-token for Sally and munching for her companions . " " You have , indeed , paid dear for your whistle , Meredith . " " Dear ! you have not heard half yet . Sir knight of the shears assailed me with a whining complaint of my paying attention , ' as he called it , to his sister Sally , and I could only get off by the gravest assurances of my profound respect for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new vest , that being the article the youth would least mar in the making , and here is his bill  --  two pounds two . This is to be added to my ball expenses , fine , &c.,; and all , as our learned professor would say , traced to the primum mobile , must be charged to pretty Sally Dunn . Oh woman ! woman !  --  ever the cause of man 's folly , perplexity , misery , and destruction ! " " You are getting pathetic , Meredith . " " My dear friend , there is nothing affects a man 's sensibilities like an empty purse  --  unless it be an empty stomach . You have not heard half my sorrows yet . Here is a bill , a yard long , from the livery-stable , and here another from Monsieur Pat et Confiture ! " " And your term-bills ? " " Oh ! my term-bills I have forwarded , with the dignity of a Sir Charles Grandison , to my uncle . Now , Eliot , " he continued , disbursing a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his empty purse , and throwing into his face an expression of mock misery , " Now , Eliot , let us resolve ourselves into a committee of ways and means , and tell me by what financial legerdemain I can get affixed to these scrawls that happiest combination of words in the English language  --  that honeyed phrase , received payment in full '  --  oh , gentle shepherd , tell me where ? ' " " Where deficits should always find supplies , Meredith , in a friend 's purse . I have just settled the account of my pedagogue labours for the last term , and as I have no extra bills to pay , I have extra means quite at your service . " Meredith protested , and with truth , that nothing was farther from his intentions than drawing on his friend ; and when Eliot persisted and counted out the amount which Meredith said would relieve his little embarrassments , he felt , and magnanimously expressed his admiration of those working-day world virtues ' ( so he called them ) , industry and frugality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the power of liberality . It is possible that , at another time , and in another humour , he might have led the laugh against the sort of barter trade  --  the selling one kind or degree of knowledge to procure another , by which a Yankee youth , who is willing to live like an anchorite or a philosopher in the midst of untasted pleasures , works his passage through college . Subsequent instances occurred of similar but temporary obligations on the part of Meredith . Temporary of course , for Meredith was too thoroughly imbued with the sentiments of a gentleman to extend a pecuniary obligation beyond the term of his necessity . CHAPTER III . Section " Hear me profess sincerely  --  had I a dozen sons , each in my love alike , I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country , than one voluptuously surfeit out of action . "  --  Shakspeare . The following extracts are from a letter from Bessie Lee to her friend Isabella Linwood . Letter " Dearest Isabella , " You must love me , or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write so delightfully about nothing , and have so much to write about , while I can tell nothing but what I see , and I see so little ! The outward world does not much interest me . It is what I feel that I think of and ponder over ; but I know how you detest what you call sentimental letters , so I try to avoid all such subjects . Compared with you I am a child  --  two years at our age makes a great difference  --  I am really very childish for a girl almost fourteen , and yet , and yet , Isabella , I sometimes seem to myself to have gone so far beyond childhood , that I have almost forgotten that careless , light-hearted feeling I used to have . I do not think I ever was so light-hearted as some children , and yet I was not serious  --  at least , not in the right way . Many a time , before I was ten years old , I have sat up in my own little room till twelve o'clock Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half through the whole sermon the next morning . I do believe it is the natural depravity of my heart . I never read over twice a piece of heathen poetry that moves me but I can repeat it  --  and yet , I never could get past what is effectual calling ? ' in the Westminster Catechism ; and I always was in disgrace on Saturday , when parson Wilson came to the school to hear us recite it :  --  oh dear , the sight of his wig and three-cornered hat petrified me ! " " Jasper Meredith is here , passing the vacation with Eliot . I was frightened to death when Eliot wrote us he was coming  --  we live in such a homely way  --  only one servant , and I remember well how he used to laugh at every thing he called la bourgeoise . I felt this to be a foolish , vulgar pride , and did my best to suppress it ; and since I have found there was no occasion for it , for Jasper seemed ( I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he used to be ) to miss nothing , and to be delighted with being here . I do not think he realizes that I am now three years older than I was in New-York , for he treats me with that sort of partiality  --  devotion you might almost call it  --  that he used to there , especially when you and he had had a falling out . He has been giving me some lessons in Italian . He says I have a wonderful talent for learning languages , but it is not so : you know what hobbling work I made with the French when you and I went to poor old Mademoiselle Amand  --  Jasper is quite a different teacher , and I never fancied French . He has been teaching me to ride , too  --  we have a nice little pony , and he has a beautiful horse  --  so that we have the most delightful gallops over the country every day . It is very odd , though I am such a desperate coward , I never feel the least timid when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it . Eliot rarely finds time to go with us  --  when he is at home from college he has so much to do for mother  --  dear Eliot , he is husband , father , brother , every thing to us . " " I had not time , while Jasper and Eliot stayed , to finish my letter , and since they went away I have been so dull !  --  The house seems like a tomb . I go from room to room , but the spirit is not here . Master Hale , the schoolmaster , boards with us , and gives me lessons in some branches that Eliot thinks me deficient in ; but ah me ! where are the talents for acquisition that Jasper commended ? Did you ever know , dear Isabella , what it was to have every thing affected by the departure of friends , as nature is by the absence of light  --  all fade into one dull uniform hue . When Eliot and Jasper were here , all was bright and interesting from the rising of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! " I am shocked to find how much I have written about myself . My best respects to your father and mother , and love to Herbert . Burn this worthless scrawl without fail , dear Isabella , and believe me ever most affectionately " Yours , " Bessie Lee . " Jasper Meredith to Herbert Linwood . " Dear Linwood , " I have been enjoying a very pretty little episode in my college life , passing the vacation at Westbrook , with your old friends the Lees . A month in a dull little country town would once have seemed to me penance enough for my worst sin , but now it is heaven to get anywhere beyond the sound of college bells  --  beyond the reach of automaton tutors  --  periodical recitations  --  chapel prayers , and college rules . " I went to the Lees with the pious intention of quizzing your rustics to the top o ' my bent ; but Herbert , my dear fellow , I 'll tell you a secret ; when people respect themselves , and value things according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our artificial and worldly estimates , and makes us feel as if we stood upon a wonderful uncertain foundation . These Lees are so strong in their simplicity  --  they would so disdain aping and imitating those that we ( not they , be sure ! ) think above them  --  they are so sincere in all their ways  --  no awkward consciousness  --  no shame-facedness whatever about the homely details of their family affairs . By heavens , Herbert , I could not find a folly  --  a meanness  --  or even a ludicrous rusticity at which to aim my ridicule . " I begin to think  --  no , no , no , I do not  --  but , if there were many such families as these Lees in the world , an equality , independent of all extraneous circumstances ( such as the politicians of this country are now ranting about ) , might subsist on the foundation of intellect and virtue . " After all , I see it is a mere illusion . Mrs. Lee 's rank , though in Westbrook she appears equal to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in your boyish memory , Herbert , you must confess she would cut a sorry figure in a New- York drawing-room . " Eliot might pass current anywhere ; but then he has had the advantage of Boston society , and an intimacy with  --  pardon my coxcombry  --  your humble servant . Bessie  --  sweet Bessie Lee , is a gem fit to be set in a coronet . Do n't be alarmed , Herbert , you are welcome to have the setting of her . There is metal , as you know , more attractive to me . Bessie is not much grown since she was in New-York  --  she is still low in stature , and so childish in her person , that I was sometimes in danger of treating her like a child  --  of forgetting that she had come within the charmed circle of proprieties . But , if she has still the freshness and immaturity of the unfolding rose-bud  --  the mystical charm of woman  --  the divinity stirring within her beams through her exquisite features . Such features ! Phidias would have copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should such a creature , all sentiment , refinement , imagination , spring up in practical , prosaic New-England ! She is a wanderer from some other star . I am writing like a lover , and not as I should to a lover . But , on my honour , Herbert , I am no lover  --  of little Bessie I mean . I should as soon think of being enamoured of a rose , a lily , or a violet , an exquisite sonnet , or an abstraction . " It is an eternity since Isabella has written me a postscript  --  why is this ? Farewell , Linwood . " Yours , &c.; " P.S.  --  One word on politics  --  a subject I detest , and meddle with as little as possible . There must be an outbreak  --  there is no avoiding it . But there can be no doubt which party will finally prevail . The mother country has soldiers , money , every thing ; ' t is odds beyond arithmetic . ' As one of my friends said at a dinner in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , but they will be whipped into submission , and wear their collars patiently for ever after . ' I trust , Herbert , you are already cured of what my uncle used to call the boy-fever '  --  but if not , take my advice  --  be quiet , prudent , neutral . As long as we are called boys , we are not expected to be patriots , apostles , or martyrs . At this crisis your filial and fraternal duties require that you should suppress , if not renounce , the opinions you used to be so fond of blurting out on all occasions . I am no preacher  --  I have done  --  a word to the wise . " M  --  . " Section We resume the extracts from Bessie 's letters . Letter " Dear Isabella ,  --  Never say another word to me of what you hinted in your last letter : indeed , I am too young ; and besides , I never should feel easy or happy again with Jasper , if I admitted such a thought . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that I believed in her  --  at least , not much ; but I have always known who was first in his thoughts  --  heart  --  opinion ; and besides , it would be folly in me , knowing his opinions about rank , &c.; Mother thinks him very proud , and somewhat vain ; and she begins not to be pleased with his frequent visits to Westbrook . She thinks  --  no , fears , or rather she imagines , that Jasper and I  --  no , that Jasper or I  --  no , that I  --  it is quite too foolish to write , Isabella  --  mother does not realize what a wide world there is between us . I might possibly , sometimes , think he loved ( this last word was carefully effaced , and cared substituted ) cared for me , if he did not know you . " How could Jasper tell you of Eliot 's prejudice against you ? Jasper himself infused it , unwittingly , I am sure , by telling him that when with you , I lived but to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swim , or dive into the fire . ' Eliot fancies that you are proud and overbearing  --  I insist , dear Isabella , that such as you are born to rule such weak spirits as mine ; but Eliot says he does not like absolutism in any form , and especially in woman 's . Ah , how differently he would feel if he were to see you  --  I am sure you would like him  --  I am not sure , even , that you would not have preferred him to Jasper , had he been born and bred in Jasper 's circumstances . He has more of some qualities that you particularly like , frankness and independence  --  and mother says ( but then mother is not at all partial to Jasper ) he has a thousand times more real sensibility  --  he does , perhaps , feel more for others . I should like to know which you would think the handsomest . Eliot is at least three inches the tallest ; and , as Jasper once said , cast in the heroic mould , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality '  --  but then Jasper has such grace and symmetry  --  just what I fancy to be the beau-ideal of the arts . Jasper 's eyes are almost too black  --  too piercing ; and yet they are softened by his long lashes , and his olive complexion , so expressive  --  like that fine old portrait in your drawing-room . His mouth , too , is beautiful  --  it has such a defined , chiselled look  --  but then do you not think that his teeth being so delicately formed , and so very , very white , is rather a defect ? I do n't know how to describe it , but there is rather an uncertain expression about his mouth . Eliot 's , particularly when he smiles , is truth and kindness itself  --  and his deep , deep blue eye , expresses every thing by turns  --  I mean every thing that should come from a pure and lofty spirit  --  now tender and pitiful enough for me , and now superb and fiery enough for you  --  but what a silly , girlish letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , ' you know ! I see nobody but Jasper and Eliot , and I think only of them . " Section We continue the extracts from Bessie 's letters . They were strictly feminine , even to their being dateless  --  we can not , therefore , ascertain the precise period at which they were written , except by their occasional allusions to contemporaneous events . Letter " Thanks , dear Isabella , for your delightful letter by Jasper  --  no longer Jasper , I assure you to his face , but Mr. Meredith  --  oh , I often wish the time back when I was a child , and might call him Jasper , and feel the freedom of a child . I wonder if I should dare to call you Belle now , or even Isabella ? Jasper , since his last visit at home , tells me so much of your being the mirror of fashion  --  the observed of all observers ' ( these are his own words  --  drawing-room terms that were never heard in Westbrook but from his lips ) , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy  --  I am too happy now to envy anybody in the wide world . Eliot is at home , and Jasper is passing a week here . Is it not strange they should be so intimate , when they differ so widely on political topics ? I suppose it is because Jasper does not care much about the matter ; but this indifference sometimes provokes Eliot . Jasper is very intimate with Pitcairn and Lord Percy ; and Eliot thinks they have more influence with him than the honour and interest of his country . Oh , they talk it over for hours and hours , and end , as men always do with their arguments , just where they began . Jasper insists that as long as the quarrel can be made up it is much wisest to stand aloof , and not , like mad boys , to rush foremost into the first fray ; ' besides , he says he is tied by a promise to his uncle that he will have nothing to do with these agitating disputes till his education is finished . Mother says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very easy and prudent to bind your hands with a promise when you do not choose to lift them . " Ah , there is a terrible storm gathering ! Those who have grown up together , lovingly interlacing their tender branches , must be torn asunder  --  some swept away by the current , others dispersed by the winds . " Letter " Dear Isabella ,  --  The world seems turned upside down since I began this letter  --  war ( war , what an appalling sound ) has begun  --  blood has been spilt , and our dear , dear Eliot  --  but I must tell you first how it all was . Eliot and Jasper were out shooting some miles from Cambridge , when , on coming to the road , they perceived an unusual commotion  --  old men and young , and even boys , all armed , in wagons , on horseback , and on foot , were coming from all points , and all hurrying onward in one direction . On inquiring into the hurly-burly , they were told that Colonel Smith had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that our people were gathering from all quarters to oppose his return . Eliot immediately joined them , Jasper did not ; but , dear Isabella , I that know you so well , know , whatever others may think , that tories may be true and noble . There was a fight at Lexington . Our brave men had the best of it . Eliot was the first to bring us the news . With a severe wound in his arm , he came ten miles that we need not be alarmed by any reports , knowing , as he told mother , that she was no Spartan mother , to be indifferent whether her son came home with his shield or on his shield . " Jasper has not been to Westbrook since the battle . My mind has been in such a state of alarm since , I can not return to my ordinary pursuits . I was reading history with the children , and the English poets with mother , but I am quite broken up .

Write soon , dear Isabella , and let me know if this hurly-burly extends to New-York  --  dear , quiet New-York ! In war and in peace , in all the chances and changes of this mortal life , your own Bessie Lee . " Letter Miss Linwood to Bessie Lee . " Exempts ! my little spirit of peace  --  your vocation it may be , my pretty dove , to sit on your perch with an olive-branch in your bill , but not mine . Oh for the glorious days of the Clorindas , when a woman might put down her womanish thoughts , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why was the loyal spirit of my race my exclusive patrimony ? Can his blood , who at his own cost raised a troop of horse for our martyr king , flow in Herbert 's veins ? or his who followed the fortunes of the unhappy James ? Is my father 's son a renegado  --  a rebel ? Yes , Bessie  --  my blood burns in my cheeks while I write it . Herbert , the only male scion of the Linwoods  --  my brother  --  our pride  --  our hope has declared himself of the rebel party  --  Ichabod , Ichabod , the glory is departed , is written on our door-posts . ' " But to come down from my heroics ; we are in a desperate condition  --  such a scene as I have just passed through ! Judge Ellis was dining with us , Jasper Meredith was spoken of . In the name of Heaven , Ellis , ' said my father , why do you suffer your nephew to remain among the rebel crew in that infected region ? ' " I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that any region is free from infection . ' " True , true , ' said my father ; but the air of the Yankee states is saturated with it . I would not let an infant breathe it , lest rebellion should break out when he came to man 's estate . ' I am sorry to say it , dear Bessie ; but my father traces Herbert 's delinquency to his sojourn at Westbrook . I saw a tempest was brewing , and thinking to make for a quiet harbour , I put in my oar , and repeated the story you told me in your last letter of our noncombatant , Mr. Jasper . The judge was charmed . Ah , he 's a prudent fellow ! ' he said ; he 'll not commit himself ! ' " Not commit himself ! ' exclaimed my father ; by Jupiter , if he belonged to me , he should commit himself . I would rather he should jump the wrong way than sit squat like a toad under a hedge , till he was sure which side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bessie , my father 's words implied something like a commendation of Herbert . I ventured to look up  --  their eyes met  --  I saw a beam of pleasure flashing from them , and passing like an electric spark from one heart to another . Oh , why should this unholy quarrel tear asunder such true hearts ! " The judge 's pride was touched  --  he is a mean wretch . Ah , my dear sir , ' he said , it is very well for you , who can do it with impunity , to disregard prudential considerations ; for instance , you remain true to the king , the royal power is maintained , and your property is protected . Your son  --  I suppose a case  --  your son joins the rebels , the country is revolutionized , and your property is secured as the reward of Mr. Herbert 's patriotism . ' " My father hardly heard him out . Now , by the Lord that made me ! ' he exclaimed , setting down the decanter with a force that broke it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would taste a crumb of bread that was the reward of rebellion . ' " It was a frightful moment ; but my father 's passion , you know , is like a whirlwind ; one gust , and it is over ; and mamma is like those short-stemmed flowers that lie on the earth ; no wind moves her . So , though the judge was almost as much disconcerted as the decanter , it seemed all to have blown over , while mamma , as in case of any ordinary accident , was directing Jupe to remove the fragments , change the cloth , etc . But alas ! the evil genius of our house triumphed ; for even a bottle of our oldest Madeira , which is usually to my father like oil to the waves , failed to preserve tranquillity . The glasses were filled , and my father , according to his usual custom , gave the king  --  God bless him . ' " Now you must know , though he would not confess he made any sacrifice to prudence , he has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pretext or other , such as he had a headache , or he had dined out the day before , or expected to the day after ; and thus Herbert has escaped the test . But now the toast was given , and Herbert 's glass remained untouched , while he sat , not biting , but literally devouring his nails . I saw the judge cast a sinister look at him , and then a glance at my father . The storm was gathering on my father 's brow . Herbert , my son , ' said mamma , you will be too late for you appointment . ' Herbert moved his chair to rise , when my father called out , Stop , sir  --  no slinking away under your mother 's shield  --  hear me  --  no man who refuses to drink that toast at my table shall eat of my bread or drink of my wine . ' " Then God forgive me  --  for I never will drink it  --  so help me Heaven ! ' " Herbert left the room by one door  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fixture of a judge , and I ran to my room , where , as soon as I had got through with a comfortable fit of crying , I sat down to write you ( who are on the enemy 's side ) an account of the matter . What will come of it , Heaven only knows ! " But , my dear little gentle Bessie , I never think of you as having any thing to do with these turbulent matters ; you are in the midst of fiery rebel spirits , but you are too pure , too good to enter into their counsels , and far too just for any self-originating prejudices , such as this horrible one that pervades the country , and fires New-England against the legitimate rights of the mother country over her wayward , ungrateful child . Do n't trouble your head about these squabbles , but cling to Master Hale , your poetry , and history : by-the-way , I laughed heartily that you , who have done duty  --  reading so virtuously all your life , should now come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a note in Herodotus , the most picturesque of historians , the other day that charmed me . The writer of the note says there is no mention whatever of Cyrus in the Persian history . If history then is mere fiction , why may we not read romances of our own choosing ? My instincts have not misguided me , after all . " So , Miss Bessie , Jasper Meredith is in high favour with you , and the friend of your nonpareil brother . Jasper could always be irresistible when he chose , and he seems to have been i ' the vein ' at Westbrook . With all our impressions ( are they prejudices , Bessie ? ) against your Yankee land , we thought him excessively improved by his residence among you . Indeed , I think if he were never to get another letter from his worldly icicle mother , to live away from his time-serving uncle , and never receive another importation of London coxcombries , he would be what nature intended him  --  a paragon . " I love your sisterly enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the accidents of birth and fortune , indeed , you were not true to your friend when you intimated that . Certainly , the views you tell me he takes of my character are not particularly flattering , or even conciliating . However , I have my revenge  --  you paint him en beau  --  the portrait is too beautiful to be very like any man born and reared within the disenchanted limits of New-England . I am writing boldly , but no offence , dear Bessie ; I do not know your brother , and I have  --  yes , out with it , with the exception of your precious little self  --  I have an antipathy to the New-Englanders  --  a disloyal race , and conceited , fancying themselves more knowing in all matters , high and low , especially government and religion , than the rest of the world  --  all-sufficient , self-sufficient , and insufficient . ' " Pardon me , gentle Bessie  --  I am just now at fever heat , and I could not like Gabriel if he were whig and rebel . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard these detestable words ; and once truly loving , especially if our hearts be knit together by nature , I think the faults of the subject do not diminish our affection , though they turn it from its natural sweet uses to suffering . " Letter " Dear Bessie ,  --  A week  --  a stormy , miserable week has passed since I wrote the above , and it has ended in Herbert 's leaving us , and dishonouring his father 's name by taking a commission in the rebel service . Papa has of course had a horrible fit of the gout . He says he has for ever cast Herbert out of his affections . Ah ! I am not skilled in metaphysics , but I know that we have no power whatever over our affections . Mamma takes it all patiently , and chiefly sorroweth for that Herbert has lost caste by joining the insurgents , whom she thinks little better than so many Jack Cades . " For myself , I would have poured out my blood  --  every drop of it , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my secret heart I glory in him that he has honestly and boldly clung to his opinions , to his own certain and infinite loss . I have no heart to write more . " Yours truly , " Isabella Linwood . " P.S.  --  You may show the last paragraph ( confidentially ) to Jasper ; but do n't let him know that I wished him to see it . I. L. " CHAPTER IV . Section " An ' forward , though I canna see , I guess an ' fear . "  --  Burns . Three years passed over without any marked change in the external condition of our young friends . Herbert Linwood endured the hardships of an American officer during that most suffering period of the war , and remained true to the cause he had adopted , without any of those opportunities of distinction which are necessary to keep alive the fire of ordinary patriotism . It has been seen that Eliot Lee , with most of the young men of the country ( as might be expected from the insurgent and generous spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought not to have been expected , that when the young country came to the muscle and vigour of manhood , it should continue to wear the leading-strings of its childhood , or remain in the bondage and apprenticeship of its youth . It has been justly said , that the seeds of our revolution and future independence were sown by the Pilgrims . The political institutions of a people may be inferred from their religion . Absolutism , as a mirror , reflects the Roman Catholic faith . Whatever varieties of names were attached to the religious sects of America , they were , with the exception of a few Pepists , all Protestants  --  all , as Burke said of them , " agreed ( if agreeing in nothing else ) in the communion of the spirit of liberty  --  theirs was the Protestantism of the Protestant religion  --  the dissidence of dissent . " It was morally certain , that as soon as they came to man 's estate , their government would accord with this spirit of liberty ; would harmonize with the independent and republican spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted . The fires of our republic were not then kindled by a coal from the old altars of Greece and Rome , whose freest government exalted the few , and retained the many in grovelling ignorance and servitude : ours came forth invincible in the declaration of liberty to all , and equality of rights . Such minds as Eliot Lee 's , reasoning and religious , were not so much moved by the sudden impulses of enthusiasm as incited by the convictions of duty . His heart was devoted to his country , his thoughts absorbed in her struggle ; but he quenched , or rather smothered his intense desire to go forth with her champions , and remained pursuing his legal studies , near enough to his home to perform his paramount but obscure duty to his widowed mother and her young family . Jasper Meredith 's political preferences , if not proclaimed , were easily guessed . It was obvious that his tastes were aristocratic and feudal  --  his sympathies with the monarch , not with the people . New-York was the headquarters of the British army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretext of keeping his nephew out of the way of the seductions of a very gay society , advised him to pursue the study of the law in New-England , and thus for a while he avoided pledging himself . He resided in Boston or its vicinity , never far from Westbrook . He had a certain eclat in the drawing-rooms of Boston , but he was no favourite there . A professed neutrality was , if not suspicious , most offensive in the eyes of neck-or-nothing patriots . But Meredith did not escape the whisper that his neutrality was a mere mask . His accent , which was ambitiously English , was criticised , and his elaborate dress , manufactured by London artists , was particularly displeasing to the sons of the Puritans , who , absorbed in great objects , were then more impatient even than usual of extra sacrifices to the graces . The transition from Boston to Westbrook was delightful to Meredith . There was no censure of any sort , but balm for the rankling wounds of vanity ; and it must be confessed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than elsewhere : the best parts of his nature were called forth ; he was ( if we may desecrate a technical expression ) in the exercise of grace . There is a certain moral atmosphere , as propitious to moral wellbeing as a genial temperature is to health . Vanity has a sort of thermometer , which enables the possessor to graduate and adapt himself to the dispositions , the vanities ( is there any gold in nature without this alloy ? ) of others . Meredith , when he wished to be so , was eminently agreeable . Those always stand in a most fortunate light who vary the monotony of a village existence , and he broke like a sunbeam through the dull atmosphere that hung over West-brook . He brought the freshest news , he studied good Mrs. Lee 's partialities and prejudices , and ( without her being aware of their existence ) accommodated himself to them . He supplied to Eliot what all social beings hanker after , companionship with one of his own age , pursuits , and associations . The magnet that drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in love with Bessie Lee . She was too spiritual a creature for one of earth 's mould ; but his self-love , his ruling passion , was flattered by her . He saw and enjoyed ( what , alas ! no one else then saw ) his power over her . He saw it in the mutations of her cheek , in the kindling of her eye , in the changes of her voice . It was as if an angel had left his sphere to incense him . Meredith must be acquitted of a deliberate attempt to insnare her affections . He thought not and cared not for the future . He cared only for a present selfish gratification . A ride at twilight or a walk by moonlight with this creature , all beauty , refinement , and tenderness , was a poetic passage to him  --  to her it was fraught with life or death . Poor Bessie ! she should have been hardened for the changing climate of this rough world ; but by a fatal , but very common error , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant . " She has such delicate health ! she is so different from my other children ! " said the mother .  --  " She is so gentle and sensitive , " said the brother . And thus , with all their sound judgment , instead of submitting her to a hardening process , it seemed an instinct with them , by every elaborate contrivance , to fence her from the ordinary trials and evils of life . Only when she was happy did they let her alone ; with Meredith she seemed happy , and they were satisfied . Bessie shared this unfounded tranquillity , arising with them partly from confidence in Meredith , and partly from the belief that she was in no danger of suffering from an unrequited love ; but Bessie 's arose from the most childlike ignorance of that study puzzling to the wisest and craftiest  --  the human heart . She was the most modest and unexacting of human creatures  --  her gentle spirit urged no rights  --  asked nothing , expected nothing beyond the present moment . The worshipper was satisfied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed a conviction that a disparity of birth and condition was an impassable gulf . It was natural enough that she should have imbibed this opinion ; for , being a child , the aristocratic opinions of the society she was in were expressed , unmitigated by courtesy ; they sunk deep in her susceptible mind , a mind too humble to aspire above any barrier that nature or society had set up . There was another foundation of her fancied security . This was shaken by the following conversation :  --  Meredith was looking over an old pocketbook , when a card dropped from it on the floor at Bessie 's feet : she handed it to him  --  he smiled as he looked at it , and held it up before her . She glanced her eye over it , and saw it was a note of the date of their visit to the soothsayer Effie , and of Effie 's prediction in relation to the " dark curling hair . " " I had totally forgotten this , " said he , carelessly . " Forgotten it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too truly her feelings . " Certainly I had  --  and why not , pray ? " " Oh , because  --  " she hesitated . " Because what , Bessie ? " Bessie was ashamed of her embarrassment , and faltering the more the more she tried to shake it off , she said , " I did not suppose you could forget any thing that concerned Isabella . " " Upon my honour , you are very much mistaken ; I have scarcely thought of Effie and her trumpery prediction since we were there . " " Why have you preserved the card , then , Jasper ? " asked Bessie , in all simplicity . Jasper 's complexion was not of the blushing order , or he would have blushed as he replied , at the same time replacing the card  --  " Oh , Lord , I do n't know ! accident  --  the card got in here among these old memoranda and receipts , trivial fond records ' all ! " " There preserve it , " said Bessie , " and we will look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When  --  as it surely will be , the prediction is verified . " " If not till then , " he said , " it will never again see the light  --  this is the oddest fancy of yours , " he added . " Not fancy , but faith . " " Faith most unfounded  --  why , Bessie , Isabella and I were always quarrelling . " " And always making up . Do you ever quarrel now , Jasper ? " " Oh , she is still of an April temper ; but I "  --  he looked most tenderly at Bessie  --  " have lived too much of late in a serene atmosphere to bear well her fitful changes . " A long time had passed since Bessie had mentioned Isabella to Meredith . She knew not why , but she had felt a growing reluctance to advert to her friend even in thought ; and she was now conscious of a thrilling sensation at the careless , cold manner in which Jasper spoke of her . It seemed as if a load had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has at length caught a glimpse of what seems distant land , and is name=f345-071Page image - Page 074. bewildered with new sensations , and uncertain whether it be land or not . She was conscious Jasper 's eye was on hers , though her own was downcast . She longed to escape from that burning glance , and was relieved by a bustle in the next room , and her two little sisters running in , one holding up a long curling tress of her own beautiful hair , and crying out  --  " Did not you give this to me , Bessie ? " " Is not it mine ? " said the competitor . " No , it is mine ! " exclaimed Jasper , snatching it , and holding it beyond their reach . The girls laughed , and were endeavouring to regain it , when he slipped a ring from his finger , and set it rolling on the floor , saying , " The hair is mine  --  the ring belongs to whoever gets it . " The ring , obedient to the impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children eagerly followed , he shut the door after them , and repeated , kissing the lock of hair  --  " It is mine  --  is it not ? " " Oh , no  --  no , Jasper  --  give it to me , " cried Bessie , excessively confused . " You will not give it to me !  --  well  --  a fair exchange is no robbery , ' " and taking the scissors from Bessie 's workbox , he cut off one of his own luxuriant dark locks , and offered it to her . She shook her head . " That is unkind  --  most unfriendly , Bessie "  --  he paused a moment , and then , still holding both locks , he extended the ends to Bessie , and asked her if she could tie a true love-knot . Bessie 's heart was throbbing ; she was frightened at her own emotion ; she was afraid of betraying it ; and she tied the knot as the natural thing for her to do . " There is but one altar for such a sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting it into his bosom , when Bessie snatched it from him , burst into tears , and left the room . After this , there was a change in Bessie 's manners  --  her spirits became unequal , she was nervous and restless  --  Meredith , in the presence of observers , was measured and cautious to the last degree in his attentions to her  --  when however they were alone together , though not a sentence might be uttered that a lawyer could have tortured into a special plea , yet his words were fraught with looks and tones that carried them to poor Bessie 's heart with a power that can not be imagined by those " Who have ceased to hear such , or ne'er heard . " It was about this period that Meredith wrote the following reply to a letter from his mother . Letter " You say , my dear madam , that you have heard certain reports about me , which you are not willing to believe , and yet can not utterly discredit . ' You say , also , that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those liaisons that are advised by Lord Chesterfield , and others of your friends , yet you see no harm in ' loverlike attentions to young persons in inferior stations ; they serve ' you add , to keep alive and cultivate that delicate finesse so essential to the success of a man of the world , and , provided they have no immoral purpose , are quite innocent , ' as the object of them must know there is an impassable gulf between her and her superiors in rank , and is therefore responsible for her mistakes . ' I have been thus particular in echoing your words , that I may assure you my conduct is in conformity to their letter and spirit . Tranquillize yourself , my dear madam . There is nothing , in any little fooleries I may be indulging in , to disquiet you for a moment . The person in question is a divine little creature  --  quite a prodigy for this part of the world , where she lives in a seclusion almost equal to that of Prospero 's isle ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that e'er she saw , ' it would not be to marvel at if he should be the first that e'er she loved '  --  and if I am , it is my destiny  --  my conscience is quite easy  --  I never have committed myself , nor ever shall : time and absence will soon dissipate her illusions . She is an unaspiring little person , quite aware of the gulf , as you call it , between us . She believes that even if I were lover and hero enough to play the Leander and swim it , my destiny is fixed on the other side . I have no distrust of myself , and I beg you will have none ; I am saved from all responsibility as to involving the happiness of this lily of the valley , by her very clear-sighted mother , and her sage of a brother , her natural guardians . " It is yet problematical whether , as you suppose , a certain lady 's fortune will be made by the apostacy of her disinherited brother . If the rebels win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscated , or transferred to the rebel heir . But all that is in futuro  --  fortune is a fickle goddess ; we can only be sure of her present favours and deserve the future by our devotion . " With profound gratitude and affection , " Yours , my dear mother , " J. Meredith . " P. S.  --  My warmest thanks for the inestimable box , which escaped the sea and land harpies , and came safe to hand . The Artois buckle is a chef d'oeuvre , worthy the inventive genius of the royal count whose taste rules the civilized world . The scarlet frock-coat , with its unimitated , if not inimitable , capes , does credit ( as friend Rivington would say in one of his flashy advertisements ) to the most elegant operator of Leicester-fields . ' I must reserve it till I go to New-York , where they always take the lead in this sort of civilization  --  the boys would mob me if I wore it in Boston . The umbrella , a rare invention ! is a curiosity here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers . Novelty as it is , I venture to spread it here , as its utility commends it to these rationalists , who reason about an article of dress as they would concerning an article of faith . " Once more , your devoted son , M. " Section Meredith 's conscience was easy ! " He had not committed himself ! "  --  Ah , let man beware how he wilfully or carelessly perverts and blinds God 's vicegerent , conscience . Meredith was suddenly recalled to New-York , and Bessie Lee was left to ponder on the past , and weave the future of shattered faith and blighted hopes . The scales fell too late from the eyes of her mother and brother . They reproached themselves , but never poor Bessie . They hoped that time , operating on her gentle , unresisting temper , would restore her serenity . She , like a stricken deer , took refuge under the shadow of their love , she was too affectionate , too generous , to resign herself to wretchedness without an effort . She wasted her strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER V. " I , considering how honour would become such a person , was pleased to let him seek danger , where he was like to find fame . " Shakspeare . Another sorrow soon overtook poor Bessie ; but now she had a right to feel , and might express all she felt , and look full in the face of her friends for sympathy , for they shared the burden with her . In the year 1778 , letters were sent by General Washington to the governors of the several states , earnestly entreating them to re-enforce the army . The urgency of this call was acknowledged by every patriotic individual ; and never did heart more joyously leap than Eliot Lee 's , when his mother said to him  --  " My son , I have long had misgivings about keeping you at home ; but last night , after reading the general 's letter , I could not sleep ; I felt for him , for the country ; my conscience told me you ought to go , Eliot ; even the images of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should stay with us , rose up against me : we should pay our portion for the privileges they are to enjoy . I have made up my mind to it , and on my knees I have given you to my country . The widow 's son , " she continued , clearing her voice , " is something more than the widow 's mite , Eliot ; but I have given you up , and now I have done with feelings  --  nothing is to be said or thought of but how we shall soonest and best get you ready . " Eliot was deeply affected by his mother 's decision , voluntary and unasked ; but he did not express his satisfaction , his delight , till he ascertained that she had well considered the amount of the sacrifice and was willing to meet it . Then he confessed that nothing but a controlling sense of his filial duty had enabled him to endure loitering at the fireside , when his country needed the aid he withheld . The decision made , no time was lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in less than a week Eliot was ready for his departure . It was a transparent morning , late in autumn , in bleak , wild , fitful , poetic November . The vault of heaven was spotless ; a purple light danced over the mountain summits ; the mist was condensed in the hollows of the hills , and wound them round like drapery of silver tissue . The smokes from the village chimneys ascended through the clear atmosphere in straight columns ; the trees on the mountains , banded together , still preserved a portion of their summer wealth , though now faded to dun and dull orange , marked and set off by the surrounding evergreens . Here and there a solitary elm stood bravely up against the sky , every limb , every stem defined ; a naked form , showing the beautiful symmetry that had made its summer garments hang so gracefully . Fruits and flowers , even the hardy ones that venture on the frontiers of winter , had disappeared from the gardens ; the seeds had dropped from their cups ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nature was stamped with the signet seal of autumn , memory and hope . Eliot had performed the last provident offices for his mother ; every thing about her cheerful dwelling had the look of being kindly cared for . The strawberry-beds were covered , the raspberries neatly trimmed out , the earth well spaded and freshly turned ; no gate was off its hinges , no fence down , no window unglazed , no crack unstopped . A fine black saddle-horse , well equipped , was at the door . Little Fanny Lee stood by him , patting him , and laying her head , with its shining flaxen locks , to his side  --  " Rover , " she said , with a trembling voice , " be a good Rover  --  wo n't you ? and when the naughty regulars come , canter off with Eliot as fast as you can . " " Hey ! that 's fine ! " retorted her brother , a year younger than herself . " No , no , Rover , canter up to them , and over them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail on them , Rover . " " Oh , Sam ! how awful ; would you have Eliot killed ? " " No , indeed , but I had rather he 'd come deused near it than to have him a coward . " " Do n't talk so loud , Sam  --  Bessie will hear you . " But the young belligerant was not to be silenced . He threw open the " dwelling-room " door , to appeal to Eliot himself . The half-uttered sentence died away on his lips . He entered the apartment , Fanny followed ; they gently closed the door , drew their footstools to Eliot 's feet , and quietly sat down there . How instinctive is the sympathy of children ! how plain , and yet how delicate its manifestations ! Bessie was sitting beside her brother , her head on his shoulder , and crying as if her heart went out with every sob . The youngest boy , Hal , sat on Eliot 's knee , with one arm around his neck , his cheek lying on Bessie 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so . The good mother had arrived at that age when grief rather congeals the spirit than melts it . Her lips were compressed , her eyes tearless , and her movements tremulous . She was busying herself in the last offices , doing up parcels , taking last stitches , and performing those services that seem to have been assigned to women as safety-valves for their ever effervescing feelings . A neat table was spread with ham , bread , sweetmeats , cakes , and every delicacy the house afforded  --  all were untasted . Not a word was heard except such broken sentences as " Come , Bessie , I will promise to be good if you will to be happy ! " " Eliot , how easy for you  --  how impossible for me ! " " Dear Bessie , do be firmer , for mother 's sake . For ever ! oh no , my dear sister , it will not be very long before I return to you ; and while I am gone , you must be every thing to mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eliot  --  and now  --  " " Bessie , my dear child , hush  --  you have been  --  you always will be a blessing to me . Do n't put any anxious thoughts into Eliot 's mind  --  we shall do very well without him . " " Noble , disinterested mother ! " trembled on Eliot 's lips ; but he suppressed words that might imply reproach to Bessie . The sacred scene was now broken in upon by some well-meaning but untimely visiters . Eliot 's approaching departure had created a sensation in Westbrook ; the good people of that rustic place not having arrived at the refined stage in the progress of society , when emotion and fellow-feeling are not expressed , or expressed only by certain conventional forms . First entered Master Hale , with Miss Sally Ryal . Master Hale " hoped it was no intrusion ; " and Miss Sally answered , " by no means ; she had come to lend a helping hand , and not to intrude "  --  whereupon she bustled about , helped herself and her companion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lee assumed a more tranquil mien ; poor Bessie suppressed her sobs , and withdrew to a window , and Eliot tried to look composed and manly . The children , like springs relieved from a pressure , reverted to their natural state , dashed off their tears , and began whispering among themselves . Miss Sally produced from her workbag a comforter for Mr. Eliot , of her own knitting , which she " trusted would keep out the cold and rheumatism : " and she was kindly showing him how to adjust it , when she spied a chain of braided hair around his neck  --  " Ah , ha , Mr. Eliot , a love-token ! " she exclaimed . " Yes , it is , " said little Fanny , who was watching her proceedings ; " Bessie and I cut locks of hair from all the children 's heads and mother 's , and braided it for him ; and I guess it will warm his bosom more than your comforter will , Miss Sally . " It was evident , from the look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed " so too ; but he nevertheless received the comforter graciously , hinting , that a lady who had been able to protect her own bosom from the most subtle enemy , must know how to defend another 's from common assaults . Miss Sally hemmed , looked at Master Hale , muttered something of her not always having been invulnerable ; and finally succeeded in recalling to Eliot 's recollection a tradition of a love-passage between Miss Sally and the pedagogue . A little girl now came trotting in , with " grandmother 's love , and a vial of her mixture for Mr. Eliot  --  good against camp-distemper and the like . " Eliot received the mixture as if he had all grandmother 's faith in it , slipped a bright shilling into the child 's hand for a keepsake , kissed her rosy cheek , and set her down with the children . Visiters now began to throng . One man in a green old age , who had lost a leg at Bunker 's Hill , came hobbling in , and clapping Eliot on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This is what I wanted to see your father 's son a-doing : I 'd go too , if the rascals had left me both my legs . Cheer up , widow , and thank the Lord you 've got such a son to offer up to your country  --  the richer the gift , the better the giver , you know ; but I do n't wonder you feel kind o ' qualmish at the thoughts of losing the lad . Come , Master Hale , ca n't you say something ? A little bit of Greek , or Latin , or ' most any thing , to keep up their sperits at the last gasp , as it were . " " I was just going to observe , Major Avery , to Mrs. Lee , respecting our esteemed young friend , Mr. Eliot , that I , who have known him from the beginning , as it were , having taught him his alphabet , which may be said to be the first round of the ladder of learning ( which he has mounted by my help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am , to mend my figure ) the poles that support all the rounds ; having had , as I observed , a primordial acquaintance with him , I can testify that he is worthy every honourable adjective in the language , and we have every reason to hope that his future tense will be as perfect as his past . " " Wheugh ! " exclaimed the major , " a pretty long march you have had through that speech ! " The good schoolmaster , quite unruffled , proceeded to offer Eliot a time-worn Virgil ; and finished by expressing his hopes that " he would imitate Csar in maintaining his studies in the camp , and keep the scholar even-handed with the soldier . " Eliot charmed the old pedagogue , by assuring him that he should be more apt at imitating Csar 's studies than his soldiership , and himself bestowed Virgil in his portmanteau . A good lady now stepped forth , and seeming somewhat scandalized that , as she said , " no serious truth had been spoken at this peculiar season , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stockings , into which she had wrought St. Paul 's description of the gospel armour . " The Scripture , " she feared , " did not often find its way to the camp ; and she thought a passage might be blessed , as a single kernel of wheat , even sowed among tares , sometimes produced its like . " Eliot thanked her , said " it was impossible to have too much of the best thing in the world ; but he hoped she would have less solicitude about him , when he assured her that his mother had found place for a pocket Bible in his portmanteau . " A meek-looking creature now stole up to Mrs. Lee , and putting a roll of closely-compressed lint. into her hand , said , " tuck it in with his things , Miss Lee . Do n't let it scare you  --  I trust he will dress other people 's wounds , not his own , with it .  --  My ! that will come natural to him . It 's made from the shirt Mr. Eliot stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam , that time he was scalt . Mr. Eliot was a boy then , but he has the same heart now . " Mrs. Lee dropped a tear on the lint , as she stowed it away in the closely-packed portmanteau . " There comes crazy Anny ! " exclaimed the children ; and a woman appeared at the door , scarcely past middle age , carrying in her hand a pole , on which she had tied thirteen strips of cloth of every colour , and stuck them over with white paper stars . Her face was pale and weatherworn , and her eye sunken , but brilliant with the wild flashing light that marks insanity . The moment her eye fell on Eliot , her imagination was excited  --  " Glory to the Lord ! " she cried  --  " glory to the Lord ! A leader hath come forth from among my people ! Go on , Eliot Lee , and we will gird thee about with the prayers of the widow and the blessings of the childless ! This is comfort ! But you could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angel that time you was sent to me with the news the boys was shot . I remember you shed tears , and it seemed to me there was a hissing in here ( she put her hand on her head ) as they fell . My eyes were dry  --  I did not shed one tear , though the doctor bid me . I cried them all out when he ( she advanced to Eliot , and lowered her voice ) , the grand officer in the reg'lars , you know , decoyed away my poor Susy , the prettiest and kindest creature that ever went into Westbrook meeting ; fair as Bessie Lee , and far more plump and rosy  --  to be sure Susy was but a servant-girl , but  --  " she raised her voice to a shriek , " I shall never lay down my head in peace till they are all driven into the salt sea , where my Susy was buried . " " We 'll drive them all there , " said Eliot , soothingly , laying his hand on her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  now be quiet , and go home , Anny . " " Yes , sir  --  thank you , sir ,  --  yes , sir ! " said she , calmed and courtesying again and again  --  " oh , I forgot , Mr. Eliot ! " she drew from her bosom an old rag , in which she had tied some kernels of butter-nuts  --  " give my duty to General Washington , and give him these butternut meats  --  it 's all I have to send him  --  I did give him my best  --  they were nice boys , for all  --  wer' n't they , Bob and Pete ? " And whimpering and trailing her banner after her , the poor bereft creature left the house . A loud official rap was heard at the door , and immediately recognised as the signal of the minister 's ister 's approach . We must claim indulgence while we linger for a moment with this reverend divine , for the race of which he was an honoured member is fast disappearing from our land . Peace be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestioned equality of rights , of anti-monopolies , of free publishing and freer thinking , of universal suffrage , of steam-engines , rail-roads , and spinning-jennies ,  --  all indirect contrivances to raze those fortunate eminences , by mounting which little men became great , and lorded it over their fellows : but peace be with them ! How should they have known ( till it began to tremble under them ) that the height on which they stood was an artificial , not a natural elevation . They preached equality in Heaven , but little thought it was the kingdom to come on earth . They were the electric chain , unconscious of the celestial fire they transmitted . We would give them honour due ; and to them belongs the honour of having been the zealous champions of their country 's cause , and of having fought bravely with the weapons of the church militant . Our good parson Wilson was an Apollo " in little ; " being not more than five feet four in height , and perfectly well made ,  --  a fact of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article of his apparel , even to his long blue yarn stockings , drawn over the knee , and kept sleek by the well-turned leg , without the aid of garters . On entering Mrs. Lee 's parlour , he gave his three-cornered hat , gold-headed cane , and buck-skin-gloves to little Fanny , who , with the rest of the children , had at his approach slunk into a corner ( they need not , for never was there a kinder heart than parson Wilson 's , though somewhat in the position of vitality enclosed in a petrefaction ) , and then giving a general bow to the company , he went to the glass , took a comb from his waistcoat-pocket , and smoothed his hair to an equatorial line around his forehead ; he then crossed the room to Mrs. Lee with some commonplace consolation on his lips ; but the face of the mother spoke too eloquently , and he was compelled to turn away , wipe his eyes , and clear his throat , before he could recover his official composure . " Mr. Eliot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel of peace , I heartily approve your going forth in the present warfare , for surely it is lawful to defend that which is our own ; no man has a right to that for which he did not labour ; to cities which he built not ; to olive-yards and vineyards which he planted not . " " I do n't know about olive-yards and vineyards , " interposed the major , " never having seen such things ; but I 'm thinking we can eat our corn and potatoes without their help that have neither planted nor gathered them . " The parson gave an acquiescent nod to the major 's emendation of his text , and proceeded :  --  " I have wished , my young friend , to strengthen you in the righteous cause in which you are taking up arms ; and , to that end , besides the prayers which I shall daily offer for you and yours at the throne of divine grace , I have made up a book for you ( here he tendered a package , large enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of extracts selected from three thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven sermons , preached on the Sabbaths throughout my ministry of forty-eight years , besides occasional discourses for peace and war , thanksgivings and fasts , associations and funerals . As you will often be out of reach of preaching privileges , I have provided here a word in season for every occasion , which I trust you may find both teaching and refreshing after a weary day 's service . " Eliot received the treasure with suitable expressions of gratitude . The good man continued :  --  " I could not , my friends , do this for another ; but you know that , speaking after the manner of men , we look upon this dear youth as the pride and glory of our society . " " And I 'm thinking , reverend sir , " said the major , with that tone of familiarity authorized by age ( but stared at by the children ) , " I 'm thinking you 'll not be called on again for a like service ; for after Eliot Lee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call a man in the parish . To begin with yourself , reverend sir ; you 've never been a fighting character , which I take to be , humanly speaking , a necessary part of a man ; then there 's myself , minus a leg ; and Master Hale here , who  --  I respect you for all , Master Hale  --  never was born to be handy with a smarter weapon than a ferule ; then comes blind Billy , and limping Harris , and , to bring up the rear , Deacon Allen and the doctor . " Here the major chuckled : " They both say they would join the army if ' t was not as it is ; but they have been dreadful near-sighted since the war broke out . That 's all of mankind , ' as you may say , that 's left in the bounds of Westbrook . Oh , I forgot Kisel  --  poor Kisel ! Truly , he seems to have been made up of leavings . Kisel would not make a bad soldier either , if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go-off , but he ca n't bear the sight o'blood ; and if he shoots as crooked as he talks , he 'd be as like to shoot himself as anybody else . But sometimes the fellow 's tongue does hit the mark in a kind of providential manner . By the Lor  --  Jiminy , I mean !  --  there he comes , on Granny Larkin 's colt ! " The person in question now halted before Mrs. Lee 's door , mounted on an unbroken , ragged , party-coloured animal , such as is called , in country phrase , " a wishing horse , " evidently equipped for travelling . His bridle was compounded of alternate bits of rope and leather ; a sheepskin served him for a saddle , behind which hung on either side a meal-bag , filled with all his worldly substance . His own costume was in keeping ; an over-garment , made of an old blanket , a sort of long roundabout , was fastened at the waist with a wampum belt , which , tied in many a fantastical knot , dangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holyday leather breeches , and yarn stockings of deep red ; a conical cap , composed of alternate bits of scarlet and blue cloth , covered his head , and was drawn close over his eyebrows .  --  Nature had reduced his brow to the narrowest precincts ; his face was concave ; his eyes sparkling , and in incessant motion ; his nose thin and sharp ; a pale , clean-looking skin , and a mouth with more of the characteristics of the brute than the human animal , complete the portrait of Kisel , who , leaping like a cat from his horse , appeared at the door , screaming out , in a cracked voice , " Ready , Misser Eliot ? " While all were exchanging inquiring glances , and the children whispering , " Hush , Kisel  --  do n't you see Dr. Wilson ? " Eliot , who comprehended the strange apparition at a glance , came forward and said  --  " No , Kisel ; I am not ready . " " Well , well  --  all same  --  Kisel can wait , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kisel , " replied Eliot , kindly taking the lad 's hand , " you must not wait  --  you must give this up , my good fellow . " " Give it up !  --  Diddle me if I do  --  no , I told you that all the devils and angels to bargain should not stop me , no  --  you go , I go  --  that 's it , hey ! " Here Major Avery , who sat near the door , his mouth wide open with amazement , burst into a hoarse laugh , at which Kisel , his eyes flashing fire , gave him a smart switch with his riding-whip ( a willow wand ) over the face . The good-humoured man , deeming the poor lad no subject for resentment , passed his hand over his face as if a moscheto had stung him , saying  --  " Well , now , Kisel , that was not fair , my boy ; I was only smiling that such a harlequin-looking thing as you should think of being waiter to Mr. Eliot . He might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eliot did not need his poor friend should be placed in this ludicrous aspect to strengthen the decision which he had already expressed to him ; and drawing him aside beyond the irritation of the major 's gibes , he said  --  " It is impossible , Kisel  --  I can not consent to your going with me . " " Ca n't , hey ! ca n't ! ca n't ! "  --  and for a few moments the poor fellow hung his head , whimpering ; then suddenly elevating it , he cried , " Then I go ' out consent  --  I go , anyhow ; " and springing back to the door , he called out  --  " Miss Lee , hear me  --  Miss Bessie , you too , and you , parson Wilson , for I speak gospel . When I boy , all boys laugh at me , knock me here , kick there  --  who took my part ?  --  Misser Eliot , hey ! When they tied me to old Roan , Beauty 's mother , head to tail , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot . I sick , nobody care I live or die  --  Misser Eliot stay by me all night . When everybody laugh at me , plague me , hate me , I wish me dead , Misser Eliot talk to me , make me feel good , glad , make me warm here . " He laid his hand on his bosom  --  " He gone , I ca n't live !  --  but I 'll follow him  --  I 'll be his dog , fetch , carry , lay down at his feet . S'pose he sick , Miss Lee ? everybody say I good in sickness  --  S'pose , Miss Bessie , he lie on the ground , bleeding , horses trampling , soldiers flying , hey !  --  I bind him up , bring water , carry him in my arms  --  if he die , I die too ! " The picture Kisel rudely sketched struck the imaginations of mother and daughter . They knew his devotion to Eliot , and that in emergencies he had gleams of shrewdness that seemed supernatural . They were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ludicrous ; and both joined in earnestly entreating Eliot not to oppose Kisel 's wishes . Dr. Wilson supported their intercession by remarking , " that it seemed quite providential he should have been able to prepare for such an expedition . " The major took off the edge of this argument by communicating what he had hastily ascertained , that Kisel had bartered away his patrimony for " Granny Larkin 's " wishing horse , yclept Beauty ; but he added two suggestions that had much force with Eliot , particularly the last ; for if there was a virtue that had supremacy in his well-ordered character , it was humanity . " The lad , Mr. Lee , " he said , " may be of use , after all . It takes a great many sorts of folks to make a world , and so to make up an army . There 's a lack of hands in camp , and his may come in play . Kisel is keen at a sudden call  --  and besides , " he added , in a lower voice to Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are gone he 'll be good for nothing  --  like a vine when the tree it clung to is removed , withering on the ground . Say you 'll take him , and we 'll rig him out according to Gunter . " Thus beset , Eliot consented to what half an hour before had appeared to him absurd ; and the major bestirring himself , from his own and Mrs. Lee 's stores soon rectified Kisel 's equipment in all important particulars , to suit either honourable character of volunteer soldier or volunteer attendant on Mr. Eliot Lee . This done , nothing remained but the customary devotional service , still performed by the village pastor on all extraordinary occasions . On this , Doctor Wilson 's feelings over-powered his technicalities . His prayer , sublimed by the touching language of Scripture , melted the coldest heart , and raised the most dejected . After bestowing their farewell blessing the neighbours withdrew , all treasuring in their hearts some last word of kindness from Eliot Lee , long remembered , and often referred to . The family were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more intensely felt . Eliot , locking his mother and sister in his arms , and the little ones gathered around him , with manly faith commended them to God their Father ; and receiving their last embraces , sprang on to his horse conscious of nothing but confused sensations of grief , till having passed far beyond the bounds of Westbrook , he heard his companion lightly singing  --  " I cries for nobody , and nobody cries for Kisel ! " CHAPTER VI . " I do not , brother , Infer , as if I thought my sister 's state Secure , without all doubt or controversy ; Yet , where an equal poise of hope and fear Does arbitrate the event , my nature is , That I incline to hope rather than fear . "  --  Milton . Eliot Lee to his Mother . "  --  Town , 1778 . " I have arrived thus far , my dear mother , on my journey ; and , according to my promise , am beginning the correspondence which is to soften our separation . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , brooded over dear Bessie and the little troop , and dwelt on our home affairs . " I feared Harris would neglect the thrashing , and the wheat might not turn out as well as we hoped ; that the major might forget his promise about the husking bee ; that the pumpkins might freeze in the loft ( pray have them brought down , I forgot it ! ) ; that the cows might fail sooner than you expected ; that the sheep might torment you . In short , dear mother , the grief of parting seemed to spread its shadows far and wide . If Master Hale could have penetrated my mental processes , he would have deemed his last admonition , to deport myself in thought , word , and deed , like a scholar , a soldier , and a gentleman , quite lost upon me . I was an anxious wretch , and nothing else . Poor Kisel did not serve as a tranquillizer . His light wits were throwing off their fermentation , in whistling , laughing , and soliloquizing : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , canter , nor pace , but something compounded of all , irritated my nerves . Never were horse and rider better matched . Together , they make a fair centaur ; the animal not more than half a horse , and Kisel not more than half a man ; there is a ludicrous correspondence between them ; neither vicious , but both unbreakable , and full of all manner of tricks . " Our land at this moment teems with scenes of moral and poetic interest . We made our first stop at the little inn in R  --  . The landlord 's son was just setting off to join the quota to be sent from-that county . The father , a stout old man , was trying to suppress his emotion by bustling about , talking loud , whistling , hemming , and coughing . The mother , her tears dropping like rain , was standing at the fire , feeling over and over again the shirts she was airing for the knapsack . He 's our youngest , ' whispered the old man to me , and mammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not mammy alone , ' thought I , as the old man turned away to brush off his starting tears . The sisters were each putting some love-token , socks , mittens , and nutcakes into the knapsack , which they looked hardy enough to have shouldered , while one poor girl sat with her face buried in her handkerchief , weeping most bitterly . The old man patted her on the neck  --  Come , Letty , cheer up ! ' said he ; Jo may never have another chance to fight for his country , and marrying can be done any day in the year . ' He turned to me with an explanatory whisper ; ' T is tough for all  --  Jo and Letty are published , and we were to have the wedding thanks-giving evening . ' " All this was rather too much for me to bear , in addition to the load already pressing on my heart ; so without waiting for my horse to be fed , I mounted him and proceeded . " My next stop was in H  --  . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin their march . Some infirm old men , a few young mothers , with babies in their arms , and all the boys in the town , had gathered for the last farewell . The soldiers were resting on their muskets , and the clergyman imploring the benediction of Heaven on their heads . Can England , ' thought I , hope to subdue a country that sends forth its defenders in such a spirit , with arms of such a temper ? ' Oh , why does she not respect in her children the transmitted character of their fathers ! " I arrived at Mrs. Ashley 's just as the family were sitting down to tea . She and the girls are in fine spirits , having recently received from the colonel accounts of some fortunate skirmishes with the British . The changed aspect of her once sumptuous tea-table at first shocked me ; but my keen appetite ( for the first time in my life , my dear mother , I had fasted all day ) quite overcame my sensibilities ; the honest pride with which my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into shirts for her husband 's men , and the complacency with which she commended her sage tea , magnified the virtues of her brown bread , and self-sweetened sweetmeats would have given a relish to coarser fare more coarsely served . " I have been pondering on the character of our New-England people during my ride . The aspect of our society is quiet , and , to a cursory observer , it appears tame . We seem to have the plodding , safe , self-preserving virtues ; to be industrious , frugal , provident , and cautious ; but to want the enthusiasm that gives to life all its poetry and almost all its charms . But it is not so ; there is a strong under-current . Let the individual or the people be roused by a motive that approves itself to the reasoning and religious mind , a fervid energy , an all-subduing enthusiasm bursts forth , not like an accidental and transient conflagration , but operating , like the elements , to great effects , and irresistibly . This enthusiasm , this central fire , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence of the orator , kindles the heart of the soldier , the beacon-lights and strong defences of our land ; but it lights the temple of God , and burns on the family altar . The old man throws away his crutch ; the yeoman leaves the plough in the half-turned furrow ; and the loving , quiet matron like you , my dear mother , lays aside her domestic anxieties , dispenses with her household comforts , and gives the God-speed to her sons to go forth and battle it for their country . The nature of the contest in which we are engaged illustrates my idea . Its sublimity is sometimes obscured by the extravagance of party zeal . We have not been goaded to resistance by oppression , nor fretted and chafed , with bits and collars , to madness ; but our sages , bold with the transmitted spirit of freedom , sown at broadcast by our Pilgrim fathers , have reflected on the past and calculated the future ; and coolly estimating the worth of independence and the right of self-government , are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice themselves for the prospective good of their children . This is the dignified resolve of thinking beings , not the angry impatience of overburdened animals . " But good-night , dear mother . After this I shall have incidents , and not reflections merely , to send you . The pine-knot , by the light of which I have written this , is just flickering its last flame . I can not afford you a candle , ' said my good hostess when she bade me good-night ; we sold our tallow to purchase necessaries for the colonel 's men  --  poor fellows , some of them are yet barefooted ! ' " I shall enclose a line to Bessie  --  perhaps she will show it to you ; but do not ask it of her . Tell dear Fan I shall remember her charge , and give the socks she knit to the first brave barefooted soldier ' I see . Sam must feed Steady for me ; and dear little Hal must continue , as he has begun , to couple brother Eliot with the poor soldiers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your little Bible is before me ; my eye rests on the few lines you traced on the title-page ; and as I press my lips to them , they inspire holy resolutions . God grant I may not mistake their freshness for vigour . What I may be is uncertain ; but I shall ever remain , as I am now , dearest mother , " Your devoted son , " Eliot Lee . " Section Eliot found his letter to his sister a difficult task . He was to treat a malady , the existence of which the patient had never acknowledged to him . He wrote , effaced , and re-wrote , and finally sent the following :  --  Letter " My sweet sister Bessie , nothing has afflicted me so much in leaving home as parting from you . I am inclined to believe there can be no stronger nor tenderer affection than that of brother and sister ; the sense of protection on one part , and dependance on the other ; the sweet recollections of childhood ; the unity of interest ; and the communion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one existence . So it is with us  --  is it not , my dear sister ? With me , certainly ; for though , like most young men , I have had my fancies , they have passed by like the summer breeze , and left no trace of their passage . All the love , liking ( I can not find a word to express the essential volatility of the sentiment in my experience of it ) that I have ever felt for all my favourites , brown and fair , does not amount to one thousandth part of the immutable affection that I bear you , my dear sister . I speak only of my own experience , Bessie , and , as I well know , against the faith of the world . I should be told that my fraternal love would pale in the fires of another passion , as does a lamp at the shining of the sun ; but I do n't believe a word of it  --  do you , Bessie ? I am not , my dear sister , playing the inquisitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject on which I thought it would be easier to write than to speak ; but I find it can not be easy to do that , in any mode , which may pain you . " I have neglected the duty I owed you ; and yet , perhaps , no vigilance could have prevented the natural consequence of your intercourse with one of the most fascinating men in the world . There , it is out !  --  and now I can write freely . I said I had neglected my duty ; but I was not conscious of this till too late . The truth is , my mind has been so engrossed with political subjects , so harassed with importunate cravings and conflicting duties , that I was for a long time unobservant of what was passing under my eye . I awoke as from a dream , and found ( or feared ) that my sister 's happiness was at stake ; that she had given , and given to one unworthy , the irrequitable boon of her affections ; irrequitable , but , thank Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word of all the trumpery about incurable love . I will not adopt a faith , however old and prevailing , which calls in question our moral power to achieve any conquest over ourselves . For my own part , I do not think we have any power over our affections to give or withdraw them , or even to measure their amount . This may seem a startling assertion , and contradictory of what I have said above ; but it is not . The sentiment I there alluded to is generated by accidental circumstances , is half illusion , unsustained by reason , unauthorized by realities  --  not the immortal love infused by Heaven and sustained by truth ; but a disease very mortal and very curable , dear Bessie , believe me . Such a mind as yours , so pure , so elevated , has a self-rectifying power . You have felt the influence of the delightful qualities which M  --  undoubtedly possesses ; and why should you not , for who is more susceptible to grace and refinement than yourself ? Heaven has so arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have said above , we can neither give nor withhold our love  --  the heart has no tenants at will . If M  --  has assumed , or you have imputed to him qualities which he does not possess , your affection will be dissipated with the illusion . But if the spell still remains unbroken , I entreat you , my dear sister , not to waste your sensibility , the precious food of life , the life of life , in moping melancholy . " Attach thee firmly ( I quote from memory ) to the virtuous deeds And offices of love  --  to love itself , With all its vain and transient joys , sit loose . ' " I have long had a lurking distrust of M  --  . He has acted too cautious a part in politics for a sound heart . Let a man run the risk of hanging for it either way ; but if he have a spark of generosity , he will be either a whole-souled whig or a loyal tory in these times . " I know what M  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ; all his friends were on the royal side ; and , on the other hand , his property was here , and might depend on the favour of the rebels ; and indeed , there was so much to be said on both sides , that a man might well pause ! ' There are moments in men 's histories when none but cowards or knaves , or ( worse than either ) cold-blooded , selfish wretches , would pause ! " It is possible that I misjudge him ; Heaven grant it ! All that I know is , that he is in New-York no longer , pausing , but the aid of General Clinton . It is barely possible that he has written ; letters are not transmitted with any security in these times ; but why did he not speak before he went ? why , up to the very hour of his departure ( as my mother says , you know I was absent ) , did he continue a devotion which must end in suffering and disappointment to you ? There is a vicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not think , dearest Bessie , that I am anxious to prove him unworthy  --  Alas , alas ! I was far too slow to believe him so ; and I now only set before you these inevitable inferences from his conduct , in the hope that your illusion will sooner vanish , and you will the sooner recover your tranquillity . " I am writing without a ray of light , except what comes from the embers on the hearth . Perhaps you will think I am in Egyptian mental darkness . No , Bessie , I must be clear-sighted when I have nothing in view but your honour and happiness . They shall ever be my care , even more than my own . But why do I separate that which is one and indivisible ? Good-night , dear sister . Let me fancy you listening to me ; your sweet eye fixed on me ; no dejected nor averted look ; your face beaming , as I have often seen it , with the tenderness so dangerous here , so safe in heaven ; the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy so transient here , there enduring !  --  Let me see this blessed vision , and I shall sleep sweetly and sweetly dream of home . " Ever thine , Bessie , " E. L. " Section Bessie read her brother 's letter with mixed emotions . At first it called forth tenderness for him ; then she thought he judged Meredith precipitately , harshly even ; and after confirming herself in this opinion , by thinking of him over and over again in the false lights in which he had shown himself , she said , " even Eliot allows that we can neither give nor withhold our love ; then how is Jasper to blame for not giving it to one so humble , so inferior as I am ? and how could I withhold mine ? " Poor Bessie ! it is a common trick of human nature to snatch from an argument whatever coincides with our own views , and leave the rest . " If , " she continued in her reflections , " he had ever made any declarations , or asked any confessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She could have recalled passionate declarations in his eye , prayers in his devotion ; but her love had the essential characteristics of true passion ; it was humble , generous , and self-condemning . CHAPTER VII . " Si tout le monde vous ressembloit , un roman seroit bientot fini ! "  --  Moliere . November 's leaden clouds and fitful gleams of sunshine , coming like visitations of heaven-inspired thoughts , and vanishing , alas ! like illusions , harmonized with the state of Bessie 's mind . She was much abroad , rambling alone over her favourite haunts , and living over the dangerous past . This was at least a present relief and solace ; and her mother , though she feared it might minister to the morbid state of her child 's feelings , had not the resolution to interpose her authority to prevent it . Bessie was one evening at twilight returning homeward by a road ( if road that might be called which was merely a horse-path ) that communicated at the distance of a mile and a half with the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little brook , through a pine wood that was just now powdered over with a light snow . Meredith and Bessie had always taken their way through this sequestered wood in their walks and rides , going and returning ; not a step of it but was eloquent with some treasured word , some well-remembered emotion . Bessie had seated herself on a fallen trunk , an accustomed resting-place , and was looking at a bunch of ground pine and wild periwinkles as if she were perusing them ; the sensations of happier hours had stolen over her , the painful present and uncertain future were forgotten , when she was roused from her dreamy state by the trampling of an approaching horse . Women , most women , are cowards on instinct . Bessie cast one glance backward , and saw the horse was ridden by a person in a military dress . A stranger in this private path was rather an alarming apparition , and she started homeward with hasty steps . The rider mended his horse 's pace , and was soon even with her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee !  --  It is you , Bessie  --  I can not be mistaken ! " Bessie smiled at this familiar salutation , and did not refuse her hand to the stranger , who with eager cordiality offered his ; but not being in the least a woman of the world , it was plain she explored his face in vain for some recognisable feature .  --  " No , you do not remember me  --  that is evident , " he said , with a tone of disappointment . " Is there not a vestige , Bessie , of your old playmate , in the whiskered , weather-beaten personage before you ? " " Herbert Linwood ! " she exclaimed , and a glow of glad recognition mounted from her heart to her cheek . " Ah , thank you , Bessie , better late than never ; but it is sad to be forgotten . You are much less changed than I , undoubtedly ; but I should have known you if nothing were unaltered save the colour of your eye ; however , I have always worn your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to his heart , " and in truth , you are but the opening bud expanded to the flower , while I have undergone a change like the chestnut , from the tassel to the bearded husk . " Bessie soon began to perceive familiar tones and expression , and she consoled Herbert with the assurance that it was only her surprise , his growth , change of dress , &c.,; that prevented her from knowing him at once . They soon passed to mutual inquiries , by which it appeared that Herbert had come to Massachusetts on military business . The visit to Westbrook was a little episode of his own insertion . He was to return in a few weeks to West Point , where he was charmed to hear he should meet Eliot . " I am cut off from my own family , " he said , " and really , I pine for a friend . I gather from Belle 's letters that my father is more and more estranged from me . While he thought I was fighting on the losing side , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placable ; but since the result of our contest has become doubtful , even to him , he has waxed hotter and hotter against me ; and if we finally prevail , and prevail we must , he will never forgive me . " " Oh , do not say so  --  he can not be so unrelenting ; and if he were , Isabella can persuade him  --  she can do any thing she pleases . " " Yes , a pretty potent person is that sister of mine . But when my father sets his foot down , the devil  --  I beg your pardon Bessie , and Belle 's too  --  I mean his metal is of such a temper that an angel could not bend him . " " Isabella is certainly the angel , not its opposite . " " Why yes , she is , God bless her ! But yet , Bessie , she is pretty well spiced with humanity . If she were not , she would not be so attractive to a certain friend of ours , who is merely human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or feared she knew , what Herbert meant ; and after a pause , full of sensation to her , she ventured to ask " if he heard often from New-York ? " " Yes , we get rumours from there every day  --  nothing very satisfactory . Belle , in spite of her toryism , is a loving sister , and writes me as often as she can ; but as the letters run the risk of being read by friends and foes , they are about as domestic and private as if they were endited for Rivington 's Gazette . " " Then , " said Bessie , quite boldly , for she felt a sensible relief , " you have no news to tell me ? " " No  --  no , nothing official , " he replied , with a smile ; " Belle writes exultingly of Meredith having , since his return to New-York , come out on the right side , as she calls it  --  and of my father 's pleasure and pride in him , &c.; Of course she says not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine , who was brought in a prisoner the other day , that Meredith has been devoted to her ever since his return . They were always lovers after an April-day fashion , you know , Bessie , and I should not be surprised to hear of their engagement at any time  --  should you ? " Fortunately for poor Bessie , her hood sheltered the rapid mutations of her cheek ; resolution or pride she had not , but a certain sense of maidenly decorum came to her aid , and she faintly answered , " No , I should not . " If this were a slight departure from truth , every woman ( every young one ) will forgive her , for it was a case of self-preservation . Linwood was so absorbed in the happiness of being near her , of having her arm in his , that he scarcely noticed how that arm trembled , and how her voice faltered . He afterward recalled it . Herbert 's visit to the Lees was like a saint 's day to good Catholics after a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite with Mrs. Lee  --  she was delighted to see him again , and thought the man even more charming than the boy . She made every effort to show off her hospitable home to Linwood in its old aspect of abundance and cheerfulness ; and , in spite of war and actual changes , she succeeded . She had the skilful housewife 's gift " to make the worse appear the better , "  --  far more difficult in housewifery than in metaphysics . Herbert enjoyed , to her kind heart 's content , the result of her efforts . The poor fellow 's appetite had been so long mortified with the sorry fare of the American camp , that no Roman epicurean ever relished the dainties of an emperor 's table ( such as canaries ' eyes and peacocks ' brains ) more keenly than he did the plain but excellent provisions at Lee farm ; the incomparable bread and butter , ham , apple-sauce , and cream , the nuts the children cracked , and the sparkling cider they drew for him . We are quite aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these gross matters , but our friend Herbert was no hero , no romantic abstraction , but a good , honest , natural fellow , compounded of body and spirit , each element bearing its due proportion in the composition . Bessie yielded to the influence of old associations , and , as her mother thought , was more light-hearted , more herself , than she had been for many a weary month . " After all , " she said , anxiously revolving the subject in her mind , " it may come out right yet . Bessie can not help preferring Herbert Linwood , so good-humoured and open-hearted as he is , to Meredith , with his studied elegance , his hollow phrases , and expressive looks . Herbert 's heart is in his hand ; and hand and heart he 'll not be too proud to offer her ; for he sees things in their true lights , and not with the world 's eye . " Mrs. Lee was delicate and prudent ; but she could not help intimating her own sentiments to Bessie . From that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the rosy hues from the sunset clouds . Herbert wondered , but he had no time to lose in speculation . He threw himself at Bessie 's feet , and there poured out his tale of love and devotion . At first he received nothing in return but silence and tears ; and , when he became more importunate , broken protestations of her gratitude and ill desert ; which he misunderstood , and answered by declaring " she owed him no gratitude ; that he was but too bold to aspire to her , poor wretch of broken fortunes that he was ; but , please Heaven , he would mend them under her auspices . " She dared not put him off with pretences . She only wept , and said she had no heart to give ; and then left him , feeling much like some poor mariner , who , as he is joyously sailing into a long-desired port , is suddenly enveloped in impenetrable mist . Herbert was not of a temper to remain tranquil in this position . He knew nothing of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never waited for any thing ; and he at once told his perplexities to Mrs. Lee , who , herself most grieved and mortified , communicated slight hints which , by furnishing a key to certain observations of his own , put him sufficiently in possession of the truth . Without again seeing Bessie , he left Westbrook with the common conviction of even common lovers in fresh disappointments , that there was no more happiness for him in this world . Mrs. Lee uttered no word of expostulation or reproach to Bessie ; but her sad looks , like the old mother 's in the ballad , " gaed near to break her heart . " There are few greater trials to a tender hearted , conscientious creature like Bessie Lee , than to defeat the hopes and disappoint the expectations of friends , by opposing those circumstances which , as it seems to them , will best promote our honour and happiness . " Eliot , " said Bessie , in her secret meditations , " thinks I am weakly cherishing an unworthy passion  --  my mother believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness  --  thank Heaven , the wretchedness , as well as the fault , is all my own . " Many may condemn Bessie 's unresisting weakness ; but who will venture to graduate the scale of human virtue ? to decide in a given case how much is bodily infirmity , and how much defect of resolution . Certain are we , that when fragility of constitution , tenderness of conscience , and susceptibility of heart , meet in one person , the sooner the trials of life are over the better . CHAPTER VIII . " A name which every wind to Heaven would bear , Which men to speak , and angels joy to hear . " Section Another letter from Eliot broke like a sunbeam through the monotonous clouds that hung over the Lees . Letter " My Dearest Mother ,  --  I arrived safely at headquarters on the 22d . Colonel Ashley received me with open arms . He applauded my resolution to join the army , and bestowed his curses liberally ( as is his wont on whatever displeases him ) on the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and Poland are crossing the ocean to volunteer in our cause . He rubbed his hands exultingly when I told him that it was your self-originating decision that I should leave you . The only son of your mother  --  that is , the only one to speak of ' ( forgive him , Sam and Hal ) , and she a widow ! ' he exclaimed . Let them talk about their Spartan mothers , half men and demimonsters ; but look at our women-folks , as tender and as timid of their broods as hens , and as bold and self-sacrificing as martyrs ! You come of a good stock , my boy , and so I shall tell the gin'ral . He 's old Virginia , my lad ; and looks well to blood in man and horse . ' " The next morning he called , his kind heart raying out through his jolly face , to present me to General Washington . If ever I go into battle , which Heaven of its loving mercy grant , I pray my heart may not thump as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the residence of our noble leader . You tremble , Eliot , ' said my colonel , as we reached the door-step . I do n't wonder  --  I always feel my joints give a little when I go before him . I venerate him next to the Deity ; but it is not easy to get used to him as you do to other men . ' " When we entered , the general was writing . If Sam wishes to know whether my courage returned when I was actually in his presence , tell him I then forgot myself  --  forgot I had an impression to make . The general requested us to be seated while he finished his despatches . The copies were before him , all in his own hand . Every t crossed , and every i dotted , ' whispered the colonel , pointing to the papers . He 's godlike in that ; he finishes off little things as completely as great . ' I could not but smile at the comparison , though it was both striking and just . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction from Governor Hancock and Mr. Adams , which I presented , You see , sir , ' said my kind patron , that my young friend here is calculating to enter the army ; I 'll answer for him , he 'll prove good and true ; up to the mark , as his father Sam Lee was before him . He , that is , Sam Lee , and I , fit side by side in the French war ; I was no flincher , you know , sir , and he was as brave as Julius Csar , Sam was ; so I think my friend Eliot here has a pretty considerable claim . ' " But , my good sir , ' said the general , you know we are contending against hereditary claims . ' " That 's true , sir ; and thank the Lord , he can stand on his own ground ; he shot one of the first guns at Lexington , and got pretty well peppered too , though he was a lad then , with a face as smooth as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , ' thought I ; and I attempted to stop my trumpeter 's mouth by saying I had no claims on the score of the affair at Lexington ; that my being there was accidental , and I fought on instinct . ' " Ah , my boy , ' said the colonel , determined to tell his tale out , you may say that  --  there 's no courage like that that comes by natur , gin'ral ; he stood within two feet of me , as straight as a tombstone , when a spent ball bounding near him , he caught it in his hands just as if he 'd been playing wicket , and said , " you may throw down your bat , my boys , I 've caught you out ! "  --  was not that metal ? ' " General Washington 's countenance relaxed as the colonel proceeded ( I ventured a side glance ) , and at the conclusion he gave two or three emphatic and pleased nods ; but his grave aspect returned immediately , and he said , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Lee , of my friends of Massachusetts , that you may receive a commission in the service , deserves attention ; Colonel Ashley is a substantial voucher for your personal merit . Are you aware , sir , that a post of honour in our army involves arduous labour , hardships , and self-denial ? Do you know the actual condition of our officers  --  that their pay is in arrears , and their private resources exhausted ? There are among them men who have bravely served their country from the beginning of this contest ; gentlemen who have not a change of linen ; to whom I have even been compelled to deny , because I had not the power to divert them from their original destination , the coarse clothes provided for the soldiers . This is an affecting , but a true view of our actual condition . Should the Almighty prosper our cause , as , if we are true to ourselves , he assuredly will , these matters will improve ; but I have no lure to hold out to you , no encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps , Mr. Lee , you would prefer to reflect further , before you assume new obligations ? ' " Not a moment , sir . I came here determined to serve my country at any post you should assign me . If a command is given me , I shall be grateful for it : if not , I shall enter the ranks as a private soldier . ' " General Washington exchanged glances with the colonel , that implied approbation of my resolution , but not one syllable dropped of encouragement as to the commission ; and it being evident that he had no leisure to protract our audience , we took our leave . " I confess I came away rather crest-fallen . I am not such a puppy , my dear mother , as to suppose my single arm of much consequence to my country , but I felt an agreeable , perhaps an exaggerated consciousness , that I deserved  --  not applause , but some token of encouragement . However , the colonel said this was his way ; he never disappoints an expectation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I asked . " The Lord forgive you ! Eliot , ' he replied . Cold-hearted !  --  No , his heat does not go off by flashes , but keeps the furnace hot out of which the pure gold comes . Lads never think there is any fire unless they see the sparks and hear the roar . ' " But , sir , ' said I , I believe there is a very common impression that General Washington is of a reserved , cold temperament  --  ' " The devil take common impressions . They are made on sand , and are both false and fleeting . Wait , Eliot  --  you are true metal , and I will venture your impressions when you shall know our noble commander better . Cold , egad , ' he half muttered to himself ; where the deuse , then , has the heat come from that has cemented our army together , and kept their spirits up when their fingers and toes were freezing ? " ' " Give me joy , my dear mother ; a kiss , Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a huzza , boys ! General Washington has sent me a lieutenant 's commission , and a particularly kind note with it . So , it appears , that while I was thinking him so lukewarm to my application , he lost no time in transmitting it to Congress , and enforcing it by his recommendation . Our camp is all bustle . Soldiers , just trained and fit for service , are departing , their term of enlistment having expired . The new quotas are coming in , raw , undisciplined troops . The general preserves a calm , unaltered mien ; but his officers fret and fume in private , and say that nothing effective will ever be achieved while Congress permits these short enlistments . " " Thanks to you , dear mother ; my funds have enabled me to purchase a uniform . I have just tried it on . I wish you could all see me in it . Every woman is at heart a rake , ' says Pope ; that every man is at heart a coxcomb , is just about as true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we meet again , but the freshness of my love for you will never be dimmed , my dear mother ; for Bessie , and for all the little band , whose bright faces are even now before my swimming eyes . " Yours devotedly , " Eliot Lee . " P. S.  --  My poor jack-o ' - lantern , Kisel , is of course of no use to me , neither does he give me much trouble . He is a sort of mountebank among the soldiers , merry himself and making others merry . If he is a benefactor who makes two blades of grass grow where but one grew before , Kisel certainly is , while he produces smiles where rugged toil and want have stamped a scowl of discontent . " Section In this letter to his mother , Eliot enclosed one to Bessie ; reiterating even more forcibly and tenderly what he had before said . It served no purpose but to aggravate her self-reproaches . CHAPTER IX . " Come not near our fairy queen . " Before mid-winter , Linwood joined Eliot Lee at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the footing of friends . There was just that degree of similarity and difference between them that inspires mutual confidence and begets interest . Herbert , with characteristic frankness , told the story of his love , disappointment and all . Eliot felt a true sympathy for his friend , whose deserts he thought would so well have harmonized with Bessie 's advantage and happiness ; but this feeling was subordinate to his keen anxiety for his sister . This anxiety was not appeased by intelligence from home . Letters were rare blessings in those days  --  scarcely to him blessings . His mother wrote about every thing but Bessie , and his sister 's letters were brief and vague , and most unsatisfactory . The winter , however , passed rapidly away . Though in winter quarters , he had incessant occupation ; and the exciting novelty of military life , with the deep interest of the times , to an ardent and patriotic spirit , kept every feeling on the strain . Eliot had that intimate acquaintance with nature that makes one look upon and love all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face ; and as that most interests us in its soul-fraught seriousness , so he delighted even more in the wild gleams of beauty that are shot over the winter landscape , than in all its summer wealth . To eyes like his , faithful ministers to the soul , the scenery of West Point was a perpetual banquet . Nature , in our spring-time , as we all know ( especially in this blessed year of our Lord 1835 ) , rises as slowly and reluctantly from her long winter 's sleep as any other sluggard . On looking back to our hero 's spring at West Point , we find she must have been at her work earlier than is her wont ; for April was not far gone when Eliot , after looking in vain for Linwood to accompany him , sauntered into the woods , where the buds were swelling and the rills gushing . At first his pleasure was marred by his friend not being with him , and he now for the first time called to mind Linwood 's frequent and unexplained absences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social being , that Eliot 's curiosity was naturally excited by this sudden manifestation of a love of solitude and secrecy . He however pursued his way ; and having reached the cascade which is now the resort of holyday visiters , he forgot his friend . The soil under his feet , released from the iron grasp of winter , was soft and spongy , and the tokens of spring were around him like the first mellow smile of dawn . The rills that spring together like laughing children just out of school ( we borrow the obvious simile from a poetic child ) , and at their junction form " the cascade , " were then filled to the brim from their just unsealed fountains . Eliot followed the streamlet where it pursues its headlong course , dancing , singing , and shouting , as it flings itself over the rocks , as if it spurned their cold and stern companionship , and was impatiently running away from the leafless woods to a holyday in a summer region . He forced his way through the obstructions that impeded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream again divided , looking up at the snow-white and feathery water , as he caught a glimpse of it here and there through the intersecting branches of hemlocks , and wondering why it was that he instinctively infused his own nature into the outward world : why the rocks seemed to him to look sternly on the frolicking stream that capered over them , and the fresh white blossoms of the early flowering shrubs seemed to yearn with a kindred spirit towards it , when his speculations were broken by human voices mingling with the sound of the waterfall . He looked in the direction whence they came , and fancied he saw a white dress . It might be the cascade , for that at a little distance did not look unlike a white robe floating over the gray rocks , but it might be a fair lady 's gown , and that was a sight rare enough to provoke the curiosity of a young knight-errant . So Eliot , quickening his footsteps , reached the point where the streamlet ceases its din , and steals loiteringly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had pressed on unwittingly , for he was now within a few yards of two persons on whom he would not voluntarily have intruded . One was a lady ( a lady certainly , for a well-practised ear can graduate the degree of refinement by a single tone of the voice ) , the other party to the tte -- tte was his truant friend Linwood . The lady was seated with her back towards Eliot , in a grape-vine that hung , a sylvan swing , from the trees ; and Linwood , his face also turned from Eliot , was decking his companion 's pretty hair with wood anemones , and ( ominous it was when Herbert Linwood made sentimental sallies ) saying very soft and pretty things of their starry eyes . Eliot was making a quiet retreat , when , to his utter consternation , a lady on his right , till then unseen by him , addressed him , saying , " she believed she had the pleasure of speaking to Lieutenant Lee . " Eliot bowed ; whereupon she added , " that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be his friend . Captain Linwood is there with my sister , you perceive , " she continued ; " and as he is our friend , and you are his , you will do us the favour to go home and take tea with us . " By this time the tte -- tte party , though sufficiently absorbed in each other , was aroused , and both turning their head , perceived Eliot . The lady said nothing ; Linwood looked disconcerted , and merely nodded without speaking to his friend . The lady rose , and with a spirited step walked towards a farmhouse on the margin of the Hudson , the only tenement of this secluded and most lovely little glen . Linwood followed her , and seemed earnestly addressing her in a low voice . By this time Eliot had sufficiently recovered his senses to remember that the farmhouse , which was visible from West Point , had been pointed out to him as the temporary residence of a Mr. Grenville Ruthven . Mr. Ruthven was a native of Virginia , who some years before had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had held an office under the king till the commencement of the war . His only son was in the English navy , and the father was suspected of being at heart a royalist . His political partialities , however , were not so strong but that they might be deferred to prudence : so he took her counsel , and retired with his wife and two daughters to this safe nook on the Hudson , till the troubles should be overpast . Eliot could not be insensible to the friendly and volunteered greeting of his pretty lady patroness , and a social pleasure was never more inviting than now when he was famishing for it ; but it was so manifest that his presence was any thing but desirable to Linwood and his companion , that he was making his acknowledgments and turning away , when the young lady , declaring she would not take " no " for an answer , called out , " Stop , Helen  --  pray , stop  --  come back , Captain Linwood , and introduce us regularly to your friend ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an acquaintance that is not begun in due form . " Thus compelled , Miss Ruthven stopped and submitted gracefully to an introduction , which Linwood was in fact at the moment urging , and she peremptorily refusing . " Now , here we are , just at our own door , " said Miss Charlotte Ruthven to Eliot , " and you must positively come in and take tea with us . " Eliot still hesitated . " Why , in the name of wonder , should you not ? " said Linwood , who appeared just coming to himself . " You must come with us , " said Miss Ruthven , for the first time speaking , " and let me show your friend how very magnanimous I can be . " " Indeed , you must not refuse us , " urged Miss Charlotte . " I can not , " replied Eliot , gallantly , " though it is not very flattering to begin an acquaintance with testing the magnanimity of your sister . " Helen Ruthven bowed , smiled , and coloured ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend is certainly the most civilized of all the eastern savages I have yet seen , and , as your friend , I will try to tolerate him . " She soon , however , seemed to forget his presence , and to forget every thing else , in an absorbing and half-whispered conversation with Linwood , interrupted only by singing snatches of sentimental songs , accompanying herself on the piano , and giving them the expressive application that eloquent eyes can give . In the meanwhile Eliot was left to Miss Charlotte , a commonplace , frank , and good-humoured person , particularly well pleased at being relieved from the rle she had lately played , a cipher in a trio . Mr. and Mrs. Ruthven made their appearance with the tea-service . Mr. Ruthven , though verging towards sixty , was still in the unimpaired vigour of manhood , and was marked by the general characteristics , physical and moral , of a Virginian : the lofty stature , strong and well-built frame , the open brow , and expression of nobleness and kindness of disposition , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the least approaching to superciliousness , but a certain happy sense of the superiority , not of the individual , but of the great mass of which he is a component part . His wife , unhappily , was not of this noble stock . She was of French descent , and a native of one of our cities . At sixteen , with but a modicum of beauty , and coquetry enough for half her sex , she succeeded , Mr. Ruthven being then a widower , in making him commit the folly of marrying her , after a six weeks ' acquaintance . She was still in the prime of life , and as impatient as a caged bird of her country seclusion , or , as she called it , imprisonment , where her daughters were losing every opportunity of achieving what she considered the chief end of a woman 's life . Aware of her eldest daughter 's propensity to convert acquaintances into lovers , and looking down upon all rebels as most unprofitable suiters , she had sedulously guarded against any intercourse with the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to despair of a favourable change in their position ; and Miss Ruthven having accidentally renewed an old acquaintance with Herbert Linwood , her mother encouraged his visits from that admirable policy of maternal man oeuvrers , which wisely keeps a pis-aller in reserve . Helen Ruthven was one of those persons , most uncomfortable in domestic life , who profess always to require an object ( which means something out of a woman 's natural , safe , and quiet orbit ) on which to exhaust their engrossing and exacting desires . Mr. Ruthven felt there was a very sudden change in his domestic atmosphere , and though it was as incomprehensible to him as a change in the weather , he enjoyed it without asking or caring for an explanation . Always hospitably inclined , he was charmed with Linwood 's good-fellowship ; and while he discussed a favourite dish , obtained with infinite trouble , or drained a bottle of Madeira with him , he was as unobservant of his wife 's tactics and his daughters ' coquetries as the eagle is of the modus operandi of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , Helen was lavishing her flatteries with infinite finesse and grace . Her words , glances , tones of voice even , might have turned a steadier head than Linwood 's . Her father , good , confiding man , was not suspicious , but vexed when she called his companion away , just , as he said , " as they were beginning to enjoy themselves , " to scramble over frozen ground or look at a wintry prospect ! or to play over , for the fortieth time , a trumpery song . Helen , however , would throw her arms around her father 's neck , kiss him into good-humour , and carry her point ; that is , secure the undivided attentions of Herbert Linwood . Matters were at this point , after a fortnight 's intercourse , when Eliot entered upon the scene ; and , though his friend Miss Charlotte kept up an even flow of talk , before the evening was over he had taken some very accurate observations . When they took their leave , and twice after they had shut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that seemed to mean nothing , and yet clearly meant that her heart went with him : and then So fondly she bade him adieu , It seemed that she bade him return . " The young men had a long , dark , and at first rather an unsocial walk . Both were thinking of the same subject , and both were embarrassed by it . Linwood , after whipping his boots for ten minutes , said , " Hang it , Eliot , we may as well speak out ; I suppose you think it deused queer that I said nothing to you of my visits to the Ruthvens ? " " Why , yes , Linwood  --  to speak out frankly , I do . " " Well , it is , I confess it . At first my silence was accidental  --  no , that is not plummet and line truth ; for from the first I had a sort of a fear  --  no , not fear , but a sheepish feeling , that you might think the pleasure I took in visiting the Ruthvens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , by Heavens , did feel , to my heart 's core , about that affair at Westbrook . " " No , Linwood  --  whatever else I may doubt , I never shall doubt your sincerity . " " But my constancy you do ? " Eliot made no reply , and Linwood proceeded : " Upon my soul , I have not the slightest idea of falling in love with either of these girls , but I find it exceedingly pleasant to go there . To tell the truth , Eliot , I am wretched without the society of womankind ; Adam was a good sensible fellow not to find even Paradise tolerable without them . I knew the Ruthvens in New-York : I believe they like me the better , apostate as they consider me , for belonging to a tory family ; and looking upon me , as they must , as a diseased branch from a sound root , they certainly are very kind to me , especially the old gentleman  --  a fine old fellow , is he not ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is piquant and agreeable , and very polite to me ; and the girls , of course , are pleased to have their hermitage enlivened by an old acquaintance . " Linwood 's slender artifice in saying " the girls , " when it was apparent that Miss Ruthven was the magnet , operated like the subtlety of a child , betraying what he would fain conceal . Without appearing to perceive the truth , Eliot said , " Miss Ruthven seems to restrict her hospitality to old acquaintance . It was manifest that she did not voluntarily extend it to me . " " No , she did not . Helen Ruthven 's heart is in her hand , and she makes no secret of her antipathy to a rebel  --  per se a rebel ; however , her likes and dislikes are both harmless  --  she is only the more attractive for them . " Herbert had not been the first to mention Helen Ruthven ; he seemed now well enough pleased to dwell upon the subject . " How did you like her singing , Eliot ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings with expression . " " Does she not ? infinite !  --  and then what an accompaniment are those brilliant eyes of hers . " " With their speechless messages , Linwood ? " Linwood merely hemmed in reply , and Eliot added , " Do you like the expression of her mouth ? " " No , not entirely  --  there is a little spice of the devil about her mouth ; but when you are well acquainted with her you do n't perceive it . " " If you are undergoing a blinding process , " thought Eliot . When the friends arrived at their quarters , and separated for the night , Linwood asked and Eliot gave a promise to repeat his visit the next evening to the glen . CHAPTER X. " He is a good man . " Have you heard any imputation to the contrary ? " From this period Linwood was every day at the glen , and Eliot as often as his very strict performance of his duties permitted . He was charmed with the warm-hearted hospitality of Mr. Ruthven , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not pass the vestibule of his heart to the holy of holies , but in the vestibule ( of even the best of hearts ) vanity is apt to lurk . If Eliot therefore was not insensible to the favour of Miss Charlotte , an every-day character , Linwood could not be expected to resist the dazzling influence of her potent sister . A more wary youth might have been scorched in the focus of her charms . Helen Ruthven was some three or four years older than Linwood ,  --  a great advantage when the subject to be practised on combines simplicity and credulity with inexperience . Without being beautiful , by the help of grace and versatility , and artful adaptation of the aids and artifices of the toilet , Miss Ruthven produced the effect of beauty . Never was there a more skilful manager of the blandishments of her sex . She knew how to infuse into a glance " thoughts that breathe , "  --  how to play off those flatteries that create an atmosphere of perfume and beauty ,  --  how to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in her absence a dreary day of nothingness . She had little true sensibility or generosity ( they go together ) ; but selecting a single object on which to lavish her feeling , like a shallow stream compressed into a narrow channel , it made great show and noise . Eliot stood on disenchanted ground ; and , while looking on the real shape , was compelled to see his credulous and impulsive friend becoming from day to day more and more inthralled by the false semblance . " Is man 's heart , " he asked himself , " a mere surface , over which one shadow chaseth another ? " No . But men 's hearts have different depths . In some , like Eliot Lee 's ( who was destined to love once and for ever ) , love strikes a deep and ineradicable root ; interweaves itself with the very fibres of life , and becomes a portion of the undying soul . In other circumstances Eliot would have obeyed his impulses , and endeavoured to dissolve the spell for his friend ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so soon superseded , and by his secret wish that Linwood should remain free till a more auspicious day should rectify all mischances . Happily , Providence sometimes interposes to do that for us which we neglect to do for ourselves . As has been said , Linwood devoted every leisure hour to Helen Ruthven . Sometimes accompanied by Charlotte and Eliot , but oftener without them , they visited the almost unattainable heights , the springs and waterfalls , in the neighbourhood of West Point , now so well known to summer travellers that we have no apology for lingering to describe them . They scaled the coal-black summits of the " Devil 's Peak ; " went as far heavenward as the highest height of the " Crow 's Nest ; " visited " Bull-Hill , Butter-Hill , and Break-neck , "  --  places that must have been named long before our day of classic , heathenish , picturesque , and most ambitious christening of this new world . Helen Ruthven did not affect this scrambling " thorough bush , thorough brier , " through streamlet , snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , no , simple reader ! but because at her home in the glen there was but one parlour  --  there , from morning till bedtime , sat her father  --  there , of course , must sit her mother ; and Miss Ruthven 's charms , like those of other conjurers , depended for their success on being exercised within a magic circle , within which no observer might come . She seemed to live and breathe alone for Herbert Linwood . A hundred times he was on the point of offering the devotion of his life to her , when the image of his long-loved Bessie Lee rose before him , and , like the timely intervention of the divinities of the ancient creed , saved him from impending danger . This could not last much longer . On each successive occasion the image was less vivid , and must soon cease to be effective . Spring was advancing , and active military operations were about to commence . A British sloopof-war had come up the river , and lay at anchor in Haverstraw Bay . Simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the spirits of the family at the glen  --  a fall in their mercury . Though they were still kind , their reception of our friends ceased to be cordial , and they were no longer urged , or even asked , to repeat their visits . Charlotte , who , like her father , was warm and true-hearted , ventured to intimate that this change of manner did not originate in any diminution of friendliness ; but , save this , there was no approach to an explanation ; and Eliot ceased to pay visits that , it was obvious , were no longer acceptable . The mystery , as he thought , was explained , when they incidentally learned that Captain Ruthven , the only son of their friend , was an officer on board the vessel anchored in Haverstraw Bay . This solution did not satisfy Linwood . " How , in Heaven 's name , " he asked , " should that affect their intercourse with us ? It might , to be sure , agitate them ; but , upon my word , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the simplicity of his heart , he forthwith set off to give them information of the fact . Mr. Ruthven told him , frankly and at once , that he was already aware of it ,  --  and Helen scrawled on a music-book which lay before them , " Do you remember Hamlet ? ten thousand brothers ! ' " What she exactly meant was not plain ; but he guessed her intimation to be , that ten thousand brothers and their love were not to be weighed against him . Notwithstanding this kind intimation , he saw her thenceforth unfrequently . If he called , she was not at home ; if she made an appointment with him , she sent him some plausible excuse for not keeping it ; and if they met , she was silent and abstracted , and no longer kept up a show of the passion that a few weeks before had inspired her words , looks , and movements . Herbert was not destined to be one of love 's few martyrs ; and he was fast reverting to a sound state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still involved . Since the beginning of his intercourse with the family , his Sunday evenings had been invariably spent at the glen ; and now he received a note from Miss Ruthven ( not , as had been her wont , crossed and double-crossed ) , containing two lines , saying her father was ill , and as she was obliged to attend him , she regretted to beg Mr. Linwood to omit his usual Sunday evening visit ! Linwood had a lurking suspicion  --  he was just beginning to suspect  --  that this was a mere pretext ; and he resolved to go to the glen , ostensibly to inquire after Mr. Ruthven , but really to satisfy his doubts . It was early in the evening when he reached there . The cheerful light that usually shot forth its welcome from the parlour window was gone  --  all was darkness . " I was a rascal to distrust her ! " thought Linwood , and he hastened on , fearing good Mr. Ruthven was extremely ill . As he approached the house he perceived that , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a bright light gleamed through their crevices . He put his hand on the latch of the door to open it , as was his custom , without rapping ; but no longer , as if instinct with the hospitality of the house , did it yield to his touch . It was bolted ! He hesitated for a moment whether to knock for admittance , and endeavour to satisfy his curiosity , or to return as wise as he came . His delicacy decided on the latter course ; and he was turning away , when a sudden gust of wind blew open one of the rickety blinds , and instinctively he looked through the window , and for a moment was riveted by the scene disclosed within . Mr. Ruthven sat at a table on which were bottles of wine , olives , oranges , and other most rare luxuries . Beside him sat a young man  --  his younger self . Linwood did not need a second glance to assure him this was Captain Ruthven . On a stool at her brother 's feet sat Charlotte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the other extremity of the table , examining , with enraptured eye , caps , feathers , and flowers , which , as appeared from the boxes and cords beside her , had just been opened . But the parties that fixed Linwood 's attention were Helen Ruthven and a very handsome young man , who was leaning over her chair while she was playing on the piano , and bestowing on him those wondrous glances that Linwood had verily believed never met an eye but his ! What a sudden disenchantment was that ! Linwood 's blood rushed to his head . He stood as if he were transfixed , till a sudden movement within recalling him to himself , he sprang from the steps and retraced his way up the hill-side :  --  the spell that had wellnigh bound him to Helen Ruthven was broken for ever . No man likes to be duped ,  --  no man likes to feel how much his own vanity has had to do with preparing the trap that insnared him . Linwood , after revolving the past , after looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him , after comparing his passion for Helen Ruthven with his sentiments for Bessie Lee , came to the consoling conclusion that he had never loved Miss Ruthven . He was right  --  and that night , for the first time in many weeks , he fell asleep thinking of Bessie Lee . On the following morning Linwood confided to Eliot the denoeument of his little romance . Eliot was rejoiced that his friend 's illusion should be dispelled in any mode . After some discussion of the matter , they came to the natural conclusion that a clandestine intercourse had been for some time maintained by the family at the glen with the strangers on board the sloop-of-war , and that there were reasons for shaking Linwood and Eliot off more serious than Linwood 's flirtation having been superseded by a fresher and more exciting one . In the course of the morning Eliot , in returning from a ride , at a sudden turn in the road came upon General Washington and Mr. Ruthven , who had just met . Eliot was making his passing salutation when General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will ride in together . " While Eliot paused , he heard Mr. Ruthven say , " You will not disappoint me , general ,  --  Wednesday evening , and a quiet hour  --  not with hat and whip in hand , but time enough to drink a fair bottle of Helicon , ' as poor Randolph used to call it  --  there are but two left , and we shall ne'er look upon its like again . Wednesday evening  --  remember . " General Washington assented , and the parties were separating , when Mr. Ruthven , in his cordial manner , stretched out his hand to Eliot , saying , " My dear fellow , I should ask you too ; but the general and I are old friends , and I want a little talk with him , by ourselves , of old times . Besides , no man , minus forty , must have a drop of my Helicon ; ' but come down soon and see the girls ,  --  they are Helicon enough for you young fellows , hey ? " As Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Washington , " as true-hearted a man as ever breathed . We were born on neighbouring plantations . Our fathers and grandfathers were friends . Our hearts were cemented in our youth , or at least in my youth , for he is much my elder , but his is a heart always fusible . Poor man , he has had much ill-luck in life ; but the worst , and the worst , let me tell you , my young friend , that can befall any man , was an ill-starred marriage . His wife is the daughter of a good-for-nothing Frenchman ; bad blood , Mr. Lee . The children show the cross  --  I beg Miss Charlotte 's pardon , she is a nice girl , fair Virginia stock ; but Miss Helen is  --  very like her mother . The son I do not know ; but his fighting against his country is prim facie evidence against him . " The conversation then diverged to other topics . There was in Eliot that union of good sense , keen intelligence , manliness , and modesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Eliot had the happiness , for a half hour , of hearing him whom of all men he most honoured , talk freely , and of assuring himself that this great man did not , as was sometimes said of him , " A wilful stillness entertain , With purpose to be dress 'd in an opinion Of wisdom ; " but that his taciturnity was the result of profound thought , anxiously employed on the most serious subjects . Late in the afternoon of the same day , Linwood received a note from Helen Ruthven , enclosing one to General Washington , of which , after entreating him to deliver it immediately , she thus explained the purport . " It contains a simple request to your mighty commander-in-chief , to permit me to visit my brother on board his vessel . I know that Washington 's heart is as hard as Pharaoh 's , and as unrelenting as Brutus 's ; still it is not , it can not be in man to refuse such a request to the daughter of an old friend . Do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and win the everlasting gratitude of your unworthy but always devoted friend , Helen Ruthven . " " Urge it ! " exclaimed Linwood , as he finished the note , " urge General Washington ! I should as soon think of urging the sun to go backward or forward ; but I 'll present it for you , my devoted friend , Helen , ' and in merely doing that my heart will be in my mouth . " He obtained an audience . General Washington read the note , and turning to Linwood , asked him if he knew its purport . " Yes , sir , " replied Linwood , " and I can not , " he ventured to add , " but hope you will find it fitting to gratify a desire so natural . " " Perfectly natural ; Miss Ruthven tells me she has not seen her brother for four years . " Linwood felt his honest blood rush to his face at this flat falsehood from his friend Helen . Washington perceived the suffusion and misinterpreted it . " You think it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are many hard cases in this unnatural war . It grieves me to refuse Helen Ruthven  --  the child of my good friend . " He passed his eye again over the note , and there was an expression of displeasure and contempt in his curling lip as he read such expressions as the following : " I can not be disappointed , for I am addressing one who unites all virtues , whose mercy even surpasses his justice . "  --  " I write on my knees to him who is the minister of Providence , dispensing good and evil , light and blessing , with a word . " General Washington threw down the note , saying , " Miss Ruthven should remember that flattery corrupts the giver as well as the receiver . I have no choice in this matter . We have an inflexible rule prohibiting all intercourse with the enemy . " He then wrote a concise reply , which Linwood sent to the lady in a blank envelope . " Ah ! " thought Helen Ruthven , as she opened it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mais n'importe . Mr. Herbert Linwood , you may run free now ; I have nobler prey in my toils . " She unsealed General Washington 's note , and after glancing her eye over it , she tore it into fragments and dispersed it to the winds , exclaiming , " I 'll risk my life to carry my point ; and if I do , I 'll humble you , and have a glorious revenge ! " She spent a sleepless night in contriving , revolving , and dismissing plans on which , as she fancied , the destiny of the nation hung , and , what was far more important in her eyes , Helen Ruthven 's destiny . She at last adopted the boldest that had occurred , and which , from being the boldest , best suited her dauntless temper . The next morning , Tuesday , with her mother 's aid and applause , she effected her preparations ; and having fortunately learned , during her residence on the river , to row and manage a boat , she embarked alone in a little skiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she rowed into the current and dropped down the river . She did not expect to escape observation , for though the encampment did not command a view of the Hudson , there were sentinels posted at points that overlooked it , and batteries that commanded its passage . But rightly calculating on the general humanity that governed our people , she had no apprehensions they would fire on a defenceless woman , and very little fear that they would think it worth while to pursue her , to prevent that which she dared to do before their eyes and in the face of day . Her calculations proved just . The sentinels levelled their guns at her , in token not to proceed ; and she in return dropped her head , raised her hands deprecatingly , and passed on unmolested . At a short distance below the Point there is a remarkable spot , scooped out by nature in the rocky bank , always beautiful , and now a consecrated shrine  --  a " Mecca of the mind . " On the memorable morning of Miss Ruthven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he rose in the heavens , casting behind him a soft veil of light clouds , shone on the gray rocks , freshening herbage , and still disrobed trees of this lovely recess . From crevices in the perpendicular rocks that wall up the table-land above , hung a sylvan canopy ; cedars , studded with their blue berries , wild raspberries , and wild rose-bushes ; and each moist and sunny nook was gemmed with violets and wild geraniums . The harmonies of nature 's orchestra were the only and the fitting sounds in this seclusion : the early wooing of the birds ; the water from the fountains of the heights , that , filtering through the rocks , dropped from ledge to ledge with the regularity of a water-clock ; the ripple of the waves as they broke on the rocky points of the shore , or softly kissed its pebbly margin ; and the voice of the tiny stream , that , gliding down a dark , deep , and almost hidden channel in the rocks , disappeared , and welled up again in the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trickled down the lower ledge of granite to the river . Tradition has named this little green shelf on the rocks " Kosciusko 's Garden ; " but as no traces have been discovered of any other than nature 's plantings , it was probably merely his favourite retreat , and as such is a monument of his taste and love of nature . The spring is now enclosed in a marble basin , and inscribed with his name who then lay extended beside it : Kosciusko , the patriot of his own country , the friend of ours , the philanthropist of all , the enemy only of those aliens from the human family who are the tyrants of their kind . An unopen book lay beside him , while , gazing up through the willows that drooped over the fountain , he perused that surpassing book of nature , informed by the spirit and written by the finger of God  --  a Book of revelations of his wisdom , and power , and goodness . Suddenly his musings were disturbed by approaching footsteps ; and looking up , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piled rocks . He had scarcely exchanged salutations with them , when the little boat in which Helen Ruthven was embarked shot out from behind the dark ledge that bounded their upward view of the river . They sprang forward to the very edge of the sloping ground . Helen Ruthven would most gladly have escaped their observation , but that she perceived was impossible ; and making the very best of her dilemma , she tossed her head exultingly , and waved her handkerchief . The young men instinctively returned her greeting . " A gallant creature , by Heaven ! " exclaimed the Pole ; " God speed you , my girl ! " And when Linwood told him who she was , and her enterprise , so far as he thought fit to disclose it , he reiterated , " Again then , I say , God speed her ! The sweetest affections of nature should be free as this gushing rill , that the rocks and the earth ca n't keep back ; I am glad when they throw off the shackles imposed by the cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze after the boat till it turned and disappeared with the river in its winding passage through the mountains . On Wednesday morning it appeared that the sloop-of-war had changed her position , and approached as nearly to West Point as was possible without coming within the range of its guns . " I am convinced , " said Linwood to Eliot , taking up the thread of conversation where they had dropped it the day before , " I am convinced there is a plot brewing . " " I am apprehensive of it too . Our obvious duty , Linwood , is to go to General Washington , and tell him all we know of the Ruthvens . " " My service to you !  --  no , he is the wariest of human beings , and has grounds enough for suspicion without our prompting . Ca n't he put this and that together  --  the old man 's pressing invitation , Helen 's flight , and the movement of the vessel ? " " Ah , if his suspicions were excited , as ours are , by previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in his old friend ; he is uninformed of the strong tory predilections of the whole family ; and , though he does not like Helen Ruthven , he has no conception of what we have tolerable proof , that she has the talents of a regular bred French intriguer . Besides , as the fact of your having seen those men at the glen proves the practicability of their visiting it again , the general should certainly be apprized of it . ' " No , Eliot , I 'll not consent to it  --  this is my game , and I must control it . It is a violation of the Arab bread-and-salt rule , to communicate that which was obtained by our friendly intimacy at the glen . " " I think you are wrong , Linwood ; it is a case where an inferior obligation should yield to a superior one . " " I do n't comprehend your metaphysical reasoning , Eliot ; I govern myself by the obligations I feel . " " By the dictates of your conscience , my dear fellow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general , with or without you . " " Not with me  --  no , I 'll not tell him what I know , that 's flat ; and as to being questioned and cross-questioned by him , heavens and earth ! when he but bends his awful brow upon me , I feel as if my heart were turning inside out . No , I 'll not go near him . Why ca n't we write an anonymous letter ? " " I do not like anonymous letters  --  my course appears plain to me , so good morning to you . " " One moment , Eliot  --  remember , not a word of what I saw through the window at the glen . " " Certainly not , if you insist . " Eliot then went to the general 's markee , and was told he would see him in two hours . Eliot returned at the precise moment , and was admitted . " You are punctual , Mr. Lee , " said the commander , " and I thank you for it . A young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play requires the lover to be ! he should not break a part of the thousandth part of a minute . ' Your business , sir ? " Eliot was beginning to disclose it , when they were interrupted by a servant , who handed General Washington a note . A single involuntary glance at the superscription assured Eliot it was from Linwood . General Washington opened it , and looked first for the signature , as one naturally does at receiving a letter in an unknown hand . " Anonymous ! " he said ; and refolding without reading a word of it , he lighted it in a candle , still burning on the desk where he had been sealing letters , and suffered it to consume ; saying , " This is the way I now serve all anonymous letters , Mr. Lee . Men in public life are liable to receive many such communications , and to have their minds disturbed , and sometimes poisoned , by them . They are the resort of the cowardly or the malignant . An honest man will sustain by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no rule of universal application to the versatile mind of man , " thought Eliot , and his heart burned to justify his friend ; when the general reminding him they had no time to lose , he proceeded concisely to state his apprehensions and their grounds . Washington listened to him without interruption , but not without an appaling change of countenance . " I have heard you through , Mr. Lee , " he said ; " your apprehensions are perhaps natural ; at any rate , I thank you for frankly communicating them to me ; but , be assured , your suspicions have no foundation . Do you think such vile treachery could be plotted by a Virginian , my neighbour , my friend of thirty years , my father 's friend , when all the grievous trials of this war have not produced a single traitor ? No , no , Mr. Lee , I would venture my life  --  my country , on the cast of Ruthven 's integrity . If I do not lightly give my confidence , I do not lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eliot left Washington 's presence , half convinced himself that his suspicions were unfounded . It never occurred to Washington or to Eliot that there might be a conspiracy without Mr. Ruthven being a party to it , and the supposition that he was so invalidated all the evidences of a plot . In the afternoon Kisel asked leave to avail himself of a permit which Eliot had obtained for him , to go on the opposite side of the river to a little brook , whence he had often brought a mess of trout for the officers ' table ; for our friend Kisel was skilled in the craft of angling , and might have served Cruikshank for an illustration of Johnson 's definition of the word , " a fishing-rod , with a bait at one end and a fool at the other ; " but happily , as it proved , our fool had some " subtlety in his simplicity . " Eliot gave him the permission , with directions to row up to the glen when he returned , and await him there . Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the margin of the river , where , in case ( a chance that seemed to him at least possible ) of the approach of an enemy 's boat , he should descry it in time to give Washington warning . He went in search of Linwood , to ask him to accompany him ; but Linwood was nowhere to be found . He deliberated whether to communicate his apprehensions to some other officer . The confidence the general had manifested had nearly dissipated his apprehensions , and he feared to do what might appear like officiousness , or like a distrust of Washington 's prudence ; that virtue , which , to remain , as it then was , the bulwark of his country 's safety , must continue unsuspected . Eliot in his anxiety had reached the glen while it was yet daylight ; and , careful to escape observation , he stole along the little strip of pebbly beach where a mimic bay sets in , and seated himself on a pile of rocks , the extreme point of a hill that descends abruptly to the Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountains , has the appearance of a lake ; for the passage is so narrow and winding through which it forces its way , that the eye scarcely detects it . Eliot for a while forgot the tediousness of his watch in looking around him . The mountains at the entrance of the Hudson into the highlands , which stand like giant sentinels jealously guarding the narrow portal , appeared , whence he saw them , like a magnificent framework to a beautiful picture . An April shower had just passed over , and the mist was rolling away like the soft folds of a curtain from the village of Newburgh , which looked like the abode of all " country contentments , " as the setting sun shone cheerily on its gentle slopes and white houses , contrasting it with the stern features of the mountains . Far in the distance , the Catskills , belted by clouds , appeared as if their blue heads were suspended in the atmosphere and mingling with the sky , from which an eye familiar with their beautiful outline could alone distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to Eliot ; and as his eye again fell on the little glen sleeping in the silvery arms of the rills between which it lies  --  " can this place , " he thought , " so steeped in nature 's loveliness , so enshrined in her temple , be the abode of treachery ! It has been of heartlessness , coquetry , duplicity  --  ah , there is no power in nature , in the outward world , to convert the href= " http : **52;1381;TOOLONG ? i d=eaf345v1 &image=345-152.jpg"; name=f345-152Page image - Page 155. bad  --  blessings it has ; blessings manifold , for the good . " The spirit of man , alone in nature 's solitudes , is an instrument which she manages at will ; and Eliot , in his deepening seriousness and anxiety , felt himself answering to her changing aspect . The young foliage of the well-wooded little knoll that rises over the glen had looked fresh and feathery , and as bright as an infant awaking to happy consciousness ; but as the sun withdrew its beams , it appeared as dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when the last gleams of day had stolen up the side of the Crow 's Nest , shot over the summit of Break-neck , flushed the clouds and disappeared , and the wavy lines and natural terraces beyond Cold Spring , and the mass of rocks and pines of Constitution Island . were wrapped in sadcoloured uniform , Eliot shrunk from the influence of the general desolateness , and became impatient of his voluntary watch . One after another the kindly-beaming homelights shot forth from hill and valley , and Eliot 's eye catching that which flashed from Mr. Ruthven 's window , he determined on a reconnoitre ; and passing in front of the house he saw Washington and his host seated at a table , served with wine and nuts , but none of those tropical luxuries that had been manifestly brought to the glen by the stranger-guests from the sloop-of-war . Eliot 's heart gladdened at seeing the friends enjoying one of those smooth and delicious passages that sometimes vary the ruggedest path of life . That expression of repelling and immoveable gravity , that look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that characterized Washington 's face , had vanished like a cloud ; and it now serenely reflected the social affections ( bright and gentle spirits ! ) that , for the time , mastered his perplexing cares . He was retracing the period of his boyhood ; a period , however , cloudy in its passage , always bright when surveyed over the shoulder . He recalled his first field-sports , in which Ruthven had been his companion and teacher ; and they laughingly reviewed many an accident by flood and field . " No wonder , " thought Eliot , as in passing he glanced at Ruthven 's honest , jocund face ; " no wonder Washington would not distrust him ! " Eliot returned to his post . The stars had come out , and looked down coldly and dimly through a hazy atmosphere . The night was becoming obscure . A mist was rising ; and shortly after a heavy fog covered the surface of the river . Eliot wondered that Kisel had not made his appearance ; for , desultory as the fellow was , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole . Darkness is a wonderful magnifier of apprehended danger ; and , as it deepened , Eliot felt as if enemies were approaching from every quarter . Listening intently , he heard a distant sound of oars . He was all ear . " Thank Heaven ! " he exclaimed , " it is Kisel  --  a single pair of oars , and his plashy irregular dip ! " In a few moments he was discernible ; and nearing the shore , he jumped upon the rock where Eliot stood , crying out exultingly , " I 've dodged ' em , hey ! " " Softly , Kisel ; who have you dodged ? " " Them red birds in their borrowed feathers . Cheat me ? No . Ca n't I tell them that chops , and reaps , and mows , and thrashes , from them that only handles a sword or a gun , let ' em put on what ev'yday clothes they will ? " " Tell me , Kisel , plainly and quickly , what you mean . " A command from Eliot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marvellous effect in steadying Kisel 's wits ; and he answered with tolerable clearness and precision :  --  " I was cutting ' cross lots before sunset with a mess of trout , long as my arm  --  shiners ! when I stumbled on a bunch of fellows squatted ' mong high bushes . They held me by the leg , and said they 'd come down with provisions for Square Ruthven 's folks ; and they had not got a pass , and so must wait for nightfall ; and they 'd have me stay and guide ' em across , for they knew they might ground at low water if they did not get the right track . I mistrusted ' em . I knew by their tongues they came from below ; and so I cried , and told ' em I should get a whipping if I did n't get home afore sundown ; and one of ' em held a pistol to my head , loaded , primed , and cocked , and told me he 'd shoot my brains out if I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massy ! ' says I , do n't shoot  --  ' two n't do any good , for I hant got no brains , hey ! ' " " Never mind what you said or they said ; what did you do ? " " I did n't do nothing . They held me fast till night ; and then they pushed their boat out of a kind o ' hiding-place , and come alongside mine , and put me into it , and told me to pilot ' em . You know that sandy strip a bit off t' other shore ? I knew my boat would swim over it like a cob ,  --  and I guessed they 'd swamp , and they did ; diddle me if they did n't ! " " Are they there now ? " " There ! not if they 've the wit of sucking turkeys . The river there is not deep enough to drown a dead dog , and they might jump in and pull the boat out . " A slight westerly breeze was now rising , which lifted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river was suddenly unveiled , and Eliot descried a boat making towards the glen . " By Heaven ! there they are ! " he exclaimed ; " follow me , Kisel ; " and without entering the house , he ran to the stable close by . Fortunately , often having had occasion , during his visits at the glen , to bestow his own horse , he was familiar with the " whereabouts ; " and in one instant General Washington 's charger was bridled and at the door , held by Kisel ; while Eliot rushed into the house , and in ten words communicated the danger and the means of escape . General Washington said not a word till , as he sprang on the horse , Ruthven , on whose astounded mind the truth dawned , exclaimed , " I am innocent . " He replied , " I believe you . " Washington immediately galloped up the steep imbowered road to the Point . Eliot hesitated for a moment , doubting whether to attempt a retreat or remain where he was , when Mr. Ruthven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's sake , Mr. Lee ; stay , and witness to my innocence . " The imploring agony with which he spoke would have persuaded a more inflexible person than Eliot Lee . In truth , there was little use in attempting to fly , for the footsteps of the party were already heard approaching the house . They entered , five armed men , and were laying their hands on Eliot , when Mr. Ruthven 's frantic gestures , and his shouts of " He 's safe  --  he 's safe  --  he 's escaped ye ! " revealed to them the truth ; and they perceived what in their impetuosity they had over looked , that they held an unknown young man in their grasp instead of the priceless Washington ! Deep were the oaths they swore as they dispersed to search the premises , all excepting one young man , whose arm Mr. Ruthven had grasped , and to whom he said , " Harry , you 've ruined me  --  you 've made me a traitor in the eyes of Washington  --  the basest traitor ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me innocent ; but he will not when he reflects that it was I who invited him  --  who pressed him to come here this evening  --  the conspiracy seems evident  --  undeniable ! Oh , Harry , Harry , you and your mad sister have ruined me ! " The young man seemed deeply affected by his father 's emotion . He attempted to justify himself on the plea that he dared not set his filial feeling against the importance of ending the war by a single stroke ; but this plea neither convinced nor consoled his father . Young Ruthven 's associates soon returned , having abandoned their search , and announced the necessity of their immediate return to the boat . " You must go with us , sir , " said Ruthven to his father ; " for , blameless as you are , you will be treated by the rebels as guilty of treason . " " By Heaven , Harry , I 'll not go . I had rather die a thousand deaths  --  on the gallows , if I must  --  I 'll not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no alternative  --  you must aid me , " said young Ruthven to his companions . They advanced to seize his father . " Off  --  off ! " he cried , struggling against them . " I 'll not go a living man . " Eliot interposed ; and addressing himself to young Ruthven , said , " Believe me , sir , you are mistaking your duty . Your father 's good name must be dearer to you than his life ; and his good name is blasted for ever if in these circumstances he leaves here . But his life is in no danger  --  none whatever  --  he is in the hands of his friend , and that friend the most generous , as well as just , of all human beings . You misunderstand the temper of General Washington , if you think he would believe your father guilty of the vilest treachery without damning proof . " Young Ruthven was more than half convinced by Eliot , and his companions had by this time become impatient of delay . Their spirit had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now only anxious to secure a retreat to their vessel . They had some little debate among themselves whether they should make Eliot prisoner ; but , on young Ruthven 's suggestion that Lieutenant Lee 's testimony might be important to his father , they consented to leave him  --  one of them expressing in a whisper the prevailing sentiment , " We should feel sheepish enough to gain but a paltry knight when we expected a checkmate by our move . " In a few moments more they were off ; but not till young Ruthven had vainly tried to get a kind parting word from his father . " No , Harry , " he said , " I 'll not forgive you  --  I ca n't ; you 've put my honour in jeopardy  --  no , never ; " and as his son turned sorrowfully away , he added , " Never , Hal , till this cursed war is at an end . " Early next morning Eliot Lee requested an audience of Washington , and was immediately admitted , and most cordially received . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " you are safe , and here . I sent repeatedly to your lodgings last night , and hearing nothing , I have been exceedingly anxious . Satisfy me on one point , and then tell me what happened after my forced retreat . I trust in Heaven this affair is not bruited . " Eliot assured him he had not spoken of it to a human being  --  not even to Linwood ; and that he had enjoined strict secrecy on Kisel , on whose obedience he could rely . " Thank you  --  thank you , Mr. Lee , " said Washington , with a warmth startling from him , " I should have expected this from you  --  the generous devotion of youth , and the coolness and prudence of ripe age  --  a rare union . " Such words from him who never flattered and rarely praised , might well , as they did , make the blood gush from the heart to the cheeks . " I am most grateful for this approbation , sir , " said Eliot . " Grateful ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immense favour you have done me , beside words ; but the importance of keeping the affair secret precludes all other return . I think it will not transpire from the enemy ,  --  they are not like to publish a baffled enterprise . I am most particularly pleased that you went alone to the glen . In this instance I almost agree with Cardinal de Retz , who says , he held men in greater esteem for what they forbore to do than for what they did . ' I now see where I erred yesterday . It did not occur to me that there could be a plot without my friend being accessory to it . I did not err in trusting him . This war has cost me dear ; but , thank Heaven , it has not shaken , but fortified , my confidence in human virtue ! " Washington then proceeded to inquire into the occurrences at the glen after he left there , and ended with giving Eliot a note to deliver to Mr. Ruthven , which proved a healing balm to the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in new relations , often exhibited in new force and beauty the ties that bind together the human family . Sometimes , it is true , they were lightly snapped asunder , but oftener they manifested an all-resisting force , and a union that , as in some chymical combinations , no test could dissolve . CHAPTER XI . " Our will we can command . The effects of our actions we can not foresee . "  --  Montaigne . Herbert Linwood to his Sister . " July 30th , 1779 . " Dearest Belle ,  --  I write under the inspiration of the agreeable consciousness that my letter may pass under the sublime eye of your commander-in-chief , or be scanned and sifted by his underlings . I wish to Heaven that , without endangering your bright orbs , I could infuse some retributive virtue into my ink to strike them blind . But the deuse take them . I defy their oversight . I am not discreet enough to be trusted with military or political secrets , and therefore , like Hotspur 's Kate , I can betray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not flatter myself I have attained a moral eminence which I may challenge the world to survey , yet I 'll expose nothing to you , dear Belle , whose opinion I care more for than that of king , lords , and commons , which the whole world may not know without your loving brother being dishonoured thereby : so , on in my usual streak o ' lightning style , ' with facts and feelings . " You have before this seen the official account of our successful attack on Stony Point , and have doubtless been favoured with the additional light of Rivington 's comments , your veritable editor . These thralls of party editors ! The light they emit is like that of conjurers , intended to produce false impressions . " Do not imagine I am going to send you a regular report of the battle . With all due deference to your superior mental faculties , my dear , you are but a woman , and these concernments of vile guns ' must for ever remain mysteries to you . But , Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  thy vocation , Hal . ' " My friend Eliot Lee has a vein of quixotism , that reminds me of the inflammable gas I have seen issuing from a cool healthy spring . Doctor Kissam , you know , used to say every man had his insanity . Eliot 's appears in his affection for a half-witted follower , one Kisel ; the oddest fellow in this world . His life is a series of consecutive accidents , of good and bad luck . " On the 10th he had been out on the other side of the river , vagrantizing in his usual fashion , and returning late to his little boat , and , as we suspect , having fallen asleep , he drifted ashore at Stony Point . There he came upon the fort , and a string of trout ( which he is seldom without ) serving him as a passport , he was admitted within the walls , His simplicity , unique and inimitable , shielded him from suspicion , and a certain inspiration which seems always to come direct from Heaven at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he belonged to our army , and he was suffered to depart in peace . The observations he made ( he is often acute ) were of course communicated to his master , and by him made available to our enterprise . Eliot and myself were among the volunteers . He , profiting by Kisel 's hints , guided us safely through some sloughs of despond . ' With all his skill , we had a killing scramble over pathless mountains , and through treacherous swamps , under a burning sun , the mercury ranging somewhere between one and two hundred , so that my sal volatile blood seemed to have exhaled in vapour , and my poor body to be a burning coal , whose next state would be ashes . " Our General Wayne ( you will understand his temper from his nom de guerre , mad Anthony ' ) had ordered us to advance with unloaded muskets and fixed bayonets . He was above all things anxious to avoid an accidental discharge , which might alarm the garrison . At eight in the evening we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there the detachment halted ; while Wayne , with Eliot and some other officers , went to reconnoitre . They had approached within gunshot of the works , when poor Kisel , who away from Eliot is like an unweaned child , and who had been all day wandering in search of him , suddenly emerged from the wood , and in a paroxysm of joy discharged his musket . Wayne sprang forward , and would have transfixed him with his bayonet , had not Eliot thrown himself before Kisel , and turned aside Wayne 's arm : some angry words followed , but it ended in the general leaving Kisel to be managed by Eliot 's discretion . The general 's displeasure , however , against Eliot , did not subside at once . " When the moment for attack came , I felt myself shivering , not with fear , no , franchement ' ( as our old teacher Dubois used to say on the few occasions when he meant to tell the truth ) , franchement , not with fear , but with the recollection of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fierce contest were before me , and my father 's curse rung in my ears like the voices that turned the poor wretches in the Arabian tale into stone . Once in the fight , it was forgotten ; all men are bulldogs then , and think of nothing past or to come . " They opened a tremendous fire upon us ; it was the dead of night , Belle , and rather a solemn time , I assure you . Our commander was wounded by a musket ball : he fell , and instantly rising on one knee , he cried , Forward , my brave boys , forward . ' The gallant shout gave us a new impulse ; and we rushed forward , while Eliot Lee , with that singular blending of cool courage and generosity which marks him , paused and assisted the general 's aid in bearing him on , in compliance with the wish he had expressed ( believing himself mortally wounded ) , that he might die in the fort . Thank God , he survived ; and being as magnanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot 's gallantry and good conduct throughout the whole affair , and particularly dwelt on the aid he had given him , after having received from him injurious epithets . In consequence of all this , Eliot is advanced to the rank of captain . Luck is a lord , Belle ; I would fain have distinguished myself , but I merely , like the rest , performed my part honourably , for which I received the thanks of General Washington , and got my name blazoned in the report to Congress . " I hear that Helen Ruthven is dashing away in New-York , not , as I expected , after her romantic departure hence , as the honourable Mrs. O  --  . Well ! all kind vestals guard her ! Heaven knows she needs their vigilance . Rumour says , too , that you are shortly to vow allegiance to my royalist friend . God bless you ! my dear sister . If it were true ( alas ! nothing is more false ) that matches are made in Heaven , I know who would be your liege-lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boyhood ! my youth , my maturity , I believed Heaven had surely made . It is a musty proverb , that . Farewell , Belle ; kiss my dear mother for me , and tell her I would not have her , like the old Scotch woman , pray for our side , right or wrong , ' but let her pray for the right side , and then her poor son will be sure to prosper . Oh , would that I could , without violating my duty to my country , throw myself at my father 's feet . His loyalty is not truer to King George , than mine to him . " Dearest Belle , may Heaven reunite us all . " Yours , H. Linwood . " P. S.  --  Kind love , do n't forge it , to Rose . " Section A day or two after Herbert 's letter was despatched , Eliot received a summons from Washington ; and on his appearing before him , the general said , " I have important business to be transacted in New-York , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton . My agent must be intrusted with discretionary powers . An expedition to New-York , even with the protection of a flag of truce , is hazardous . The intervening country is infested with outlaws , who respect no civilized usages . My emissary must be both intrepid and prudent . I have therefore selected you . Will you accept the mission ? " " Most gratefully , sir  --  but  --  " " But what ? if you have scruples , name them . " " None in the world , sir ; on my own account I should be most happy , but I should be still happier if the office might be assigned to Linwood . It would afford him the opportunity he pines for , of seeing his family . " " That is a reason , if there were no other , why Captain Linwood should not go . Some embarrassment might arise . Your friend has not the coolness essential in exigencies . " Eliot well knew that Washington was not a man with whom to bandy arguments , and he at once declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability , whatever duty should be imposed on him ; and it was settled that he should depart as soon as his instructions could be made out . Eliot soon after met Linwood , and communicated his intended expedition . " You are always under a lucky star , " said Linwood ; " I would have given all I am worth for this appointment . " " And you certainly should have it if it were mine to bestow . " " I do not doubt it , not in the least ; but is it not hard ? Eliot , I am such a light-hearted wretch , for the most part , that you really have no conception how miserable my father 's displeasure makes me . I do n't understand how it is . The laws of Heaven are harmonious , and certainly my conscience acquits me , yet I suffer most cruelly for my breach of filial obedience . If I could but see my father , eye to eye , I am sure I could persuade him to recall that curse , that rings in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half hour in New-York would be my salvation ! The sight of Belle and my mother would be heaven to me ! Do n't laugh at me , Eliot , " he continued , wiping his eyes , " I am a calf when I think of them all . " " Laugh at you , Linwood ! I could cry with joy if I could give my place to you ; as it is , I must hasten my preparations . I have obtained leave to take Kisel with me . " " Kisel ! heaven forefend , Eliot . Do you know what ridicule such a valet-de-place as Kisel will call down on your head from those lordly British officers ? " " Yes , I have thought of that , and it would be sheer affectation to pretend to be indifferent to it ; but I can bear it . Providence has cast Kisel upon my protection , and if I leave him he will be sure to run his witless head into some scrape that will give me ten times more trouble than his attendance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always wilful . " After a few moments ' thoughtful silence , he added , " How long before you start , Eliot ? " " The general said it might be two hours before my instructions and passports were made out . " " It will be dark then , and , " added Linwood , after a keen survey of the heavens , " I think , very dark . " " Like enough ; but that is not so very agreeable a prospect as one would infer from the tone of your voice . " " Pardon me , my dear fellow ; it was New-York I was thinking of , and not any inconvenience you might encounter from the obscurity of the night Your passports are not made out ? " " Not yet . " " Do me a favour , then  --  let Kisel ride my gray . I can not endure the thought of the harlequin spectacle you 'll furnish forth , riding down the Broadway with your squire mounted on Beauty ; besides , the animal is not equal to the expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kindness as freely as you offer it . You have relieved me of my only serious embarrassment . Now get your letters ready ; any thing unsealed ( my orders are restricted to that ) I will take charge of , and deliver at your father 's door . " " My father 's door ! " exclaimed Linwood , snapping his fingers with a sort of wild exultation that made Eliot stare , " oh , what a host of images those words call up ! but as to the letters , there is no pleasure in unsealed ones ; I sent a bulletin of my health to Belle yesterday ; I have an engagement that will occupy me till after your departure ; so farewell , and good luck to you , Eliot . " The friends shook hands and parted . The twilight was fading into night when Eliot was ready for his departure . To his great vexation Kisel was missing ; and he was told he had ridden forward , and had left word that he would await his master at a certain point about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits were so desultory that they never excited surprise , though they would have been intolerable to one less kind-tempered than Eliot Lee . He found him at the point named . He had reined his horse up against the fence , and was awaiting his master , as Eliot saw , for he could just descry the outline of his person lying back to back to the horse , his legs encircling the animal 's neck . " Sit up , Kisel , " said his master , in an irritated tone ; " remember you are riding a gentleman 's horse that 's not accustomed to such tricks . And now I tell you , once for all , that unless you behave yourself quietly and reasonably , I will send you adrift . " Kisel whistled . He always either replied by a whistle or tears to Eliot 's reproof , and the whistle now , as usual , was followed by a fit of sulkiness . The night was misty and very dark . Kisel , in spite of sundry kind overtures from his master , remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus they travelled all night , merely stopping at the farmhouses to which they had been directed to refresh their horses . On these occasions Kisel was unusually zealous in performing the office of groom , and seemed to have made a most useful transfer of the nimbleness of his tongue to his hands . The dawn found them within the enemy 's lines , at twenty miles distance from the city of New-York , and in sight of a British post designated in their instructions where they were to stop , exhibit their flag of truce , show their passports , and obtain others to the city . " Now , Kisel , " said Eliot , " you must have done with your fooleries ; you will disgrace me if you do not behave like a man ; pull up your cap  --  do not bury your face so in the collar of your coat  --  sit upright . " Kisel threw the reins upon his horse 's neck , affected to arrange his cap and coat , and in doing so dropped his whip . This obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he did as if he had clogs at his heels . In the meantime Eliot spurred on his horse , and rode up to the door where the enemy 's guard was stationed . His passports were examined , and returned to him countersigned . He passed on ; and the guard was giving a cursory glance at the attendant , when it seemed to strike him there was some discrepance between the description and the actual person . " Stop , my man , " said he , " let 's have another glance . Crooked , ill-made person ; ' yes , crooked enough  --  sandy hair ; ' yes , by Jove , sandy as a Scotchman 's  --  gray eyes , small and sunken ; ' gray to be sure , but neither small nor sunken . " " Well , now , " said Kisel , with beseeching simplicity , and looking eagerly after Eliot , who was watering his horse at a brook a few rods in advance of him ; " well , now , I say , do n't hender me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so big as an ox 's , nor tant so small as a mole 's ; and folks will dispute all the way ' twixt the two : so what signifies keeping captain waiting ? " " Well , well , it must be right  --  go on . I do n't know , though , " muttered the inquisitor , as Kisel rode off at a sharp trot  --  " d  --  n these Yankees , they 'd cheat the devil . The passport said , a turnup nose '  --  this fellow 's is as straight as an arrow . Here , halloo , sirs ,  --  back . " But Kisel , instead of heeding the recall , though seconded by his master , galloped forward , making antic gestures , laughing and shouting ; and Eliot , bitterly repenting his indiscretion in bringing him , retraced his steps . He found the inspector 's faculties all awakened by the suspicion that he had been outwitted . " My friend , " said Eliot , reproducing his passports , " this detention is unnecessary and discourteous . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here described ; and I give you my honour that my companion is the attendant specified . He is a fellow of weak wits , as you may see by his absurd conduct , who can impose on no one , much less on a person of your keenness . " " That is to say , if he is he . But I suppose you know , sir , that a wolf can wear a sheep 's clothing . There are so many rebels that have connexions in the city , outside friends to his majesty , that we are obliged to keep a sharp look-out . " " Certainly , my friend : all that you say is perfectly reasonable , and I respect you for doing your duty . But you must be satisfied now , and will have the goodness to permit me to proceed . " The man was conciliated ; and after making an entry in his note-book , he again returned the passports . Eliot put spurs to his horse ; and as the man gazed after him , he said , " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that face ; but that wo n't serve him now-a-days without endorsements . That other fellow I doubt . Well , I 'll just forward these notes I have taken down to Colonel Robertson , and he 'll be on the look-out . " In the meantime Eliot followed Kisel at full speed ; but , after approaching him within a few yards , he perceived he did not gain an inch on him ; and , apprehensive that such forced riding might injure Linwood 's horse , or , at any rate , that the smoking sides of both the steeds would excite suspicion , he reined his in , and wondered what new demon had taken possession of Kisel ; for , while he now rode at a moderate pace , he had the mortification of seeing that Kisel exactly , and with an accuracy he had never manifested in any other operation , measured his horse 's speed by his master 's , so as to preserve an undeviating distance from him . Thus they proceeded till they approached Kingsbridge , where a British picket was stationed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse abreast to Eliot 's . The horse seemed to take alarm at the colours that were flying from the British flagstaff , and reared , whirled around , and curvetted , so as to require all his rider 's adroitness to keep on his back . Meanwhile the passports were being examined , and they were suffered to proceed without a particular investigation . They had passed the bridge , and beyond observation , when Eliot , who was still in advance of his attendant , turned suddenly round with the intention of trying the whole force of a moral battery ; but he was surprised by a coup de main that produced a sudden and not very agreeable shock to his ideas . His follower 's slouched and clownish attitude was gone ; and in its place an erect and cavalier bearing . His head was raised from the muffler that had half buried it  --  his cap pushed back , and from beneath shone the bright laughing eye of Herbert Linwood . " Now , Eliot , my dear fellow , " he said , stretching out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if you liked the knave less than the fool . " " If I do look so , Linwood , it is because fools are easier protected than knaves . It is impossible to foresee what may be the consequence of this rash business . " " Oh , hang the consequence . I wish you would get over that Yankee fashion of weighing every possible danger ; you are such a cautious race . " " Granted , Linwood , we are ; and I think it will take all my caution to get us out of a scrape that your heroism has plunged us into . " The first shaft of Linwood 's petulance had glanced off from the shield of his friend 's good-temper , and he had not another . " I confess , " he said , in an altered voice , " that the boldness is worse than questionable that involves others in our own danger . But consider my temptations , and then try , my dear fellow , to pardon my selfishness . I have lived three years in exile  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's house . I am suffering the wretchedness of his displeasure ; and am absolutely famishing for the faces and voices of home . I could live a week upon the ticking of the old hall-clock . " " But what satisfaction can you expect , Linwood ? You have always told me you believed your father 's displeasure was invincible  --  " " Oh , I do n't know that . His bark is worse than his bite . I can not calculate probabilities . One possibility outweighs a million of them . I shall at any rate see my sister  --  my peerless , glorious sister , and my mother . And , after all , what is the risk ? If you did not detect me , others will not , surely . " " You did not give me a chance . " " Nor will I them . The only catastrophe I fear is the possibility of General Washington finding me out . But it was deused crabbed of him not to give me the commission . He ought to know that a man ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than he performs . " " That is true enough ; but is it reasonable to require of children to bear the burdens of men ?  --  of common men to do the deeds of heroes ? " " I believe there is no limit , but in our will , to our moral power . " " Pshaw !  --  and I believe the moral power of each individual can be measured as accurately as his stature . But we are running our heads into metaphysics , and shall get lost in a fog . " " A New-England fog , Linwood ? " " They prevail there , " he answered , with a quizzical smile . " But we are wandering from the point . I really have taken all possible precautions to keep my secret . I obtained leave for four days ' absence on the pretext that I was going up the river on my private business . The only danger arises from my having been compelled to make a confidant of Kisel . " " That occurred to me . How in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I conjured in your name . I made him believe that your safety depended on his implicitly obeying my directions ; so I obtained his holyday suit ( which you must confess is a complete disguise ) , and sent him on a fool 's errand up the river . " The friends entered the city by passing the pickets at the Bowery . They were admitted without scruple :  --  letting animals into a cage is a very different affair from letting them out . At Linwood 's suggestion they crossed into Queen-street . That great mart , now stored with the products of the commercial world , and supplying millions from its packed warehouses , was then chiefly occupied by the residences of the provincial gentry . Linwood had resumed his mufflers and his clownish air ; but the true man from the false exterior growled forth many an anathema as he passed house after house belonging to the whig absentees  --  his former familiar haunts  --  now occupied , and , as he thought , desecrated by British officers , or resident royalists whose loyalty was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor left , I pray you , Linwood , " said Eliot ; " you are now in danger of being recognised . We are to stop at Mrs. Billings 's , in Broad-street . " " Just above my father 's house , " replied Linwood , in a sad tone . They rode on briskly ; for they perceived that Eliot 's American uniform and grotesque attendant attracted observation . They had entered Broad-street , and were near a large double house , with the carving about the doors and windows that distinguished the more ambitious edifices of the provincialists . Two horses , equipped for their riders , stood at the door , and a black servant in faded livery beside them . The door opened ; and a gentleman of lofty stature , attended by a young lady , came forth . She patted the animal that awaited her , and sprang into the saddle . " It must be Isabella Linwood ! " thought Eliot , turning his asking eye to his companion , who , he now perceived , had reined in his horse towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his observation were . " He is right and careful for once , " thought Eliot . That Eliot would have thought it both right and inevitable to have indulged himself in a nearer survey of the beautiful young lady , we do not doubt ; but as he again turned , her horse suddenly reared his hind legs in the air . Her father screamed  --  there were several persons passing  --  no one dared approach the animal , who was whirling , floundering , and kicking furiously . Some , gazing at Miss Linwood , exclaimed , " She 'll be dashed to pieces ! "  --  and others , " Lord , how she sits ! " She did sit bravely ; her face colourless as marble , and her dark eyes flashing fire-Eliot and Linwood instinctively dismounted , and at the risk of their lives rushed to her rescue ; and , at one breath 's intermission of the kicking , stood on either side of the animal 's head . She was an old acquaintance and favourite of Linwood , and with admirable presence of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a loud tone , in his accustomed phrase , " Jennet  --  Jennet , softly  --  softly ! " The animal was quieted ; and , as Linwood afterward affirmed , spoke as plainly to him with her eye as ever human voice spoke . At any rate , she stood perfectly still while Eliot assisted the young lady to dismount . The people now gathered round ; and at the first burst of inquiry and congratulation , Herbert disappeared . " Thank God . you are not hurt , Belle ! " exclaimed her father , whose voice , though choked with emotion , was heard above all others . " What in Heaven 's name possessed Jennet ?  --  she never kicked before ; and how in the world did you quiet her , sir ? " turning to Eliot . " It was most courageously done ! " " Miraculously ! " said Miss Linwood ; her face , as she turned it to Eliot , beaming with gratitude . There are voices that , at their first sound , seem to strike a new chord that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard pronounced by Isabella Linwood , often afterward rung in his ears like a remembered strain of sweet music . There were persons present , however , not occupied with such high emotions ; and while Eliot was putting in a disclaimer , and saying , if there were any merit attending arresting the horse , it was his servant 's , diligent search was making into the cause of the animal 's transgression , which soon appeared in the form of a thorn , that , being entangled in the saddle-cloth , had pierced her side . The first flow of Mr. Linwood 's gratitude seemed to have been suddenly checked . " Papa has seen the blue coat , " thought Isabella ; " and the gushings of his heart are turned to icicles ! " And infusing into her own manner the warmth lacking in his , she asked what name she should associate with her preservation . " My name is Lee . " " A very short one . May we prefix Harry or Charles ? " alluding to two distinguished commanders in the American army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame . Eliot . " " Eliot Lee !  --  Herbert 's friend !  --  Bessie 's brother ! Papa , you do not understand . Mr. Lee is the brother of your little pet , Bessie Lee , and , " she added , " Herbert 's best friend . " Her father coloured ; and civilly hoped Miss Bessie Lee was well . " Well ! that is nothing , " exclaimed Miss Linwood . " We hope all the world is well ; but I must know where Bessie is  --  what she is doing  --  how she is looking , and a thousand million et ceteras . Papa , Mr. Lee must come home with us . " " Certainly , Isabella , if Mr. Lee chooses . " Thus bidden , Mr. Lee could only choose to refuse , which he did ; alleging that he had no time at his own disposal . Isabella looked pained , and Mr. Linwood felt uncomfortable ; and making an effort at an amende honorable , he said , " Pray send your servant to me , sir ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Heaven smiles on Herbert ! " thought Eliot ; and he replied eagerly , " I will most certainly send him , sir , this evening , at eight o'clock . " He then bowed to Mr. Linwood , took Isabella 's hand , which she again graciously extended to him , and thanking her for her last kind words  --  " Best  --  best love to Bessie ; be sure you do n't forget it , " he mounted his horse and was off . " Send him ! " said Mr. Linwood , reiterating Eliot 's last words . " I 'll warrant him !  --  trust a Yankee for not letting slip a shilling . " " He is quite right , papa . If he can not obtain the courtesy due to the gentleman in return for the service he has rendered , he is right to secure the reward of the menial . You were savage , sir  --  absolutely savage . Mr. Lee will think we are barbarians  --  heathens  --  any thing but Christians . " " And so am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This young man did only what any other young man would have done upon instinct ; so do n't pester me any more about him . You know , Belle , I have sworn no rebel shall enter my doors . " " And you know , sir , that I have  --  not sworn ; oh , no ! but resolved , and my resolve is the feminine of my father 's oath , that you shall hang me on a gallows high as Haman 's , before I cease to plead that our doors may be opened to one rebel at least . " " Never , never ! " replied her father , shutting his hall-door after him as he spoke , as if all the rebel world were on the other side of it . CHAPTER XII . " Oui , je suis sr que vous m'aimez , mais je ne le suis pas que vous m'aimiez toujours. "  --  Moliere . When Eliot rejoined his friend at the appointed rendezvous , Mrs. Billings 's , Herbert listened most eagerly to every particular of Eliot 's meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over again for so thoughtfully smoothing the way for his interview with them in the evening . " Oh , Eliot , " he said , " may you never have such a hurricane in your bosom as I had when I stood by my father and Belle , and longed to throw myself at his feet , and take my sister into my arms . I believe I did kiss Jennet  --  what the deuse ailed the jade ? she is the gentlest creature that ever stepped . Never doubt my self-control after this , Eliot ! " Eliot 's apprehensions were not so easily removed . He perceived that Herbert was in a frame of mind unsuited to the cautious part he was to act . His feelings had been excited by his rencounter with his father and sister , and though he had passed through that trial with surprising self-possession , it had quite unfitted him for encountering the " botheration " ( so he called it ) that awaited him at Mrs. Billings 's . " We are in a beautiful predicament here , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ' cute Yankees , ' will not let us in till she has sent our names and a description of our persons to the Commandant Robertson 's :  --  this , she says , being according to his order . Now this can not be  --  I will not implicate you  --  thus far I have proceeded on my sole responsibility , and if any thing happens , I alone am liable for the consequences . Are your instructions to stop at this house positive ? " " Yes ; and if they were not , we might not be better able to evade this police regulation elsewhere . I will see my countrywoman  --  hawks wo n't pick out hawks ' e'en , ' you know they say ; perhaps one Yankee hawk may blind another . " A loud rap brought the hostess herself to the door , a sleek lady , who , Eliot thought , looked as if she might be diplomatized , though a Yankee , and entitled to the discretion of at least forty-five years . " Mrs. Billings , I presume ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Thank you , madam . Kisel , remain here while I speak with the lady . " Mrs. Billings looked at the master , then at the man , then hemmed , which being interpreted , meant , " I understand your mutual relations , " and then conducted Eliot to her little parlour , furnished with all the display she could command , and the frugality to which she was enforced , a combination not uncommon in more recent times . A carpet covered the middle of the floor , and just reached to the stately chairs that stood like grenadiers around the room , guarding the uncovered boards , the test of the house-wife 's neatness . One corner was occupied by a high Chinese lackered clock ; and another by a buffet filled with articles , like the poor vicar 's , " wisely kept for show , " because good for nothing else ; and between them was the chest of drawers , that so mysteriously combined the uses which modern artisans have distributed over sideboards , wardrobes , &c.; The snugness , order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a striking contrast to the nakedness and desolation of our soldier 's quarters , and the pleased and admiring glances with which Eliot surveyed the apartment were quite unaffected . " You are very pleasantly situated here , madam , " he said . " Why , yes ; as comfortably as I could expect . " " You are from Rhode Island , I believe , Mrs. Billings ? " " I am happy to own I am , sir ; " the expression of hostility with which the lady had begun the conference abated . It is agreeable to have such cardinal points in one 's history as where one comes from known  --  an indirect flattery , quite unequivocal . " I have been told , madam , " continued Eliot , " that you were a sufferer in the royal cause before you left your native state ? " " Yes , sir , I may say that ; but I have never regretted it . " " The lady 's loyalty is more conspicuous than her conjugal devotion , " thought Eliot , who remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had lost her husband . " No , madam , " he replied , " one can not regret sacrifices in a cause conscientiously espoused . " " Your sentiments meet my views , sir , exactly . " " But your sacrifices have been uncommon , Mrs. Billings ; you have left a lovely part of our country to shut yourself up here . " " That 's true , sir ; but you know one can do a great deal from a sense of duty . I am not a person that thinks of myself ; I feel as if I ought to be useful while I am spared . " Our self-sacrificing philanthropist was driving a business , the gains of which she had never dreamed of on her steril New-England farm . " I am glad to perceive , Mrs. Billings , that your sacrifices are in some measure rewarded . You have , I believe , the best patronage in the city ? " " Yes , sir ; I accommodate as many as I think it my duty to ; my lodgers are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , it is a pleasure to converse with one 's own people . The British officers are not sociable except among themselves . " " I assure you our meeting is a mutual pleasure , Mrs. Billings . May I hope for the accommodation of a room under your roof for a day or two ? " " I should be very happy to oblige you , sir . It appears to me to be a Christian duty to treat even our enemies kindly ; but our officers  --  I mean no offence , sir  --  look down upon the rebels , and I could not find it suitable to do what they would not approve . " " As to that , Mrs. Billings , you know we are liable to optical illusions in measuring heights  --  that nearest seems most lofty . " Eliot paused , for he felt he had struck too high a note for his auditor ; and lowering his pitch , he added , " you are a New-England woman , Mrs. Billings , and know we are not troubled by inequalities that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you find it convenient to oblige me , I shall not intrude on your lodgers , as I prefer taking my meals in my own room . " This arrangement obviated all objection on the part of the lady , and the matter was settled after she had hinted that a private table demanded extra pay . Eliot perceived he was in that common case where a man must pay his quid pro quo , and acknowledge an irrequitable obligation into the bargain : he therefore submitted graciously , acceded to the lady 's terms , and was profuse in thanks . Looking over the mantel-piece , and seeming to see , for the first time , a framed advertisement suspended there , " I perceive , madam , " he said , " that your lodgers are required to report themselves to the commandant ; but as my errand is from General Washington to Sir Henry Clinton , I imagine this ceremony will be superfluous ; somewhat like going to your servants for leave to stay in your house . After obtaining it from you , madam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then all is settled , Mrs. Billings . As my man is a stranger in the city , you will allow one of your servants to take a note for me to Sir Henry Clinton ? " " Certainly , sir . " Thus Eliot had secured an important point by adroitly and humanely addressing himself to the social sympathies of the good woman , who , though ycleped " a ' cute calculating Yankee , " was just that complex being found all the world over , made up of conceit , self-esteem , and good feeling ; with this difference , that , like most of her country people , she had been trained to the devotion of her faculties to the provident arts of getting along . In conformity to the answer received to his note , Eliot was at Sir Henry Clinton 's door precisely at half past one , and was shown into the library , there to await Sir Henry . The house then occupied by the English commander-in-chief , and afterward consecrated by the occupancy of Washington , is still standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted by its proprietors to retain its primitive form , and fortunately spared the profane touch of the demon of change ( soi-disant improvement ) presiding over the city corporation . In the centre of the library , which Eliot found unoccupied , was a table covered with the freshest English journals and other late publications : among them , Johnson 's political pamphlets , and a poetic emission of light from the star just then risen above the literary horizon  --  Hannah More . Eliot amused himself for a half hour with tossing these over , and then retired to an alcove formed by a temporary damask drapery , enclosing some bookcases , a sofa , and a window . This window commanded a view of the Battery , the Sound , indenting the romantic shores of Long Island , the generous Hudson , pouring into the bay its tributary waters , and both enfolding in their arms the infant city , ordained by nature to be the queen of our country . " Ah ! " thought Eliot , as his eye passed exultingly over the beautiful scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay anchored in the bay , " How long are we to be shackled and sentinelled by a foreign power ! how long before we may look out upon this avenue to the ocean as the entrance to our independent homes , and open or shut it , as pleases us , to the commerce and friendship of the world ! " His natural revery was broken by steps in the adjoining drawing-room  --  the communicating door was open , and he heard a servant say , " Sir Henry bids me tell you , sir , he shall be detained in the council-room for half an hour , and begs you will excuse the delay of dinner . " " Easier excused than endured ! " said a voice , as soon as the servant had closed the door , which Eliot immediately recognised to be Mr. Linwood 's . " I 'll take a stroll up the street , Belle  --  a half hour is an eternity to sit waiting for dinner ! " " If Dante had found my father in his Inferno , " thought Isabella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The young lady , left to herself , did what we believe all young ladies do in the like case  --  walked up to the mirror , and there , while she was readjusting a sprig of jessamine with a pearl arrow that attached it to her hair , Eliot , from his fortunate position , contemplated at leisure her image . The years that had glided away since we first introduced our heroine on her vist to Effie , had advanced her to the ripe beauty of maturity . The freshness , purity , and frankness of childhood remained ; but there was a superadded grace , an expression of sentiment , of thought , feelings , hopes , purposes , and responsibilities , that come not within the ken of childhood . Form and colouring may be described . Miss Linwood 's hair was dark , and , contrary to the fashion of the times ( she was no thrall of fashion ) , unpowdered , uncurled , and unfrizzed , and so closely arranged in braids as to define ( that rare beauty ) the Grecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purity that indicates health and cheerfulness . " How soon , " thought Eliot , as he caught a certain look of abstraction to which of late she was much addicted , " how soon she has ceased to gaze at her own image ; is it that she is musing , or have her eyes a sibylline gaze into futurity ! " Those eyes were indeed the eloquent medium of a soul that aspired to Heaven ; but that was not , alas ! above the " carking cares " of earth . We must paint truly , though we paint the lady of our love ; and therefore we must confess that our heroine was not among the few favoured mortals whose noses have escaped the general imperfection of that feature . Hers was slightly  --  the least in the world  --  but incontrovertibly of the shrewish order ; and her mouth could express pride and appalling disdain , but only did so when some unworthy subject made these merely human emotions triumph over the good-humour and sweet affections that played about this , their natural organ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and approaching nearer to embonpoint than is common in our lean climate ; but it had that grace and flexibility that make one forget critically to mark proportions and dimensions , and to conclude , from the effect produced , that they must be perfect . We said we could describe form and colour ; but who shall describe that mysterious changing and all-powerful beauty of the soul , to which form and colour are but the obedient ministers ?  --  who , by giving the form and dimensions of the temple , can give an idea of the exquisite spirits that look from its portals ? Eliot was not long in making up his mind to emerge from his hiding-place , and was rising , when he was checked by the opening of the library door , and the exclamation , in a voice that made his pulses throb  --  " Nymph , in thy orisons be all my sins remembered ! " " All , Jasper ? " replied Miss Linwood , starting from her meditations , and blushing as deeply as if she had betrayed them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge my prayers with such a burden . " " Not one committed against you , Isabella , " replied Meredith , in a tone that made it very awkward for Eliot to present himself . " It would make no essential difference in my estimation of a fault whether it were committed against myself or another . " " Perhaps so ! " Miss Linwood took up one gazette , and Meredith another . Suddenly recollecting herself  --  " Oh , do you know , " she said , " that Eliot Lee is in town ? " " Now , " thought Eliot , " is my time . " " God forbid ! " exclaimed Meredith . Miss Linwood looked at him with an expression of question and astonishment , and he adroitly added , " Of course , if he is in town he is a prisoner , and I am truly sorry for it . " " Spare your regrets  --  he comes in the honourable capacity of an emissary from his general to ours . " " It is extraordinary that he has not apprized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Isabella recounted the adventure of the morning , and concluded by saying , " He must have some reason for withholding himself  --  you were friends ? " " Yes , college friends  --  boy friendship , which passes off with other morning mists  --  a friendship not originating in congeniality , but growing out of circumstances  --  a chance . " " Chance  --  friendship ! " exclaimed Isabella , in a half suppressed tone , that was echoed from the depths of Eliot 's heart . He held his breath as she continued  --  " I do not understand this  --  the instincts of childhood and youth are true and safe . I love every thing and everybody I loved when I was a child . I now dread the effect of adventitious circumstances  --  the flattering illusions of society  --  the frauds that are committed on the imagination by the seeming beautiful . " Isabella was perhaps conscious that she was mentally giving a personal investment to these abstractions , for her voice faltered ; but she soon continued with more steadiness and emphasis , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light  --  " chance friendship ! This chance friend-Jasper . " On my honour you have not the slightest ground for them , " he said . She proceeded . " Miss Linwood is in some respects a superior young person  --  she has not the  --  the  --  the talent of Helen Ruthven  --  nor the  --  the  --  the grace of Lady Anne ( no wonder the perplexed diplomatist hesitated for a comparative that should place Isabella Linwood below these young ladies ) ; but , as I said , she is a superior young person  --  a remarkable looking person , certainly ; at least , she is generally thought so . I do not particularly like her style  --  tenderness and manageableness , like our dear Anne 's , are particularly becoming in a female . Miss Linwood is too lofty  --  one does not feel quite comfortable with her . On the whole , I consider it quite fortunate you did not form an attachment in that quarter  --  prudence must be consulted  --  not that I would be swayed by prudential considerations  --  certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ; but when , as in your case , Jasper , the taste and affections accord with a wise consideration of  --  of  --  " " Fortune , my dear mother ? " " Yes , Jasper , frankly , fortune  --  I esteem it a remarkably happy circumstance . Your own fortune may or may not be large . The American portion of it depends upon contingencies , and therefore it would have been rash for you to have encumbered yourself with a ruined family ; for , as I am informed , the Linwoods have but just enough to subsist decently upon from day to day . It is true , they keep up a respectable appearance . Anne , by-the-way , tells me they get up the most delicious petits soupers there . It is amazing what pride will do !  --  what sacrifices some people make to appearances ! " " There must be something else than mere table luxuries to make these suppers so attractive to my cousin . " " Undoubtedly ; for as to that , you know , we have every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , Anne might have a foolish , girlish liking for Miss Linwood , but then I am quite confident  --  I hesitate , for if there is any thing on which I pride myself , it is being scrupulous towards my own sex in affairs of the heart ; but I betray nothing , for though you are perfectly free from coxcombry , you are not blind , and you must have seen  --  " " Not seen , but hoped , my dear mother , " replied Meredith , with a smile that indicated assurance doubly sure . " Hope is the fitting word for you  --  but your hope may be my certainty . I betray no secrets . Anne has not been confidential , but the dear child is so transparent  --  " " She seems , however , to have been rather opaque in this Linwood attachment . " " Yes , I confess myself baffled there  --  you may have opened a vein of coquetry , Jasper . I know not what it means , but it can mean nothing to alarm us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to gratify her , and every thing here . This very evening Governor Tryon called with the young prince , to propose to get up a concert for her . By-the-way , a pretty youth is Prince William !  --  he left this bouquet for Lady Anne . The honourable Mr. Barton and Sir Reginald were here too , and the Higbys  --  and there she is , mewed up with that old fretful Mr. Linwood . She must think , Jasper , you are not sufficiently devoted to her . " " She shall not think so in future . " " Hark , there is the carriage !  --  I sent her word that I was not well . In truth , her absence has teased me into a headache , and my own room will be the best place for me . " Thus concluding her tedious harangue , the lady made a hasty retreat ; and before Lady Anne had exchanged a salutation with Meredith , and thrown aside her hat and cloak , her aunt 's maid appeared with a message from this " frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness in coming home , and informing her that prudence obliged her to abstain from seeing her niece till morning . " I am very sorry ! " said Lady Anne , heaving a deep sigh , sinking down in the arm-chair her aunt had just left , resting her elbow on it , and looking pensively in the fire . " You need not be so deeply concerned , my kind cousin ; my mother is not very ill , " said Meredith , with difficulty forbearing a laugh at the disparity between the cause and the effect on his apparently sympathizing cousin . " Ill ! " exclaimed Lady Anne , starting , " I did not suppose that she was ill . " " Then why , in the name of Heaven , that deep sigh ? " " There are many causes of sighs , cousin Jasper . " " To you , Lady Anne , so young , so gifted , so lovely , so beloved . " " That should be happiness ! " she replied , covering her face with her hands to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies of her nature , gushed from her eyes . " Those dimpled hands , " thought Meredith , " hiding so childishly her melting face , might move an anchoret ; but they move not me . I am too pampered  --  to know that I have been loved by Isabella Linwood , with all the bitter , cursed mortification that attends it , is worth a world of such triumphs as this . Poor Bessie  --  I remember too ! but , allons , I will take the good the gods provide , ' since I can not have that which they deny . Cousin  --  " " Did you speak to me , Jasper ? " " Now , by my life , " thought Meredith , " my words are congealed  --  they will not flow to such willing ears . " " I am playing the fool , " exclaimed Lady Anne , suddenly rising and dashing off her tears . " Good night , Jasper  --  I have betrayed myself  --  no , no , I did not mean that  --  pray forget my weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life , and I know nothing of managing nerves  --  good night , Jasper ! " Meredith seized her hand and held her back . " Indeed , my sweet coz , you must not go now . " " Must not go ! Why not ? " she replied , excessively puzzled by the expressive smile that hovered on his lips . " Why not ! Because you are too much of an angel to shut your heart so suddenly against me after allowing me a glimpse at the paradise within . " " What do you mean ? " she asked , now beginning , from Meredith 's manner , and from the welltutored expression of his most sentimental eyes , to have some dim perception of his meaning , and to be disconcerted by it . " Dear Anne , did you not , with your own peculiar , enchanting ingenuousness , say you had betrayed yourself ? Never was there a sweeter  --  a more welcome treachery . " He fell on his knee , and pressed her hand to his lips . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snatching her hand away , " tell me what I have said or done . " " Nothing that you should not , dearest cousin ; your betrayal , as you called it , was , I know , involuntary , and for that the dearer . " Page 201 " Are you in earnest , Jasper ? " " In earnest ! most assuredly ; and do you , Lady Anne , like all your sex , delight in torturing your captives ?  --  your captive I certainly am , for life . " The truth was now but too evident to Lady Anne ; but she was so unprepared for it , her mind had been so wholly preoccupied , that it seemed to her the marvellous result of some absurd misunderstanding . At first she blushed , and stammered , and then , following her natural bent , laughed merrily . To Meredith , this appeared a childish artifice to shelter her mortification at having made , in military phrase , a first demonstration . His interest was stimulated by this slight obstacle ; and rallying all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good set terms " in such cases made and provided ; " but Lady Anne cut him off before he had finished his peroration . " This is a most absurd business , Jasper ; I entreat you never to speak of it again . Aunt , or somebody , or something , has misled you  --  misled you certainly are . I never in my life thought of you in any other light , than as a very agreeable cousin , nor ever shall . I am very sorry for you , Jasper ; but really , I am not in fault , for I never , by word or look , could have expressed what I never felt . Good night , Jasper . " She was running away , when she turned back to add , " Pray , say nothing of this to my aunt , and let us meet to-morrow as we have always met before . " She then disappeared , and left Meredith baffled , mortified , irritated , and most thoroughly awakened from his dreams . Her face , voice , and manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse , and carefully weighing the words that had misled him , he came to the conclusion that he had been partly misguided by his mother , and partly the dupe of his previous impressions . The measure of his humiliations was filled up . But his vanity survived the severe and repeated blows of that evening . Vanity has a wonderful tenacity of life : it resembles those reptiles that feed greedily on every species of food , the most delicate and the grossest , and that can subsist on their own independent vitality . CHAPTER XXXV . " Heart ! what 's that ? " Oh , a thing servant-maids have , and break for John the footman . " If Meredith could have borne off his charming heiress-cousin , his love for Isabella might have gone to the moon , or to any other repository of lost and forgotten things . But , balked in that pursuit , it resumed its empire over him . He passed a feverish , sleepless night , revolving the past , and reconsidering Isabella 's every word and look during their interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a conclusion not unnatural ( for few persons give others credit for less of a given infirmity than they themselves possess ) , that Isabella 's vanity had been wounded by the conviction that she had been , for a time , superseded by Bes ie Lee ; and that the ground he had thus lost might , by a dexterous manoeuvre , be regained . Engrossed with his next move , he appeared at breakfast-table as usual , attentive to his mother , and polite to Lady Anne , who , anxious to express her good-will , was more than ordinarily kind ; and Mrs. Meredith concluded that if matters had not gone as far as she had hoped , they were going on swimmingly . The breakfast finished , Lady Anne ran away from her aunt 's annoying devotions to the Linwoods , and Meredith retired to his own room to write , after weighing and sifting each word , the following note to Isabella . He did not send it , however , till he had taken the precaution to precede it by a written request to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late that honest dealing was far the safest ) that she would , on no account  --  he asked it for her own sake  --  communicate to any one their parting scene of the preceding evening . His evil star ruled the ascendant , and Lady Anne received the note too late . To Miss Linwood . " Montaigne says , and says truly , that toutes passions que se laissent , gouster et digerer ne sont que mediocres ; ' but how would he  --  how shall I characterize a passion which has swallowed up every other passion , desire , and affection of my nature  --  has grown and thriven upon that which would have seemed fatal to its existence ! " Isabella , these are not hollow phrases ; you know they are not ; and be not angry at my boldness ; I know your heart responds to them , and , though I was stretched on the rack to obtain this knowledge , I thank my tormentors . Yes , by Heaven ! I would not exchange that one instant of intoxicating , bewildering joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such witnesses ! you confessed you had loved me , for ages of a common existence . Thank Heaven , too , the precious confession was not through the hackneyed medium of words . Such a sentiment is not born in your bosom to die . I judge from my own inferior nature . I have loved on steadily , through absence , coldness , disdain , caprice ( pardon me , my proud , my adored Isabella ) , in spite of the canker and rust of delay after delay ; in spite of all the assaults of those temptations to which the young and fortunate are exposed . Can I estimate your heart at a lower rate than my own ? " As to that silly scene last evening , though it stung me at the moment , and goaded me to an unmeaning impertinence , yet , on a review of it , do you not perceive that we were both the dupes of a little dramatic effect ? and that there is no reality in the matter , except so far as concerns the lost wits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her well-meaning brother , whose unjust and hasty indignation towards me , being the result of false impressions , I most heartily forgive . " As to poor Bessie Lee , I can only say , God help her ! I am most sincerely sorry for her ; but neither you nor I can be surprised that she should be the dupe of her lively imagination , and the victim of her nervous temperament . I ask but one word in reply . Say you will see me at any hour you choose ; and , for God 's sake , Isabella , secure our interview from interruption . " In half an hour , and just as Meredith was sallying forth to allay his restlessness by a walk in the open air , he met his messenger with a note from Miss Linwood . He turned back , entered the unoccupied drawing-room , and read the following :  --  " I have received your note , Jasper ; I do not reply to it hastily ; hours of watchfulness and reflection at the bedside of my friend have given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved you , I confess it now ; not by a treacherous blush , but calmly , deliberately , in my own hand-writing , without faltering or emotion of any sort . Yes , I have loved you , if a sentiment springing from a most attachable nature , originating in the accidental intercourse of childhood , fostered by pride , nurtured by flattery , and exaggerated by an excited imagination , can be called love . " I have loved you , if a sentiment struggling with doubt and distrust , seeking for rest and finding none , becoming fainter and fainter in the dawning light of truth , and vanishing , like an exhalation in the full day , can be called love . " You say truly . Bessie Lee is the dupe of a too lively imagination , and the victim of a nervous temperament . To these you might have added , an exquisitely organized frame , and a conscience too susceptible for a creature liable to the mistakes of humanity . Oh , how despicable , how cruel , was the vanity that could risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I have wept bitterly over her ; I should scarcely have pitied her , had she been the unresisting slave and victim of a misplaced and unrequited passion . " After what I have written , you will perceive that you need neither seek nor avoid an interview with me ; that the only emotion you can now excite , is a devout gratitude that our former interviews were interrupted , and circumstances were made strong enough to prevail over my weakness . " Isabella Linwood . " P. S.  --  I have detained my messenger , and opened my note to add , that your cousin has just come in , and with a confidence befitting her frank nature , has communicated to me the farce with which you followed up the tragedy of last evening . " Section Meredith felt , what was in truth quite evident , that Isabella Linwood was herself again . He threw the note from him in a paroxysm of vexation , disappointment , and utter and hopeless mortification ; and covering his face with his hands , he endured one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins , follies , and failures of by-gone years are felt with the vividness and acuteness of the actual and present , and memory and conscience are endued with supernatural energy and retributive power . What a capacity of penal suffering has the All-wise infused into the moral nature of man , even the weakest ! " The mind is its own place , and in itself , Can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven . " Meredith was roused by the soft fall of a footstep . He started , and saw Helen Ruthven , who had just entered , and was in the act of picking up the note he had thrown down . She looked at the superscription , then at Meredith . Her lustrous eyes suffused with tears , and the tears formed into actual drops , and rolled down her cheeks . " Oh , happy , most happy Isabella Linwood ! " she exclaimed . Meredith took the note from her and threw it into the fire . Miss Ruthven stared at him , and lifted up her hands with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she added , " I still say , most happy Isabella Linwood . And yet , if she can not estimate the worth of the priceless kingdom she sways , is she most happy ? You do not answer me ; and you , of all the world , can not . " Meredith did not reply by word ; but Miss Ruthven 's quick eye perceived the cloud clearing from his brow ; and she ventured to try the effect of a stronger light . " I can not comprehend this girl , " she continued ; " she is a riddle  --  an insolvable riddle to me . A passionless mortal seems to me to approach nearer to a monster than to a divinity deserving your idolatry , Meredith . She can not be the cold , apathetic , statue-like person she appears  --  " " And why not , Miss Ruthven ? " " Simply because a passionless being can not inspire passion  --  and yet  --  and yet , if she were a marble statue , your love should have been the Promethean touch to infuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I speak too plainly ; there are moments when the heart will burst the barriers of prudence  --  there are moments of desperation , of self-abandonment . I can not be bound by those petty axioms and frigid rules that shackle my sex  --  I can not weigh my words  --  I must pour out my heart , even though this prodigality of its treasures naught enriches you , and makes me poor indeed ! ' " Helen Ruthven 's broken sentences were linked together by expressive glances and effective pauses . She gave to her words all the force of intonation and emphasis , which produce the effect of polish on metal , making it dazzling , without adding an iota to its intrinsic value . Meredith lent a most attentive ear , mentally comparing the while Miss Ruthven 's lavished sensibilities to Isabella 's jealous reserve . He should have discriminated between the generosity that gives what is nothing worth , and the fidelity that watches over an immortal treasure ; but vanity wraps itself in impenetrable darkness . He only felt that he was in a labyrinth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the process of preparation to follow whithersoever she willed to lead him . We let the curtain fall here ; we have no taste for showing off the infirm of our own sex . We were willing to supply some intimations that might be available to our ingenuous and all-believing young male friends ; but we would not reveal to our fair and true-hearted readers the flatteries , pretences , false assumptions , and elaborate blandishments , by which a hackneyed woman of the world dupes and beguiles ; and at last ( obeying the inflexible law of reaping as she sows ) pays the penalty of her folly in a life of matrimonial union without affection  --  a wretched destiny , well fitting those who profane the sanctuary of the affections with hypocritical worship . While the web is spinning around Meredith , we leave him with the wish that all the Helen Ruthvens in the world may have as fair game as Jasper Meredith . CHAPTER XXXVI . " Adventurous I have been , it is true , And this fool-hardy heart would brave  --  nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Yea , like a witch , would whistle for a whirlwind . But I have been admonished . " Our humble story treats of the concerns of individuals , and not of historical events . We shall not , therefore , embarrass our readers with the particulars of the secret mission on which Eliot Lee had been sent to the city by the commander-in-chief . He needed an agent , who might , as the exigency should demand , be prudent or bold , wary or decided , cautious or gallant , and self-sacrificing . He had tested Eliot Lee , and knew him to be capable of all these rarely-united virtues . Eliot had confided to Washington his anxieties respecting his unfortunate sister , and his burning desire to go to the city , where he might possibly ascertain her fate . Washington gave him permission to avail himself of every facility for the performance of his fraternal duty , consistent with the public service on which he sent him . His sympathies were alive to the charities of domestic life . While the military chieftain planted and guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished the birds that made their nests in its branches . Eliot was instructed to seek a hiding-place in the city at a certain Elizabeth Bengin 's , a woman of strong head and strong heart , whose name is preserved in history as one who , often at great personal risk , rendered substantial service in the country 's cause . Dame Bengin and her parrot Sylvy , who seemed to preside over the destinies of the shop , and did in fact lure many a young urchin into it , were known to all the city . The dame herself was a thick-set , rosy little body , fair , fat , and forty ; her shop was a sort of thread and needle store : but as the principle of division of labour had yet made small progress in our young country , Mistress Bengin 's wares were as multifarious as the wants of the citizens . Mrs. Bengin 's first principle was to keep a civil tongue in her own and in Sylvy 's head , she " holding civility ( as she often said and repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her shop . " It was indeed seriously profitable to her , for it surrounded her with an atmosphere of kindness , and enabled her , though watched and suspected by the English , to follow her calling for a long while unmolested . She gave Eliot an apartment in a loft over her shop , to which , there being no apparent access , Eliot obtained egress and ingress by removing a loose board that , to the uninstructed eye , formed a part of the ceiling of the shop . From this hiding-place Eliot sallied forth to execute his secret purposes , varying his disguises , which were supplied by Mrs. Bengin , as caution dictated . As all sorts of persons frequented the shop , no attention was excited by all sorts of persons coming out of it . Eliot 's forced masquerading often compelled him to personate various characters during the day , and at evening , with simply a clock over his own uniform , and a wallet over his arm , like those still used by country doctors , and precisely , as Dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor that attended the quality , " he made his way , sheltered by the obscurity of the night , to Mrs. Archer 's , where he was admitted by one of the children , whose acute senses caught the first sound of his approaching footsteps . Eliot , in spite of remonstrances from his prime minister , Mrs. Bengin , had persisted in appearing in his own dress at Mrs. Archer 's . In vain the good dame speculated and soliloquized ; she could not solve the mystery of this only disobedience to her counsel . " To be sure , " she said , " it makes a sight of difference in his looks , whether he wears my tatterdemalion disguises , wigs , scratches , and what not , or his own nice uniform , with his own rich brown hair , waving off his sunshiny forehead  --  a bright , pleasant , tight-built looking youth he is , as ever I put my two eyes upon ; and if he were going to see young ladies , I should not wonder that he did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience ! to keep up such a brushing and scrubbing  --  my loft is not so very linty either  --  just to go before the widow Archer  --  to be sure , she is a widow ; but then , there never was a man yet that dared to have any courting thoughts of her , any more than if she were buried in her husband 's grave ; and this is not the youth to be presuming . " Dame Bengin knew enough of human nature to have solved the mystery of Eliot 's toilet , if she had been apprized of one material fact in the case . At Mrs. Archer 's , watching at Bessie 's bedside , Eliot always found Miss Linwood ; and though the truest , the most anxious , and tender of brothers , he was not unconscious of her presence , nor unconscious that her presence mingled with his sufferings for his sister a most dangerous felicity . His fate was inevitable ; he at least thought it so ; and that fate was an intense and unrequited devotion to one as unattainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet . He did not resist his destiny by abating on minute of those hours that were worth years of a drawing-room intercourse . In ordinary circumstances , Isabella 's soul would have been veiled from so new an acquaintance ; but now , constantly under the influence of strong feeling and fresh impulses , and a most joyous sense of freedom , her lofty , generous , and tender spirit glowed in her beautiful face , and inspired and graced every word and movement . Her devotion to Bessie was intense ; not simply from compassion nor affection , but remembering , that in her self-will she had insisted , in spite of her father 's disinclination , and her aunt 's most reasonable remonstrances , on Bessie 's visit to the city , she looked upon herself as the primary cause of her friend 's misfortunes , and felt her own peace of mind to be staked on Bessie 's recovery . What a change had the discipline of life wrought in Isabella 's character ! the qualities were still the same ; the same energy of purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , but now all flowing in the right channel , all having a moral aim , and all governed by that religious sense of duty , which is to the spirit in this perilous voyage of life what the compass is to the mariner . Of Bessie 's recovery there seemed , from day to day , little prospect . One hopeful circumstance there was . The intelligent physician consulted by Mrs. Archer had frankly confessed that his art could do nothing for her , and had advised leaving her entirely to the energies of nature . Would that this virtue of letting alone were oftener imitated by the faculty ! that nature were oftener permitted to manifest her power unclogged , and unembarrassed by the poisons of the drug-shop ! Bessie was as weak and helpless as a new-born infant , and apparently as unknowing of the world about her . With few and brief exceptions , she slept day and night . Her face was calm , peaceful , and not inexpressive , but it was as unvarying as a picture . Her senses appeared no longer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing , and saw without seeing , and never attempted to speak . At times , her friends despaired utterly , believing that her mind was extinct ; and then again they hoped it was a mere suspension of her faculties , a rest preluding restoration . While fear and hope were thus alternating , a week passed away . Eliot 's mission was near being accomplished . The evening of the following day was appointed for the consummation of his plans . The boats , with muffled oars and trusty oarsmen , were in readiness , and the plan for the secret seizure of a most important personage so well matured , that it was all but impossible it should be baffled . The most brilliant result seemed certain : and well-balanced as Eliot 's mind was , it was excited to the highest pitch when a communication reached him from headquarters , informing him that Washington deemed it expedient to abandon the enterprise of which he was the agent ; and he was directed , if possible , to cross the Hudson during the night , and repair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brilliant achievement and sudden advancement ; and he went to pay his last visit to his sister  --  for the last time to see Isabella Linwood ! She met him with good news lighting her eyes , " Bessie is reviving ! " she said ; " she has pressed my hand , and spoken my name ! " " Thank God ! " replied Eliot , approaching the bedside . For the first time Bessie fixed her eye on him as if conscious at whom she was looking ; then , as he bent over her , she stretched out her arms , drew his face to hers , and kissed him , feebly murmuring , " dear Eliot ! " The effort exhausted her , and she reverted to her usual condition . " This must be expected , " said Miss Linwood , replying to the shade of disappointment that passed over Eliot 's brow ; " but having seen such a sign of recovery , you will leave her with a light heart ? " Eliot smiled assentingly ; a melancholy smile enough . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to-morrow evening ? " " No , my business in the city is finished , and I go this very night . " " To-night ! would to Heaven that Herbert were going with you ! " " Not one regret for my going ! " thought Eliot , and he sighed involuntarily . " You seem , " resumed Isabella , " very suddenly indifferent to Herbert 's fate  --  you do not care to know , before you go , how our plans are ripening ? " " Indifferent to Herbert 's fate !  --  to aught that concerns you , Miss Linwood ! " " A commonplace compliment from you , Captain Lee  --  well , as it is the first , I 'll forgive you  --  not so would Herbert , for making him secondary in a matter where he is entitled to the honour , as he has the misery of being principal . Poor fellow ! his adversities have not taught him patience , and Rose tells me he is very near the illness he has feigned , and that if he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fever . " " Have you made Lady Anne acquainted with your project ? " " Yes , indeed ! and her quick wit , loving heart , and most ingenious fingers , have been busy in contriving and executing our preparations . She is wild enough to wish to be the companion of Herbert 's flight  --  this is not to be thought of  --  but I have promised her that she shall see him once more . Lizzy Bengin will go with us to the boat , where , if Heaven prosper us , he will be by eight to-morrow evening . And then , Captain Lee , should you persuade General Washington to receive and forgive him , we shall be perfectly happy again . " " Perfectly happy ! " echoed Eliot , in a voice most discordant with the words he uttered . " Oh , pardon me ! I did not mean that . It is cruel to talk to you of happiness while Bessie is in this uncertain condition  --  and most unjust it is to myself , for I never shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself again . " " Ah , Miss Linwood , that can not be . In her best days she had not the physical and mental power required to make her mistress of herself ; ' no , it can never be . If it were not for my mother , who I know would wish Bessie restored to her , even though she continue the vacant casket she now is , I should , with most intense desire , pray God to take her to himself  --  there alone can a creature so sensitive and fragile be safe and at peace ! " " You are wrong  --  I am certain you are wrong . There is a flexibility in our womanly nature that is strength in our weakness . Bessie will perceive the delusion under which she has acted and suffered , and which had dominion over her , because , like any other dream , it seemed a reality while it lasted . Yes , her affections will return to their natural channels to bless us all . " Eliot shook his head despondingly . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , smiling and blushing , " but I reason from experience , and therefore you should believe me . " This was the first time that Meredith had been alluded to . The allusion was intrepid and generous ; and if a confession of past weakness , it was an assurance of present , conscious , and all-sufficient strength . That Eliot at least thought so , was evident from the sudden irradiation of his countenance ; a brightness misinterpreted by Isabella , who immediately added , " I have convinced you , and you will admit I was not so very rash in saying that we should all again be perfectly happy . " Eliot made no reply ; he walked to the extremity of the room , paused , returned , gazed intently yet abstractedly at his sister , then at Isabella , and then mechanically took up his hat , laid it down , and again resumed it . Isabella was perplexed by his contradictory movements . " You are not going so soon ? " she said . He did not reply . " Shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot seized her hand , and withheld her . " No , no , not yet  --  Miss Linwood , I am playing the hypocrite  --  it is not alone my anxiety for my sister that torments me  --  that made your prediction of happiness sound to me like a knell . " He paused , and then yielding to an irresistible impulse , he impetuously threw himself at Isabella 's feet . " Isabella Linwood , I love you  --  love you without the presumption of the faintest , slightest hope  --  before we part for ever , suffer me to tell you so . " " Captain Lee , you astonish me !  --  you do not mean  --  " " I know I astonish you , but I will not offend you . Is it folly  --  rashness  --  obtrusiveness , to pour out an affection before you , that expects nothing in return , asks nothing but the satisfaction of being known , and not offensive to you ? " " Oh , no , no ; but you may regret  --  " " Never , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicate my existence to you ; insomuch as God permits me to love aught beneath himself , I will love you . I must now part from you for ever ; but wherever I go your image will attend me  --  that can not be denied me  --  it shall defend me from temptation , incite me to high resolves , pure thoughts , and good deeds . " " Such homage might well make me proud , " replied Isabella , " and I am most grateful for it ; but your imagination is overwrought ; this is a transient excitement  --  it will pass away . " " Never ! " replied Eliot , rising , and recovering in some degree the steadiness of his voice ; " hear me patiently ; it is the only time I shall ever ask your indulgence . I am not now , nor was I ever , under the dominion of my imagination or my passions . I have been trained in the school of exertion , of self-denial , and self-subjection ; and I would not , I could not love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not entitled to the homage of my best faculties . I have been moved by beauty , I have been attracted by the lovely  --  I have had my fancies and my likings  --  what man of two-and-twenty has not ?  --  I never loved before ; never before felt a sentiment that , if it were requited , would have made earth a paradise to me ; but that unrequited , unsustained but by its own independent vitality , I would not part with for any paradise on this earth . " The flush of surprise that first overspread Isabella 's face had deepened to a crimson glow . If a woman is not offended by such language as Eliot 's , she can not be unmoved . Isabella 's was a listening eye . It seemed to Eliot , at this moment , that its rays touched his heart and burned there . She passed her hand over her brow , as one naturally does when the brain is becoming a little blurred in its perceptions . " This is so very strange , so unexpected , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose every tone was music to her lover 's ear  --  " in one short week  --  it can not be ! " Isabella but half uttered her thoughts : she had been misled , as most inexperienced observers are in similar cases , by the tranquillity of Eliot 's manner ; she respected and liked him exceedingly ; but she thought him unexcitable , and incapable of passion . She had yet to learn that the strongest passions are reducible to the gentlest obedience , and may be so subjected as to manifest their power , not in irregular and rebellious movements , but only in the tasks they achieve . She did not now reflect or analyze , but she felt , for the first time , there was that in Eliot Lee that could answer to the capacities of her own soul . " This is , undoubtedly , unexpected to you , " resumed Eliot , " but should not be strange . When I first saw you I was struck with your beauty ; and I thought , if I were a pagan , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall down and worship it  --  that might have been what the world calls falling in love , but it was far enough from the all-controlling sentiment I now profess to you . Our acquaintance has been short ( I date farther back than a week ) ; but in this short period I have seen your mind casting off the shackles of early prejudices , resisting the authority of opinion , self-rectified , and forming its independent judgments on those great interests in which the honour and prosperity of your country are involved . I have gloried in seeing you willing to sacrifice the pride , the exclusiveness , and all the little idol vanities of accidental distinctions , to the popular and generous side . " Nay , hear me out , Isabella ; I will not leave you till you have the reasons of my love ; till you admit that I have deliberately elected the sovereign of my affections ; till you feel , yes , feel , that my devotion to you can never abate . " He hesitated , and his voice faltered ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over woman 's weakness enabled you to cast off . " " Oh , no  --  no ; do not commend me for that  --  they fell off . " " Be it so : they could not fetter you , that is enough . " " Then , " said Isabella , somewhat mischievously , " I think you like me for , what most men like not at all  --  my love of freedom and independence of control . " " Yes , I do ; for I think they are essential to the highest and most progressive nature ; but I should not love it if it were not blended with all the tenderness and softness of your sex . The fire that mounts to Heaven from the altar , diffuses its gentle warmth at the fireside . Think you , that while you have been tending my sister , I have been unmindful of your kindly domestic qualities , or blind to the thousand womanly inventions by which I see you ministering to the happiness of these unfortunate children ? Have you thought me insensible to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in much mercy to him , willed it should be bootless ? I do homage to your genius , talent , and accomplishment , but I love your gracious , domestic , home-felt virtues . I am exhausting your patience . " Isabella had covered her face ; over-powered with the accumulated proof that Eliot had watched her with a fond lover 's eye . After a slight hesitation , he proceeded to obey a most natural , if it be a weak longing . " Allow me , if you can , one solace , one blessed thought to cheer a long life of loneliness and devotion . I am bold in asking it ; but , tell me , had I known you earlier , had no predilection forestalled me , had no rival intervened , do you think it possible that you should have returned my love ? " Some one says that all women are reared hypocrites  --  trained to veil their natures ; Isabella Linwood , at least , was not . She replied , impulsively and frankly , " Most certainly I should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her hand , to press it to his lips , to wet it with his tears . " I am satisfied , " he said ; " now I can go ; and the thought that I might , under a happier star , have been loved by Isabella Linwood , shall elevate , guide , and sooth me , in all the chances and changes of life . " While Eliot was uttering these last words , and while Isabella was absorbed in the emotions they excited , the door was softly opened , and Lizzy Archer , flitting across the room , said in a low voice , " Oh , Captain Lee ! what shall we do ?  --  there are horrid soldiers watching at both our doors for you  --  mamma is out , and I could not sleep  --  I never sleep when you are here , for fear something will happen  --  I heard their voices at the side door ; and when I came through the hall , I heard others through the street door  --  what shall we do ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a minute . " But " Cousin Belle 's " presence of mind had suddenly forsaken her ; and as Eliot 's eye glanced towards her , he saw she was pale and trembling . A hope shot into his mind , a thought of the possibility that if he were not now severed from her , that which she had generously admitted might have been , might still be . To exclude this new-born hope seemed to him like the extinction of life . He rapidly revolved the circumstances in which he was placed . He had done , in the affair intrusted to him , all , and even more than his commander expected ; it had failed of consummation through no fault of his ; he was in the American uniform , and thus captured , he might claim the rights of a prisoner of war ; the temporary loss of his presence in camp would be unimportant to the cause ; and remaining for a time within reach of Isabella Linwood might result in good , infinite good , and happiness to himself . He wavered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of the soldier over the almost irresistible inclinations of the man : he shut out the temptation , and only considered the means of escape . " Dear Lizzy , " he said , " if I could find my way to your skylight  --  I have observed the descent would not be dangerous from there to the back building , and so down on the roofs of the other offices . " " But , " said Lizzy , for the little creature seemed to have considered the whole ground , " if there should be soldiers too at the back gate ? " " I will avoid them , Lizzy , by going into the next yard to yours , then over two or three walls , till I find it safe to emerge into the street . " " I can lead you to the skylight . I am very glad I am blind , so I shall not need any light ; for that would show you to the soldiers , who are standing by the side windows of the hall-door . Oh , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it does beat so ! " There were other hearts there that beat almost audibly besides poor Lizzy 's ; but there was no time to indulge emotions . Eliot kissed his unconscious sister ; and then grasping the hand Isabella extended to him , he would have said , " Farewell for ever ! " but his voice was choked , and the last ominous word was unpronounced . His little guide led him noiselessly up the stairs , through the entries , and to the skylight ; and then fondly embracing him and promising to give his farewells to " mother and Ned , " she parted from him , and stood fixed and breathless , listening till she believed he had eluded those who were lying in wait for him , when she returned to give full vent to her feelings on Isabella 's bosom , and to find more sympathy there than she wotted of . We shall not follow our hero through his " imminent dangers and hair-breadth ' scapes . " Suffice it to say , he did escape ; and having passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Zandt " to the city , he eluded the British station at Powles Hook , passed their redoubts , and at dawn of day received at the camp at Morris-town the warm thanks of Washington , who estimated conduct by its intrinsic merit , and not , according to the common and false standard , by its results . CHAPTER XXXVII . " Good sir , good sir , you are deceived ; it is no man at all ! " At any other juncture , Mr. Linwood would have been restless and unappeasable under the privation of Isabella 's society ; but now , in his interest and sympathy in Herbert 's affairs , and in his fondness for Lady Anne , he found full employment for his thoughts and feelings . Lady Anne persisted in considering herself Herbert 's betrothed ; and in spite of her aunt , who , as her niece affirmed , had become insupportably cross and teasing , she persevered in spending all her evenings with the Linwoods . The charm that love imparts to those who are connected with the object of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . Lady Anne felt the most tender anxieties for her lover ; but , sustained by the buoyancy of youth , and a most cheerful and sanguine disposition , she was uniformly bright and animated . Her sparkling eye and dimpled cheek were happiness to Mr. Linwood ; the old love cheerfulness as the dim eye delights in brilliant colours . Mrs. Archer , who was always , in Mr. Linwood 's estimation , the next best to Isabella , devoted her evenings to him . She saw , or fancied she saw , that Bessie 's countenance expressed a pleased consciousness of Isabella 's presence ; at any rate , she knew that there was another countenance always lighted up by it . Accordingly , she repaired every evening to Mr. Linwood , and played rubber after rubber , performing her tiresome duty with such zest and zeal , that Mr. Linwood pronounced her a comfortable partner and respectable antagonist  --  " a deal more than he could say for any other woman . " While the surface of this little society remained as usual , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lady Anne , was resolved to leave no effort unmade to effect his escape from durance , and put himself in the way of those brighter hours that youth and health whispered might come . His first step was taken the morning after his parting with Lady Anne . He enclosed the permit for his visits at home , sent to him by Sir Henry Clinton , to that gentleman , with an acknowledgment of his kindness , but without assigning any reason for declining to avail himself of it farther . He was careful not to involve his honour by any pretences in relation to that obligation ; it was off his hands , and he thanked Heaven he was now free to use whatever stratagem would avail him . He feigned illness . He knew Rose would be sent to inquire after him ; and he also knew that , when told he was ill , she would , by force or favour , obtain access to him . Fortunately , she was admitted without hesitation ; for Cunningham , conscious of the bad odour he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed it his best policy to inflict no gratuitous hardship on the son of Mr. Linwood . Rose , once admitted , became first counsellor and coadjutor ; and with the aid of the young ladies at home , a project was contrived , of which this noble creature was to be the main executer . Herbert 's illness , of course , continued unabated ; and Rose repeated her visits daily , and made her last , as she hoped , the evening succeeding Eliot 's escape . " Lock me in , " she said to the turnkey , " and leave me a quarter of an hour or so . I want to coax Mr. Herbert to take a biscuit ; he 'd die on your dum stuff . " Rose had , in fact , brought to Linwood , daily , more substantial rations than biscuit , and thus enabled him to gratify his appetite without endangering his reputation as an invalid . He was in bed when Rose entered , and out of it the moment the turnkey closed the door  --  " Oh , Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " Every thing , Mr. Herbert , snug as a bug in a rug . The young ladies came with me to Mrs. Lizzy 's , and she is to be at Smith 's house with them precisely at seven . It is now half past six . Mrs. Lizzy 's boat , with the muffled oars , that 's got off many a prisoner before you , is now waiting for you . " " And are my sister and Lady Anne going to Smith 's house without any male attendant ? " " Dear , yes ! they are wrapped in cloaks  --  nobody will know them ; and Mrs. Lizzy is as good a guard as horse , foot , and dragoon ; there 's not a thimbleful of danger , Mr. Herbert , and they fear none , bless their hearts ! To be sure , Miss Belle is no great of a soldier in common , and Lady Anne will scream like all natur ' at a mouse ; but love is a great help to courage in young parsons . " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened , she was doffing an extra set of linsey-woolsey garments , and transferring them to her young master , who somewhat delayed their adjustment , by putting his feet first into the " cursed petticoat , " as he profanely termed it . That most respectable feminine article arranged to Rose 's satisfaction , she put over it a shortgown , and a checked handkerchief over all . " Now for the beauties , " she said , drawing from her pocket a wig and mask , and holding them up in either hand , " Miss Belle made one , and Lady Anne t' other . " The mask , if it might be so called , was well coloured , and bore a tolerable likeness to Rose . Linwood was enchanted . " Which , " he exclaimed , " which did Lady Anne make , Rose ? " " The mask . " Linwood seized it , kissed it , and exclaimed , " Admirably , admirably done ! " " It was not half the trouble the wig was , " said Rose . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you do n't carry on so about it . Land 's sake ! However , I suppose you love Miss Belle as well , only it a n't a kind of love that breeds antics . " " True , Rose ; you may be sure I shall never love anybody better than I do my sister . " Rose was satisfied , and proceeded to tie on the mask , and adjust the fleecy locks . " It 's a main pity , " she said , " to cover your pretty shining hair with what looks like nigger 's wool , as they call it . " " Not a bit  --  not a bit , Rose . I know some wool that covers a far better head than mine  --  more capable , more discerning ; and God never created a nobler heart than beats under one black skin . " " Pooh ! Mr. Herbert . " Rose 's pooh was a disclaimer ; but as she put it in , she brushed a tear from her eye ; then tying a mobcap and black silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her short blue broadcloth cloak , and hiding his white hands in her mittens , she laughed exultingly , declaring she " should not herself know him from herself . " " Now you 're readied , " she said , " settle down as you walk  --  be prudent , Mr. Herbert  --  look before you leap . Do n't answer them dum fellows , when you go out , a word more than yes or no  --  I never do . Do your endeavours , and the Lord will help you . He helps them as helps themselves  --  hark ! there comes the fellow . " Before the turnkey opened the door she was in bed , her head enveloped in the bedclothes ; and Herbert stood , her basket on his arm , apparently waiting . No suspicion was excited , nor questions asked . They went out , and the door was relocked . Rose raised her head to listen to their receding footsteps . The footsteps ceased , and she heard Cunningham 's ( the provost-marshal 's ) voice , " Well , wench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her counterfeit , " how goes it with your young master ? " " Now the Lord o'mercy help him ! " she exclaimed ; " he used to mimic Jupe  --  if he only can me . " She did not hear Herbert 's reply ; but she heard Cunningham say , as if responding to it  --  " Poorlier , hey ? I 've got something here that will bring back his stomach  --  respects to your master  --  mind , wench . " Again she heard Herbert 's footsteps recede , and Cunningham enter her cell , and shut and lock the door . Cunningham 's name was a terror to the whigs , and to all that cared for them . The man 's excessive cruelty and meanness may be inferred from the extravagant allegations current at the time ; that he was in the habit of putting the American prisoners of war to death , in order to sequester the rations allowed them . He had recently reason for apprehensions that an inquiry would be instituted into his conduct by the commander-in-chief , who certainly did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognizance of them . Rose 's head was well muffled in the bedclothes , when Cunningham , coming up to the bed , said , " How goes it , Mr. Linwood ; bile uppermost yet ? Come , lift up your head , and speak , man  --  ca n't you give an answer to a civil word ? Come , come , I 'm not Tom nor Sam , to be put off this way  --  next thing you 'll bolt , and I shall have it to answer for ; but they sha' n't say I did not do the good Samaritan by you . You wo n't eat  --  you wo n't hear to the doctor  --  the d  --  l is in you , man ; why do n't you rise up ? Here 's a dose you must take , any how  --  it 's what they give in all cases , calomel and jalap  --  come , man , if fair means wo n't do , foul must . " The patient continued obstinate , and Cunningham set down the dose , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vials , containing sundry nauseous medicines , designed for the poor prisoners , as if bad food were not poison and torture enough for them . A contest began , in which Cunningham had reason to be astonished at the strength of the invalid . In the scramble , Rose 's head was disengaged from the bedclothes ; the truth was revealed , and she sprang on him like a tiger on its prey . The cowardly wretch shrunk back , and drew a knife , crying out , " You d  --  d nigger ! " Rose wrested it from him , and her spirit disdaining the assassin 's weapon , she thrust it into the wall , exclaiming  --  " Now we 're even ! " He sprung towards the door  --  she pulled him back , threw him down , put her knee on his breast , and by the time he had made one ineffectual struggle , and once bellowed for help , she had added laudanum , castor-oil , and ipecacuanha to the calomel and jalap ; and holding his nose between the thumb and finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips with the other . When she had convinced him of her potentiality , by making him gulp down one swallow , she mercifully withdrew the draught , saying , " If you offer to move one inch , or make a sound , I 'll pour it down your throat to the last drop . " She then released him from her grasp , and while he was panting and shuddering , she turned her back , muttering something of stringing him up in her clothes . The " clothes , " which she quickly disengaged from their natural office , proved to be her garters . As she stretched them out , trying their strength , " My own spinning , twisting , and knitting , " said she ; " they 'll bear the weight of twenty such slim pieces as you . " " Are you going to hang me ? " gasped out Cunningham . " Hang you ? Yes ; but not harm you , if you 're quiet , mind . But I 'd choke you twice over to give Mr. Herbert time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porridge . " She then turned him over , bound his hands behind him with one garter , and made a slip-noose with the other , while he , like a reptile in the talons of a vulture , crawled and squirmed with a hopeless resistance . " There 's no use , " said Rose ; " you 're but a baby in my hands  --  it 's the strong heart makes the strong arm . " She then set him upright on Herbert 's bed , put the noose around his neck , and made the other end fast to an iron hook in the wall . This was just achieved , when a hurried footstep was heard , followed by a clattering at the door , and a call for " Master Cunningham !  --  Master Cunningham ! " Rose placed her foot against the foot of the bedstead ; Cunningham understood the menace , and suppressed the cry on his lips . The calls were reiterated . Cunningham cast one glance at Rose ; her foot was fixed , her lips compressed , and her eyes glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alternative was silence or death , and his face convulsed between the impulse to respond and the effort to keep quiet . The knocking and screaming were repeated ; and then finding them ineffectual , the person went off to seek his master elsewhere . Other sounds now roused Rose 's generous spirit , and tempted her to inflict the vengeance so well deserved ; but hers was not the mind to be swayed by opportunity  --  " convenience snug . " The apartment adjoining Linwood 's was spacious , and crammed with American prisoners . There was a communicating door between them , through which could be distinctly heard any sound or movement louder than usual . Loring , in his customary evening round , had entered this apartment . Loring was Cunningham 's coadjutor , and is described by Ethan Allen , who had himself notable experience in that prison , as " the most meanspirited , cowardly , deceitful , and destructive animal in God 's creation . " Rose heard Loring command the prisoners to get to their beds , in his customary phrase ( we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kennel , d  --  n ye  --  kennel , ye sons of Belial ! " At this brutal address to persons whom Rose honoured as a Catholic honours the saints , her blood boiled within her . She hastily withdrew her foot from the bedpost , and strided to the extremity of the narrow apartment ; then turning and stretching her arm towards Cunningham , she said , with an energy that made his blood curdle , " It is not for me to ' venge them , but God will . Their children shall be lords in the land , and sound out their fathers ' names with ringing of bells and firing of cannon , when you , and Loring , and all such car'on , have died and rotted like dogs , as ye are . " The sounds in the adjoining apartment after a while subsided , and with them Rose 's ire . She seated herself to await the latest hour when she could retire from the prison , and elude the suspicion of the sentinel , the only person whose vigilance she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep seemed , like rain , to have fallen on the just and the unjust  --  the keepers and their prisoners . Cunningham , seeing Rose preparing to take her departure , begged her , in the most abject manner , before she went , to release him from his frightful position . " No , no , " she obstinately replied to his supplications , " ye shall hang in iffigy , to be seen and scorned by your own people ; but one marcy I 'll do you ; if you 'll hold your tongue , I 'll not let out , while the war lasts  --  while the war lasts , remember , that you were strung up there by a d  --  n nigger '  --  a nigger woman ! " It appeared that Cunningham was glad to accept this very small mercy , by the report that afterward prevailed , that he had only escaped a fitting end through the forbearance of Mr. Herbert Linwood . Rose passed unmolested through the passage and the outer door , which , being locked on the inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her retreat . The sentinel in the yard saw and recognised her ; but not being the same who was on guard when the first Dromeo passed , he merely inferred that Rose had been permitted to remain longer than usual ; and kindly opening the gate , he responded civilly to her civil " good-night . " Rose went home , not however to enjoy the quiet sleep which should have followed so good a piece of work as she had achieved , but to suffer , and see others suffer , the most distressful apprehensions . CHAPTER XXXVIII . " Let the great gods , That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads , Find out their enemies now . " Isabella and Lady Anne , cloaked and hooded , repaired to Dame Bengin 's some half hour , as may be remembered , before the time appointed for their meeting with Linwood . This forerunning of the hour was to allow them to take advantage of Rose 's escort . It did not pass without a censure from their wary coadjutor . " You lack discretion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked it too when I let you in partners in this business . My father used to say , if you want to go safe over a tottering plank , always go alone . ' However , we must make the best of it now : so just take this box of ribands , and stand at the farther end of the counter , and seem to be finding a match . It is nothing strange for ladies to be tedious at that . " The young ladies obeyed , but Lady Anne fretted in an under voice at the delay ; and Isabella ventured a remonstrance , to which Dame Bengin , an autocrat in her own domain , replied , " She must go her own way ; that full twenty minutes were left to the time appointed for the meeting at Smith 's house , and time was money to her . " " I wish to Heaven I could wring that parrot 's neck , " whispered Lady Anne ; " I do believe the people answer to its call . " The parrot kept up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " that might have tormented nerves less excitable than our friend 's were at this moment . " I surmise we are going to have a storm , " said an old woman , who had stepped in for a pennyworth of cochinia for her grandchildren ; " its always a sign of a storm when Sylvy keeps up such a chattering at night-fall . " Lizzy Bengin went to the door , and looked anxiously at the gathering clouds . " Come in !  --  come in ! " cried Sylvy ; and , as if obedient to her summons , trotted in , one after another , half a dozen urchins . One wanted " a skein of sky-blue silk for aunt Polly : not too light , nor too dark ; considerable fine , and very strong ; not too slack nor too hard twisted . " Lizzy Bengin looked over half a dozen papers before she could meet the order of her customer . " Pray send the whole to aunt Polly , " cried Lady Anne ; " I will pay you , Bengin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her , and bade the boy run home and tell aunt Polly she hoped the skein would suit . " Twopence worth of button-moulds-just this size , ma'am . " The indefatigable Mrs. Bengin explored the button-mould box . " Mammy wants a nail of silk , a shade lighter than the sample . " Mrs. Bengin looked over her pile of silks . " Come in !  --  come in ! " still cried Sylvy , certainly not the silent partner of the house . " Aunty wants a dust of snuff , and she 'll pay you to-morrow . " " How much is a drawing of your best bohea , Mrs. Bengin ? " " Mrs. Lizzy , uncle John wants to know if you 've got any shoes about little Johnny 's size ? " While Mrs. Bengin , who was quite in the habit of securing the mint , anise , and cummin of her little trade , was with the utmost composure satisfying these multifarious demands , the minutes seemed ages to our impatient friends ; Isabella took out her watch . The dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , for she was dismissing the shoe inquirer with a simple negative , when in came a black girl , with a demand for " spirits of camphire . " " What 's the matter , Phillis ? " " Madam Meredith has got the hystrikes . " " Then she has my note , " whispered Lady Anne . While the camphire was pouring out , a sturdy sailor-boy entered . " Ah , is that you , Tom Smith ? A hand of tobacco you 're wanting ? Well , first come first served  --  just be taking in Sylvy , while I 'm getting a cork to suit the vial . " Mrs. Bengin seemed suddenly fluttered by a look from Tom , and she bade the servant run home sans cork . The moment Phillis had passed the threshold , Lizzy said , " Speak out , Tom , there are none but friends here ! " " It 's too late , Lizzy Bengin , you 're lost ! " The inquiries and replies that followed were rapid . The amount of Tom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazine , and that as strange persons had recently been observed going to and coming from Lizzy 's shop , it was believed that a plot had been there contrived ; the commandant had issued an order for her apprehension , and men were by this time on their way to seize her . Lizzy Bengin had so often been suspected , and threatened , and eluded detection , that she did not now believe her good fortune had deserted her . She heard Tom through , and then said , " My boat is ready and I 'll dodge them yet . " Isabella ventured to ask , with scarcely a ray of hope , " if they might still go with her ? " " Yes , if you 're not afeared , and will be prudent . Shut the shutters , Tom  --  lock the door after us , and keep them out as long as possible , that we may gain time . Throw my books into the loft  --  do n't let ' em rummage and muss my things , and look to Sylvy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If any thing happens to me , Tom , be kind to Sylvy ! " By this time her cloak and hood were on , and they sallied forth . Dame Lizzy 's valour was too well tempered by discretion to have permitted her to consent to the attendance of the young ladies , if she had not , after calculating the chances , been quite sure that no danger would be thereby incurred . She believed that her pursuers , after being kept at bay by her faithful ally Tom , would be at a loss where next to seek her . The place appointed for meeting Linwood was a little untenanted dwelling , near the water 's edge , called " Smith 's house . " There he was to doff his disguise , and there , should there be any uproar in the streets , the young ladies could remain till all was quiet . Isabella and Lady Anne were in no temper to consider risks and chances . Life , to the latter , seemed to be set on the die of seeing Herbert once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire , and an intense eagerness to be immediately assured of her brother 's escape ; so , clinging close to their sturdy friend , they hastened forward . The old woman 's interpretation of Sylvy 's cries proved a true one . A storm was gathering rapidly . Large drops of rain pattered on the pavement , and the lightning flashed at intervals . But the distance to the boat , lying in a nook just above Whitehall , was short , and the moon , some seven nights old , was still unclouded . They soon reached " Smith 's house , " and heard the joyful signal-whistle previously agreed on . " He is here ! " exclaimed Isabella . Lady Anne 's fluttering heart was on her lips , but she did not speak . Herbert joined them . " Now kiss and part , " cried Lizzy Bengin . The first command was superfluous ; the second it seemed impossible to obey . It was no time for words , and few did they mingle with the choking sighs of parting , but these few were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was stamped upon them . The storm increased , and the darkness thickened . " Come , come ; this wo n't do , young folks , " cried their impatient leader ; " we must be off  --  we 've foul weather to cross the river , and then to pass the enemy 's stations before daylight  --  the hounds may be on our heels too  --  we must go . " All felt the propriety , the necessity of this movement . Lady Anne only begged that they might go to the water 's edge , and see the boat off . Dame Bengin interposed no objection ; that would only have caused fresh entreaties and longer delay , and they set forward . The distance to the boat was not above a hundred yards ; they had reached the shore , Mrs. Bengin was already in the boat , and Herbert speaking his last word , when they heard the voices of pursuers , and the next flash of lighting revealed a file of soldiers rushing towards them . Lady Anne shrieked ; Lizzy Bengin screamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off without you . " " Go , " cried Isabella , " dear Herbert , go . " " I will not  --  I can not , and leave you in the hands of these wretches . " " Oh , no ! do not  --  do not , Herbert , " entreated Lady Anne , " take me with you . " This was enough and irresistible . Herbert clasped his arm around her , and leaped into the boat . " Come with us , Isabella , " screamed Lady Anne . " For God 's sake , come , Belle , " shouted Herbert . Isabella wavered for an instant . Another glare of lightning showed the soldiers within a few feet of her , looking , in that lurid light , fierce and terrible beyond expression ; Isabella obeyed the impulse of her worst fears and leaped into the boat ; and Lizzy , who stood with her oar fixed , instantly pushed from the shore . Curses burst from the lips of their balked pursuers . " We 'll have them yet , " exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and get out a boat ! " Our boat 's company was silent . Herbert , amid a host of other anxieties , was , as he felt Lady Anne 's tremulous grasp , bitterly repenting this last act of a rashness which he flattered himself experience had cured , and Isabella was thinking of the beating hearts at home . Dame Bengin , composed , and alone wholly intent on the present necessity , was the first to speak . " Do n't be scared , little lady , " she said ; " sit down quiet  --  do n't touch his arm  --  he 'll need all its strength . Do you take the tiller , Miss Linwood  --  mind exactly what I tell you  --  I know every turn in the current  --  do n't lay out so much strength on your oars , Captain Linwood  --  keep time to the dip of mine  --  that will do ! " Dame Bengin , with good reason , plumed herself on her nautical skill . Her father had been a pilot , and Lizzy being his only child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he considered the calamity of her sex , by giving her the habits of a boy . Her childhood was spent on the water , and nature and early training had endowed her with the masculine spirit and skill that now did her such good service . The courage and cowardice of impulse are too much the result of physical condition to be the occasion of either pride or shame . The wind was rising , the lightning becoming more vivid and continuous , and the pelting cold rain driving in the faces of our poor fugitives . The lightning gloriously lit up a wild scene ; the bay , a " phosphoric sea ; " the little islands , that seemed in the hurly-burly to be dancing on the crested waves ; and the shores , that looked like the pale regions of some ghostly land . Still the little boat leaped the waves cheeringly , and still no sound of fear was heard within it . There is something in the sublime manifestations of power in the battling elements , that either stimulates the mind of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above a consciousness of the mortality that invests it , or crushes it under a sense of its own impotence . Our little boat 's company were a group for a painter , if a painter could kindle his picture with electric light . Lizzy Bengin , her short muscular arms bared , and every nerve of body and mind strained , plied her oars , at each stroke giving a new order to her unskilled but most obedient coadjutors . Isabella 's head was bare , her dark hair hanging in masses on each side her face , her poetic eye turning from " heaven to earth and earth to heaven , " her face in the lurid light as pale as marble , and like that marble on which the sculptor has expressed his own divine imaginings in the soft forms of feminine beauty . Lady Anne sat at Herbert 's feet , her eye fixed on his face , passively and quietly awaiting her fate , not doubting that fate would be to go to the bottom , but feeling that such a destiny would be far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This dependance , " love overcoming the fear of death , " inspired Herbert with preternatural strength . His fine frank face beamed with hope and resolution , and his eye , as ever and anon it fell on the loving creature at his feet , was suffused with a mother 's tenderness . In the intervals of darkness they guided the boat by the lights on the shores , and towards a light that , kindled by a confederate of Lizzy Bengin 's for Herbert 's benefit , blazed steadily , in spite of the rain , a mile below Powles Hook . They were making fair headway , when they perceived a sail-boat put off from Whitehall . They were pursued , and their hearts sunk within them ; but Lizzy Bengin soon rallied , and her inspiring voice was heard , calculating the chances of escape . " The storm , " she said , " is in our favour  --  no prudent sailor would spread a sail in such a gusty night . The wind is flawy too , and we can manage our boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to puzzle them , and in some of their turns , if they have not more skill than any man has shown since my father 's day , they 'll capsize their boat . " We dare not attempt to describe the chase that followed ; the dexterous manoeuvring of the little boat , now setting towards Long Island , now back to the city , now for Governor 's Island , now up , and then down the river . We dare not attempt it . Heaven seems to have endowed a single genius of our land with a chartered right to all the water privileges for the species of manufacture in which we are engaged , and his power but serves to set in desperate relief the weakness of his inferiors . The water is not our element , and we should be sure to show an " alacrity in sinking . " Suffice it to say , it seemed that the efforts of our little boat 's crew must prove unavailing ; that after Dame Bengin 's sturdy spirit had yielded to her woman 's nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common signals of her sex 's weakness in streaming tears and wringing hands , Herbert continued laboriously to row , till Lady Anne , fainting , dropped her head on his knee , and Isabella entreated him to submit at once to their inevitable fate . Nothing indeed now remained but to run the boat ashore , to surrender themselves to their pursuers , to obtain aid for Lady Anne , and secure protection to her and Isabella . The resolution taken , the boat was suddenly turned ; the sail-boat turned also , but too suddenly ; the wind struck and capsized it . The bay was in a blaze of light when the sail dipped to the water  --  intense darkness followed  --  no shriek was heard . After the first exclamations burst from the lips of our friends , not a sound proceeded from them , not a breath of exultation at a deliverance that involved their fellow-beings in destruction . The stroke of Herbert 's oars ceased , and the fugitives awaited breathlessly the next flash of lightning , to enable them to extend their aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was repeated , but nothing was to be seen but the boat drifting away at the mercy of the waves . A few moments more brought them to land , where , beside their beacon-light , stood an untenanted fisherman 's hut , in which they found awaiting them a comfortable fire and substantial food . These " creature comforts , " with rest and rekindled hope , soon did their work of restoration . And the clouds clearing away , and the stars shining out cheerily , Lizzy Bengin , aware that her presence rather encumbered and endangered the companions of her flight than benefited them , bade them a kind good-night , and sought refuge among some of her Jersey acquaintance , true-hearted to her , and to all their country 's friends . CHAPTER XXXIX . " Good to begin well , better to end well . " What was next to be done was as puzzling to our friends as the passage of that classic trio , the fox , the goose , and the corn , was to our childish ingenuity . Duty and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all possible expedition . General Washington was at Morristown , and the American army was going into winter quarters in its immediate vicinity . Thither Linwood must go , and so thought Lady Anne must she . " Fate , " she said , " had seconded her inclinations , and to contend against their united force was impossible ; why should she not give her hand to Herbert at once and be happy , instead of returning to vex and be vexed by her disappointed aunt ? After they had made sure of happiness and Heaven 's favour , for Heaven would smile on the union of true and loving hearts , let the world gossip to its heart 's content about Linwood running off with an heiress ; he who was so far above a motive so degrading and soul-sacrificing , could afford the imputation of it , and would soon outlive it . " There was both nature and truth in her reasoning , and it met with her lover 's full and irrepressible sympathy ; with Isabella 's too , but not with her acquiescence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her keen participation in the happiness of other to oppose it , and to hazard by delay the loss of its richest materials . There was an earnest seconding of their entreaties , too , from a voice in the secret depths of her heart , which whispered that Eliot Lee was at Morristown ; but what of that ? ay , Isabella , what of that ? Once at Morristown , her return to the city might be indefinitely delayed ; innumerable obstacles might interpose , and to return to her father was an imperative and undeferable duty . To permit Lady Anne to proceed without her would be to expose her to gossip and calumny . Isabella 's was the ruling spirit ; and after arguments , entreaties , and many tears on the lady 's part , the lovers deferred to the laws of propriety as expounded by her ; and it was agreed that Linwood should escort the ladies to the outskirts of the Dutch village of Bergen , which could not be more than two or three miles distant ; that there they should part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour 's delay might easily be compassed . Accordingly , two hours before daylight , they set forth , following , through obscure and devious footpaths , the general direction of Bergen . Miranda truly says , " it is the good-will to the labour that makes the task easy . " Lady Anne had no goodwill to hers , and her footsteps were feeble and faltering . The day dawned , the sun rose , and as yet they saw no landmarks to indicate the vicinity of Bergen . Herbert feared they had missed their way ; but without communicating his apprehensions , he proposed the ladies should take shelter in a log-hut they had reached , and which he thought indicated the proximity of a road , while he went to reconnoitre . He had been gone half an hour , when Isabella and Lady Anne were startled by the firing of guns . They listened breathlessly . The firing was repeated , but unaccompanied by the sound of voices , footsteps , or the trampling of horses . " It is not near , " said Isabella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terror ; " Herbert will hear it and return to us , and we are quite safe here . " " Yes ; but if he is taken  --  murdered , Isabella ? Oh , let us go and know the worst . " " It would be folly , " replied Isabella , " to expose ourselves , and risk the possibility of missing Herbert ; but if you will be quiet , we will creep up to that eminence , " pointing to a hill before them ; " if it is cleared on the other side , we may see without being seen . " They forthwith mounted the hill , which presented a view of an open country , traversed by several cross-roads . The point where they intersected , a quarter of a mile distant , at once fixed their gaze . A party of some thirty Americans , part mounted and part on foot , were engaged in a hot contest with more than an equal number of the enemy . Lady Anne grasped Isabella 's arm , both were silent for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It is  --  it is he ! " " Who ? where  --  what mean you ? " " Your brother , Isabella !  --  there , the foremost ! on the black horse ! " " It is he ! God have mercy on us !  --  and there is Eliot Lee ! " Lady Anne 's eye was riveted to Linwood . " There are three upon him , " she screamed ; " fly , fly !  --  Oh , why does he not fly ? " " He fights bravely , " cried Isabella , covering her eyes . " Heaven aid you , my brother ! " " It 's all over , " shrieked Lady Anne . Isabella looked again . Herbert 's horse had fallen under him . " No , no , " she cried ; " he lives ! he is rising ! " " But they are rushing on him  --  they will cut him to pieces ! " Isabella sprang forward , as if she would herself have gone to his rescue , exclaiming  --  " My brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid ! God be praised !  --  See , Anne !  --  look up . Now they fight side by side !  --  Courage , courage , Anne ! Mercy upon us , why does Eliot Lee turn back ? " " Oh , why does not Herbert turn too ? if he would but fly while he can ! " " Ah , there he comes ! " exclaimed Isabella , without heeding her companion 's womanly wish , " urging forward those men from behind the wagons  --  On , on , good fellows ! Ah , that movement is working well  --  see , see ; the enemy is disconcerted ! they are falling back ! thank God , thank God ! See what confusion they are in ; they are running , poor wretches ; they are falling under that back fire ! " The flying party had taken a road which led to an enclosed meadow , and they were soon stopped by a fence . This opposed a slight obstacle , but it occasioned delay . The Americans were close upon them ; they turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shortly after , Eliot Lee , his face radiant with a joy that fifty victories could not have inspired , stood at the entrance of the log-hut , informing the ladies that Linwood had confided them to his care ; Linwood himself having received a wound , which , though slight , unfitted him for that office , and rendered immediate surgical aid desirable to him . His friend had bidden him say to Miss Linwood that they had wandered far from Bergen ; and that as they could not now get there without the danger of encountering parties of the enemy , nothing remained but to accept Captain Lee 's protection to Morristown . " Do you hesitate now , Isabella ? " asked Lady Anne , impatiently . " No , my dear girl , there is now no choice for us . " " Thank Heaven for that . Nothing but necessity would conquer you , Isabella . " The necessity met a very willing submission from Isabella ; and she was half inclined to acquiesce in a whispered intimation from Lady Anne , " that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morristown . " They were soon seated in a wagon , and proceeding forward , escorted by Eliot and a guard , and hearing from him the following explanation of his most fortunate meeting with Linwood . Eliot Lee had been sent by Washington , with wagons , and a detachment of chosen men , to afford a safe convoy for some important winter-stores that had been run across from New-York to the Jersey shore for the use of the officers ' families at Morristown . In the meantime , a vigilant enemy had sent an intimation of the landing of these stores , and of their destination , to the British station at Powles Hook , and a detachment of men had been thence despatched with the purpose of anticipating the rightful proprietors . Eliot , on his route , encountered one of the enemy 's videttes , whom he took prisoner , and who , to baffle him , told him the stores were already at Powles Hook . Eliot , warily distrusting the information , proceeded , and directly after , and just as he came in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wood . A half moment 's explanation was enough . The vidette was dismounted , Herbert put in his place , armed with his arms , and a golden opportunity afforded ( to which the brave fellow did full justice ) , to win fresh laurels wherewith to grace his return to the dreaded , and yet most desired , presence of his commander . CHAPTER XL . " Our profession is the chastest of all . The shadow of a fault tarnishes our most brilliant actions . The least inadvertence may cause us to lose that public favour which is so hard to gain . " The quotation from a public reprimand of Washington to a general officer , which forms the motto to this chapter , contains the amount of his reproof to Linwood in their first and private interview . Even this reproof was softened by the generous approbation his general expressed of the manliness and respectful submission with which he had endured the penalty of his rashness . Linwood 's heart was touched ; and , obeying the impulse of his frank nature , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a sort of dot and line sketch of his love-tale to the awe-inspiring Washington . Oh the miracles of love ! But let not too much power be ascribed to the blind god . Linwood 's false impressions of Washington 's impenetrable sternness were effaced by his own experience , the most satisfactory of all evidence . He found that this great man , like Him whom he imitated , was not strict to mark iniquity , and was , whenever he could be so without the sacrifice of higher duties , alive to social virtues and affections . " Well , my young friend , " he said , as Linwood concluded , " you certainly have made the most of your season of affliction , and now we must take care of these generous companions of your flight . Our quarters are stinted ; but Mrs. Washington has yet a spare room , which they must occupy till they can return with safety to the city , and choose to do so . " Linwood thought himself , and with good reason , requited a thousand fold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had soon after the happiness of presenting his sister and Lady Anne Seton to Mrs. Washington , a most benign and excellent woman , and of confiding them to the hospitalities of her household . Eliot and Linwood 's gallantry , in their rencounter with the enemy , was marked , and advanced them in the opinion of their fellow-officers ; but the signal favour it obtained from the ladies of Morristown , must have been in part a collateral consequence of the immense importance , to their domestic comfort , of those precious stores which our friends had secured for them . Their sympathy in the romantic adventures of the young ladies was manifested in the usual feminine mode , by a round of little parties : from stern necessity , frugal entertainments , but abounding in one luxury , so rare where all others now abound , that it might be thought unattainable ; the highest luxury of social life  --  what is it ? With the luggage of our heroines came encouraging accounts from Mrs. Archer of Bessie Lee 's progress , assurances of Mr. Linwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prudent for her young friends to remain where they were till the excitement , occasioned by their departure , had subsided . Still Isabella was so thoroughly impressed with the filial duty of returning without any voluntary delay , that at her urgent request , measures were immediately taken to effect it ; but obstacle after obstacle intervened . Sir Henry Clinton was about taking his departure for the south , and he put off from time to time giving an official assurance of an act of oblivion in favour of our romantic offenders . The rigours of that horrible winter of 1780 , still unparalleled in the annals of our hard seasons , set in , and embarrassed all intercommunication . It must be confessed , that Isabella bore these trials with such gracious patience , that it hardly seemed to be the result of difficult effort . It was quite natural that she should participate in the overflowing happiness of her brother and friend . And it was natural that , being now an eyewitness of the struggles , efforts , endurance , and entire self-sacrifice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perception , and vigorous in reflection , should be excited and gratified . There are those who deem political subjects beyond the sphere of a woman 's , certainly of a young woman 's mind . But if our young ladies were to give a portion of the time and interest they expend on dress , gossip , and light reading , to the comprehension of the constitution of their country , and its political institutions , would they be less interesting companions , less qualified mothers , or less amiable women ? " But there are dangers in a woman 's adventuring beyond her customary path . " There are ; and better the chance of shipwreck on a voyage of high purpose , than expend life in paddling hither and thither on a shallow stream , to no purpose at all . Isabella 's mind was not regularly trained ; and , like that of most of her sex , the access to it was through the medium of her feelings . Her sympathies were not limited to the few , the " bright , the immortal names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . She saw the same virtues that illustrated them conspicuous in the poor soldiers ; in that class of men that have been left out in the world 's estimate , and whose existence is scarcely recognised in its past history . The winter of 1780 was characterized by Washington as " the decisive moment , the most important America had seen ! " The financial affairs of the country were in the utmost disorder . The currency had so depreciated , that a captain 's pay would scarcely furnish the shoes in which he marched to battle . The soldiers were without clothes or blankets , and this in our coldest winter . They had been but a few days in their winter quarters before the flour and meat were exhausted ; and yet , as Washington said in a letter to Congress , after speaking of the patient and uncomplaining fortitude with which the army bore their sufferings , " though there had been frequent desertions  --  not one mutiny . " Happy was it for America that , in the beginning of her national existence , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profiting by her experience , was confirmed in her resolution to confide her destinies to them ! Something above the ordinary standard has been claimed for our heroine ; but it must be confessed , after all , that she was a mere woman , and that the mainspring of her mind 's movements was in her heart . How much of Isabella 's enthusiasm in the American cause was to be attributed to her intercourse with Eliot Lee , we leave to be determined by her peers . That intercourse had never been disturbed by the cross-purposes , jarring sentiments , clashing opinions , and ever-annoying disparities , that had so long made her life resemble a troubled dream . Eliot 's world was her world ; his spirit answered to hers . During that swift month that had flown away at Morristown , how often had she secretly rejoiced in the complete severance of the chain that had so long bound her to an " alternate slave of vanity and love ! "  --  how she exulted in her freedom  --  freedom ! the voluntary service of the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers to Isabella and Lady Anne 's return to the city . The day was fixed ; it came ; and while they were packing their trunks , and thinking of the partings that awaited them , Lady Anne 's eyes streaming , and Isabella 's changing cheek betraying a troubled heart , a letter was handed to Lady Anne . She looked at the superscription , threw it down , then resumed it , broke the seal , and read it . Without speaking , she mused over it for a moment , then suddenly disappeared , leaving her affairs unarranged , and did not return till Isabella 's trunk was locked , and she was about wrapping herself in her travelling furs . She reproved her little friend 's delay , urged haste , suggested consolation , and offered assistance . Lady Anne made no reply , but bent over her trunk , where , instead of arrangement , she seemed to produce hopeless confusion . " How strange , " she exclaimed , " that Thrse should have sent me this fresh white silk dress ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . " " Bless Thrse ! Here is my Brussels veil , too ! " " My dear child , are you out of your senses ? Our escort will be waiting  --  pray , pray make haste . " " And pray , dear Belle , do n't stand looking at me  --  you fidget me so . Oh , I forgot to tell you Captain Lee asked for you  --  he is in the drawing-room  --  go down to him  --  please , dear Belle . " As Lady Anne looked up , Isabella was struck with the changed expression of her countenance ; it was bright and smiling , the sadness completely gone . But she did not stay to speculate on the change , nor did she , it must be confessed , advert to Lady Anne for the next fifteen minutes . Many thoughts rushed through her mind as she descended the stairs . She wondered , painfully wondered , if Eliot would allude to their memorable parting at Mrs. Archer 's ; " if he should repeat what he then said , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawing-room door , she was obliged to pause to gain self-command ; and when she opened it she was as pale as marble , and her features had a stern composure that would have betrayed her effort to any eye but Eliot 's ; to his they did not . Eliot attempted to speak the commonplaces of such occasions , and she to answer them ; but his sentences were lame , and her replies monosyllables ; and they both soon sunk into a silence more expressive of their mutual feelings . " Lady Anne said he asked for me  --  well , it was but to tell me the cold has abated !  --  and the sleighing is fine ! and he trusts I shall reach the city without inconvenience ! What a poor simpleton I was to fancy that such sudden and romantic devotion could be lasting . A very little reality  --  a little everyday intercourse , has put the actual in the place of the ideal ! " If Isabella had ventured to lift her eye to Eliot 's face at this moment , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her false surmises ; and if her eye had met his , the conflict might have ceased , for it takes but a spark to explode a magazine . But Eliot had come into her presence resolved to resist the impulses of his heart , however strong they might be . He thought he should but afflict her generous nature by a second expression of his love , and his grief at parting . There had been moments when a glance of Isabella 's eye , a tone of her voice  --  a certain indescribable something , which those alone who have heard and seen such can conceive , had flashed athwart his mind like a sunbeam , and visions of bliss in years to come had passed before him ; but clouds and darkness followed , and he remembered that Miss Linwood was unattainable to him  --  that if it were possible by the devotion of years to win her , how should he render that devotion , pledged as he was to his country for a service of uncertain length , and severed as he must be from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Isabella , he had been trained in the school of self-subjection , and never had he given such a proof of it as in these last few moments ; the last he expected ever to enjoy or suffer with her . Both were so absorbed in their own emotions that they did not notice the various entrances and exits of the servants , who were bustling in and out , and arranging cake and wine on a sideboard , with a deal of significance that would have amused unconcerned spectators . A louder , more portentous bustle followed , the door was thrown wide open , and both Eliot and Isabella were startled from their reveries by the entrance of Mrs. Washington , attended by a gentleman in clerical robes , and followed by Linwood and Lady Anne , in the bridal silk and veil that Thrse , with inspiration worthy a French chambermaid , had forwarded . " One word with you , Miss Linwood , " said Mrs. Washington , taking Isabella apart . " This dear little girl , it seems , was left independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your family have alone prevented her surrendering her independence into your brother 's hands . She has this morning received a letter from her aunt , written in a transport of rage , at her son 's unexpected marriage with a Miss Ruthven . I fancy it is a Miss Ruthven of the Virginia family  --  Grenville Ruthven 's eldest daughter ? " " Yes  --  yes  --  it is , madam , " replied Isabella , with a faltering voice . The emotion passed with the words . " Lady Anne 's aunt , " resumed Mrs. Washington , " declares her intention of immediately returning to England , and renounces her niece for ever . Lady Anne and your brother have referred their case to me ; she saying , with her usual playfulness , that she has turned rebel , and put herself under the orders of the commander-in-chief , or rather , he being this morning absent , under mine . I have decided according to my best judgment There seems to be no sufficient reason why they should defer their nuptials , and endure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear Miss Linwood , you have nothing to do but submit to my decision  --  take your place there as bride's-maid  --  you see your brother has already stationed his friend , Captain Lee , beside him as groom's-man  --  Colonel Hamilton is waiting our summons to give away the bride . " At a signal from his mistress , a servant opened the door to the adjoining room , and Hamilton entered , his face glowing with the sympathies and chivalric sentiment always ready to gush from his heart when its social spring was touched . Isabella had but time to whisper to Lady Anne , " Just what I would have prayed for had I dared to hope it , " when the clergyman opened his book and performed his office . That over , Mrs. Washington , as the representative of the parents , pronounced a blessing on the bridal pair ; and that no due ceremonial should be omitted , the bridal cake was cut and distributed according to established usage ; accompanied by a remark from Mrs. Washington , that it must have been compounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only orthodox plum cake that had been or was like to be seen in Morristown , during that hard winter . Now came partings , and tears , and last kind words , and messages that were sure to find their way to Mr. Linwood 's heart , and a bit of wedding-cake for mamma , who would scarcely have believed her son lawfully married unless she had tasted it ; and last of all , an order for a fine new suit for Rose , in compensation for that so unceremoniously dropped at " Smith 's house . " At last , Isabella , in a covered sleigh , escorted by a guard , and attended by her brother and Eliot Lee on horseback , set off for the place appointed for her British friends to meet her , and there she was transferred to their protection . What Eliot endured , as he lingered for a moment at Isabella 's side , can not be expressed . She felt her heart rising to her eyes and cheeks , and by an effort of that fortitude , or pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever name it may be called , she firmly said , " Farewell ! " Eliot 's voice was choked . He turned away without speaking ; he impulsively returned and withdrew the curtain that hung before Isabella . She was in a paroxysm of grief , her head thrown back , her hands clasped , and tears streaming from her eyes . What a spectacle  --  what a blessed spectacle for a self-distrusting , hopeless lover ! " Isabella ! " he exclaimed , " we do not then part for ever ? " " I hope not , " she replied . The driver , unconscious of Eliot 's returning movement , cracked his whip , the horses started on their course , and the road making a sudden turn , the sleigh instantly disappeared , leaving Eliot feel ing as if he had been translated to another world  --  a world of illimitable hope , immeasurable joy . " I hope not . ' " Could Isabella have uttered a more commonplace reply ? and yet these words , with the emotion that preceded them , were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through summer and winter  --  ay , for years . " Ah , n'en doutons pas ! travers les temps et les espaces , les mes ont quelquefois des correspondances mysterieuses . En vain le monde rel lve ses barrires entre deux tres qui s'aiment ; habitans de la vie idale , ils s'apparaissent dans l'absence , ils s'unissent dans la mort . " CHAPTER XLI . " Boy , fill me a bumper  --  now join in the chorus , There 's happiness still in the prospect before us ; In this sparkling glass all hostility ends , And Britons and we will for ever be friends . Derry down , derry down . "  --  Old Song . More than three years from the date of our last chapter had passed away . The European statesmen were tired of the silly effort to keep grown-up men in leading-strings , and their soldiers were wearied with combating in fields where no laurels grew for them . The Americans were eager , the old to rest from their labours , and the young to reap the fruit of their toils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reunion of two nations who were of one blood and one faith . King George , firm or obstinate to the last , had yielded his reluctant consent to the independence of his American colonies ; and the peace was signed , which was welcomed by all parties , save the few American royalists who were now to suffer the consequences that are well deserved by those who learn unwillingly , and too late , that their own honour and interest are identified with their country 's . The 25th of November , 1783 , was , as we are annually reminded by the ringing of bells and firing of cannon , a momentous day in this city of New-York . It was the time appointed for the evacuation of the city by the British forces , and the entrance of the American commander-in-chief with his army . To the royalists who had remained in the garrisoned city , attached from principle , and fettered by early association , to the original government , this was a day of darkness and mourning . With their foreign friends went , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory . We may smile at their weakness , but can not deny them our sympathy . Such men as Sir Guy Carleton ( Sir Henry Clinton 's successor ) , who made even his enemies love him , had a fair claim to the tears of his friends ; and others were there whose names grace the history of our parent land , and names not mentioned that were written on living hearts , and which made partings that day " Such as press the life from out young hearts . " Though on the very verge of winter , the day was bright and soft . The very elements were at peace . At the rising of the sun , the British flag on the Battery was struck . Boats were in readiness at the wharves to convey the troops , and such of the inhabitants as were to accompany them , down to Staten Island , where the British ships were awaiting them . At an early hour , and before the general embarcation , a gentleman , much muffled , and evidently sedulously avoiding observation , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his luggage had already been conveyed , and which , as soon as he entered it , put off towards the fleet . He looked soured and abstracted , eager to depart , and yet not joyful in going . His attitude was dejected , and his eyes downcast , till some sound that betokened an approach to the ship roused him , when suddenly looking up , he beheld , leaning over the side of the vessel , an apparition that called the blood and the spirit to his face . This apparition was his wife  --  Mrs. Jasper Meredith . There she stood , bowing to him , and smiling , and replying adroitly to such congratulations from the officers of the ship as , " Upon my word , Mrs. Meredith , you leave the country with spirit  --  your husband should take a leaf out of your book . " Meredith entered the ship . His wife took him by the arm and led him aside . " One word to you , my dear love , " she said , " before that cloud on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your secret intention , and your secret preparations to go off with the fleet , and leave me here to get on as I could . I took my measures to defeat yours . You should know , before this time of day , that I am never foiled in what I undertake  --  " " No , by Heaven , never . " " There 's no use in swearing about it , my love ; nor will there be any use , " she added , changing her tone of irony to a cutting energy , " in doing what , as my husband  --  my lord and master  --  you may do , in raising a storm here , refusing to pay my passage , and sending me back to the city . Officers  --  gentlemen , you know , all take the part of an oppressed wife  --  you would be put in Coventry , and make your dbut in England at great disadvantage . So , my dear , make the best of it ; let our plans appear to be in agreement . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve that to enliven domestic scenes in England . " " In England ! my mother declares she will never receive you there ; and I am now utterly dependant on my mother . " " I know all that ; I have seen your mother 's letters . " Meredith stared . " Yes , all of them ; and in them all she reiterates her governing principle , that appearances must be managed . ' I shall convince her that I am one of the managers , and the prima donna in this drama of appearances . " Meredith made no reply . He saw no eligible way of escape , and he was , like a captive insect , paralyzed in the web that enclosed him . " You are convinced , I perceive , my dear ; " continued his loving wife , " be kind enough to give me a few guineas ; I paid my last to the boatmen , and it is awkward being without money . " Meredith turned from her , and walked hurriedly up and down the deck ; then stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but his purpose was suspended by his eye falling accidentally on the card , on which , ten years before , he had recorded Effie 's prediction . The card was yellow and defaced ; but like a talisman , it recalled with the freshness of actual presence the long but not forgotten past  --  the time when Isabella Linwood 's untamed pulses answered to his  --  when Bessie Lee 's soft eye fell tenderly upon him  --  when he was linked in friendship with Herbert  --  when the lights of nature still burned in his soul  --  while as yet his spirit had not passed under the world 's yoke , and crouched under its burden of vanity , heartlessness , and sordid ambition . His eye glanced towards his wife , he tore the card in pieces , and honest , bitter tears flowed down his cheeks . Bessie Lee , thou wert then avenged ! Avenged ? Sweet spirit of Christian forgiveness and celestial love , we crave thy pardon ! Bessie Lee , restored to her excellent mother , and to her peaceful and now most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " rectified spirit . " The vigorous mind of Mrs. Archer , and Isabella 's frank communication of her own malady and its cure , had aided in the entire dissipation of Bessie 's illusions , and no shadow of them remained but a sort of nun-like shrinking from the admiration and devotion of the other sex . She lived for others , and chiefly to minister to the sick and sorrowful . She no longer suffered herself ; but the chord of suffering had been so strained that it was weakened , and vibrated at the least touch of the miseries of others . The satirist who scoffs at the common fact of devotion succeeding love in a woman 's heart , is superficial in the philosophy of our nature . He knows not that woman 's love implies a craving for happiness , a dream of bliss that human character and human circumstances rarely realize , and a devotedness and self-negation due only to the Supreme . The idol falls , and the heart passes to the true God . " All things on earth shall wholly pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live and last for aye . " That love of God , that sustaining , life-giving principle , waxed stronger and stronger in Bessie Lee as she went on in her pilgrimage . Her pilgrimage was not a long one ; and when it ended , the transition was gentle from the heaven she made on earth to that which awaited her in the bosom of the Father . We return to the shifting scenes in New-York . The morning was allotted to the departure of the British . " Rose , " said Mr. Linwood , " give me my cloak and fur shoes , and I will go through the garden to Broadway , and see the last of them  --  God bless them ! " " And my cloak and calche , Rose , " said Mrs. Linwood ; " it is a proper respect to show our friends that our hearts are with them to the last  --  it should be a family thing . Come , Belle ; and you , Lady Anne , come too . " name=f345-272Page image - Page 275 . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray do not call me Lady Anne . I have told you , again and again , that I have renounced my title , and will have no distinction but that which suits the country of my adoption  --  that which I may derive from being a good wife and mother  --  the true American order of merit . " " As you please , my dear child ; but it is a singular taste . " " Singular to prefer Mrs. Linwood to Lady Anne ! Oh , no , mamma . " Mrs. Linwood received the tribute with a grateful smile , and afterward less frequently forgot her daughter-in-law 's injunction . Her affections always got the better of her vanity  --  after a slight contest . " Rose , " continued Lady Anne , " please put on little Herbert 's fur cap , and take him out to see the show too . Is not that a pretty cap , mamma ? I bought it at Lizzy Bengin 's . " " Lizzy Bengin 's ! Has Lizzy returned ? " " Yes , indeed ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her little household deity Sylvy again , who is screaming out as zealously as ever  --  Come in , come in . ' Lizzy , they say , is to have a pension from Congress . " 2 " The d  --  l she is ! " exclaimed Mr. Linwood ; " well , every thing is turned topsy-turvy now . Come , are we not all ready ? where lags Belle ? " Isabella entered in a very becoming hat and cloak , adjusted with more than her usual care , and her countenance brilliant with animation . " Upon my word , Miss Belle , " said her father , passing his hand over her glowing cheek , " you are hanging out very appropriate colours for this mournful occasion . " " The heart never hangs out false colours , papa . " " Ah , Belle , Belle ! that I should live to see you a traitor too ; but I do live , and bear it better than I could have expected . " " Because , papa , it no longer seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I 'll be hanged if it do n't , just the same ; but then , Belle , I 'll tell you what it is that 's kept the sap running warm and freely in this old , good-for-nothing trunk of mine . My child , " the old man 's voice faltered , " you have been true and loyal to me through all this dark time of trial and adversity ; you have been a perpetual light and blessing to my dwelling , Belle ; and Herbert  --  if a man serves the devil , I 'd have him serve him faithfully  --  Herbert , in temptation and sore trials , has been true to the cause he chose  --  up to the mark . This it is that 's kept me heart-whole . And , Belle , if ever you are a parent , which God grant , for you deserve it , you 'll know what it is to have your very life rooted in the virtue of your children , and sustained by that  --  yes , as mine is , sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to succumb to these rebel upstarts , and I have to look on and see every gentleman driven out of the land to give place to these rag-tag and bobtails . " " But , papa , " said Isabella , anxious to turn her father 's attention from the various groups gathering in the street , and who , it was evident , were only waiting , according to the previous compact , for the last British boat to leave the wharf , to give utterance to their joyous " huzzas ; " " but , papa , you have overlooked some important items in your consolations . " " I have not mentioned them ; but they are main props . Anne , God bless her ! and that little dog , " he shook his cane lovingly at his grandson , who crowed a response , " though he was born under Washington 's flag , and sucks in independence and republicanism with his mother 's milk , the little rascal . " In spite of Mr. Linwood 's habitual vituperation , it was evident that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was in it only a few salutary bitter drops , without which there is no draught commingled for human lips . Mrs. Archer with her children now joined her friends , and they were all grouped under a fine old locust that stood just without the wall of Mr. Lin wood 's garden , and was among the few trees that retained any foliage at this advanced season . The last foreign regiment were passing from Broadway to the Battery , in the admirable order and condition of British troops : their arms glittering , the uniform of the soldiers fresh and unsullied , and that of the officers , who had seen little service to deface and disarrange it , in a state of preservation rather indicating a drawing-room than a battlefield . Mr. Linwood gazed after them , and said , sorrowfully , " We ne'er shall look upon their like again . " " I hope not , " muttered Rose to herself , in the back-ground ; " this a' n't to be the land for them that strut in scarlet broadcloth and gold epaulets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , thank God  --  and General Washington . " " Ah , " said Mrs. Archer , " there is good old General Knyphausen turning the key of his door for the last time . Heaven 's blessing will go with him , for he never turned it upon a creature that needed his kindness . " The good old German crossed the street , grasped Mr. Linwood 's hand , kissed the hands of the ladies , and without speaking , rejoined his suite and passed on . " Who are those young gallants , Isabella , " asked Mr. Linwood , " that seem riveted to the pavement at Mrs.  --  ' s door ? " Isabella mentioned their names , and added , " Miss  --  is there , a magnet to the last moment  --  a hard parting that must be . " No wonder it was deemed a " hard parting , " if half that is told by her contemporaries of Miss  --  ' s beauty and auxiliary charms be true ; a marvellous tale , but not incredible to those who see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than fifty years , vivacious , courteous , and bright-eyed . While Lady Anne was deepening the colour on Isabella 's cheek by whispering , " Better a coming than a parting lover ! " our old friend Jupiter , arm in arm with his boon companion " the gen'ral , " was passing . " Where are you going in such haste , Jupe ? " asked his ex-master , in reply to Jupiter 's respectful salutation . " I am ' gaged to black Sam ' to dine with General Washington , sir . " Mr. Linwood had been told that a fte was in preparation at " black Sam 's , " the great restaurateur of his day , for General Washington and his friends . He was ready to believe almost any extravagance of the levelling Americans ; but the agrarianism that made Jupiter a party at the festive board with the commander-in-chief rather astounded him . " By the Lord ! " he whispered to Isabella , " Herbert shall come home and eat his dinner . " " You mean , Jupe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that you are engaged to wait on General Washington , at black Sam 's ? " " Sartin , Miss Isabella ; did not I'spress myself so ? " " Not precisely , Jupe ; but I understood you so . " Jupiter drew near to Miss Linwood , whom he , in common with others , looked upon as the presiding genius of the family , to unfold a wish that lay very near his heart . But Jupe was a diplomatist , and was careful not to commit himself in the terms of a treaty . " Miss Belle , " he said , " I hear Mrs. Herbert Linwood has got a nice char'ot sent over from England , and if she wants a coachman , I do n't know but I might like to come back to the old place . " " Very well , Jupe , I will speak to my sister , and we will consider of it . " " Do , Miss Belle , and I 'll ' sider of it too . I have not ' finitly made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to be such bustle and racket here , building ships and stores , and all this space , " pointing to the still vacant space between Broadway and the river , " all this space to be covered with housen bigger than them burnt down . I 'm afraid there 'll be too much work and ' fusion for me ; ' tant genteel , you know , Miss Belle , and I think of ' tiring to the manor . " " That will be wisest , Jupe ; New-York will no longer be a place for idlers of any degree . " Jupiter , all complacency in a classification which sorted him with those whom he styled the genteel , bowed and passed on . Music was now heard from the extremity of the Battery . All had embarked save the band . The band , that had been the pride and delight of the inhabitants , through winter and summer , now struck up , for the last time , " God save the king ! " Every sound was hushed , and white handkerchiefs were waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncovered his head , and the tears trickled down his cheeks . As the music ceased , Edward Archer , who stood with his arm over his sister 's shoulder , said , " Oh , Lizzy , how we shall miss the band ! " " Miss them ! No , Ned ; not when we get back to dear breezy Beech Hill , and hear the birds , and smell the flowers , and have none to hurt us nor make us afraid . " The last boat put off from the wharf , and at the next instant the " star-spangled banner " was unfurled from the flagstaff , and every bell in the city poured forth its peal of welcome to the deliverer of his country , who was seen , at the head of a detachment of his army , approaching the city through the Fields , then the general designation of all that portion of New-York beyond the British palisades which traversed Broadway at Chambers-street . Those who are familiar with the location of this our noble street of Broadway , the pride of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the spectators . They saw the flag of an independent empire waving on the Battery ; beyond , the bay , glittering in the meridian sun ; and , floating on the bay , the ships that were to convey their late masters for ever from the land that had rejected them . At the upper extremity of the street appeared General Washington , the spotless patriot , the faultless military chieftain , the father of his country ; " first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen : " he on whom every epithet of praise has been exhausted , and whose virtues praise never yet reached . With him were his companions in arms and glory , and following him his soldiers , their garments worn and soiled , and their arms broken and defaced . It mattered not . The period of toils and hardship , of hope and fear , of seed-time , was past  --  the harvest was to come , the abundant harvest to them , their children 's children , and the stranger within their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to turn ; a few paces lower down was the locust-tree where our friends were grouped . As the cavalcade approached , Mr. Linwood began to show signs of fidgeting . Isabella 's arm was in his : " Let us go in , sir , " she said . " Presently , my dear , presently ; I 'll have one look at Washington . By George of Oxford ! a noble figure of a man ! Ah , but for him , the rebels would never have carried the day . " " For him , and the Lord on their side ! " involuntarily added Rose , who had advanced to give her little charge a chance at a glance at his father . " The Lord on the side of such a ragged regiment of ragamuffins ? High sons of liberty , forsooth ! " replied Mr. Linwood , chuckling at the wretched appearance of the American soldiers . " They are extremely ragged , " said Mrs. Linwood ; " such a contrast to our army . " " They are , God bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my eyes , as the garments of the saints , are these outward signs of their brave toils . " " Oh , " exclaimed Mrs. Herbert Linwood , " I see my husband !  --  and there , Belle , is Colonel Lee , on the very horse General Putnam gave him . I wish his poor man Kisel , of whom I have so often heard him speak , had lived to amble after him this day . Poor fool ! ' Eliot will always have one part in his heart that 's sorry yet for thee . ' " Isabella 's eye had followed the direction of her sister 's ; her cheek became suddenly pale , and she reiterated her wish to her father to return into the house . " In a minute , my dear child , in a minute ; let 's first see them wheel into Wall-street . Who is that Colonel Lee you spoke of , Anne ? " " Eliot Lee , sir . Did not Belle tell you how he was sent with the detachment from the northern army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallantry at the taking of Cornwallis , that he received a colonelcy immediately after from Congress  --  did you not tell , Belle ? " she added , archly smiling at her sister . The turn into Wall-street was now to be made , and the officers riding ahead came nearly parallel to our friends . General Washington seeing , and instantly recognising , Isabella Linwood and her sister , saluted them . Mr. Linwood instinctively doffed his hat , and bowed low to the commander of the rebel army . Eliot Lee 's eye met Isabella 's , and returned its brightest beam to the welcome that flashed from hers . Herbert kissed his hand to his friends , and stretched his arms to his boy . Rose lifted the little fellow high in the air ; he was inspired with the animation of the scene , and the word that was then shouted forth from a thousand tongues , the first he ever uttered , burst from his lips  --  " Huzza ! " The following , and many successive evenings , Eliot Lee passed with the Linwoods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the close of these volumes , will not be surprised that our heroine , after her conquest over a misplaced , and , as it may strictly be termed , an accidental passion , should return with her whole heart his love who deserved , if man could deserve it , that treasure . Did the course of their true love run smooth ? Yes , true love though it was , it did . The bare fact that his daughter Isabella , who seemed to him fit to grace a peerage , was to wed the portionless son of a New-England farmer , was at first startling to Mr. Linwood . But , as few men are , he was true to his theories ; and when Isabella , quoting his own words on a former occasion , frankly confessed that she had given her heart to Eliot Lee , and " that meant her respect , honour , esteem , and all that one of God 's creatures can feel for another , " he replied , fondly kissing her , " Then God 's will be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are aware that the champions of romance , the sage expounders of the laws of sentiment , maintain that there can be but one love . We will not dispute with them , though we honestly believe , that in the capacities of loving , as in all other capacities , there be diversities of gifts ; but we will concede that such a sentiment as united Isabella and Eliot Lee can never be extinguished ; and therefore can never be repealed . It blended their purposes , pursuits , hopes , joys , and sorrows ; it became a part of their spiritual natures , and independent of the accidents of life . As the cause of humanity and the advance of civilization depend mainly on the purity of the institution of marriage , I shall not have written in vain if I have led one mind more highly to appreciate its responsibilities and estimate its results ; its effect not only on the happiness of life , but on that portion of our nature which is destined to immortality : if I persuade even one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate the social duties and ties , that she will not give her hand without her heart , nor her heart till she is quite sure of his good desert who seeks it . And , above all , I shall not have written in vain if I save a single young creature from the barter of youth and beauty for money , the merely legal union of persons and fortunes multiplying among us , partly from wrong education and false views of the objects of life , but chiefly from the growing imitation of the artificial and vicious society of Europe . It is only by entering into these holy and most precious bonds with right motives and right feelings , that licentious doctrines can be effectually overthrown , and the arguments of the more respectable advocates of the new and unscriptural doctrine of divorce can be successfully opposed . We boldly then advise our young friends so far to cultivate the romance of their natures ( if it be romance to value the soul and its high offices above all earthly consideration ) , as to eschew rich old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle , ignorant young heirs ; and to imitate our heroine in trusting to the honourable resources of virtue and talent , and a joint stock of industry and frugality , in a country that is sure to smile upon these qualities , and reward them with as much worldly prosperity as is necessary to happiness , and safe for virtue . Lizzy Bengin actually received the pension . Back matter NOTE TO VOLUME SECOND . a One of the thousand pleasing anecdotes related of La Fayette at his last visit to America , was , that a rich iron-merchant in one of our large cities was presented to him , and after the customary courtesies , took out his watch and showed it to La Fayette , asking him if he remembered it . La Fayette seemed to have an indistinct reminiscence of some circumstance connected with the watch . " You do not remember , sir , " said the merchant , " that at a certain time and place " ( specifying both ) , " you stopped at a blacksmith 's shop to have your horse shod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a most wretched condition .
