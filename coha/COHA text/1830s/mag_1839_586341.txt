txt THERE are but few men , indeed , of whom we would say , that they do honor to a great party . We are not prone to the common habit of the day , of exaggerating'the merits or importance of individuals , in comparison with that stupendous thing , a mass of aggregate millions . It is an honor , according to our conception , to any man , to belong to the Democratic party , if it be insincerity of heart , and with a liberal expansion of views to the comprehension of the grand , harmonious , simple , and sublime truths of its political faith . But if in any sense allowable , we know no individual , prominent among the public men of the day , to whom-for all the best qualities of heart and head , and a transparent purity of conduct in all the relations of life-we could more sincerely apply the expression , than to the subject of the present sketch . We have heard this opinion so oftea expressed in private , by political foes as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we feel perfectly justified in thus giving this public expression to it , rather as a matter of general consent than as any tribute of individual sentiment . Mr. Butler 's life presents none of those striking points , of connection with great events of national history , or of adventurous incident , which have lent their interest to some of the biographical narratives we have already presented in this series of Political Portraits . Though he has never yielded to any in the ardor of the interest he has always felt in the political contests of the times , it has only been within a recent period that he has suffered himself to be drawn from the retirement of private and professional life , to bear a conspicuous part on the public stage , in the stirring drama of our national politics . His way of life has therefore flowed on , like an even and unruffled stream , gathering its quiet depth of volume from a thousand springs unseen to the public ey6 and though scarcely perhaps noticed by the stranger whose admiration is rather attracted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusing a daily beneficent utility to the dwellers upon its tranquil borders , and an object of a far higher admiration to the more judicious eye that can better appreciate true excellence . Having risen from a humble beginning , by the quiet hut zealous exercise of those qualities which , similarly applied , can never fail // to command a similar success , industry , self-cultivation , integrity , and I ) *lrity of life , his career presents one of those pictures best illustrative of the spirit of our institutions , and best calculated for a useful example and encouragement to others . Mr. Butler is a native of Kinderhook , Columbia county , New York , and is therefore a fellow-townsman of his early and fast friend , the present President of Vhe United States . For the sake of precision it may be worth wh*Ie to distinguish , that he was born ( December 14th , 1795 , ) in that part of the town bordering on the river , usually known as Kinderhook Landing , though recently set off a separate town , by the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are both now living , in the enjoymenl of a healthy and honored green old age . The subject of the present memoir is their eldest son . Mr. Butler 's parentage has this peculiar interest , that those who know him find no difficulty in recognizing in his character , illustrated by his life , the traces of the different influences which his genealogy was calculated to combine in its formation . His father , Medad Butler , was born in Branford , Connecticut . The grandfather of the latter , Jonathan Butler , was one of two brothers , Irish adventurers , who came to Connecticut in about the rear 1710 ; and who may therefore be regarded as the earliest pioucers of that stream of emigration from the land of generous hearts and ardent temperaments , which has since poured its wealth over the whole extent of our country , and proved one of the most valuable elements of its growing prosperity . He married a descendant of the original Puritan settlers of that Colony . His son , Ezekiel , married Mabel Jones , a lineal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oliver Cromwell . This Colonel Jones was one the Regicide Judges , and after the Restoration suffered the penalty for that act whose stern glory shall immortalize the names of all who participated in it , by being beheaded for High Treason . His family came to Connecticut , and many of his descendants are to be found in different parts of- the United States . Such a descent , of the Irish stock , combined with the Puritan-the latter taking its origin from that stout and high-hearted bench of judges who inflicted the just doom of a nation 's vengeance on a tyrant who had dared to deserve its awful wrath , and directly from the side of Cromwell himself-harmonizes well with the quiet ardor of temperament , the calm firmness of purpose and clearness of judgment , the chastened enthusiasm , the strict purity of religious and moral principle , and the unwavering devotion to the great truths of democracy and freedom , which combine to characterize BENJAMIN FRANKLiN BUTLER . His father , after serving an apprenticeship , in New Haven , to a scythe-maker , emigrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and // 35 engaged soon after in mercantile business , first at Claverack , and afterwards at Kinderhook Landing , in connection with Stephen Hogeboom , then a Senator in the Legislature of the State , and whose name is well known , as one of the most venerated patriarchs of the Democracy of the State , ha*ving been , in fact , in connexion with George Clinton , one of the original founders of the Democratic Republican party of New Yqg*k . Mr. Butler 's father has always been a remarkably active and public .. spirited man ; has occupied a seat in the Legislature ; and has been for the last fifteen years one of the County Judges for Columbia county . In the course of his business , which was of the most multifarious character imaginable , his eldest son Benjamin from a very early age became an invaluable assistant ; and as book-keeper , store-keeper , tavern-keeper , farmer , in addition to the business of forwarding , ' as owner of a line of Hudson river sloops , in all which departments he was fectotum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , industry , and activity , together with an intimate acquaintance with all descriptions of the people , which has since proved invaluable to their possessor in a different profession and a more elevated sphere of life . The common schools in that part of the country being , at that period , in a very low state , his father , who had had the advantages of the better school system already in operation in New England , when his eldest son was about six years old , succeeded , by great exertion , in establishing a New England teacher in Kinderhook ; and until the excellent common school system of New York went into operation in 1813 , kept up the school mainly , if not solely , by his exertions ,  --  having been in the hiibit , for many successive years , of paying all the school-bills in advance to the teacher , and taking on himself all the trouble and risk of collecting them from the individuals , as well as chance might enable him in the course of his miscellaneous business . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father possessed but few books , * nor did the neighbourhood afford many mere , but all such as could be found and obtained by him were read with avidity . This taste , with the exhibition of an unusual capacity , and especially of a very remarkable memory , soon made him an object of particular attention these few , it may not be immaterial to mention , were the Works of Benjamin Franklin , which fastened on the mind of their reader with a peculiar force . The remark will be readily believed which we have heard from Mr. Butler himself that to the influence of that book and that name he ascribed , more than to any other cause , the formation of his character in the particular mould which it assumed , and of those habits of mind , and general views of men and things , which have given direction to his subsequent career in life . The incident , slight as it is , may not be without its utility to parents who may regard the hint as worthy of attention . // 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fifteen , though during the last five years of that period , at least half of his time was spent out of school , in assisting his father in his business , as already alluded to above . Latin and Greek , with a little French , and mathematics to no greater extent than the earlier rudiments of arithmetic , formed the bulk of the studies of this period , in which he was very assiduous and successful . On leaving school , in May , 1811 , his father 's circumstances not enabling him to send him to college , Mr. Van Buren , who was his father 's personal and political friend , entertaining a high opinion of his capacity , took him into his office , at Hudson , as a law student . To diminish the expenses which could not easily have been met by his father , without injustice to his other children , Mr. Van Buren , after a short trial of his services in the office , received him into his own family ; in which Mr. Butler continued to reside , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in fact for some time afterwards , till his own marriage , in the year 1818 . Thus was formed a friendship , founded on intimate and long familiarity , mutual confidence , respect , and attachment-combined , on the part of the subject of our memoir , with an ardor of gratitude equally honorable to both-which the progress of time could only serve to develope and confirm . The period of his clerkship as a student of law was spent in zealous assiduity to his profession , and to the general cultivation of his mind . Being for the first time placed in a situation affording ample means for the indulgence of his early passion for reading , the first A two or three years were devoted by him , in addition to the regular duties of the office , chiefly to miscellaneous literature ; and the range of his reading was very extensive and various . But after he commenced to address himself seriously to the duty of studying the law , he did so with a determination and industry rarely surpassed . These pursuits and studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest interest in the high political excitements that agitated the public mind at that period . An ardent democrat from the earliest opening of his mind to the perception of the great principles involved in the contest of parties , his pen indulged itself freely , and was wielded with no slight degree of energy and eloquence , in the columns of the Democratic paper of Hudson , the " Bee , " in support of the war , and of the administration of James Madison . And when at a later day he took his seat in the Cabinet of the late President of the United States , it was not an unpleasing reminiscence , that one of the earliest productions of his pen had been an animated eulogy of which the following was , substantially , the cornmencement . We give it as a not uninteresting instance of the confirmation of the early impressions of youth , by the mature judgment // of manhood , in relation to the same individual , on a closer inspection , and a different and more arduous theatre of action : " Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain the character said exalt the glory of the nation , while they have secured for themselves the approbation and applause of their country , ANDREW JACKSON is pre-eminently conspicuous . Bold and enterprising , to an extraordinary natural sagacity he adds an energy of character which enables him to triumph over every obstacle and find resources in every emergency . Undismayed by difficulties , regardless of reputation , and unawed by clamor , he is intluenced alone b*4is duty to the State , and in the course which that duty is designated , he is indefatigable , vigorous , and successful . " The same pen , set to the same task , would probably employ , at the present day , terms not materially different from the above . On Mr. Butler 's admission to the Bar , in 1817 , as an attorney of the Supreme Court and solicitor in Chancery , Mr. Van Buren , then Attorney General of the State , and resident at Albany , received him into partnership in his professional business ; which connection subsisted till the appointment of the latter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1821-with the exception of a interval of a few months in 1819 . This temporary separation was caused only by private reasons which it is of no importance to explain , though honorable to both , as evincing the greater , solicitude felt by each for the interests of the other than for his own . That interval was spent by Mr. Butler at Sandy Hill , Washington County , when he was induced to accept a flattering and advantageous office of the presidency of a bank , owned by Mr. Barker , of New York , and conducted in connexion with the larger banking institution in the city of New York managed by the latter in person . Mr. Butler , whose recent marriage connected him nearly with Mr. Barker , had already shown himself a decided advocate of free banking ; and had written a pamphlet on the subject , in which he urged forcibly the same general views of the true principles of republican freedom and of sound political economy , which are now becomin*r much more extensively popular in that State . It is rather a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that State , as the advocate of those liberal and wise views to which Mr. Butler has been consistently attached from the outset of his career , was at that time the very author of the celebrated Restraining Law , recently repealed , against which the pamphlet here alluded to was directed ,  --  , .. though we by no means would imply , in the credit to which this circumstance may entitle the one , any corresponding discredit upon that other , most upright , wise , and honest statesman . His acceptance of the presidency of the Washington County Bank , an incorporated institution , does not in the least impugn the consistency of his views on this subject . By a clause of the Restraining Law , Mr. Barker had been prohibited from maintaining his private bank , two years being allowed him for the settlement of its affairs . The restriction was , however , easily evaded by him by the purchase of nearly // the whole of the stock of the chartered institution referred to ; which was thus , when its charge was offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private one . The failure of Mr. Barker 's experiment is well knoivn ,  --  a failure by which those banks of our own ' day which we see unwisely attempting to combine a mercantile with their proper banking business , would ( 10 well to take caution . Mr* Barker failed as a banker , because he combined with that character the incompatible one of a mcrchd4t. he fall of his " Exchange Bank " dragged with it , of course , that of its subordinate branch ; which , in fact , was already in such a situation on Mr. Butler 's first assuming its management as to be compelled to suspend specie payments very shortly afterwards . This event restored Mr. Butler to his profession , though before he left the bank , by great exertions and care , its credit was restored and specie payments resumed . Immediately on his admission as eounsellor , in 1820 , Mr. Butler began to appear as an advocate in all the higher courts of the State . Mr. Van Buren , * with a liberality as rare in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quote an expression of the latter *r gave him every opportunity of appearing prominently and to advantage in the argument of cases ,  --  sometimes at his own expense ; and when his increasing public engagements , on another stage of action , took him from the Bar , much of his professional business naturally devolved upon Mr. Butler . We have heard the occasion of Mr. Butler 's first appearance in the Supreme Court described , ( January , 1821 , ) and it is not undeserving of notice . He was the attorney in the cause , with Colonel Burr and Mr. Van Buren , against the celebrated Mr. Henry , then at the head of the Albany Bar , and one of the most eminent lawyers in the State . The case turned on recondite questions of black-letter learning , and such was the impression made by Mr. Butler 's argument , that neither of his distinguished senior counsel thought it worth while to speak in the cause , which was gained singlehanded by the young advocate whose first effort was thus so arduous and so honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also won , in the next year , in a similar single comb*at with the same powerful antagonist ,  --  Mr. Van Buren , who had argued it in the Supreme Court below , having , on his own withdrawal from practice , advised his client to entrust it to Mr. Butler 's hands . This success placed Mr. Butler at once in the front rank of the profession . His practice has ever since been very extensive and important ; and in the Court of Errors , especially , has been ( with the exception of the period when the Revision of the Laws withdrew him from the courts ) perhaps as much as twice or thrice that of any other individual . In February , 1*1 , he was appointed the District Attorney of the city and county of Albany . This office , involving the duties of criminal prosecutor , was an laborious though useful school , as he had // constantly to appear against many of the ablest members of the profession , and never ( with the exception , we believe , of but a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to his manner of discharging the delicate functions of this office , which he resigned in March , 1825 , we feel at liberty to transfer from the minutes of the Court of Common Pleas , to the publicity of the present notic* , the following extract from the letter in which the court accepted fls resignation : We accept your resignation , but at the same time regret that the occurrence of events has rendered it necessary for you to tender it . " And as you are now about to retire from an office you have held with so much honor to yourself and satisfaction to the community ; we avail ourselves of this opportunity of expressing the pleasure we derive from the reflection , that the trust reposed in you , as public prosecutor , has been so faithfully discharged . And were we permitted to indulge in the gratifying reflection that we also had been successful in any effort to discharge our official duties , we yield it to you , as a just tribute , to say , that it is to your candor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From the opportunity we have had of correctly estimating your services for the citizens of this county , we take the liberty to say , on their behalf that their laws have been fully supported , and in you , their taste , their morals , and their reputation have had a zealous advocate . " But , sir , more especially are you enabled to congratulate yourselg that those whom your duty has required you to conduct to the bar of justice , have reason to be grateful to you for the opportunities you have afforded them for a fair and impartial trial . This reflection must be peculiarly gratifying inasmuch as it is not enjoyed by all . For the desire to succeed in a cause , regardless of the means , appears to be the stron , , est passion in the heart of an advocate , and the last and most difficult one , in the whole pro* , ress of refinement , to subdue . But in no one does this appear more odious tnan in a public prosecutor . This great moral conquest it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life . We have witnessed , with pleasure , the scrupulous regard you have always had to the means-that they should be no less worthy than the end . While on the part of the people your end and aim were justice , except that , you surrendered all to the unfortunate prisoner . " In November , 1824 , Mr. Butler was appointed , together with two other distinguished lawyers , to the arduous charge of the revision and codification of all the statutes of the State of New York . In this duty , of which Mr. Butler performed the largest part , he was engaged more or less nearly five years ; two of which were so exclusively devoted to it as to compel him to discontinue his appearance in court , as well as his other professional labors . With what signal ability this colossal task was discharged , has long been considered established by the almost unanimous opinion of the bar , the bcnch , and the public at large , of that State . Chiefly with reference to this work Mr. Butler allowed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the office of a Member of the Assembly from Albany , and after a sharp contest was elected . In this capacity an immense labor devolved on him , of explaining and advocating the different sections of the new code ; in which he had , ot course , to encounter single-handed all the objections to be urged from different directions against separate // portions . A similar charge was performed in the Senate by his colleague in the Revision , Judge Spencer . In this position Mr. Butler gained very high honor . The Statutes , as offered by the Revisers , were in very rare instances altered by the Legislature , except on their own motion , to adopt amendments suggested by themselves ; and it was computed that at the regular session , in January , and an extra session which was held for the exclusive purpose of discussing this subject*iMr . Butler had to make not less than five or six hundred speeches , in encounter with the ablest antagonists , embracing the widest scope of inquiry into all the principles of law and practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1829 he was appointed by the Legislature one of the Regents of the University ; which , however , he resigned in 1832 . In 1833 lie acted as a commissioner on the part of the State of New York , to settle the long ( lisputed controversy between that State and New Jersey in relation to their boundary line , which was thus after a dispute of half a century brought to a satisfactory termination . hi November of the same year , 1833 , he accepted , at General Jackson 's very urgent request , the office of Attorney General of the ljnite ( l States , though he had before declined all the previous very honorable offers that had been made to induce him to come to Washington. * This office was so directly connected with his pro * We can not omit in this place quoting the following letter addressed to Mr. Butler , on the occasion of his leaving Albany to assume the office of Attorney General at the seat of go*erni*ent , by a larae number of the most respectable and eminent citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions but of all parties . A volunteer tribute of such a kind , proceeding from such a source ,  --  and not usual on similar occasions , constitutes a higher testimonial to the elevated purity of character and life which could alone have elicited it , than any other public honor could ever afford : ALBANY , N em . &amp;er 26 , 1833 . " Sm : Your friends and fellow citizens have heard with much concern that you are about to leave a city in which you have resided many years , and in which you commenced an honorable career of professional distinction and public service , to fill a hi*hly important office in the General Government .

" IVith the solicitude for you naturally produced by the change you have made , is mingled a confidence that your public life will ever be characterized by that love of justico and truth , that moderation and prudence , which have won our esteem and regard , and which we hope will safely guide you through the uncertain future . " We part with you with the warmest wishes for your public usefulness and personal happiness . " // fession , and was pressed upon him in a manner so flattering , that he did not feel at liberty to obey his own inclination and his own interests , which would alike have prompted him to decline it . It involved very considerable pecuniary sacrifices ; but in the struggle in which General Jackson was then engaged with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to the support and assistance of all who concurred with him in his opposition to the attempts of that institution*to defeat the expressed will of the people , and to overthrow the Administration of their choice . This office he continued to hold from November , 1833 , till the first of September , 1838 . With respect to his discharge of its duties , in preference to giving our own impressions , we will quote the follow .. ing testimony of a very distinguished member of the Bar , than N ' - whom no one could be better qualified to judge , both by constant practice in the Supreme Court , and by all the personal requisites to give authority to his opinions : " Mr. Butler appeared in the Supreme Court with a high professional character acquired at the Bar of New York , among competitors as numerous , able , and learned as any of the tribunals of our country afford . " He fully sustained this character : and although the cases of the Government were generally , while he was in office , numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raging times , as a member of the Cabinet , such as to occupy a large share of his time and labor , liii efforts in every cause showed a clear conception and thorough investigation of all the points in controversy , and a familiar acquaintance with the legal principles by which they were to be resolved . " It was universally allowed that no man ever adapted his manner and style of speaking more appropriately to the high tribunal which he addressed . His course of argument , calm , clear , and strong , with no passionate appeals , no vehemence of voice or gesture , no wordy declamation , made its way directly to the understanding and showed a speaker who felt himself above all the arts of the rhetorician , and all desire of display . " He had gained much reputation for eloquence not only at the Bar , but by those efforts which a man of public spirit and of high moral and religious feeling is continually called upon to make , in the prosecution of the various benevolent objects that engage the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his addresses had been to the feelings of his hearers on such occasions , be had the good sense to see , what seems not always to be perceived by gentlemen on such occasions , that law questions are not thus to be argued before a court . " One thing was always observed in him-that he spoke and reasoned from his own convictions , with more or less confidence in the positions he maintained , according to his belief of their correctness ; and no one doubted that , in the important constitutional questions he was called on to discuss , he mentioned no doctrines but such as he conscientiously believed were consistent with the gre at charter of our rights , and necessary to preserve and perpetuate the blessings it was designed to confer . His doctrines were such as became an American Jurist , equally remote from the wild speculations of the latitudinarian , and the narrow and impracticable limitations of the close construer of words . " For another quality he will ( as he deserves ) be long remembered-his nevervarying courtesy to the Bench and Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident impulse of the kindest feelings . His opponents in discussion always found themselves and their opinions treated with respect , and their arguments met with the utmost candor and fairness . " // In addition to his discharge of the duties of his office in court , its other labors were of unexampled amount during the period that it was held by Mr. Butler ; and the number of written opinions given by him , on questions constantly submitted to him from all the other departments and offices of the Government , was probably not less than three or four times the number given by any of his predecessors . For a period of about five moThhs from October , 1836 , to March , 1837 , Mr. Butler added to his other multifarious and almost gigantic labors those of the charge of the Department of War , at that time , too , a peculiarly onerous burthen . This appointment , as Secretary of War ad interim , was almost forced upon him by General Jackson ; who , on the office becoming vacant within so short a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interfere , by a new appointment , with the freedom of choice of his successor , in filling his Cabinet according to his own liking . It was the universal testimony of all brought into official relations with Mr. Butler in this capacity , that it had never been filled more efficiently , and in all respects satisfactorily , by any of the predecessors whose undi* vided attention had been bestowed upon its duties . It may be here mentioned , that to him is due the authorship of the plan for the increase of the army , which was carried into effect at the last session of Congress . At an early day after accepting the office of Attorney General , Nh ' . Butler announced his intention of retiring from it at the close of General Jackson 's term . It had long been a favorite project with him to establish a Law School in the city of New York ; in relation to which he published a pamphlet in 1835 , and about at the same period accepted from the University , then recently organ . ized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Law Faculty , to take effect on his contemplated retirement from Washington . It was not without great reluctance that lie yielded to considerations of personal friendship , in consenting to retain his office for one year of Mr. Van Buren 's Presidential term ; refusing at the same time every inducement held out to him to ictain a seat in Mr. Van Buren 's Cabinet as Head of one of the Departments of his Administration . He finally resigned it in April of last year , though his resignation could not go into effect until the arrival of his successor at the seat of government , in the month of September . Mr. Butler is now again in that retirement of private life to which it is well known that his inclinations have always , throughout his official career , so earnestly turned . In addition to a practice in the higher courts which may perhaps , without disparagement to the powerful competitors by whom he may be surrounded , be said to place him at the head of the Bar of his native State , a large por @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mind which may be said to be almost indefatigable and inexhaustible , is devoted to his favorite object of establishing a Law School in that city , commensurate with its greatness , and with his own views of the important benefits to flow from it to the profession and to the public . It is yet in the state of infant experiment , Mr. Butler 's opening Inaugural having been delivered only in the month of April last . Its success can as yet be only a i*atter of prediction and conjecture ; though we may safely say , that its failure would falsify all the calculations that it is possible to make , from the importance of an end proposed and the urgency of public demand , together with the signal competency and adaptation of the means employed . In addition to the incessant labors in which his professional and other avocations have kept him engaged , Mr. Butler has likewise devoted no inconsiderable portion of his most earnest attention to many of the great causes of moral and religious philanthropy of his time ; the different institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his influence , time , and eloquence , both of the tongue and the pen , on numberless public occasions . Of these we need only specify that of the Temperance Reform , of which he was froni the commencement one of the most zealous advocates . It should not , however , be omitted here-as illustrative of the general calm and well-balanced character of his mind-that he never allowed himself to participate in that fanaticism into which so many of those with whom he had from the first acted , afterwards ran . And A. towards the close he found himself so far separated from the communion of his associates , who directed the organization and public action of the societies-by his refusal to go beyond the restriction of ardent spirits , and to carry out the system of social inquisition arid persecution adopted , to an extreme which could not but defeat its own objects-that his own immediate connexion with them ceased as soon as their cause , from a philanthropy , degenerated into a fanaticism . In this connexion it ought perhaps to be mentioned , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professing and zealous member of the Presbyterian church , though his sentiments have always inclined to the moderate Calvinism of the present day , harinonizing entirely with those of Wilberforce , Hannah More , and others of that school in the Anglo-Episcopal church . At the same time we ought not to omi* that , while earnest in his own views , and strict in the practice appropriate to them , no one could entertain a more expanded liberality of mind , and freedom from every kind of religious intolerance or sectarianism , than characterize the subject of our present sketch . Mr. Butler has labored with great assiduity to repair the deficiendes of his early education ,  --  with what success is sufficiently // attested by the elegance , and familiarity with the highest range of ancient and modern literature , which mark many of his public productions , lie has never remitted the classical st udies* so generally neglected by many similarly engrossed in the active pursuits of professional and public life ; and besides some proficiency in the Italian and German languages , has cultivated considerably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has held the office of Attorney General . And alt*ugh , as has been seen above , he never graduated at any college , the degree of A. M. has been twice conferred upon him ( by Union College , New York , and Williams College , Massachusetts , ) as also that of LL . D. by Rutger 's College , and by the Regents of the University , in 1834 . Entirely plain and unostentatious in all his habits , few men have been more highly favored in the possession of all the elements of domestic and social happiness , within that circle of private life unseen to the general eye which watches so vigilantly the public career of the politician . His wife , whom he married in 1818 , is a sister of that gallant and universally lamented Lieutenant Allen of the Navy , who was killed in a boat attack upon a piratical schooner , in November , 1822 , and who has been immortalized in the lines of Halleck doubtless familiar to many of our readers . As a politician , Mr. Butler has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while never false to his principles or his party , he has never failed , on any division of the Republican party , to side with the more democratic of the two portions ; as he has also , on several occasions , exhibited an independ- A ence , in obeying the convictions of his own judgment , or the generous impulses of his own heart , attesting equally the firmness of his moral courage and the sincerity of his convictions . During his single term as a member of the Assembly of New York , notwithstanding his general desire to avoid taking part in any other business than the special purpose for which alone he had sought a seat there , several opportunities occurred to testify this quality of his political character . It is sufficient for us to allude to twohis support of the Chenango canal ( the principal measure of the session , ) which his voice and influence carried against the general opposition of his friends ;  --  and his generous advocacy of the claims of the family of Dewitt Clinton on the liberality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention that this practice , in Mr. Butler 's caee , was early derived from the example and advice of Chancellor Kent ; who on being found on one occasion by Mr. Butler , engaged in his office in some reading of ancient classic literature having apparently but little connection with the appropriat* business ofthe place , mentioned that it was his daily habit and rule for at least an hour , and earnestly enjoined its adoption on his young friend ,  --  adding an interesting anecdote descriptive of the occasion on which he himself had had the similar benefit of the same example and advice from the late Edward Livingston . // on one occasion burst forth in an eloquent impromptu appeal in their behalf , which is described as having thrilled its audience with a power and effect rarely surpassed . On both these occasions his course was such , that nothing less than the profound confidence of his friends and his party in his purity of motives , the general soundness of his views , and the value of his political support , could have preserved unimpaired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his course its peculiar im*rtance . In 1817 he opposed the election of Dewitt Clinton , which opposition continued till the death of that distinguished citizen in 1828 , though never characterized by any feature of bitterness or unfairness . In 1820- ' 21 , he was an earnest advocate of the Convention for amending the Constitution of the State , and was the author of a series of very influential articles , published in the Argus , entitled " Plain Thoughts , &amp;c. , " in which the extension of the right of suffrage was urged with all the arguments appropriate to the school of elevated and sincere democracy to which he belonged . When in the Legislature , in 1828 , he took the lead in procuring the nomination of General Jackson by the Republican members of that body , advocating his claims strongly and ably in the caucus held for the purpose . In 1824 he had with similar ardor supported Mr. Crawford , in common with most of the Republican party of the State ; and his very able vindication of that eminent statesman from the aspersions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers over the signature of " Americanus , " was highly influential in his favor , not only in the State but over the Union at large . He at the same time expressed a high admiration of the character of General Jackson , for whom it has been seen he had always entertained a peculiar enthusiasm ; and awarded a very liberal measure of justice to the other competitors for the honor ; while at the same time , on a survey of the whole ground , with the lights then open to the public eye , he gave the preference over all to Mr. Crawford . The zealous and efficient support that he gave to General Jackson 's administration , before as well as after he became a member of his Cabinet , is well known . At the time of the Nullification excitement , Mr. Butler took the leading part in Albany , in a stormy and violent public meeting , in procuring the passage of resolutions of a decided antitariff character , and marked by a very conciliatory spirit towards the State of South Carolina , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support so necessary at so difficult a crisis . In his general views of the Constitution , and of the true public policy of the country , Mr. Butler has always supported to the fullest extent the democratic doctrines of the Jeffersonian school . Adopted in early youth with all the generous ardor which those great and noble principles are so well calculated to excite , the only effect cC time and the more mature judgment of manhood , has been to confirm // his conviction of their soundness , and deepen that sober enthusiasm in their behalf which is the true fruit of such conviction . He has on various occasions advocated them in public , in orations and addresses , which it is needless to specify , with marked ability and earnestness . In relation to the currency his opinions have exhibited a consistency which many of those would now be glad to boast , whose views , enlightened*by the progress of events and the profound discussions that the s*bject has elicited , are now most sound and wise . We have seen that one of his earliest public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it to that whole system of special , monopoly legislation of which that law was the corner-stone . And if , at the delicate , and we may say fearful , crisis of affairs , on the accession of the preseHt Executive , wnile the question of the repeal *f the Specie Circular was under I debate , Mr. Butler 's counsels , eloquence and influence were perhaps more effective than those of any other individual , in deciding the firm and boldly sagacious stand taken by the Democratic party , not even the most violent of the opponents whose implacable hostility such a course could not fail to excite , could refuse him at least the credit of consistency with his early and well known opinions on the subject . The bias insensibly exerted upon public men by the connexion that may exist between their public course and private interests , is but too well known , as an influence of the most subtle kind , whose effect we have of late years had to lament in so many signal and fatal instances . In this connexion we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate contrast of so many others makes peculiarly honorable to Mr. Butler ,  --  namely , that , though in no way himself engaged in speculation of any character , few men were under a stronger pressure of private interest and private feeling , to pursue a different course from that which he adopted . And if the voluntarily facing the imminent probability of ruin and beggary , with the sacrifice of all the moderate fruits of a life of such incessant labor and activity as has been above sketched-which a different course of temporizing expediency seemed alone likely to avert-constitute any evidence of sincerity of conviction , and elevated purity of motive , we are proud to claim its benefit , from our own private knowledge , as , in a signal manner , the incontestable due of the subject of the present sketch . But while Mr. Butler has been thus zealous and active as a politician , he has most amply proved that his acts have had their source in far nobler motives than any of personal ambition . Though there can be no doubt that he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest honors that the great Republican party of New York could bestow , yet he not only always scrupulously abstained from seeking office , but declined it when offered to him-even to the extent of almost seriously displeasing many // of his friends . His refusal to retain the office of Attorney General , as likewise to accept one of the Departments of Mr. Van Buren 's Administration , has been already noticed . On one occasion only , perhaps , may he now have cause to regret this determination ; or if not himself , certainly at least not a few of the latter . We refer to the month of February , 1833 , when one of the present Senators in Congress from that State , the Hon. Nathaniel P. Tallmadge , received the caucus not*ination of the Legislature of New York by a majority of only seven votes over Mr. Butler ,  --  those who voted for the latter having done so in opposition to his positive wishes and determination , as perfectly understood at the time . Of this a sufficient evidence will appear from the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4- " The large vote given to Mr. Butler on the first ballot , when his entire unwillingness to he a candidate was so perfectly understood , was a gratifying compliment , and shows how deeply seated is the confidence of the democracy of the State in its highly gifted and disinterested son . " It is due to Mr. Butler to say , what is known by every b6dy here to he the fact , t , hat if he had consented to he a candidate , there would have been not only the utmost unanimity in the selection , hut that none of the distinguished and justly esteemed citizens for whom votes were cast , would have consented to the use of their names in competition with him . " It is only within a recent period that the violence of partisanship , in the embittered political struggles which have agitated the country , has roceeded to the length of attacking the personal or public character of Mn . BUTLER . The manner in which some papers have recently assailed him with abuse , courtteracting its own objects by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many instances already familiar , which prove that no elevated purity of life can protect a public man from such assaults , however barmlessly every envenomed shaft of calumny may fall in the dust be*eath his feet . Without any farther notice of this matter-of-course species of abuse , we shall barely allude to the only definite charge we have heard or read adduced against him , which was by Mr. Bond , of Ohio , in his speech in the House of Representatives at the last session of Congress ,  --  to the effect , that he had in his official capacity as Attorney General , under the express dictation of the President , contradicted a legal opinion before given by him in his private professional capacity . We allude to it , only to pronounce it a miserable calumny-of which more can not be said than that it is equally base and baseless . And as for the very paltry sneer , so recklessly hazarded in manifest indifference to the truth  --  to intimate an habitual servile submission to General Jackson 's opinions and wishes-we allude to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No member of his Cabinet exhibited so often probably as Mr. Butler a firm independence and resolution , in the collisions of opinion occasionally occurring , because his position at the council . // board as its general legal adviser brought him more often than any other into direct contact with almost every question arising . Numerous instances of this trait might be readily cited-in some of which it seemed carried rather far -- were it necessary or proper to do so . The very case adduced by Mr. Bond as his chief ground of attack , contained in fact an evidence of its falsehood . We will but allude to one other act within our own knowledge ,  --  in which when the President had yielded * urgent applications of the strongest personal and political interest , to reinstate a cadet dismissed from West Point , Mr. Butler then Head of the War Department , refused to permit such an interference with the proper duty of his office , which he threatened to resign , if the order should be persisted in . We make this denial and refutation , only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the attack upon it ; which we here dismiss without farther notice . The preceding sketch , hastily thrown together , will after all but imperfectly convey the general idea we would impart , to those of our readers unacquainted with the man , of Benjamin Franklin Butler . Having now retired from public life , we feel at greater liberty to speak freely our high appreciation of his many claims to the respect , confidence and affection of his country and his friends , than might otherwise perhaps have been the case . We repeat , that the Democratic party is amply entitled to feel proud of him , as one of the ablest , and at the same time most disinterested and pure of its members . And such as his past career has been , proving him " an Israelite without guile , in whom there is no reproach " - as a patriot , lofty and pure-as a democrat , sincere and ardent-as a statesman , philosophical and sagacious-as a politician , liberal and disinterested-as an advocate , eloquent , calm , persuasive , and forcible-and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those admirably organized minds so rarely met with , in which different qualities of excellence are so harmoniously blended and tempered , without an undue excess of any , as to produce , on the whole , one of the best and purest of characters that we can easily conceive-piety without bigotry-philanthropy without fanaticism-enthusiasm without quixotism-boldness without rashness-firmness without obstinacy-.calmness without coldness-sagacity without cunning-all the dignity of self-respect without any of the hauteur of pride  --  the expansive wisdom of the man of study , reflection and practical experience of life , with the single-hearted simplicity of the childwe can not use a stronger expression than our conviction , that he fully merits all that high appreciation and attachment , which is most earnestly entertained by those who have had the most intimate opportunities of observing and knowing him , in every aspect of his public and private character.
