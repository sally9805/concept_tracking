BY JOHN HOWARD PAYNE . Argument . Early in life Bianca of Naples returned the love of the reckless and enthusiastic Hyppolito , but his father thought a wealthier wife might be found , and sent the youth abroad ; at sea he was wrecked , but saved by pirates and detained a captive . Being supposed dead by his family and Bianca , she is at length prevailed on to listen to a new suitor . She weds a Spaniard by the name of Alvar , equally a devotee to her and to the fine arts , and who met her when he visited Italy on a tour of taste . Hyppolito , escaping , returns , and hears that his betrothed is lost to him . In madness he pursues her to her dwelling in Barcelona , and , being skilled in the pencil , obtains access to her husband by spreading his fame abroad as an Italian painter of eminence , hurrying through the city . Alvar has seen his sketches , and earnestly desires from him a portrait of Bianca . On a carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyppolito consents , as a special favor to Don Alvar , to spare an hour for a sitting . His object may be guessed . It is a delirious desire to disclose himself , and carry her away with him in the confusion of the masquerade . The scene here given describes the introduction of the imagined painter . Main text SCENE . An apartment in Don Alvar 's palace at Barcelona . Busts  --  statues  --  an easel  --  swing-glass  --  painting apparatus . Don Alvar enters , leading Bianca , both sumptuously habited in masquerade dresses , Bianca as a Sultana . Hyppolito follows as a painter , completely disguised . He takes his colors and pencils from an attendant . While he arranges them and reconnoitres the room , Alvar and Bianca converse apart at the front . Bianca . Bianca ( To Alvar aside . ) Who is this painter ? Were't not well , my lord , That he should come to-morrow , not to-night ? His look is strange .

He touches now The finest lines of his most lovely work . ( Looking over the sketch . ) Bravo , Signor ! A Titian were outdone With that delicious coloring . That glow Is worthy the Venetian . Hyp . Hyp . I was his pupil  --  An idle one  --  but worshipped at his feet For some wild years , enamor 'd of the fame , The glory that he threw around his land ! But , when he died , I hated Venice  --  fled  --  And wander 'd , on a painter 's pilgrimage , To every shrine of loveliness . Bian . Bian .

Alvar It grows in light and beauty , as the sky Before the rosy chariot the morn !  --   --  Signor , your task is finish 'd for to-night , And richly finish 'd . My lady well reminds me ' twill be late Before we reach our kinsman's.  --  ( To Bianca . ) Come , my love ! Bian . Bian .

Mazeppa , an equestrian melodrama , which was probably never performed , was written in 1825 , when its source , Lopold and Cuvelier 's Mazeppa ; ou , Le Cheval Tartare , was produced at the Franconis ' Cirque Olympique , and published in Paris . Payne 's manuscript is dated November 12 of that year , but the play was practically complete by October 2 ; for at that time Irving , returning it with revisions , advised Payne to send it to Price . Failing to interest Price , Payne offered it , apparently without success , to Fawcett , January 7 , 1826 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legend became extremely popular ; but the relationships among the important versions are not always clear . Byron 's narrative , generally thought to have been inspired by Voltaire 's sketchy account in Charles XII , itself inspired , according to the contemporary review in The Drama , the anonymous Mazeppa ; or , The Wild Horse of the Ukraine , which was acted early in November 1823 , at the Royal Coburg , but which has not been preserved in either manuscript or printed form . Lopold and Cuvelier acknowledge their indebtedness to Byron ; but they introduce important changes , for their heroine at the opening is unmarried , and their hero , a Tartar Prince , eventually marries her . Payne , except for slight alterations , translates the French play closely . Milner 's version , called , like Payne 's , Mazeppa ; or , The Wild Horse of Tartary , was performed April 4 , 1831 , at the Royal Adelphi , and later was revived in both England and America , and published several times ; although Milner states that Byron is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French play , altering the names of some of the minor characters . ( A. H. Quinn in A History of the American Drama from the Beginning to the Civil War , New York , 1923 , p. 442 , suggests that Payne may have been the author of the play with this title acted at the Bowery , July 22 , 1833 ; but the names of the characters in the bill are those of Milner 's version . ) Interest in the legend died slowly , for later versions appeared sporadically . It seems impossible to account for Payne 's failure to find a producer , for the play has all the qualities necessary to satisfy the demand for elaborate romantic spectacle .

Scene 1 : A terrace , or open gallery , giving a view to the back of the stage , which is crossed at the boundary of the terrace by a balustrade high enough to lean upon , beyond which appears a circular enclosure forming an area , a riding ring , for jousts and tournaments , with seats ranged amphitheatrically around its remote edge . At the rising of the curtain , Rudzoloff , Drolinsko , with several servants of the castle , are discovered upon the terrace , looking on at what passes in the riding ring , where several esquires and huntsmen are seen preparing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd freak of the castellan !

Dro . Drolinsko With all due deference , his highness is a fool for his pains . What hope is there of the quadruped 's ever bearing bit or bridle , when even the want of food wo n't make him docile ? They are obliged to throw it at him as they would to a tiger . He must be the most incorrigible of independents , who will not even become submissive at the call of his stomach . Rud .

Let the castellan waste no more time and labor , but take my advice and send this devil upon all fours back to his native Tartary . He 's the most patriotic of horses , for whenever he fancies he sees a chance of escaping , he always makes toward his native country . Rud . Rudzoloff When he once gets accustomed to our more civilized habits , he will forget Tartary and love Poland . Dro . Drolinsko What ! Would you have a brute more rational than a man ? There never yet was a native of that country , whether wearing one pair of legs or two , that came to any good by being in a better . The young Tartar , for example , who was picked up , according to your account , half dead near the fountain of St. Casimir in the valley of the forest more than eighteen years since , after our great battle with the Tartars  --  Rud .

Do you think she would have herself given him the name of Casimir , in remembrance of the place where he was found , and had him brought up amongst her pages , had she not seen in him indications of those great qualities which have since rendered him the envy of all the men and the idol of all the women ? Dro . Drolinsko Not all the men ! For my part , I would , of the two , prefer his brother barbarian , the wild horse . Casimir indeed ! A fellow who never talks but with his sword and orders one about as if a foundling had a right to set himself over people of known pedigree like you and I. Let the Countess beware . She may find , too late perhaps , that she has indeed caught a Tartar ! Enter Casimir , unperceived , who , overhearing Drolinsko , slaps him on the shoulder Cas . Castell an Ha !

We must see that all is ready for their reception . Goes up the stage . Enter the Castellan , Olinska , Polish lords and ladies , esquires , pages , hunters , and vassals . The trumpets continue to sound . The seats in the circus become filled with vassals , who run from all sides to see the exercises . The competitors are set in array . Casimir is amongst them . The Castellan advances with Olinska and lords and ladies . The esquires , who are about to contend , salute them , as they pass , in the military style . The Castellan 's company are placed on elevated seats to the right and left Cast . Castellan Still standing near the balustrade My friends , display before us your address and courage . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to defend your prince and country . My daughter will crown the conqueror . Movements of Olinska and Casimir Let the signal be given for them to begin . The Castellan sits down by Olinska . Rudzoloff makes a sign . The trumpets sound . The games begin . Different exercises of the mange , fencing , and horsemanship . Amongst the esquires and pages who engage in them Casimir is distinguishable as the most skilful , whether on horse or foot ; and Drolinsko , on the contrary , is remarkable for his awkwardness . Repulsed , he quits the riding ring , especially as he perceives the wild Tartarean horse , which is led curvetting into the middle of the circus . Drolinsko makes his escape and comes to place himself near the balustrade as a mere spectator . Several esquires are dismounted in striving to master the Tartarean horse . As they endeavor to remount , the horse escapes furiously . All the esquires , frightened and discouraged , leave him . Casimir alone , who appears unintimidated , runs after him . Sight of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with restless curiosity . Olinska , especially , is trembling , but quickly recovers on beholding Casimir quietly reappear on the Tartarean courser , whom he has mastered , and who appears docile under his hands . Casimir is proclaimed first victor in the games and comes with those who distinguished themselves to bow before balcony , where the Castellan and his daughter are placed . The latter with difficulty hides her lively emotion which is shared by Casimir Cast . Castell an Casimir , it is with pleasure I behold you victor ! I have already remarked your courage and address and have distinguished you from the crowd of my servants . Merit always thus my favor , and new rewards will be the result . Cas . Castellan Aside Ah ! There 's but one reward in which my heart can set a value ! Casimir , fearful of being remarked , hastens to kneel at the feet of Olinska who , not daring to look at him lest she betray herself , presents him a scarf and a sword as the recompense of his victory , having previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prizes the Castellan comes forward with his daughter . The noblemen and ladies , Casimir and his companions , remain at the bottom ranged in order Cast . Castellan Let this day be given up to sports and pleasures . I depart presently to visit the Count Palatine Premislas . To Olinska My daughter , I shall soon return , I trust , with tidings which may make you happy . Inquietude of Olinska . Jealous movement of Casimir . The Castellan kisses his daughter 's forehead and , mounting a horse which Rudzoloff leads him from the back of the stage , departs accompanied by the lords . Olinska retires slowly on the opposite side , appearing to meditate some project ; and Casimir , scarcely able to contain himself , is compelled to follow his companions Scene 2 : A magnificent apartment of the castle , with an immense curtain spreading across the back . Enter Olinska , slowly , sad and musing . Olin . Olinska Alone Will she ne'er come ? Be still , poor heart ! Oh , like the imprisoned bird , beat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Olinska perceiving , runs to her Dear nurse ! My impatience for your coming  --  Ag .

You should be in bed , my dear  --  Olin . Olinska Nay , nurse , to the point  --  Ag . Agatha Aye , aye  --  well , well  --  to the point , then . What is this unforeseen misfortune ? And in what manner can I be serviceable to you ? Speak , speak , my dear Olinska . Tell your old Agatha . Olin . Olinska Oh , I am deeply to be pitied . Ag . Agatha Pitied ? You ! When there 's nothing talked of at the castle but your approaching nuptials with a young nobleman so rich and  --  Olin . Olinska Those nuptials never can take place  --  Ag . Agatha Never !

You are silent ; you cast down your eyes  --  Olin . Olinska Do not ask me . Ag . Agatha Oh , I shudder at the doubt which comes across my mind . Have I divined the secret of the impediment ? Olin . Olinska What deem you the impediment ? Ag . Agatha Love ! Olin . Olinska Nurse  --  Ag . Agatha And for some object which is not worthy  --  Olin . Olinska With vivacity Casimir not worthy ! Ag . Agatha Casimir ! It is then true ? This orphan without name , without country ! And you , the heiress of a noble castellan of Poland  --  Olin .

The richness of the vestments wherein he was wrapped when found , the chain of gold which held a star glittering with diamonds , those letters graven in Arabic on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mazeppa , all indicate a birth above the common , which his valor and noble sentiments confirm . Ag . Agatha We always wish to believe what we desire ; but all those proofs will not suffice for the Castellan , who has ever regarded Casimir as one of his servants . Olin . Olinska Have you forgotten , nurse , that in my infancy he saved my life ? Ag . Agatha Your father rewarded him for that act ; and in return for his benefits , Casimir has dared to raise his thoughts to the daughter of his master . Olin . Olinska Ah ! Do not accuse him ! Carried away , both , by feelings irresistible , our mutual vows  --  Ag . Agatha Such vows are void . Olin . Olinska They are recorded in the skies . Ag . Agatha Without the consent of your father , what right had you to utter them ? Olin . Olinska One not to be disputed . Ag . Agatha How ? Olin . Olinska Public report had spread abroad the dreadful story of my father 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed an orphan , without protection . I was surrounded by ambitious neighbors , ready to snatch from me my inheritance . ' T was then I found in him you deem unworthy of me , a friend to share my sorrows , a warrior to defend me at the hazard of his life . After the generous devotedness of Casimir , who could have considered it a crime in me to think of uniting my destiny with his ? Such was my intention . My father 's return , snatched from the hands of the infidels by the Palatine Premislas , prevented its fulfillment . Yesterday , yielding to the prayers of Casimir , I went to make an avowal of our love to my father ; but judge of my astonishment , my agony , when he anticipated me by announcing that he had solemnly engaged my hand to the Count Palatine , his liberator . Now that you know my cruel situation , judge me , condemn me if you can , but at least pity the unhappy Olinska ! Ag . Agatha I condemn you ! Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sentiments towards you but the tenderest , nor entertain any wish except to do you service . But how can you brave the will of the Castellan ? How will you ever dare to refuse the coronet of a countess which , according to the form of proposing marriage among persons of his rank , he is about to offer ? How set a father 's authority openly at defiance ? Olin . Olinska Oh , that is beyond my courage ! I dare not decline the offered coronet  --  Ag . Agatha And its acceptance is a marriage promise ! Olin . Olinska Its rejection would prevent my purpose of escaping from the castle this very night to the holy monastery of which the Countess Eliska , my aunt , is sovereign abbess . Ag . Agatha Would you renounce the world ? Olin . Olinska Yes , if my father , insensible to my tears , should command me to renounce my love  --  Ag . Agatha A project so bold  --  Olin . Olinska Is the only means of protection from a hateful marriage ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must conduct me to my mother 's sister  --  Ag . Agatha I ! And does Casimir know of this ? Olin . Olinska As yet he does not even know of the intended marriage which makes this necessary . I fear the temerity of his character , the excess of his love . ' T is only from my sacred asylum that I purpose to apprise him  --  A noise is heard of hurried footsteps Ha ! Someone approaches ! ' T is he ! ' T is Casimir ! Great Heaven , how agitated ! Casimir advances suddenly from the back entrance . He stops , with a vexed air , on seeing that Olinska is not alone . With difficulty he constrains himself Cas . Castellan Noble lady  --  Olin . Olinska Speak without reserve , Casimir . My second mother here knows all . Cas . Castellan Before her , then , pronounce my fate . Olin . Olinska Your fate ! Cas . Castellan Yes , on you , and on this moment , depend the destinies of my life . Olin . Olinska What mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains for us but one resource : We must fly . The deserts of Tartary where I first drew breath , and from which we are separated only by a river and a few days ' journey , offer us an assured retreat . Ah , long since , breaking the fetters of a shameful subjection , I would have returned into the midst of my brethren . I would have sought to discover what blood flows in my veins , whence the impetuous stream whose high pulsations speak that it must take its source from no unworthy fountain . To thee I sacrificed the desire for independence ; to remain near thee I submitted to the disgrace of servitude . I was beloved , and a smile of Olinska made me forget I was a slave . But now , when the bonds which unite us are to be torn asunder , have I not the right to require of Olinska who has chosen me for her husband that she should seek with me in my own country that happiness which is denied to us in hers ? Olin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seek an asylum amongst barbarians , the enemies , the devastators of Poland ? Never ! Never ! Cas . Castellan Thou refusest , then , to follow me ? Olin .

In the midst of the pages and esquires who compose it is the envoy of the Palatine . He offers , with great ceremony , rich presents to Olinska . He takes out of a superb casket , borne by two pages , a countess 's coronet sparkling with diamonds , and presents it on his knees to the daughter of the Castellan , who directs on her a severe and scrutinizing look . Casimir , with his eyes fixed on his beloved , is in hopes that she is about to refuse the brilliant gift offered to her , in order to take away all hope from his rival .

During this time Olinska has sought the eyes of Casimir to assure him by a glance ; but he can not perceive it , being plunged in somber reflections . He believes her false and meditates his vengeance apart . The Castellan orders his daughter to give the envoy of her future lord the ring which should be exchanged for the diadem . This is a new test for Olinska . Impelled by the looks of her father , who , seeing her hesitate , has resumed his severe air , she takes the ring from her finger , and , heaving a profound sigh , she advances towards the envoy to present it to him . As soon as she has extended her hand to give it , the envoy , instead of receiving it , makes a sign , the numerous group that surrounds him opens , and Premislas himself appears , receives the ring , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise What do I see ? Cast . Castellan The Count Premislas ! Cas . Castellan Aside Down , rebel nature , down ! Prem . Premislas Rising and holding Olinska 's ring Pardon me , beautiful Olinska , for not awaiting the sentence which was to decide my fate . Had my homage been refused , I should have quitted the castle without intruding upon your view ; but , on seeing you accept the diadem , I hastened to receive myself this precious pledge of happiness . Cast . Castellan This eagerness , my dear Count , is a proof of love which can not but be flattering to my daughter . Prem . Premislas To deserve her smiles shall be the study of my life . He takes the hand of Olinska and kisses it . Casimir makes a movement in his jealous fury to spring upon his happy rival . A thought stops him . He has conceived a surer way of revenging himself Cas . Castella n Aside This very night ! Vengeance ! Death ! He rushes out , without being perceived by anyone but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who still retains the hand of Olinska , perceives her agitation . The day begins to close Prem . Premislas Fair Olinska , why this agitation ? Your hand trembles in mine  --  Olin . Olinska Pardon me , my lord , but your sudden arrival , these unlooked-for honors  --  I need a moment 's calm . To the Castellan Permit me , father  --  Going Cast . Castellan How , daughter ! So soon departing ? Olin . Olinska Suffer me , my father  --  I am overcome  --  a moment 's repose will  --  oh , suffer me to withdraw hence with my nurse  --  Cast . Castellan Daughter , the Count Premislas  --  Prem . Premislas The least desires of Olinska are commands for me ; but I hope tomorrow to be more happy . Olin . Olinska Yes , my lord , tomorrow you shall know that Olinska is not unworthy of your esteem . Cast . Castellan Deign to follow me , Count . Everything is prepared to receive you with the honors due to him , who , becoming my son , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest . A general sortie . All the suite retire , following the Castellan and Premislas . The latter offers his hand to Olinska , who can not decline it . The curtain is let fall , and the scene changes Scene 3 : A Gothic apartment . In the flat , three glazed doors , which open on a picturesque country seen through an iron rail fence . At the horizon a craggy mountain terminating at the left extremity with a foaming torrent . On changing the scene , it is complete night . Servants bring in lights which are placed on a table . To the right , the darkness only appears from the exterior through the glazed doors . Enter Rudzoloff and several esquires . Rud . Rudzoloff Come , gentlemen officers of the Count Palatine . Upon me , in my capacity of major-domo , devolves the honor of doing the honors of the house . Pointing to a door at the left Here is the apartment of your master . You see , my friends , that nothing has been omitted for his service . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? It comes from the armory . The stifled cries of Drolinsko are heard , who , in a voice changed by fear , seems to call for help That simpleton Drolinsko 's voice ! He 's always running his head into some silly scrape ! Has he quarrelled with the armory and got a box on the ear from some old gauntlet ? They all go up the stage . Drolinsko staggers on , half dead with fear , and holding in his hand a flambeau , violently agitated from his trembling Dro . Drolin sko Bless my soul ! Oh , dear ! Oh , dear ! Rud . Rudzoloff What is the matter ? Dro . Drolinsko What is the matter ? I have just seen  --  Rud . Rudzoloff Whom ? Dro . Drolinsko The devil , godfather , as plainly as I see you . All . All Laughing The devil ! Rud . Rudzoloff Are you mad ? Dro . Drolinsko It was enough to make me so . Listen . I am going to relate what will make you shake in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wager . Come , go on  --  go on . All assemble around Drolinsko with curiosity Dro . Drolin sko I was coming to rejoin you as you directed  --  Rud . Rudzoloff Impatiently Be brief  --  Dro . Drolinsko In order to arrive sooner , I took my way through the armory , where all the ancestors of our Castellan stand in their steel , visors down , lances in rest , as if still living they were going to make a charge upon the Turks  --  Rud . Rudzoloff And then  --  Dro . Drolinsko I walked along , quietly , thinking  --  what was I thinking of ? I think I was n't thinking of anything . On a sudden , I heard a noise . I was close to the great-grandfather of my lord who has been dead more than a hundred years  --  you know who I mean , godfather  --  he with so terrible a frown , who always holds his arm uplifted with a drawn saber , he with the awful black helmet  --  Rud . Rudzoloff Will you never be done ? Dro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm falls on my shoulder ; I raised my eyes , with a little fright , I own ; and I saw , I saw the great-grandfather of my lord without his head  --  All burst into shouts of laughter Yes , laugh  --  laugh . I should have liked to see you there , gentlemen . I started  --  I turned round , when , lo ! I perceived , as plainly as I see you , I did indeed ! That very head  --  with its helmet shaded with black plumes , gliding softly away upon another body , covered with a great ghostlike mantle . It moved without a sound , majestically , thus and thus  --  to the bottom of the armory , through all the coats of mail , whose clinkings , ah ! I shiver still at the very recollection ! Whilst he is speaking , Casimir is seen to pass at the back of the stage , covered with a mantle , a helmet with black plumes on his head . He raises his visor for a moment Cas . Castellan Aside Could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady , but I could no longer hold it out , and I fled , thinking all the specters of my lord 's ancestors were at my heels . Rud . Rudzoloff I do n't know which is the most ridiculous , the fool who tells such tales , or we who listen to them . Dro . Drolinsko It is impossible , godfather , not to  --  Rud . Rudzoloff Enough , enough of this . Give Casimir notice that his detachment is to depart before the drawbridge is raised for the night . He will quarter his men in the village , in order to set out at an early hour without disturbing the castle . Such is the will of his lordship . Dro . Drolinsko So much the better . His room was always more agreeable to me than his company . Casimir goes out as Premislas and pages enter . The Count advances , preceded by two pages with lighted flambeaux . All the servants of the Palatine range themselves respectfully about their master . Rudzoloff points out to him his apartment where everything is prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his satisfaction to Rudzoloff , who bows low and goes out , making a sign to Drolinsko to follow him . Premislas , while some of the servants enter his apartment , sits down near the table . His esquires take off his sword and spurs . His pages remove his mantle , which is placed on the back of the chair , and his cap , which they set on the table near his sword Prem . Premislas You may retire . I dispense with all service from you for this evening . All go out . Premislas , alone I shall be presently united to Olinska . Called , too , by my sovereign , to one of the first offices at court , love and fortune unite to crown my wishes ! He reflects . His countenance assumes a more serious character Still , the extraordinary emotion of Olinska haunts me  --  her disturbed looks  --  her eyes moistened with tears ! A pause What would be her hand without her heart ? Perhaps some knight more blessed than I  --  He rises but , no ! Olinska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly her husband 's . This idea restores calm and satisfaction , which are pictured in his countenance . He takes a light and prepares to enter into the chamber . In going up the stage , he faces Casimir , who has come on during the soliloquy . Casimir is entirely enveloped in his mantle , and his head covered by a helmet with black plumes , the visor drawn . At sight of him Premislas makes a movement of surprise , approaches the table upon which his sword is placed , and seizes it to oppose the mischief which he apprehends from his mysterious visitor Who art thou ? Cas . Castellan Thine enemy ! Prem . Premislas How entered you this castle ? Cas . Castellan What matters that to thee ? Prem . Premislas What is thy will ? Cas . Castellan Thy death ! Prem . Premislas Wouldst thou be my murderer ? Cas . Castellan No . I would fight thee fairly . Prem . Premislas Proudly Thy name ? Cas . Castellan Thou shalt know that when thou art conquered . Prem . Premislas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended man . Prem . Premislas What ! Can you be  --  Cas . Castellan Thy rival ! Prem . Premislas Doubtfully Beloved ? Cas . Castellan Till yesterday I believed so . Prem . Premislas With pride But today thou findest that the beautiful Olinska accords to me the preference ? Cas . Castellan Not to thee , but to thy honors and thy titles . Prem . Premislas Ha ! Darest thou insult me  --  Cas . Castellan I have told thee but the truth . My sword shall do the rest . Prem . Premislas Rash intruder ! Thinkest thou a Palatine will measure swords with an unknown , doubtless unworthy of that honor ? Cas . Castellan My blows will teach thee whether I be worthy . Prem . Premislas Hence ! Or my servants shall chastise thy boldness . Seizes a hand bell from the table Cas . Castellan One word , one gesture , and I stretch thee at my feet  --  dead ! Presenting a pistol Prem . Premislas Coward ! If our arms were equal  --  Cas . Castellan Throwing aside his pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom is unarmed ! I wear this helmet for concealment , not protection . Aim at my heart . It has now no defense but courage and this good sword ! Pushed to the point , Premislas is forced to place himself upon his guard . A lively and bloody combat commences between them . Victory is not long uncertain . Premislas , pierced in the left shoulder , falls at the feet of Casimir Prem . Premisl as I yield ! Cas . Castellan Resuming his mantle I am revenged ! A great tumult without . The three doors at the bottom are flung open with a crash , and a crowd of servants are seen with flambeaux . Drolinsko is in advance and leads them Dro . Drolinsko I tell you the unknown who took the armor is in that gallery . Perceiving Casimir Look ! Lo ! Behold him ! There ! There ! There he is ! The servants rush into the hall , but stop upon seeing the Count extended and making vain efforts to raise himself . Two servants run towards him , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those who press too closely on him , by presenting his pistols at them and profiting by the general tumult , escapes by leaping through a window . Premislas is raised and placed in an armchair . He recovers his senses a little . He recognizes his servants . Enter the Castellan , Rudzoloff , and suite Cast . Castellan Hurrying in Great Heaven ! The Palatine assassinated ! Prem . PremislasFaintly A rival ! Vengeance  --  Cast . Castellan You shall obtain it , and whoever the murderer may prove , it shall be terrible ! Two discharges of pistols are heard . Enter Drolinsko , followed by vassals Dro . Drolinsk o Running in first We 've got him ! He is taken ! He is taken ! Casimir is brought in , still wrapped in his mantle and his visor down . He appears calm in the midst of the trouble that reigns around him . About the same time Olinska and Agatha , followed by her women , enter at the opposite side Prem . Premislas Rising to point out Casimir Yes ! That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wretch ! Before anyone has time to execute this order , Casimir flings his mantle and helmet on the ground All . All Casimir ! Cast . Castellan My suspicions were , then , true ! Servants of Prem . Servants of Prem Ready to spring on him , exclaim Let him die ! Cast . Castellan In the height of fury Hold ! Reserve him for the punishment inflicted upon rebel slaves ! Bring out the fiery , untamed horse ! Tie this vile Tartar on his back , and turn him loose to scour their native deserts ! There let the murderer be borne through sands and rocks and wilds , till hunger , thirst , and scorching suns and frequent bruise and restless motion kill him piecemeal ! This cruel sentence is executed . Casimir , firm and tranquil , seems to brave it . He is dragged off the stage by the servants of Premislas and the Castellan 's soldiers . Olinska , who remained a moment motionless with horror , seeing her lover depart , wishes to fly towards him . She is prevented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father Olin . Olinska Oh , my father ! Pardon for him who saved your daughter 's life ! Cast . Castellan Unworthy girl ! Darest thou plead for him who has dishonored thy hospitality ? All powers on earth combined were powerless o'er my vengeance ! He repels her with harshness and goes to Premislas , who seems to regain a little strength . Olinska , wild with grief , escapes from the arms of Agatha , traverses the stage , and endeavors to get away . On every side the passage is closed against her . She stops at the bottom of the stage and recoils with horror from the spectacle that presents itself to her view . The entire end of the stage has become suddenly illuminated by a great number of flambeaux , borne by the servants . Beyond the iron railing is seen Casimir , fastened to the wild horse , who , violently excited , darts across the stage with the rapidity of lightning . Casimir bids a last adieu to his beloved by calling on her name with heart-rending cries and disappears for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to Casimir . She is restrained , and at that moment the courser reappears on the mountain , dashes down the torrent , and disappears in the midst of the waves of the abyss . Olinska gives a piercing shriek and falls into a swoon ACT II . Scene 1 : In front , the interior of a grotto or cavern , open at the back , through which appears a wild and rugged prospect of the desert plains , or steppes of Tartary , crossed by an extensive lake . In the grotto , righthand , is the entrance of another cavern which seems to descend deep into the mountain . This entrance is closed with a barrier of unhewn wood . At the side , a natural bank covered with moss and detached . Several groups of horses are discovered grazing at large in the steppes beyond the lake . Ozeb and Zelos appear at the back , come round the borders of the lake , and enter mysteriously into the grotto . Ozeb . Ozeb This , then , is the mysterious dwelling of the Tartar prophetess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which my inspired mistress makes her habitation is a deep cave , cut in this side of the rock . Ozeb . Ozeb Is she now in that cave ? Zel . Zelos No . Korella passes her nights upon the summit of the rocks , whence the view stretches o'er the immense deserts of Tartary , even to the misty mountains , at whose feet rolls the Dnieper , which parts us from Poland . Ozeb . Ozeb What does she there ? Zel . Zelos ' T is said that , warned by a celestial revelation , she awaits the return of him who is to reign over us , of Mazeppa , grandson of the ruling Khan , last of his line and rightful heir to the throne of Tartary . Ozeb . Ozeb Alas ! Mazeppa perished when an infant , in the invasion of the Polish frontier . Zel . Zelos The prophetess believes that he escaped from death but dwells in slavery . Ozeb . Ozeb Knows she that the King is come and that he encamped , this very night , not far hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Her vision , it is said , embraces the past , the present , and the future . Sorrowful and mysterious sounds are heard Hark ! ' T is she ! Look , stranger ! How rapt in thought and gloomy is her mien ! Ozeb . Ozeb Looki ng Her eyes are fixed on Heaven . Deep meditations seem to absorb her mind . Zel . Zelos Such is ever her air in moments of inspiration . If you would now consult her  --  Ozeb . Ozeb Abso rbed No , no  --  not now . Tomorrow we may meet , perhaps this very day  --  but  --  Apart Now to apprise the Khan of all I have just learned . He departs at the back , on one side , as Korella advances from the other without perceiving him Kor . Korella Omens of woe !

Enter Koskar and shepherds and shepherdesses Kos . Koskar Here we are at last , Father Zelos . Bless my weary legs ! The heat makes it seem as if one were wading through flames ! This journeying in the desert is a marvellous quickener of the appetite for liquids , hey , father ? Zel . Zelos Korella has anticipated your wants . Look ! Here 's milk and cakes of maize . All dart upon the vases and cakes Kos . Koskar Truest of prophetesses ! Bless her inspirations ! The shepherds are grouped with the females on divers sides . They eat and drink gaily Zel . Zelos Clapping Koskar on the shoulder as he is drinking Hollo , friend ! Your thirst seems to be running a race with your hunger . Kos .

Children 's tales ! You ca n't believe what they say of the Volpas ? I thought you had more sense . Kos . Koskar Believe ? I do n't believe , but I know it . It never appears but as a forerunner of wonderful events . The very mention of the terrible Volpas turns all the milk I 've been drinking ! The ravager ! The destroyer ! Come , come  --  no more of the Volpas ! The pastoral groups form . Koskar mounts a hillock and plays upon his Pandean pipe . The old shepherd below sings , accompanying himself upon an instrument formed of several sticks , upon which he strikes with a rod of iron . Upon each return of the burthen , all the men and women figure a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagant movements of their heads and arms , terminating every time in grotesque and varied groups Across the wilds of Tartary there whirls a demon form ; His voice is not of this world and mingles with the storm ! Through blasts of forked lightning his snorting courser dashes , And death and terror as his guides , smile grimly mid the flashes ! Let the lovely shepherd maid Most of all his sight evade ! Haste ! Haste ! To your tents hasten back ! A pursuer is on your track ! Fly ! Fly ! ' T is the Volpas that 's coming ! The Volpas is nigh ! The last couplets are repeated in a dancing chorus as above mentioned , with signs of terror His black and fiery courser 's mane stands bristled by the blast , And from his feet the dust in air is up in whirlwinds Cast . His wide and smoky nostrils dart before him fires of wrath , And nothing that 's of mortal born can live upon his path ! Let the lovely shepherd maid Most of all his sight evade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A pursuer is on your track ! Fly ! Fly ! ' T is the Volpas that 's coming ! The Volpas is nigh ! Chorus and dance Oh , when that horse and rider come , the astonished earth and ocean Shake and shrink back with terror at the mystical commotion ! Nature , as if she writhed her last , heaves with the horrid pang , And trumpets shriek i ' th ' troubled air their war-denouncing clang ! Trumpets suddenly interrupt the singer . Koskar stands silent and shuddering . All the shepherds and shepherdesses press close to each other . Old Zelos goes up the stage Zel . Zelos These warlike sounds announce the coming of brave Thamar , first chief of Abder Khan . Kos . Koskar Affe cting courage Did n't I tell you so ? Did n't I say there was nothing to be afraid of ? As it 's Thamar , you know , it ca n't be the Volpas . Low Though , between ourselves one 's almost as bad as the other . Zel . Zelos Low Silence ! Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koskar recoils and slinks back to his companions . Thamar , with a suite of Tartar warriors , appears , and all bow submissively Tham . Th amar Shepherds of the desert , form in procession and depart for the great encampment . Abder Khan , our prince , has directed the tributary Tartars o'er whom he reigns to assemble before the royal tent . Koskar sounds a trumpet . The sounds are echoed from afar , and being heard by the docile steeds grazing in the distance , several of them come forward with no direction but the signal . Tartars spring upon their naked backs and disappear , crossing each other at various sides . The movement is repeated on the greensward beyond the lake . Groups of riders appear , recede , and are presently lost to view in the forest . All the shepherds are now gone off . Thamar addresses Zelos Acquaint Korella that I would consult her in private . Zel . Zelos You consult the prophetess ? You , who till now have scorned her words as idle  --  Tham . Thamar I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zel . Zelos You shall be obeyed . Aside What would he with Korella ? I distrust this Thamar ! Thamar makes a gesture of impatience which interrupts the old man , who , urged by the warriors , enters the cave Tham . ThamarTo his train I would win this woman to our purposes . Not that my reason stoops to a belief in superhuman powers , but she has a resistless influence over the superstitious multitude . All Tartary consider her as Heaven descended . Gold will tempt her to aid me to attain the sacred scimitar , emblem of sovereign rule , which , once within my grasp , my strength and courage will find means to keep there . All make a movement expressive of concurrence and devotedness . Zelos appears at the entrance of the cave . Terrified at the menacing air of the warriors , he pauses . Korella follows him . He points her out to Thamar , who gives a sign for the warriors to retire . Zelos disappears with them . Thamar , alone with Korella , addresses her Korella , Thamar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him What would he of the prophetess of the desert ? Tham . Thamar Her judgment . Kor .

Kor ella After a long pause That voice doth shake me to the inmost soul . The protecting genius of Tartary inspires me ! Tham . Thamar With marked earnestness Engrave , then , my words upon thy mind , that it may return an oracle suited to our tribes . Kor . Korella Speak . I hear thee . Tham . Thamar Thou knowest the Tartars need a warrior at their head . Thou knowest , too , that in battle I am ever foremost . Kor . Korella And would be on the throne , is it not so ? Tham . Thamar Dost deem me undeserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He who reads hearts , he only , can know that . Tham . Thamar ' T is he has planted in my heart the thirst for power . Hear me , Korella . The aged Abder Khan , cherishing the idle hope of recovering his lost grandson , Mazeppa , has , till now , refused to designate a successor . At length , urged by the pressure of years and the prayers of his subjects , he has consented and will name one tomorrow . Kor . Korella I know he does intend it . Tham . Thamar But , ere he choose , he would consult , disguised , with thee ; thee , whom his subjects deem the oracle of fate . Kor . Korella I await his coming . Tham . Thamar ' T is well . Summon up thy arts and spells then .

This strange proposal , the visions of this night , a force resistless impels my tongue . Thamar , thou shalt be satisfied ! Tham . Thamar Thou makst me then indeed a worshiper ! A bustle heard from without Abder Khan advances with the ancients of our tribes , disguised in lowly garb , and seeks to try thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girdle , the only sign which marks him from the rest . Kor . Korella He has thrown off that girdle . The gods will guide me . Thamar , surprised , goes up the stage to rejoin the warriors who reappear on one side , while the procession of old men advances on the other . Korella remains , alone , in front , plunged in deep thought . Abder Khan , Ozeb , with the royal suite of Tartars and old men , are clad uniformly , with no distinguishing mark . They advance slowly and salute Korella with respect . At the back , on the opposite side , are standing Thamar and his warriors Ozeb . Ozeb Korella , the wretched shepherds come to thee for succor . A mortal plague now desolates the plain . Thy prayers alone can soothe the wrath of Heaven . Kor . Korella My aid is ne'er withheld from those who seek it with sincerity .

All the old men approach and gaze on her , astonished . Thamar , in the distance , scrutinizes her with a sort of uneasiness The woes of which you speak are fabled . Higher interests fill your minds , and one among you would propound a question big with the fate of Tartary . Ozeb . Ozeb One among us ? Receives an affirmative sign from Abder Khan Well , then , I 'll not dissemble longer . In me behold the sovereign of this land . Korella makes a gesture Aye , in me know Abder Khan ! What have I to hope for ? What to fear ? Kor . Korella In vain you seek to lead me into error . Gently putting him aside Ozeb , away ! ' T is for thy master to disclose his will . Going directly to him Hail , Abder Khan ! Abd . Abder Khan Korella ! Kor . Korella Prince ! Thinkest thou to hide thee from the eyes of him , my great inspirer ? Kneeling Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

This very night thou sawest in vision the heir of the great throne of Tartary , he who was left upon the battle plain in Poland . Abd . Abder Khan With emotion ' T is true . I saw the young , the unfortunate Mazeppa . I stretched my arms to clasp him . Alas ! ' T was but a dream ! Thamar , who has approached the suite of the Prince , makes signs to Korella , who goes on without heeding him Kor . Korella And as thy arms were stretched to strain him to thy bosom , a tiger darted on the long lost Prince . Thamar expresses fury Abd . Abder Khan Enough . I feel thy inspiration .

Who is the future monarch Heaven decrees for Tartary ? The day declines Tham . Thamar Low to Korella Remember ! My bounty or my vengeance ! Distant thunder ; lightnings Kor . Korel la In a continued tone of inspiration The spirit of the desert is thy protector ! Soon , soon will his will be manifest ! Aye , from this lake , amid the flash of thunderbolts ; ' t is he , ' t is he himself reveals thy destined heir ! Rapid and repeated flashes of lightning and loud claps of thunder , amid the deepening darkness . General astonishment Tham . Th amar Apart , exultingly , to Korella Thy word is kept . I am satisfied ! Aside Now , then , for the fulfilment of the oracle ! The storm drives nearer . The thunders become more terrific . Alarm and horror pervade all the groups , while hope calls smiles upon the lips of the aged Khan and those of Thamar , though from opposite causes . The prophetess appears oppressed . The vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but her . The lightnings , discovering her pale and agitated countenance , attract the looks of the Prince and all his attendants towards hers . She gives a sudden shriek of terror . A loud clap of thunder seems to answer to the shriek . She reels against a rock , exclaiming Kor . Korel la He comes ! He comes ! The darkness deepens and the storm grows wilder . Koskar , shepherds , women , and children rush in , terrified Kos . Koskar The Volpas ! The Volpas ! All . All The Volpas ! Kos . Koskar In a voice almost inaudible from consternation I saw him in a hurricane of dust . He flies hither from the mountains bordering on Poland . He rides a wild horse which scours the desert like a tempest . He comes ! He comes ! General shriek of horror . The storm is at its height . Beyond the lake appears the horse to which Casimir is bound . He crosses the steps in a furious gallop . The shepherds , the women , and the children prostrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to tear asunder his bonds and cries with stifled shrieks Cas . Castellan Set me free ! Oh , release me ! Set me free ! For a moment he disappears with the horse . All the characters are grouped on the edge of the lake . Thamar , alone , at the front , knows not how to explain the strange sight . Thamar is disturbed , agitated , irresolute . He consults with his confidants apart , and threatens Korella with his gestures ; but she seems overwhelmed and to have lost all perception . Various Tartar groups flow back upon the stage . The thunder redoubles ; terror is at its climax . The wild horse reappears , but nearer , upon a rock , forming a little platform which overhangs the lake . In struggling , Casimir has freed his head and one of his arms . He shrieks again Cas . Castellan In mercy , set me free ! Release me ! Set me free ! At this moment , with the rapidity of thought , a thunderbolt bursts and falls near the rock upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very instant the wild horse plunges with his rider into the lake , and both disappear . A barque is at the edge of the lake . Two Tartars , the most daring of the throng , spring into it . During these various movements , amid the confusion and terror which reign on all sides , Thamar , overpowered with uneasiness , is desirous of questioning Korella upon this strange event , for which he is utterly unable to account . He approaches her with threats . She preserves a gloomy silence , points to Heaven , and opposes a cold disdain to the menaces of Thamar , who , by the presence of Abder Khan , is kept in check . The tempest gradually subsides . A rainbow appears in the distance through the trees and the returning light discloses Casimir , whom the fall had loosened from the wild horse , struggling with the waves . He swims towards the barque , which receives him ; but no sooner has he entered it than he swoons . The barque is brought to the edge of the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they bear to the front in a lifeless state and place him on the bank of moss . Thamar and his conspirators remain in mingled astonishment and rage . The aged Prince , his mind struck with the prediction he has heard , approaches Casimir with emotion and concern Abd . Abder Khan Poor sufferer ! Those torn habiliments and that death-white brow ! Raising up his head Korella ! Hasten to his succor . If it be possible , restore him back to life . Tham . Thamar Apa rt By what miracle ! I had yet given no order . Can Korella have conceived a project similar to mine ? And can she be the favorer of some rival ? Korella eagerly obeys the mandate of Abder Khan . All her attentions are lavished on Casimir . The Tartars group themselves in divers picturesque postures around the wounded . The aged Khan himself attempts to stop the flow of blood . Suddenly he is struck motionless with surprise , in discovering around the neck of the young stranger the chain of gold and star of precious gems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases with his astonishment . He falls upon his knees , uncovers the breast of the wounded , looks at his bosom , then at his right arm , and utters a cry of joy Abd . Abder Khan Great Heaven ! That chain , that star , that royal emblem stamped above his heart ! Mazeppa 's name engraven ! Friends ! Our prayers are answered ! Korella 's prophecy 's fulfilled ! Chieftains of the tribes , Tartars , approach ! Behold and recognize Mazeppa , your prince ! My son and rightful heir ! Points to the indubitable signs by which he recognizes his grandson . All express the most lively joy , which forms a strong contrast with the ill-dissembled fury of Thamar and his conspirators Kor . Kor ella Prince , give not way to a deceitful joy . The slumber of the youth is deep and fearful . The moment when his eyes unclose decides his life or death . Abd .

All the Tartars follow his example and lift their arms to Heaven . Alone at the back , Thamar seems to meditate some guilty deed and threatens while the rest supplicate . Abder Khan rises Be everything made ready for my son 's removal to the royal tent . Inspired Korella , forsake him not ! Give him your superhuman aid ! To his suite Be the prophetess obeyed implicitly . Korella makes a sign to Zelos and others of the attendants . They follow her into the cavern Gallant Thamar , proclaim the joyful tidings of my son 's return . Assemble the grand council of the chiefs to hear my sovereign will . Tham . Thamar Smo thering his rage Enough , my liege . Abd . Abder Khan Guard the exterior of the royal tent . Let the most trusty warriors , chosen by your care , be called to watch the safety of my son . Tham . Thamar Your orders shall be obeyed . He bows , affecting entire submission to the aged Khan , who turns toward his son , expressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cofferet . She is followed by Zelos and Tartars , bearing a litter covered with skins of wild beasts . Mazeppa is placed on the litter carefully . Korella applies to him a phial , which she takes from her bosom , which seems in some degree to revive him . He places his hand on his heart , lifts his head , and immediately drops it again upon the bosom of Abder Khan , murmuring the name of Olinska . On the side opposite Korella has caught the hand of the young Prince and gazes on him with returning hope . The characters group around the litter as the Tartars raise it up , and the procession moves . It disappears in the distance , after winding round the lake . Thamar is left upon the stage with his warriors , all wrapped in gloomy silence , and ranged around their discontented chief , who thus addresses them Tham . Thamar My gallant partners , the golden prize is slipping from my grasp . To you I turn for aid . All the Tartars press more closely round Thamar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juggled from your chief to be transferred into the hands of strangers ? The perfidious Korella has proved a traitress to her plighted promise ! Her treason must be paid for by her blood ! As for the youth , led hither by chance or by contrivance , be he , or be he not the rightful heir of Abder Khan , his death is sealed ! With savage exultation His guard to me has been entrusted . The moment is propitious and must not be lost . Even this very night  --  The Tartars , all with their hands upon their dagger hilts , make a gesture of assent Enough . Away ! They depart on the side opposite to the exit of the procession Scene 2 : The tent of Abder Khan . Right hand , at the back , an alcove hung with bear skins and surrounded with fasces of arms and standards . At its side , a stand sustaining a cofferet , and on which are ranged the arms of the Khan . Koskar and slaves , directed by Zelos , are settling the things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighted candelabra near the stand . The procession accompanying Mazeppa enters the tent in silence . Mazeppa is still supported on the litter by Abder Khan and Korella . He is placed gently in the alcove . All recede respectfully . The aged Khan and Korella alone remain at the young man 's side . Korella endeavors to encourage the Khan , whose anxiety concerning his grandson is become intense . Kor . Korella Subdue your fears , King ! A little more repose will be enough to bring him to himself . We shall then learn the miracle by which the guardian angels of the land have restored him to his longing kingdom . Then , Prince , you may yourself announce to him his royal lineage and welcome him to his high destiny . Abd . Abder Khan You answer for his life , then ? Oh , Korella ! How can I evince my gratitude ? Kor . Korella I have fulfilled the mission given me by Heaven ; my heart requires no further recompense !

Abd . Abder Khan Prophetess ! Your counsels shall be followed instantly . Departs with his warriors after having cast a glance of interest upon Mazeppa . Korella gives divers orders to the attendants for the service of the Prince . At a signal afterwards from the prophetess , they withdraw , guided by Zelos and Koskar . Left alone with Mazeppa , Korella , after having gazed on him an instant , glances carefully all around the tent , listens , and hearing no noise , half opens the curtains to examine whether there is aught outside to disturb the repose and safety of her charge . Satisfied on discovery of the sentinels pacing around the exterior , she returns to the side of Mazeppa , sits down near the stand and from deep thought sinks to sleep . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steals forward and gazes all around . He discovers the intense slumber of Korella . The moment seems propitious to his plot . He makes a sign . Pour ferocious warriors , devoted to Thamar , appear at the entrance of the tent . On a second signal they approach in silence . Thamar points them to the couch Tham . ThamarIn a low tone Comrades ! Behold the traitress and the impostor youth ! Fate puts them in our power ! Both must perish . Advance in silence . The Tartars softly approach the alcove . Korella , still sleeping , makes a gesture which seems to express that she is in a dream . The Tartars recoil , surprised , their swords remaining uplifted Kor . Korella Her eyes not unclosed Aye , thou shalt reign , Mazeppa , thou yet shalt reign and make the people happy ! Tham . ThamarLow She dreams . Kor . Korella Traitor ! In vain thou liftst a sacrilegious hand . ' T is Heaven 's decree . He triumphs o'er his foes . Aye , soon , thyself delivered up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thine first shall pay thy perfidy ! Aiming at her heart , the blow misses her in rising and falls upon her arm Kor . Korella Shrieking Ha ! Thoroughly awakening Murderers ! Help ! Save us ! Thamar and his Tartars rush on her . Korella only strives to shield Mazeppa with her body Mazeppa , rise ! Defend thyself , Mazeppa ! The Tartars struggle with her , and she falls . During this bustle , which has for a moment withdrawn the assassins from the alcove , Mazeppa , starting from his sleep , feels in his peril a supernatural strength . He darts behind the couch , measures with one glance the extent of the danger threatening him , and , with the celerity of thought , catches from the open cofferet two pistols and levels them at the group surrounding the overthrown Korella . The Tartars quit Korella for their new adversary . He fires the two pistols . Two of his foes are shot and stagger off . Mazeppa grasps a saber , attacks Thamar , and at the same time defends himself against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides at once , by planting his back against the alcove . After a considerable resistance in this unequal fight , he is just yielding to numbers , when Korella , having dragged herself to the back , strikes a shield which sends forth a startling sound . Violent tumult without . Trumpets sound . Cries are heard : " To arms ! " The tent opens at the back . The great encampment of the Tartars , divided according to their tribes , appears with banners floating in the air and all the warriors under arms . Multitudes rush on in disorder , at their head , the Khan , environed by his chiefs . They rush on Thamar . Korella exclaims Kor . Korella The decrees of destiny are accomplished ! Pointing to Thamar Behold the man who sought to gain the throne by sacrilege ! Heaven , to confound his crime , has realised the oracle he dared to dictate for my utterance .

Abder Khan conducts his grandson to a white courser , richly caparisoned , which is led on from the back and which none but Khans have a right to mount . The youth springs on the courSer .

There still remains to us a moment . Heaven will point the means to turn it to advantage . Away ! Away ! Maz . Mazeppa March ! March ! General movement among the Tartars , who flock tumultuously after their chief . Agatha , who has stood in a state of stupor , seeing Mazeppa following Korella off , runs towards him for protection Watch o'er this woman , Zelos ! See no harm befall her !

At the back , a marble balustrade with a gilded gate in the center , bordering on a large trench , beyond which appears a vast extent of forest , with many practicable platforms . Koskar , with the rest of the disguised Tartars , crosses the forest in the distance , looks through the gate , but disappears a moment among the trees , on discovering Drolinsko , who comes out of the castle , full of bustle , gaping all around him . Dro . Drolinsko Well , here 's a fte which I think will do me honor . Dances , banquets , illuminations ! All out of this ! Slapping his forehead This night will be the grandest day of my life !

You may never have such another chance of glory . Ozeb . Ozeb I 'll warrant we 'll make ourselves remembered . Dro . Drolinsko But where are the young girls , they who dance so merrily ? Ozeb .

The young couple , the lords , and the ladies and all . Go you and hide at the entrance of the forest , and do n't appear until I give the signal . The Tartars instantly disappear among the left-hand trees . The Castellan , Olinska , Premislas , encircled by lords and ladies , advance through the peristyle . Their presence is the signal for the sports . They place themselves upon the seats prepared , and the fte begins . Ballet . Among the figures of which it is composed , young Tartars , in disguise , presented by Drolinsko , execute a singular armed dance mingled with pantomimic action . Ozeb and Koskar , upon the watch , on one side of the stage , seem to await the signal for action . Suddenly the dances are interrupted by three shots from the outside , and presently after , an external tumult mingles with cries , " To Arms ! Treason ! Treason !

Amid the confusion the Castellan seizes his daughter to drag her from the danger . The tumult is at its height . The whole forest is in a blaze . The fight proceeds amid the flames . Groups of combatants are driven back by the conflagration . The front of the stage is left for a moment empty . Amid the disorder Olinska reappears alone , pale , wild , her hair dishevelled , a poniard in her hand Olin . Olinska My father ! Casimir ! My native land ! No , nothing is left Olinska but to die !
