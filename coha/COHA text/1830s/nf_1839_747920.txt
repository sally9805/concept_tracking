txt /q/moned , appears and pleads or demurs to this suggestion filed , and by the regular course of pleading , an issue either of law or of fact is joined . If the former , the cause is set down for argument before the court ; if the latter , it goes to a jury ; and in either case , the matter is determined in the usual way . As the Supreme Court sits at Nisi Prius , that is , for the decision of questions of fact by a jury , for the City and County of Philadelphia only , when , in the course of proceedings on a quo warranto in that Court , a fact arises proper to be tried in another county , an issue is directed to the Common Pleas of such county , to be there determined . Where , as in the present case , the issue joined by the parties is an issue of fact , the jury having found a verdict , judgment may be entered for the successful party after four days , unless within that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some error which vitiates the proceedings , appearing on the face of the record 'd , or for a new trial , where from circumstances not appearing on the record , it seems that justice has not been done . These motions are argued before the court in bank  --  that is , before all the judges sitting in a body to determine questions of law ; and , in the present case , are the only remedies for the unsuccessful party , since the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is the highest tribunal in the State  - -  the last resort . Where judgment is given in a Court of Common Pleas , it may be reviewed upon a writ of error , Issuing out of the Supreme Court , in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction . The judgment thus entered , if in favour of the plaintiff , is that the defendant be ousted and excluded ; and the successful litigant in every case recovers his costs of suit . It is manifest that such a judgment does not , in form , determine the right of any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact . /z/ If the due election of certain new members of a body corporate , in the place of as many old members , determine the office of the latter , and , the parties taking issue on the fact of such new election , the verdict is for the plaintiff , the judgment must , in effect , give a right of entry on the one hand , while it pronounces an ouster on the other . Until judgment is finally rendered , the last resort having been tried , the defendant continues in the exercise of the disputed right , unless the court to which a writ of error is brought , sees fit , on sufficient cause shown , to award execution , notwithstanding such writ . In the above concise view , we have confined ourselves chiefly to those aspects of the subject , which have seemed impoi'tant to a clear understand- , ing of the case here reported , to which , without further introduction , we now proceed .

Mr. Randall , for the relators , then opened the case as follows : Mai/ it please your Honour  --  Gentlemen of the Jury :  --  Though this action is brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , it is not to be considered in the light of a criminal proceeding . Nor does /z/ it involve any question as to the moral character of the defendants . The suit , though , nominally , aprosecution by the Commonwealth , is only a method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of individuals . The object of the writ of Quo Warrcaito in this case is , to try whether certain persons , viz. Dr. Ashbel Green , Rev , William Latta , Thomas Bradford , Esq. , Solomon Allen , Esq . and Dr. Cornelius C. Cuyler were on the 24th day of jNlay , 1S3S , trustees , in a body incorporated b ' the Legislature of Pennsylvania , as " The Trustees of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . " In order to understand this case , it will be necessary to recur to a part of the history of the Presbyterian Church . The first Presbytery formed in the United States was the Presbytery ' of Philadelphia . In the 3-ear 1758 , there existed two Synods , the Synod of New York and the Synod of Philadelphia . In that year they united , forming an ecclesiastical body , called the Sjnod of New York and Philadelphia . This organization continued until the year 17SS , when , in the place of this general Synod , was instituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States of America , the first meeting of which was held in the city of Philadelphia , on the third Thursdayof May , 17S9 . On the 2Sth day of March , 1799 , the Legislature of Pennsylvania passed an act incorporating certain persons therein mentioned , under the name of " The Trustees of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . " The sixth section of this act is as follows : " That the said corporation shall not , at any time , consist of more than ei- ' teen members ; whereof , the said General Assembly may , at their discretion , us Oiten as they shall hold their sessions in the State of Pennsylvania , change oir-ih.rci , in such manner as to the General Assembly shall seem proper : And the r .. - pji- ation aforesaid shall have power and authority , to manag-e and dispose ; f a ! i moneys , goods , chattels , lands , tenements , and hereditaments , and other eslats wuatsoever comniitleJ to their care and trust , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions for the management and disposal thereof , shall be civen by the said General Assembly in writing , under the hand of their clerk , it shall be the duty oi " the said corporation , to act according to such instructions : Provided , said instri'Ctions shall not be repugnant to the constitution and laws of the United States , or to the constitution and laws of this Commonwealth , or to the provisions , and restrictions in this act contained . " The lowest court or judicatory known to the Presbyterian Church is the Session . This primar ) ecclesiastical body consists of the pastor , or pastors , and the ruling elders of a particular congregation , such elders being chosen from among the male members of the church , and holding their office for life . The next higher court is the Frssbytery , which consists of all the ministers , and one ruling elder froFxi each congregation , within a certain district , at least three ministers , hov/ever , with as many elders as may be present , being necessary to constitute the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes a number of Presbyteries , at least three , and like the latter is composed of all the ministers , and of representative elders , one from each church , within its bounds . The highest tribunal is the General Assembly , which is entirely a representative body , consisting of ministers and elders delegated from the various Presbyteries ; the representation of each being in proportion to the number of ministers belonging to it , each being entitled to send at least two delegates , iwie a minister and the other an elder , and beyond this number , one minister and one elder for every twenty-four constituent /z/ ministers . You will observe , then , that the Synods , as such , have no representation in the General Assembly ; they are courts superior to the Presbyteries in certain points , as in the right of trying appeals from the latter , yet they are passed by in the organization of the Assembly , which is composed of the immediate representatives of the Presbyteries . In the year 1S03 , the Synod of Albany was created , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Columbia ; and in 1812 this Synod was divided into the two Synods of Albany a ! id Geneva , the latter comprising within its bounds the Presbyteries of T ) nondaga , Cayuga and Geneva . The Synod of Geneva thus formed , was Itself divided in the year 1821 , the Presbyteries of Niagara , Genessee , Rochester and Ontario , then component parts of that body , being erected into a separate Synod called the Synod of Genessee . In the year 1825 , the Synod of Pittsburgh was divided , and the Presbyteries of Grand River , Portage , and Huron were constituted the Synod of the Western Reserve . In 1829 , the Synod of Albany was a second time divided , and the Presbyteries of Ogdensburg , Watertown , Oswego , Oneida and Otsego , separated therefrom , yere constituted a new Synod , called the Synod of Utica . We have thus traced the formation of the Synods of Utica , Geneva , Genessee and Western Reserve  --  the four Synods to which , in the progress of this cause , your attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continued to act under the General Assembly for many years , always recognised as parts of the Presbyterian Church . They were represented in the General Assembl , the officers of that body being sometimes chosen from their members , and funds being collected among them , and poured into the common treasury . Thus matters continued until differences of opinion crept into the church , which , however , it was at first hoped would not destroy its unity or its peace . But they increased , two conflicting parties divided the General Assembly , and the terms Old and New-school began to be applied to them respectively ; which terms we shall employ for the purpose of description , without , however , intending to admit , that those whom we represent have in any respect departed from the original Presbyterian faith . For years these two parties continued nearly equal . In ISSl , ' 32 , ' 33 and ' 34 , our Old-school brethren , for as brethren we still regard them , were a minority in the General Assembly . In 1835 they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority . This led to the adoption of a project by the Old-school party , to separate from their brethren with whom they could not accord ; and in May , 1837 , a meeting of that party was held in Philadelphia , for deliberation on this project , and at this meeting all the preliminary arrangements were made for a voluntary separation or secession . But in the Assembly of that year , they unexpectedly found themselves a majority , and this state of things changed their whole plan of action . At the meeting of the Assembly , a proposal of separation was made by the Old-school , on their own terms , securing to them the name and succession , and to force a compliance with these terms , the purpose of cutting off from the church a sufficient portion of their opponents to place themselves in a decided majority , was held out as a punishment to be inflicted on the New-school , should they not consent to the proposed separation . The latter wei'o willing to entertain the proposition , and to enter into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered /q/ were , in our opinion , most equitable , but they were refused , and the plan of excision resolved upon . The Old-school were determined to secure a future majority in the General Assembly . Their partizans were told plainly by the gentleman who was their masterspirit in all these movements , that unless they improved the opportunit " then offered , it might never again occur  --  that thereafter they would be left in a minority . Accordingly , tliey proceeded to the work of destruction , and cut off from the church the four Synods above named  --  Utica , Geneva , Genessee and Western Reserve ; by this act casting out from their communion more than five hundred ministers , five hundred and ninety-nine churches , and al ) out sixty thousand communicants . In several cases , reverend fathers of the Churcli , who had reached the patriarchal limit of three score and ten , were excluded ; and this by a body , of which many of the chief actors had been but a few years in the Church . Dark as are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no parallel to these proceedings . The practical operation of these exscinding resolutions is the local desecration of a whole region of country , about two thirds of the state of New York , and a portion of the state of Oliio . It was purely local , or geographical , and had the reverend gentleman now before us ( Dr. Green , ) removed , before 1837 , to any part of this expatriated country , he would have been cut off among the rest . Perhaps there is no part of the Presbyterian form of church government more wisely and carefully guarded , than that which provides for cutting off or expelling a member . For every such case a plan of proceeding is circumstantially prescribed . There must always be an accusation of crime , witnesses and proof ; and above all a regular trial , giving a full opportunity to the party accused to face his accuser , if there be one , and to speak in his own defence . To exhibit fully to you , gentlemen , the care with which this right is guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discipline adopted by the Presbyterian Church , for the rules in relation to this matter . Chapter fourth , of the Book of Discipline , is devoted to the subject o Actual Process . ' Some of its provisions I will read . Mr. Randall then read different parts of the chapter referred to , as also of the succeeding one , which prescribes the form of against a Bishop or Minister j ' to show how precise and strict were the rules on this point . We shall here give merely an abstract of their most important parts . They provide for two modes in which an offence may be brought before a judicatory  --  by an individual appearing as accuser ; or by common fame ; enjoin great caution in receiving accusations from malicious , interested and otherwise improper persons ; require a copy of the charge , with the names of the witnesses to be given to the accused , and notice to all parties concerned ; that the trial shall be put off until the meeting of the judicator next succeeding that at which the accusation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible certainty as to time , place and circumstances ; and that the trial shall be fair and impartial , the witnesses being examined in the presence of the accused , who is permitted to question them ; and prescribes the manner and degree of punishment to be inflicted , whether admonition , rebuke , or exclusion . Process against /z/ a Gospel minister is required always to be entered before the Presbytery of which he is a member . These are tbe provisions of the Book of Discipline ; and how different were the proceedings in the case before us ? Here there was no accuser , no accusation . Notice was not given to the parties thus discipliwed . In fact , the first news carried to the great mass of Presbyterians who inhabit the proscribed districts  --  the first information on the subject which readied their ears was , that they had been cut off , excluded from the communion of their church . Even the names of the individuals who moved and seconded one of the exscinding resolutions are not recorded in the published minutes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which the Oldschool party rely , is the unconstitutionality of a certain " Plan of Union , " entered into in the year 1801 , between the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church , and the General Association of the State of Connecticut ; a plan by which as they contend , Congregationalists have been received into the Presbyterian communion , and under the aid of which , they allege the four exscinded Synods to have been formed . But we vshall show you that this was only a plan of fellowship , of the same kind as those formed with the General Associations of New Hampshire , Vermont , and Massachusetts , the Associated Reformed and Dutch Reformed Churches , both before and after the plan of union of ISOl , and that not a single elder , minister , church , or Presbytery has been , or could be admitted under its operation . The Plan of Union authorized a Presbyterian minister to preach to a Congregational church , and in case of dispute between the pastor and his people , authorized a voluntary tribunal to adjust it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or operate upon the admission of a minister or church into the Presbytery , Synod or General Assembly ; the two subjects had no connexion . Under the plan a small proportion of ministers were settled over Congregational churches ; that number has been , and is , yearly diminishing , and in the three exscinded Synods of New York , is now almost extinct . Thus , gentlemen , you will perceive , that the General Assembly in ISOl , authorize Presbyterian ministers to preach to Congregational churches , and in 1837 expel them for obeying their own resolution , and to increase the unequalled obliquity of the act , they proceed ' to exscind every minister , communicant , or church , that respectively may live or be located within the bounds of the Synod where a Presbyterian minister has , in obedience to their own authority , preached to a Congregational church . We shall further exhibit , gentlemen , the unjust effect of the exscinding acts . The Synods have local bounds . Under the practical operation , therefore , of these resolutions , it becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts . The mere circumstance of residence makes an individual , or ecclesiastical body , heretical or otherwise . While a minister , who had entered into the communion of the church , and received his ordination within the bounds of one of those Synods , but who had removed to some other district , before the excision , remains in good standing , another , ordained by a body still acknowledged as strictl ' Presbyterian , has by entering the infected region , after the excision , lost the right of fellowship . And the General Assembly of 1S37 did not , with /q/ any consistency , carry out its plan of operation , into every case to which it was legitimately applicable . At one fell swoop these four Synods were excluded , while other bodies , equally obnoxious to the charges brought against them , were tiot touched , and still remain in full communion . The Synods of South Carolina and Georgia should have been exscinded , if the Old-school party had wished to be consistent and impartial . The Synods of Pittsburg and New Jersey equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany was suffered to escape , when obnoxious to the very charges under which its offspring was cut off . The case of the Synod of the Western Reserve is still more extraordinary . It was erected out of the Pittsburg Synod , and , in the first instance , included what is now the Synod of Michigan . In the course of time the Synod of Michigan was ci-eated , and while the Synod of the Western Reserve was cut off , those of Pittsburg and Michigan were left untouched . The Assembly first abrogated the Plan of Union , and then declared , that this plan having , been unconstitutional and void from the beginning , no rights had ever been acquired by it ; and therefore that the four Synods , which were alleged to have been formed under its operation had never been parts of the Presbyterian Church . Yet the same consequences were not visited on other Synods , standing in precisely the same situation . If any circumstance was wanting to render this proceeding more unjust , it was that the General Assembly had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1801 , reserving intermediate rights acquired under it . Thus far the work of excision was com.plete ; but it was necessary to extend the operation of the act into the Assembly of 1838 , in order to make it of any avail . It is the duty of the clerks of that body , who con , tinue in office from year to year , during the pleasure of the Assembly , as a Committee of Commissions , to examine the commissions of the members , and report at the opening of the session , those duly elected . They are in this matter , but ministerial or executive officers , bound to act according to the constitution and laws of the Church . It was feared that the clerks of 1837 , in assisting in the organization of the next General Assembly , might refuse to acknowledge the legality of the resolutions of that year , excluding a part of the constituency of the Assembly , and might receive the commissions of delegates coming from within the bounds of the exscinded Synods . A pledge was therefore required from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of 1837 , in the new organization of 1838 . But no minute of this proceeding  --  of this pledge demanded and given , is to be found upon the published minutes of the Assembly of 1837 . At the time appointed in 1838 , commissioners from the various Presbyteries in the United States , including those coming from the four exscinded Synods , met as usual , in this city . The latter , with the resty presented their commissions to the Stated and Permanent Clerks , and demanded that their names should be enrolled . But these officers had already been pledged to a course forbidding the reception of these commissions ; and they accordingly refused . Next , all the commissioners met together in the Seventh Presbyterian church  --  the place appointed for the meeting of the Assembly of 1838 . It was the duty of Dr. Elliott , the Moderator of the last year , to preach a sermon at the openin'g-of this Assembly , and preside during its organiza- /z/ tion , until the election of a new Moderator . After the customary religious services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to be organized , Dr. Patton , a commissioner from the Third Presbytery of New York , rose , stating that he wished to offer certain resolutions which he held in his hand . The Moderator declared him out of order , Dr. Patton appealed from his decision , and the Moderator declared the appeal also out of order , a-nd refused to put the question upon it to the house , saying that the first business in order was the report of the clerks upon the roll . Dr. Patton then took his seat , and the clerks proceeded with their report . This being concluded , the-Moderator announced that , if there were any commissioners present whose names had not been enrolled , that was the time for them to present their commissions . Upon this call . Dr. Mason , also a delegate from the Third Presbytery of New York , rose , and holding in his hand the commissions from the exscinded Synods , tendered them to the Moderator , informing him that they had been presented to the clerks , and by them refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the addition of the names contained in these commissions . The Moderator declared this motion also out ' of order , though it was in answer to his own call , and though the report upon the roll had been then concluded . Dr. Mason respectfully appealed from the decision ; his appeal was seconded , but the Moderator , as before , declared it out of order , and declined putting the question to the house , that it might judge of the correctness of his decision . Under these circumstances . Dr. McDowell and Mr. Krebs , acting as the Committee of Commissions , having violated their duty ; and Dr. Elliott , as Moderator , having upheld them in their illegal course , and created himself an autocrat , I use the term with great respect , exercising the illimitable power of determining every question , and every right , without admitting any appeal from his decision to the house , of which they all were but ministerial officers , it became absolutely necessary to depose these officers , in order to secure a constitutional organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John P. Cleaveland , a commissioner from the Presbytery of Detroit , rose , and stating the difficulty that had occurred , and the necessity that a constitutional organization should be then and there effijcted , moved that Dr. Beman , of the iPresbytery of Troy , should be temporary Moderator , and put the question to the commissioners present . The motion was almost unanimously carried , there being , however , a few votes in the negative . The Assembly was then constituted , and Dr. Fisher being chosen Moderator , and Dr. E. Mason and the Rev. E. W. Gilbert , clerks , adjourned to the first Presbyterian church of this city , where it sat in the regular discharge of its ordinary duties for nearly two weeks . We shall contend that the original excision of the four Western Synods was void and unlawful , and without precedent ; that the Rev. Dr. Elliott had , in attempting to carry into effect , in the organization of the Assenjbly of 1S3S , the illegal acts of the Assembly of 1837 , forfeited his right to the Moderator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperative necessity for his removal , as also for the removal of the clerks , who. equally with him , had usurped an unconstitutional authority . The General Assembly was organized as I have described , and held its session in the First Presbyterian Church , and in the course of its proceedings , /q/ did , on the twenty-fourth of May , 1838 , according to the provisions of the section of their charter of incorporation , elect six trustees , viz : James Todd , Frederick A. Raybold , George W. McClelland , William Darling , Thomas Fleming , and John R. Nefl " , respectively , in the place of Dr. Ashbel Green , William Latta , Thomas Bradford , Solomon Allen , Dr. Cornelius C. Cuyler , and George C. Potts , The question , gentlemen , that you are to decide is , whether the gentlemen last mentioned were lawfully removed from their places by such election  --  whether they have a right to exercise the offices which they continue to hold and exercise . ' In other words , you have to decide , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the First Presbyterian Church , or the body which remained in the Seventh Presbyterian Church , was the true and only General Assembly . One feature of this case ,  --  gentlemen , I hope will be remembered during this inquiry . Our object is to preserve the unity of the Church . We do not deny the rights of our opponents ; but we deny their power to exclude from the communion of the church , without charge , accusation , or trial , every individual within the bounds of the four exscinded Synods . We come into court reluctantly , and our effort is , not to take away the rights of others , but to preserve our own inviolate. /z/ Mr. Randall , having concluded , proceeded to read the pleadings in the case , of which the following is an abstract : The suggestion , verified by the affidavit of one of the relators , Frederick A. Raybold , Esquire , on which the writ was issued , sets forth that the defendants have exercised , since the twenty-fourth day of May , 1S38 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General Assembly , without lawful authority , since on the day mentioned , the relators were duly elected to that office ; and prays that the said defendants may be made to answer , by what warrant they . claim their places . To this Ashbel Green pleads his appointment under the original act of incorporation , and Thomas Bradford , Cornelius C. Cuyler , and Solomon Allen , in separate pleas , their regular election by the General Assembly ; and all deny that any thing has happened to determine their offices . Then follow replications to these pleas , setting forth the choice of James Todd , George W. McClelland , Thomas Fleming , and William Darling , in the place of the four defendants named , according to the provisions of the act of incorporation . The rejoinders deny such choice , and on this fact issue is joined . William Latta , though his name appears in the suggestion and in the writ , was not served with the process , and takes no part in the pleadings . Before proceeding to the evidence , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties had provided , that the printed copies of all original documents , which were competent testimony , might be given in evidence , without producing such originals . The documents from which , under this agreement , the most copious extracts were read , were the published Minutes of the General Assembly , " The Assembly 's Digest , " and " The Constitution of the Presbyterian Church , " containing " The Confession of Faith , the Catechisms , and the Directory for the Worship of God : together with the Flan of Government and Discipline , as amended and ratified by the General Assembly , at their session in May 1821 ; " references to all which will be understood after this explanation . Mr. Randall first offered in evidence the Charter of Incorporation , granted to the Presbyterian Church , by the legislature of Pennsylvania . ( Assem . Digest , p . Q2 . J " An Act for incorporatiing the Trustees of the Ministers and Elders , constituting the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America .

When the day of election arrives , the Assembly shall ascertain what vacancies in the number of the eighteen Trustees incorporated , have taken place by death pr otherwise ; and shall first proceed to choose otheir members in their places .

That the Synod see no ground for the charge of delinquency in relation to the permission alleged in the first specification . The Synod would remark , that previously to the resolution of the Assembly on this subject in 1888 , it is believed that a difference of practice prevailed in our Presbyteries , in the reception of members from corresponding churches ; ( as has been common in other Presbyteries in different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confession of Faith of the Presbyterian church . But since the passage of that resolution by the Assembly , the Synod believe that no such practice has obtained in any of our Presbyteries , In regard to the allegation respecting pcrjwis licensed and ordained by our Presbyteries , without receiv- /z/ ing and adopting the Confession of Faith , the Synod have no knowledge orbelief of the prevalence of any such practice in any of our Presbyteries. " 2 . That in relation to the remaining allegation , viz. on the subject of ruling elders , the Synod do not discover any reason for the charge of having violated the constitution of the church , inasmuch as that constitution does not make the eldership essential to the e.xistence of a church , and as the number of persons in many churches is too small to admit the election of suitable persons to fill that office , and where this is not the case , the fact of there being Congregationalists mingled with Presbyterians in many churches , is a sufficient reason for the non-existence of the Eldership , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General Association of Connecticut ; from the spirit of which , the Synod believe , that none of our Presbyteries have departed . " However , with regard to the charge of the Presbyteries allowing the office of ruling elder to go into disuse , the Synod would say , that during the last year , there have been more ruling elders elected and ordained , in the churches connected with our Presbyteries , than during any three or four years previously .

When all other means of removing an offisnce have failed , the judicatory to which cognizance of it properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . There are two modes in which an offence may be brought before a judicatory : either by an individual or individuals , who appear as accusers , and undertake to substantiate the charge ; or by common fame . " 3 . In the former case , process must be pursued in the name of the accuser or accueers . In the latter , there is no need of naming any person as the accuser . Common fame is the accuser . Yet a general rumour may be raised by the rashness , censoriousness , or malice of one or more individuals . When this appears to have been the case , such individuals ought to be censured , in proportion to the degree of criminality which appears attached to their conduct .. " 4 . Great caution ought to be exercised in receiving accusations from any person who is known to indulge a malignant spirit towards the accused ; wiio is not of good character ; who is himself under censure or process ; who is deeply interested , in any respect , in the conviction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash , or highly imprudent . " 5 . When a judicatory enters on the consideration of a crime or crimes alleged , no more shall be done , at the first meetings , unless by consent of parties , than to give the accused a copy of each charire , with the names of the witnesses to support it ; and to cite ail concerntrd to appear at the next meeiing of the judicatory , to have the matter fully heard and decided . Notice shall be given to the parties concerned , at least ten days previously lo the meeting of the judicatory. " 6 . The citations shall be issued and signed by the moderator or clerk , by order , and in the name of the judicatory . He shall also furnish citations for such witnesses as the accused shall nominate , to appear on his behalf . /q/ -7 . Although it is required that the accused be informed of the names of all the witses who are to be adduced against him , at least ten days before the time of trial , ( unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) it is not necessary that he , on his part , give a sioiilar notice to the judicatory of all the witnesses intended to be adduced by him for his exculpation. " 8 , In exhibiting charges , the times , places , and circumstances should , if possible , be ascertained and stated , that the accused may have an opportunity to prove an alibi , or to extenuate or alleviate his offence . " 9 . The judicatory , in many cases , may find it more for edification , to send some members to converse , in a private manner , with the accused person ; and if he confess guilt , to endeavour to bring him to repentance , than to proceed immediately to citation . , " 10 . VViien an accused person , or a witness , refuses to obey the citation , he shall be cited a second lime : and if he still continue to refuse , he shall be excluded from the communion of the church , for his contumacy , until he repent . . " 11 , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall declare in writing , or otherwise , his fixed determination not to obey it ; this declaration shall , in no case , induce the judicatory to deviate from the regular course prescribed for citations . They shall proceed as if no such declaration had been made . The person cited may afterwards alter his mind . " 12 . The time which must elapse between the first citation of an accused person , or a witness , and the meeting of the judicatory at which he is to appear , is at least ten days . But the time allotted for his appearance in the subsequent citation , is left to the discretion of the judicatory ; provided , always , however , that it be not less than is quite sufficient for a seasonable and convenient compliance with the citation . " 13 .

As the honour and success of the Gospel depend , in a great measure , on the character of its ministers , each Presbytery ought , with the greatest care and impartiality to watch over the personal and professional conduct of all its members . But as , on the one hand , no minister ought , on account of , his office , to be screened from the hand of justice , nor his offences to be slightly censured ; so neither ought scandalous charges to be received ajrainst him , by any judicatory , on sliurht grounds . " 2 . Process agamsc a Gospel minister shall always be entered before the Presbytery of which he is a member . And the same candour , caution , and general method , substituting only the Presbytery for the session , are to be observed in investigating charges against him , as are prescribed in the case of private members . . " 3 . If it be found that the facts with which a minister stands charged , happened without the bound.s of his own Presbytery , that Presbytery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did happen : and desire them either ( if within convenient distance ) to cite the witnesses to appear at the place of trial ; or , ( if the distance be so great as to render that inconvenient , ) to take the examination themselves , and transmit an authentic record of their testimony : always giving due notice to the accused person of the time and place of such examination . " 4 . Nevertheless , in case of a minister being supposed to be guilty of a crime , or crimes , at such a distance from his usual place of residence , as that the offence is not likely to become otherwise known to the Presbytery to which he belongs ; it shall , in such case , be the duty of the Presbytery within whose bounds the facts shall have happened , after satisfying themselves that there is probable ground of accusation , to send notice to the Presbytery of which he is a member , who are to proceed against him , and either send and take the testimony themselves , by a commission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it for them , and transmit the same , properly authenticated . " 5 . Process against a Gospel minister shall not be commenced , unless some person ' or persons , undertake to make nut the charge : or unless common fame so loudly proclaims the scandal , ' that the Presbytery find it necessary , for the honour of religion , to investigate the charge . " 6 . As the success of the Gospel greatly depends upon the exemplary character of its ministers , thoir soundness in the faith , and holy conversation ; and as it is the duty of all Christians to be very cautious in talnng up an ill report of any man , but especially of a minister of the Gospel ; therefore , if any man knows a minister to be guilty of a private , censurable fault , ho should warn him in private . But if the guilty person persist in his fault , or it becomes public , he who knows it , should apply to some other bishop of the Presbytery for his advice in the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously warned , that if he fail to prove the charges , he must himself be censured as a slanderer of the Gospel ministry , in proportion to the malignity or rashness that shall appear in the prosecution . " 8 . When complaint is laid before the Presbytery , it must be reduced to writing : and nothing further is to be done at the first meeting , ( unless by consent of parties , ) than giving the minister a fuU ropy of the charfjes , with the names of the witnesses annexed : and citing all parties , and their witnesses , to appear and be heard at the next meeting : which meeting shall not be sooner than ten days after such citation .

If he confess , and the matter be base and flagitious ; such as druiikeimess , uncleanness , or crimes of a higher nature , however penitent he may appear , to the satisfaction of all , the Presbytery must , without delay , suspend him from the exercise of his office , or depose him from the ministry ; and , if TESTIMONY FOR THE RELATORS. 3j the way be clear for the purpose , appoint him a due lime to confess publicly before the congregation offended , and to profess his penitence. " 11 . If a minister accused of atrocious crimes , being twice duly cited , shall refuse to attend the Presbytery , he shall be immediately suspended . And if , after another citation , he still refuse to attend , he shall be deposed as contumacious. " 12 . If the minister , when he appears , will not confess ; but denies the facts alleged against him , if , on hearing the witnesses , the charges appear important , and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and admonish , suspend , or depose him , according to the nature of the offence . " 13 . Heresy and schism may be of such a nature as to infer deposition ; but errors ought to be carefully considered ; whether they strike at the vitals of religion , and are industriously spread ; or , whether they arise trom the weakness of the human understanding , and are not likely to do much injury . " 14 . A minister under process for heresy or schism , should be treated with Christian and brotjierly tenderness . Frequent conferences ought to be held with him , and proper admonitions administered . For some more dangerous errors , however , suspension may become necessary . " 15 . If the Presbytery find , on trial , that the matter complained of , amounts to no more than such acts of infirmity as may be amended , and the people satisfied ; so that little or nothing remains to hinder his usefulness , they shall take all prudent measures to remove the offence .

A minister deposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the deepest sorrow for his sin , until after some time of eminent and exemplary , humble and edifying conversation , to heal the wound made by his scandal . And he oughtn no case to be restored , until it shall appear , that the sentiments of the religious public are strongly in his favour , and demand his restoration . " 17 . As soon as a minister is deposed , his congregation shall be declared vacant . " Next , Form of Government , Chapter XII . " IV . The General Assembly shall receive and issue all appeals and references , which may be regularly brought before them , from the inferior judicatories . They shall review the records of every Synod , and approve or censure them ; they shall give their advice and instruction , in all cases submitted to them , in conformity with the constitution of the Church ; and they shall constitute the bond of union , peace correspondence , and mutual confidence , among all our churches .

To the General Assembly also belongs the power of deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warning , or bearing testimony against error in doctrine , or immorality in practice , in any Church , Presbytery , or Synod ; of erecting new Synods , when it may be judged necessary ; of superintending the concerns of the whole Church ; of corresponding with foreign churches , on such terms as may be agreed upon by the Assembly and the corresponding body ; of suppressing schismatical contentions and disputations ; and , in general of recommending and attempting reformation of manners , and the promotion of charity , tiuth , and holiness , through all the churches under . their care . " VI . Before any overtures or regulations proposed by the Assembly to be established as constitutional rules , shall be obligatory on the churches , it shall be necessary to transmit them to all the Presbyteries , and to receive the returns of at least a majority of them , in writing , approving thereof " Min. 1822 , p. 22 . " The committee to which was referred a paper purporting to be a remonstrance from John M. Rankin and others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , having had the same under serious consideration , submitted the following report , which was adopted , viz : " The General Assembly can never hesitate , on any proper occasion , to recommend to those , who , at both their licensure and ordination , professed " sincerely to receive and adopt the Confession of Faith of this Church , as containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures , " and to all other members of our Church , steadfastly to adhere to that " form of sound words . " " But while the General Assembly is invested with the power of deciding in all controversies , respecting doctrine and principle ; of reproving , warning , or bearing testimony , against error in doctrine in any Church , Presbytery , or Synod ; or of suppressing ' schismatical contentions and disputations , all such matters ought to he brought before /z/ the Assembly in a regular and constitutional way . And it does not appear that the constitution ever designed , that the General Assembly should take up abstract cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be , to brine : those decisions to bear on particular individuals , not judicially before the Assembly . Neither does it appear , that the Constitution of the Church , intended that any person or persons , should have the priviiecfe of presentinnr for decision , remonstrances respecting points of doetrine , on the conduct of individuals , not brougiit up from the superior judicatories , by appeal , reference , or complaint ; and this especially , when such remonstrances contain no evidence whatsoever , of the facts alleged , but mere statements , of the truth or justness of which the Assembly have no means of judging , inasmuch as a contrary course , . would allow of counter and contradictory remonstrances , without end . " Wherefore , on motion Resolved , that the committed be discharged from the further consideration of this remonstrance ; and the , committee were accordingly discharged . " Court adjourned . WEDNESDAY MORNING , March 6th  --  10 o'clock . Mr. Randall offered in evidence portions of a statistical table , ( Mln. 1837 , p. 521 , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Assembly , there were numerous ministers who were pastors of Congregational Churches . He showed that in the Presbyteries of Londonderry and Newburyport , belonging to the Synod of Albany , out of forty-one ministers reported as composing those Presbyteries , there were sixteen pastors of Congregational , and only fourteen of Presbyterian Churches , pp. 522  --  3 . ) He then offered other parts of the table to show that there were no such cases reported in any of the Presbyteries of the exscinded Synods . Next he referred to the table , beginning with the Presbytery of St. Lawrence , p. 527 , ) to show the amount of contributions to the Church funds , collected within those Synods , in the year ending with the date of the reports of 1837 . Some of the extracts were as follows : " Presbytery of St. Lawrence , $9.53 33 VVatertown , - - 976 32 Oswego , 662 07 Otsego , 1525 01 Geneva , - 7729 95 Cayuga , ....  --  .. 3251 00 Rochester , 15,750 50 . " Mr. Randall next offered to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) to show what ecclesiastical bodies were recognised as in connexion with the Church , at the opening of the Assembly of 1837 . Mr. Hubbell . We object to the evidence proposed , may it please your Honor . The admission of this testimony would involve us in other questions than those raised by the pleadings . The proceedings of the Assembly of 1837 have no bearing upon this case : why does the other party wish to introduce them here ? What is their purpose ? Is it to prove that that Assembly dismembered and destroyed itself ? If any thing less than this , what effect can the proceedings of 1837 have upon those of 1838 ? The pleadings , however , preclude the admission of evidence for such a purpose . The Assembly of 1838 derjved its existence from the adjournment in 1837 . The very appointment of these trustees , the relators in this suit , is an acknowledgment of the fact , that the Assembly of 1837 did not perform any act of dismemberment . It was said , in the opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1838 had rejected from the roll of that body certain individuals claiming seats , and that this was the true ground of the controversy . /q/ That a certain gentleman rose , and proposed the deposition of those officers , for their misconduct ; and that , by an almost unanimous vole , they were deposed . Their object , then , is to prove , that the officers of the Assembly of 1838 Committed some error ; that they defeated the constitutional organization of the Assembly , by their refusal to admit the claimants referred to . If so , if such a rejection can be proved , and it can also be shown that this rejection defeated the organization of the Assembly , the plaintiffs have made out that part of their case . But why should they go into our case ? We deny that the Assembly ever made . any such rejection ; that they ever committed themselves on the subject . But even if they did , why should our opponents go into the proceedings of the Assembly of 1837 to find a reason , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are any such reasons , it is our business to exhibit them . They have no right to meddle with them  --  to come into our camp . Let us justify ourselves . The Assembly of 1S38 , as regards the qualification of its members , was entirely independent of that of 1837 . It may have been composed of members entirely different , though coming from the same constituent bodies . The two Assemblies had not even the same Moderator ; for the old Moderator continues in office merely to constitute the new body . Here are certain individuals , then , who present themselves to the Permanent and Stated Clerks of the Assembly of 1838 , whose business it is to judge of the validity of commissions , and they are rejected . An attempt is made to introduce the matter to the consideration of the house . The Moderator declares the motion for that purpose out of order , and an appeal being taken from his decision , he declares the appeal also out of order . Now they may contend , that by this act , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , unanimously removed its officers for their misconduct . Well , if there was a unanimous removal , why should the plaintiffs go back to the proceedings of 1837 : why should they anticipate our defence ? Perhaps we may say that our opponents have violated some rule of the Assembly . If this be our defence they certainly have no right to anticipate us in the development of it . Suppose it true , that the Assembly of 1837 did ; ommit injustice : what effect can this have upon the proceedings of 1838 , when , as they contend , the error has been cleared away ? " Ah ! but you wo n't admit this , " say they- ; " therefore we will go into evidence to show the injustice of the acts of 1837 . " Well , suppose they abandon this ground , and contend that no regular process was commenced under the Assembly of 1838 ; that , from the rejection of certain commissioners by the clerks , every thing done was void and of no effect : still , is it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an , error ? If we attempt to show a justification for our Moderator and clerks , must we do it in the way which they point out ? We , indeed , intend to prove our Moderator and clerks in the right ; and that they , taking offence at the primary and inferior tribunal , never presented their case regularly for rejection . The plaintiffs have taken the ground , that an error of the clerks made them the true General Assembly , and dismembered and destroyed our body . But they want to go farther than this , and show a bad motive , which , they say , must have actuated our party . /z/ Judge Rogers . This evidence seems to me to be exactly of the same kind with that already admitted . Mr. Huhhe.ll . For the purpose for which the other testimony was received , we have no objection that this should be admitted . We conceived it to be the right and duty of our opponents to build up an Assembly . But how is this to be done ? By showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian Church ? This is conceded . Whether admitted constitutionally , or not , is another thing . But they can not be allowed to show that the proceedings of 1837 are a poor reason for those of 1838 ; that our defence is a poor defence . Let us be masters of our own defence . Mr. - Ingersoll . I should like to know for what purpose Mr. Randall offers the evidence . It may be that he has two objects . If offered to prove the admission of these Synods , it is proper , or , at least , only irrelevant . If to prove their rejection , it is inadmissible . Judge Rogers . What is the object of the testimony , Mr. Randall ? Mr. Randall . May it please your Honor , our object is to show the state of the General Assembly in 1837 ; that these Synods were then in good standing , and incorporated as a part of the Presbyterian Church , under the Constitution of 1831 . Then to follow this up , by showing an act of dismemberment , begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Moderator , which defeated the organization , and made it void and nugatory , whereby- we became the true General Assembly But we can not prove more than one link at a time . The links are independent of each other , except as to order . Judge Rogers . Mr. Hubbell , you may go on . Mr. Hubbell . May it please your Honor , we do not pretend that the act of the clerks was a mistake . Our opponents can not , then , bring evidence to prove that it was not a mistake  --  that it was the result of deliberate design . If they prove that certain commissions were presented to the clerks , and by them refused ; that then a resolution in regard to them was offered , and , this resolution being declared out of order , an appeal was taken from the Moderator 's decision , but that the Moderator refused to put the appeal  --  if all this be shown , they have laid the basis of their superstructure . They must not anticipate our defence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , then our trustees , appointed before that time , are entitled to their places . This supposition would defeat the issue chosen by the other party . They admit , therefore , that those elected trustees in 1837 , even after the acts complained of , were lawfully elected . If , on the other hand , no dismemberment is alleged , what can be the effect of the testimony offered ? The Assembly of 1838 was an entirely independent body , having full power to judge of the qualifications of its own members . The rejection complained of was not influenced by the proceedings of 1837 , except as they furnish us a reason  --  an excuse , if we choose to avail ourselves of it , for the purpose of defence . The other party themselves contend , that the proceedings of the Assembly of 1338 should not have been influenced by those of 1837 . They say , that the latter were void , except as merely advisory or recommendatory , and that therefore the rejection of commissioners in 1838 was bad . We will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will not allow our case to be mangled and distorted . Judge Rogers . I do not like to decide , at this stage of the proceedings , whether the testimony offered involves the merits of the case or not . It may be admitted now , and the point be decided hereafter . Mr. Ingersoll . I should like to say half a dozen words in explanation , even if the testimony be admitted . If it go to prove the same points as that offered yesterday it is merely irrelevant . If the other point , which I have mentioned , it will produce serious evil , by raising a false , a prejudicial , and a dangerous issue . There were two courses for the New-school party to take . They might have issued a mandamus , and thus have established their rights , if unjustly deprived of them . TJiey did not choose , however , to try that remedy , but met in Ranstead Court , determined on a bolder measure . Here they did not proceed regularly , but , having reached a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did they secede properly ? Under this quo warranto the remedy selected , they must show their title . Again , they say that we did things irregularly in the Assembly of 1837 , and therefore ask the assistance of the Court to oust us . But the Assembly of 1837 was entirely dissolved . Look at the provision on this subject , in the Form of Government , Chap . XII . Sect. 8 . " Each session of the Assembly shall be opened and closed with prayer . And the whole business of the Assembly being finished , and the vote taken for dissolving the present Assembly , the Moderator shall say from the chair  --  ' By virtue of the authority delegated to me , by the Church , let this General Assembly be dissolved , and I do hereby dissolve it , and require another General Assembly , chosen in the same manner , to meet at , on the day of A. D. , '  --  after which he shall pray and return thanks , and pro- nounce on those present the apostolic benediction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not an adjournment , nor yet a curia advisare vult , as in the practice of the Supreme Court . Therefore , as to that Assembly , there was an end of every thing . Now , if any members had been unjustly excluded from the Assembly of 1837 , they should have applied for re-admission in 1838 . But , instead of this , they chose to secede ; and here , they must prove , not that the proceedings of 1837 were void , but that their secession was proper . We say , that they were not excluded from the General Assembly of 1838 : they never sought admission . That Assembly never had an opportunity to decide on their case . Judge Rogers . It is one link in the testimony . AVe must have the proceedings of 1837 , to explain those of 1838 . Mr. Randall , then read the testimony offered . Min .

" Saturday morning . May 21th.  --  Agreeably to notice , given last evening , Mr. Breckinridge moved that a committee of ten members , of whom an equal number shall /q/ be from the majority and minority of the vote on the resolutions to cite inferior judicatories , be appointed on the state of the Church . " Dr. Junkin and Mr. Evving , on the part of the majority , and Messrs . A. Campbell and Jesup , on the part of the minority , were appointed to nominate each five members of the committee on the ' foregoing resolutions . " Dr. Junkin and Mr. Campbell , from the committees to nominate the Committee of Ten on the State of the Church , respectfully reported the following- nomination , viz ; Mr. Breckinridge , Dr. Alexander , Dr. Cuyler , Dr. VVitherspoon , and Mr. Ewmg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beman , Dr. Peters , Mr. Dickinson , and Mr. Jesup , on the part of the mmority . The report was adopted ; and the committee was directed to meet in the house at the rising of the Assembly this morning , and afterwards on their own adjournments . " On motion , the Assembly engaged m prayer on behalf of this committee , and of the subject referred . to them . " Tuesday morning , May Zth.  --  The Committee on the State of the Church rejlorted , by their chairman , Dr. Alexander , that they had not been able to agree , and asked to be discharged . " Both portions of the committee then made separate reports , accompanied by various papers ; which reports and papers were ordered to be entered upon the Minutes of the Assembly , and are as follows , viz : ' report of the committee of the majority . " The Committee of the Majority , from the United Committee on the State of the Church , beg leave to report : " That having been unable to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imm'diate and voluntary separation of the New and Old-school parties in the Presbyterian Church , they lay before the General Atsen.bly the papers which passed between the committees , and wiiich contain all the important proceedmgs of both bodies . ' ' - These papers are marked 1 to -5 of the majority , and 1 to 4 of the minority . A careful examination of them will show that the twocsimmiltees were agreed in the following matters , namely : " 1 . The propriety of a voluntary separation of the parties in our church ; and their separate organization . " 2 . As to the corporate funds , the names to be held by each denomination , the Records of the Church , and its Boards and Institutions . " It will further appear , that the committees were entirely unable to agree , on the following points , namely : " 1 . As to the propriety of entering at once , by the Assembly , upon the division , or the sending down of the question to the Presbyteries. " 2 . As to the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed by the majority ; or the necessity ' of obtaining a change in the constitution of the Church . " 3 . As to the breaking up of the succession of this General Assembly , so that neither of the new Assemblies proposed , to be considered this proper body continued ; or that the body which should retain the name and institutions of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America , should be held in fact and law , to be the true successors o ( this body . While the Committee of the Majority were perfectly disposed to do all that the utmost liberality could demand , and to use in all cases such expressions as should be wholly unexceptionable ; yet it appeared to us indispensable to take our final stand on these grounds . " For , first , we are convinced that if any thing tending towards a voluntary separation is done , it is absolutely necessary to do it effectually , and at once . Secondly . As neither party professes any desire to alter any constitutional rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but absurd , to send down an overture to the Presbyteries on this subject . We believe moreover that full power exists in the Assembly , either by consent of parties , or in the way of discipline , to settle this , and all such cases ; and that its speedy settlement is greatly to be desired . " Thirdly , In regard to the succession of the General Assembly , this committee could not , in present circumstances , consent to any thing that should even imply the final dissolution of the Presbyterian church , as now organized in this country ; which idea , it will be observed , 1r at the basis of the plan of the minority ; insomuch that even /z/ the body retaining the name and institutions should not be considered the successor of this body . " Finally . It will be observed fr-m our fifth paper , as compared with the fourth paper of the Minority 's Commiltee , that the final shape which their proposal assumed , was such , that it was impossible for the majority of the house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as it might . For if the house should vote for the plan of the Committee of the Majority , the other committee would not consider itself , or its friends , bound thereby : and voluntary division would therefore be impossible , in that case . But if the house should vote for the minority 's plan , then  --  the foregoing insuperable objections to that plan being supposed to be surmounted  --  still the whole case would be put off , perhaps indefinitely . " A. Alexander , C. C. Cuyler , J. Witherspoon , N. Ewing , R. J. Breckinridge. " /z/ " The subscribers , appointed members of the Committee of Ten on the State of the Church , respectfully ask leave to report , as follows : " It being understood that one object of the appointment of said committee was to consider the expediency of a voluntary division of the Presbyterian Church , and to devise a plan for the same , they , in connexion with the other members of the committee , have had the subject under deliberation . " The subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church existed , as some of their brethren supposed , and that the consequences of division would be greatly to be deprecated . Such necessity , however , being urged by many of our brethren , we have been induced to yield to their wishes , and to admit the expediency of a division , provided the same could be accomplished in an amicable , equitable , and proper manner . We have accordingly submitted the following propositions to our brethren on the other part of the same committee , who at the same time submitted to us their proposition , which is annexed to this report . * ' Here read the Proposition marked Minority No. 1 , and Majority No. 1 . " Being informed by the other members of the committee , that they had concluded not to discuss in committee the propositions which should be submitted , and that all propositions on both sides were to be in writing , and to be answered in writing , the following papers passed between the two parts of the committee : Here read , No. 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 3 , Minority " 4 , Majority " 4 , Minority " 5 , Majority " " From these papers it will be seen , that the only question of any importance upon which the commiltee differed , was that proposed to be submitted to the decision of the Assembly , as preliminary to any action upon the details of either plan . Therefore , believing that the members of this Assembly have neither a constitutional nor moral right to adopt a plan for a division of the Church , in relation to which they are entirely uninstructed by the Presbyteries ; believing that the course proposed by their brethren of the committee to be entirely inefficacious , and calculated to introduce confusion and discord into the whole Church , and instead of mitigating , to enhance the evils which it proposes to remove ; and regarding the plan proposed by themselves , with the modifications thereof as before stated , as presenting in general the only safe , certain and constitutional mode of division , the subscribers do respectfully present the same to the Assembly for their adoption or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Absalom Peters , B. Dickinson , William Jesup . " " No. 1 , OF THE MAJORITY . " The portion of the committee which represents the majority , submit for considera-tion : " 1 . That the peace and prosperity of the Presbyterian Church in the United States , require a separation of the portions called respectively the Old and New-school parties , and represented by the majority and minority in the present Assembly . /z/ " 2 . That the portion of the church represented by the majority in the present General Assembly , ought to retain the name and the corporate property of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . * ' 3 . That the two parties ought to form separate denominations , under separate organizations ; that to effect this with the least delay , the commissioners in the present General Assembly shall elect which body they will adhere to , and this election shall decide the position of their Presbyteries respectively for the present ; that every Presbytery may reverse the decision of its present commissioners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that body properly expressed ; that minorities of Presbyteries , if large enough , or if net , then in connexion with the neighboring minorities , may form new Presbyteries , or attach themselves to existing Presbyteries in union with either body , as shall be agreed on ; that Synods ought to take order and make election on the general principles already stated ; and minorities of Synods should follow out the rule suggested for minorities of Presbyteries , as far as they are applicable . " No. 1 , OF THE MINORITY . " Whereas , the experience of many years has proved that this body is too large to answer the purposes contemplated by the constitution , and there appears to be insuperable obstacles in the way of reducing the representation : " And whereas , in the extension of the church over so great a territory , embracing such a variety of people , difference of view in relation to important points of church policy and action , as well as theological opinion , are found to exist : " Now , it is believed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall act independently of each other , will be of vital importance to the best interests of the Redeemer 's kingdom . " Therefore , Resolved , That the following rules be sent down to the Presbyteries for their adoption or rejection as constitutional rules , to wit : " 1 . The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United Slates of America shall be , and , it is hereby divided into two bodies : the one thereof to be called the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United Stales of America , and the other , the General Assembly of the American Presbyterian Church . " 2 . That the Confession of Faith and form of government of the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America , as it now exists , shall continue to be the Conlession of Faith and form of government of both bodies , until it shall be constitutionally changed and altered by either , in the manner prescribed therein . " 3 . That in sending up their commissioners to the next General Assembly , each Presbytery , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form now prescribed , shall add thereto as follows : " That in case a majority of the Presbyteries shall have voted to adopt the plan for organizing two General Assemblies , we direct our said commissioners to attend the meeting of the General Assembly of the ' Presbyterian Church of the United States of America , ' or the ' American Presbyterian Church , ' as the case may be . " And after the opening of the next General Assembly , and before proceeding to other business than the usual preliminary organization , the said Assembly shall ascertain what is the vote of the Presbyteries , and in case a majority of said Presbyteries shall have adopted these rules , then the two General Assemblies shall be constituted and organized in the manner now pointed out in the form of government , by the election of their respective moderators , stated clerks , and other officers . " 4 . The several Presbyteries shall be deemed and taken to belong to that Assenibly with which they shall direct their commissioners to meet , as stated in the preceding rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , as aforesaid , organize the Presbyteries belonging to each into Synods . And in case any Presbytery shall fail to decide as aforesaid at that time , they may attach themselves within one year thereafter to the Assembly they shall prefer . " 5 . Churches and members of churches , as well as Presbyteries , shall be at full liberty to decide to which of said Assemblies they will be attached , and in case the majority of male members in any church shall decide to belong to a Presbytery connected with the Assembly to which their Presbytery is not attached , they shall certify the same to the Stated Clerk of the Presbytery which they wish to leave and the one with which they wish to unite , and they shall , ipso facto , be attached to such Presbytery . " 6 . It shall be the duty , of Presbyteries , at their first meeting after the adoption of these rules , or within one*year thereafter , to grant certificates of dismission to such /z/ ministers , licentiates , and students , as may wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly . " 7 . It shall be the duty of churcfh sessions to grant letters of dismission to such of their members , being in regular standing , as may apply for the same within one year after the organization of said Assemblies under these rules , for the purpose of uniting with any church attached to a Presbytery under the care of the other General Assembly ; and if such session refuse to dismiss , it shall be lawful for such members to unite with such other church in the same manner as if a certificate were given . " 8 . The Boards of Education and Missions shall continue their organizations as heretofore , until the next meeting of the Assembly ; and in case the rules for the division of the Assembly be adopted , those Boards shall be , and hereby are transferred to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America , if that Assembly at its first meeting shall adopt the Boards as their organizations ; and the seats of any ministers or elders in those Boards , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vacant . " 9 . The records of the Assembly shall remain in the hands of the present Stated Clerk , for the mutual use and benefit of both General Assemblies , until , by such an arrangement as they may adopt , they shall appoint some other person to take charge of the same . And either Assembly , at their own expense , may cause such extracts and copies to be mdde thereof , as they may desire and direct , " 10 . The Princeton Seminary funds to be transferred to the Board of Trustees of the seminary , if it can be so done legally and without forfeiting the trusts upon which the grants were made ; and if it can not be done legally , and according to the intention of the donors , then to remain with the present Board of Trustees until legislative authority be given for such transfer .

" Pass a resolution suspending the operation of the controverted votes until after the next Assembly . - ' No. 2 , OF THE MINORITY . " The Committee of the Minority , &c.,; make the following objections to the proposition of the majority : " 1 . To any recognition of the terms , " Old and New-schools , " or " majority and minority , " of the present Assembly , in any action upon the subject of division , the minority expect the division in every respect to be equal ; no other would be satisfactory . " 2 . Insisting upon an equal division , we are willing that that portion of the church which shall choose to retain the present Boards , shall have the present name of the Assembly . The corporate property which is susceptible of division to be divided , as the only fair and just course . " 3 . We object to the power of the commissioners to make any division at this time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 2 , OF THE MAJORITY . " The Committee of the Majority , having considered the paper submitted by that of the minority , observe : " 1 . That they suppose the propriety and neccfsity of a division of the church may be considered as agreed on by both committees ; but we think it not expedient to attempt giving reasons in a preamble ; the preamble is therefore not agreed to . " 2 . So much of No. 1 , of the plan of the Committee of the Minority , as relates to the proposed names of the new General Assemblies , is agreed to . " 3 . Nos. 1 to 8 , inclusive , except as above , are not agreed to , but our proposition . No. 3 , in our first paper , is insisted on . But we agree to the proposal in regard to single churches , individual ministers , licentiates , students , and private members . " 4 . In lieu of No. 9 , we propose that the present Stated Clerk be directed to makeout a complete copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the new bodies , and after causing the copy to be examined and certified , deliver it to the wrttten order of the Moderator and Stated Clerk of the General Assembly of the American Presbyterian* Church , /q/ " 5 , We agree , in substance , to the proposal in No. 10 , and offer the following as the form in which the proposition shall stand ; that the corporate funds and property of the church , so far as they appertain to the Tlieological Seminary at Princeton , or relate to the Professors ' support , or the education of beneficiaries there , shall remain the property of the body retaining the name of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America ; that all other funds shall be equally divided between the new bodies , so far as it can be done in conformity with the intentions of the donors ; and that all liabilities of the present Assembly shall be discharged in equal portions by them ; that all questions relating to the future adjustment of this whole subject upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed by the new Assemblies at their first meeting respectively ; and if these committees can not agree , then , each committee shall select one arbitrator , and these two , a third , which arbitrators shall have full power to settle finally the whole case in all its parts ; and that no person shall be appointed an arbitrator , who is a member of either church ; it being distinctly understood that whatever difficulties may arise in the construction of trusts , and all other q'uestioris of power , as well as right , legal and equitable , shall be finally decided by the committees , so as in all cases to prevent an appeal by either party to the legal tribunals of the country . " No. 3 , OF THE MINORITY . " 1 . We accede to the proposition to have no preamble . " 2 . We accede to the proposition No. 4 , modifying our proposition No. 9 , in relation to the records and copies of the records . The copy to be made within one year after the division . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by No. 5 of the propositions submitted , with a trifling alteration in the phraseology , striking out the words , " shall remain the property of the body retaining the name of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America , " and inserting the words , " shall be transferred and belong to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America , hereby constituted . " " 4 . We can not assent to any division by the present commissioners of the Assembly , as it would in no wise be obligatory on any of the judicatories of the church , or any members of the churches . The only effect would be a disorderly dissolution of the present Assembly , and be of no binding force or effect upon any member who did not assent to it . " 5 . We propose a resolution to be appended to the Rules , and which we believe , if adopted by the committee , would pass with great unanimity , urging in strong terms the adoption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority side of the committee pledge themselves to use their influence to procure the adoption of the same by the Presbyteries . " No. 3 , OF THE MAJORITY . " The Committee of the Majority , in relation to paper No. 2 , observe : " 1 . That the terms ' Old and New-3chool , majority and minority , ' are meant as descriptive , and some description being necessary , we see neither impropriety nor unsuitableness in them . " 2 . Our previous paper No. 2 , having , as we suppose , substantially acceded to the proposal of the minority in relation to the funds in their first paper , we deem any further statement on that subject unnecessary . " 3 . That we see no difficulty in the way of settling the matter at present , subject to the revision of the Presbyteries , as provided in our first paper , under the third head ; and as " no constitutional rules " are proposed in the way of altering any principles of our system , we see no constitutional obstacle to the execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plan nsour final proposal . But if the commissioners of any Presbytery should refuse to elect , or be equally divided , then the Presbytery which they represent shall make such election at its first meeting after the adjournment of the present General Assembly .

" The Commillee of the Minority , in reply to paper No. 3 , of the majority , observe : " That they will unite in a report ' to the Assembly , stating that the committee have agreed that it is expedient that a division of the Church be effected , and , in general , upon the principles upon which it is to be carried out , but they differ as to the manner of effecting it . " On the one hand , it is asked that a division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting ; and on the other hand , that the plan of division , with the subsequent arrangement and organization , shall be submitted to the Presbyteries for their adoption or rejection . " They will unite in asking the General Assembly to decide the above points previous to reporting the details , and in case the Assembly decide in favor of immediate division , then the paper No. 1 , of the majority , with the modifications agreed on , be taken as the basis of the report in detail , " If the Assembly decide to send to the Presbyteries , then No. 1 , of the minority 's papers , with the modifications agreed on , shall be the basis of the report in detail . " The Committee of the Minority can not agree to any otiier propositions than those already submitted , until the above be settled by the Assembly .

" No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Majority , &c.,; in answer to No. 4 , &c,,; reply , that understanding from the verbal explanations of the Committee of the Minority , that the said committee would not consider either side bound by the vote of the Assembly , if it were against their views and wishes respectively on the point proposed to be submitted to its decision in said paper , to carry out in good faith a scheme which , in that case , could not be approved by them ; and under such circumstances a roZimto-y separation being manifestly impossible , this committee consider No. 4 of the minority as virtually a waver of the whole subject . If nothing further remains to be proposed , they submit that the papers be laid before the Assembly , and that the united Committee be dissolved .

" 2 . When it shall appear to the satisfaction of the General Assembly , that any new Presbytery has been formed for the purpose of unduly increasing the representation , the General Assembly will , by a vote of the majority , refuse to receive the delegates of Presbyteries so formed , and may direct the Synod to which such Presbytery belongs , to reunite it to the Presbytery or Presbyteries to which the members were before attached .

After further debate the resolutions were carried . /q/ " Tuesday afternoon .  --  A protest , signed by the commissioners from the Synods of Genesee , Geneva , and Utica , against the resolutions of this Assembly declaring those Synods to be out of the Presbyterian Church , was received , read , and referred to Dr. Witherspoon , Mr. Murray , and Dr. Simpson  --  to be answered . " Mr. Breckinridge offered the following resolutions , viz. " Be it resolved , by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America , " 1 .

The other plans propose the communion of particular churches ; the friendly interchange of ministerial services ; and a correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall now proceed to examine the Rev. Dr. William Patton , of New York . This is going out of the regular order of testimony ; but Dr. Patton is obliged to leave the city , and therefore requests to be examined now . Before proceeding to the evidence of Dr. Patton , it will be well to give the reader some idea of the localities to which that evidence will introduce him . The Seventh Presbyterian Church in the city of Philadelphia  - -  the Tabernacle , as it is usually called  --  is situated in the interior of a closely built square , and is approached by an alley named Ranstead Court , which , running west from Fourth Street , terminates at a gate in the southeast corner of the church yard . The house stands north and south ; and at these two ends is directly abutted by adjoining structures , so that there is no communication between a narrow strip of pavement , which skirts the eastern side of the building , forming a right angle with Ranstead Court , and a larger piece of ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave-yard , but through the building itself , at each end of which is a small vestibule , separated by partition from the body of the house , being little more than a passage from this grave-yard to the eastern pavement . From the northern vestibule three large doors open into the church , upon as many aisles running north and south , and extending its whole length . There are two double blocks of pews between the middle and side aisles , and east and west of the latter , are ranges of single pews along the wall . From the southern vestibule , or session-room , two small doors open into the church , one on each side of the pulpit , between which and the front of the pews , is an open space , or area , in which , during the meetings of the Assembly , many of the members usually sit . There are also two doors into the church , one on the east , and the other on the west side , so situated that a straight line drawn between them would fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short passages from these doors open into the side aisles before mentioned . The galleries of the church , to which one stair-case opening on the outside , near the east door of the northern vestibule , and another from the vestibule itself , ascend , and which may also be entered at the other end of the church , by the pulpit stairs , extend round the whole building ; but the portions of them adjoining the pulpit , being separated from the rest by partition , are usually unoccupied during the session of the Assembly . In the north end of the gallery is an organ . Dr. William Patton , sworn . I was a commissioner from the Third Presbytery of New York , to the General Assembly of 1838 . I attended in the church in Ranstead Court , on the third Thursday of May , at the hour designated for the opening of the Assembly . Immediately after the introductory exercises and sermon , by the previous Moderator , Dr. Elliott , he gave notice that after the prayer which he would offer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing of that prayer , I rose and addressed the Moderator , calling him by his official title , and stated to him that I wished to offer certain resolutions , a copy of which resolutions I hold in my hand . The copy in the printed minutes is a correct one . I rose asking permission to read them . The Moderator declared them out of order , as the first business was the formation of the roll . I stated to the Moderator that the resolutions had reference to that very business , that I was desirous to present them , and would do so without comment or remark . The Moderator declaring me out of order , I took an appeal from his decision . The Moderator declared that appeal to be out of order . I then took my seat . Mr. Randall . Please to read the resolutions contained in the paper which you hold in your hand . Mr. Hubbell . I object to the reading of them . May it please your Honour , this paper was not read to the Assembly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a part of the res gestae , the contents of it are not . We did not know , at that time , what were the contents of the paper , and non constat , but that if we had known we should have acted differently . If at any subsequent stage of the proceedings , it was read to us , then when we come to the witness 's testimony in regard to that fact , perhaps there will be no objection to the contents being made known to the court and jury . Judge Rogers overruled the objection , and allowed the paper to be read , which was accordingly done by Dr. Patton , as follows : " Whereas the General Assembly of 1837 adopted certain resolutions intended to deprive certain Presbyteries of the right to be represented in the General Assembly ;  - -  and whereas , the more fully to accomplish their purpose , the said Assembly of 1837 did require and receive from their clerks a pledge or promise , that they would , in making out the Roll of Commissioners to constitute the General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioners from said Presbyteries ;  --  and whereas the said Clerks , having been requested by Commissioners from the said Presbyteries to receive their Commissions and enter their names on the Roll of the General Assembly of 1838 , now about to be organized , have refused to receive and enter the same ;  --  There-fore , " 1 . Resolved , That such attempts on the part of the General Assembly of 1837 and their Clerks , to direct and control the organization of the General Assembly of 1838 , are unconstitutional , and in derogation of its just rights as the general representative judicatory of the whole Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . " 2 . Resolved , That the General Assembly can not be legally constituted except by admitting to seats and to equality of powers , in the first instance , all Commissioners , who present the usual evidences of their appointment ; and that it is the duty of the Clerks , and they are hereby directed , to form the Roll of the General Assembly of 1838 , by including therein the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian Church , not omitting the Commissioners from the several Presbyteries within the bounds of the Synods of Utica , Geneva , Genesee , and the Western Reserve ; and in all things to form the said Roll according to the known practice and established usage of previous General Assemblies . " After the reading of the paper had commenced Mr. Hubbell objected that it was not an original . Dr. Patton testified that the original had been given to Dr. Erskine Mason , and the opposite counsel offering to call Dr. Mason to account for it , the objection was waved . Dr. Patton . These are the resolutions which I offered at the time . My appeal was seconded . The Moderator declared the appeal out of /z/ order , and directed the clerks to proceed with the reporting of the rolL Thereupon Mr. Krebs , the Permanent Clerk , rose and proceeded , omitting the names of Commissioners from the exscinded Synods . At the close of that report the Moderator announced that if there were any commissioners whose names had not been reported , then was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Dr. Mason , a commissioner also from the Third Presbytery of New York , rose , and first stating the fact , that the names of the commissioners from within the bounds of the exscinded Synods had not been entered on the roll , then moved , that their names should be added to it , at the same time holding foi'th as a tender the commissions , saying here they were , and stating that they had been rejected by the clerks . The Moderator declared that motion to be out of order . Dr. Mason then said , that , with great respect for the chair , he must appeal from his decision . This appeal was seconded . The Moderator refused to put the appeal , declaring it to be out of order . Dr. Mason then took his seat . There was an inquiry made by the Moderator , from what Presbytery these commissions came . Dr. Mason replied that they came from the Synods named in his resolution  --  Utica , Geneva , Genesee , and Western Reserve . After Dr. Mason had answered where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of order . I do not remember that any thing more was said at that time . Immediately after Dr. Mason took his seat , the Rev. Miles P. Squier , from the Presbytery of Geneva , rose , and said that he had presented his commission to the clerks , and they had refused to receive it , and that he now rose to claim his seat upon that floor , or words to that effect . The Moderator asked him from what Presbytery he came . He said from the Presbytery of Geneva . The Moderator then asked him if that Presbytery was within the bounds of the Synod of Geneva . Mr. Squier answered that it was . The Moderator then said , " We do not know you , " whereupon Mr. Squier took his seat . Immediately after that , the Rev. John P. Cleaveland , a commissioner from the Presbytery of Detroit , rose , and , after a few introductory remarks , moved that the Rev. Dr. N. S. S. Beman , of the Presbytery of Troy , be Moderator . That motion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a large majority , very few voting in the negative . Dr. Beman then called the attention of the house to business , and Dr. Mason and Mr. E. W. Gilbert , were nominated as Clerks , and were elected . No other nomination for clerks was made . Dr. Beman stated that the next business would be the election of the Moderator , and the Rev. Samuel Fisher , D. D. of the Presbytery of Newark was nominated , and no other person was put in nomination but Dr. Fisher . The vote was then taken and Dr. Fisher was declared to be duly elected . My own recollection is that the vote was unanimous ; there were no negatives . It was taken viva voce . Dr. Beman then addressed Dr. Fisher , stating to him that he was duly elected Moderator of the General Assembly , and that he should govern himself by the rules that should be adopted by the house . It is usual for the General Assembly to adopt rules for its own government . Dr. Fisher then took the place occupied by Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Gilbert were chosen clerks . No others were nominated . They were nominated together , and voted for together . A motion was then made to adjourn to meet in the lecture-room of the First Presbyterian Ciuircli . It was put and carried /q/ unanimously ; that is , there were no votes in the negative . It was put viva voce , as all the motions were put . Dr. Fisher then announced , that the Assembly had adjourned to meet forthwith in the lecture-room of the First Presbyterian Church , and that if any commissioners had not handed in their commissions to the clerks , they should do so immediately at that place . We went to the First Presbyterian Church , arid attended to the business of the Assembly in a very affectionate and brotherly manner . Immediately on our assembling at the First Church , I renewed my offer of the resolutions before offered , and they were unanimously adopted by the Assembly , as containing their views . A Committee of Commissions was then appointed , to whom informal commissions were referred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the First Church . Court adjourned . THURSDAY MORNING , March 7th  --  10 o'clock . Dr. Paiton , ( in coniimtation . ) The motions for the Moderator were made and put in an audible voice , to be heard throughout the house . Dr. Elliott occupied a chair immediately in front of the pulpit , and Dr. Beman , when he officiated as temporary Moderator , took his place in the middle aisle , about one third or one half of the way down the aisle , north of the pulpit . There were some voices in the negative , on some of the motions . These negatives , as nearly as I could judge from the sound , came from the south-west portion of the church . That was the part of the house where the Old-school sat : they occupied that portion , and also a portion on the left and front of the pulpit  --  that is the south-east part of the house . During the time that I occupied the floor , in endeavouring to get the reading of the resolutions I wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order ! " proceeding from gentlemen in the general neighborhood of the Moderator . When Dr. Mason was on the floor , similar cries of " Order ! " were repeated , from the same quarter of the house , and were more continued than when I was on the floor . Shortly after Mr. Cleaveland rose , the calls to order were much more vociferous , and were accompanied with frequent coughing , scraping of the feet on the floor , and some very emphatic hisses , also proceeding from the same quarter of the house , with the obvious intention , as appeared to me , of preventing the progress of business . After the notice of adjournment was given by Dr. Fisher , there was considerable noise in the galleries of the church . This noise consisted of clapping , expressive of approbation , intermingled with some hisses , making the light and shadow of the picture . These are the material points , in regard to which my memory serves me . Spectators only , I presume were in the gallery . There were no members there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in the galleries . A mixed company of ladies and gentlemen was there . I think ample opportunity was given to every commissioner to vote upon the motions put by the Moderator . After our adjournment from the church in Ranstead Court , the body in the First Presbyterian Church , was in session about two weeks . Every day the full roll of all who had reported commissions , at any stage of the organization , was called . The roll embraced all the commissioners , as well those whose seats had , as those whose seats had rrot been disputed . That body went into the election of new trustees . /z/ On suggestion of Mr. Hubhell , the election of such trustees being a recorded proceeding , the examination on this subject was waved . Cross-examined by Mr. Hubbell . I can not say with absolute certainty who seconded Dr. Mason 's motion . My own impression is that it was Dr. Dickinson , Professor in Lane Seminary . I gather this from general familiarity with the tones of his voice , and from his sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Mason 's appeal . Our roll was called very soon after we retired to the First Presbyterian Church . We called it for the purpose of having it complete . I can not answer with accuracy how many responded to that call , as I kept no account at the time . I should say rising one hundred ; or say in the general neighborhood of a hundred and seventeen , or from that to a hundred and twenty . This number included those whose right was disputed . The exscinded I understand by the disputed . This was the first time of the calling of the roll after Mr. Cleaveland 's motion . We do not recognise that there was any new organization . I was sitting in the same pew with Mr. Cleaveland when he made his motion . His face was turned toward Dr. Elliott , when he made the remarks preliminary to his motion , and in the same direction when he made the motion . When he put the question , his face was turned the same way . He did not , at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back or side toward the Moderator . I have no recollection that there was any gathering or crowding* of persons round him , during either his remarks , or the making of his motion . He did not call the Moderator by name , but looking toward him , addressed his remarks and put his motion to the house , a large portion of which was between himself and the Moderator . These remarks stated , that a number of the Commissioners to the Assembly of 1S38 had been refused their seats , and that learned counsel had informed us , that the constitutional organization of the General Assembly of 183S could not be effected , or secured , except at that time and place . He then made a remark something of this kind , that in view of this position , he hoped it would not be considered discourteous , to proceed with the organization of the Assembly , and offered his resolution , and put it to the house , as has been already detailed . Dr. Beman , when called to the chair , took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleaveland . My impression is that he had been before seated in the same pew with Mr. Cleaveland , or in a contiguous one . He had no chair in the aisle  --  he stood up . Dr. Fisher , when chosen Moderator , took the same place , and also stood up . Drs . Beman and Fisher , when they occupied this place , both looked toward the pulpit . I should think it probable there were other persons , besides members , on the floor , for the church was well filled . No measures were taken to prevent these from voting , or to ascertain that they did not vote : nothing of this kind was suspected . While Dr. Beman and Dr. Fisher held the place mentioned . Dr. Elliott remained in the chair where he had been before , now shorn of his office . Mr. Hubbell . Did Dr. Elliott admit that he had been shorn of his office . Dr. Patton . I presume not . I believe he continued to sit where he had before , until we had adjourned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as already stated . He also called Dr. Mason /q/ to order , and Mr. Cleaveland , frequently using the little hammer that is put into the moderator 's hand . I do not know that this hammer is a badge of office ; it is not always used . In some Assemblies where I have been , the Moderator has used his cane  --  I do not mean to strike the members . I do not know to whom this hammer belongs , unless it is the property of the General Assembly . Dr. Beman had no hammer , nor did he use a cane . I did not hear Dr. Beman call Dr. Elliott to order . Dr. Elliott had ceased calling to order , and had ceased rapping with the mallet , before Dr. Beman 's election . That part of the Assembly , called the Old-school party , I am not able to say , took any part in the proceedings after Dr. Beman took the chair , except by their silence . The cries of order , and the coughing and hissing ceased after Mr. Cleaveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What part of the house was occupied by the New-school members ? Dr. Patton . The house had been occupied nearly to the hour of religious service , by a convention of what are termed Old-school men , sitting with closed doors , and admitting no body to their counsels , but those who would sustain their proceedings . Mr. Hubbell interrupted the witness , and objected to his speaking of matters of which he could not possibly have any direct knowledge . Mr. Randall . The witness is at liberty to say whether this fact came within " his own knowledge or not . Mr. Hubbdl repeated his question . Dr. Patton . The New-school party were located on such seats as they found vacant when they entered , which were at a considerable distance from the pulpit . A portion of them were around and behind Mr. Cleaveland , in the north part of the church , and in that general neighbourhood . I did know , at the time accurately , how many persons the entire roll called after the adjournment contained . I can not state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , two persons ' names on that roll , who did not arrive in the city until after our adjournment . Neither Dr. Beman nor Dr. Fisher demanded possession of the chair , or of the hammer , from Dr. Elliott . I have seen the depositions of Dr. Beman and Mr. Cleaveland , since this visit to the city . I have read them  --  this I mean by saying I have seen them . Our proceedings were the result of a concerted plan , and not the suggestion of the moment . There was previous consultation as to the manner in which an ex parte organization of the Assembly might be prevented , and a constitutional one secured . This arrangement was not made in consequence of our knowing that we should be in a minority in that Assembly , nor from an apprehension that we would be . It was to maintain the Constitution inviolate . We had no knowledge whether we should be in the minority or majority , and could have had none until all the commissions were received . I think there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this we knew as matter of history , and not of prophecy . I think I have already answered whether it might have been matter of anticipation . The meeting of consultation , to arrange this proceeding , was held in the lecture room of the First Presbyterian Church . It commenced its session on the Monday evening preceding the meeting of the Assembl , on an invitation to all the commissioneBS to attend a meeting for consultation . I do not /z/ know how many attended . The clerks of the meeting are present and can say how many . The invitation was given through the pubHe newspapers . I have a copy of it here , as it was published . Dr. Patton produced a printed paper , in the form of a circular , from which he read the following . " Important Document .  --  We request the attention of Ministers and Elders , to the following notice : " Commissioners to the General Assembly o/1838.  --  A Meeting for Consultation .

" ( fc5 N. B. Editors of religious papers are requested to copy the above . " ' We give the notice as inserted in the Philadelphia Observer , and as afterwards read to the jury . Dr. Patton 's copy was without the names , and contained only the body of the notice . This copy has no date , but it took the date of the newspapers in which it was published . It was signed by some twenty clergymen , from differ* ent parts of the country , and was published in all the religious newspapers we could get it into . It was published in newspapers in this State , in New York State , and I think in Maryland ; and had as wide a circulation as could be given to it . Some who remained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of these , I recollect the Rev. Dr. Church , and the Rev. Wm . Bradford . I do not remember any others . I believe there were some others , but I can not identify them at this moment . The circular was signed by a number of gentlemen  --  about twenty I think . Dr. Dana , and Dr. Bemam signed it . The newspapers will show who the rest were . I think Dr. Fisher signed it . Dr. Skinner 's name was there , and also the name of Rev. Luther Halsey , formerly professor in the Western or Alleghany Town Seminary . He was not professor at that time . He was then located at Auburn in the State of New York . I do not recollect that Messrs . Church and Bradford signed it . I do not recollect that any of those who signed this paper sat in the Assembly under Dr. Plumer . There were some diversity of opinion in the debates , as to the best mode of securing the object ; but no diversity as ta the importance of forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minutes will show precisely what it is  --  and there was opposition to it , and considerable debate , which opposition , however , nearly disappeared before the end of the debate . There were various classical figures used , and among others it was said , by an eloquent gentleman present , that this measure was passing the Rubicon. /q/ Re-examined by Mr. Randall . Dr. Beman , I presume , is now in England . He left this country in the month of January ; I had the happiness of seeing him safe on board the vessel in which he sailed . Mr. Cleaveland lives , I think , in Marshall , in Michigan . Their depositions were handed tome to be read by yourself  --  ( Mr. Randall . ) No such thing as a stick or hammer is recognised in our Constitution . The Constitution is in itself strong enough . I and my friends , when we went into the house in Ranstead Court occupied the nearest vacant seats . We found those nearest the pulpit occupied by the Old-school party . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of that party in the morning , or that they sat with closed doors ; but I have no moral doubt that they were so sitting . I have been a minister of the Presbyterian Church about sixteen or seventeen years , and was forty years old last August It was the Rev. Jared Waterbury who spoke of our measures being the passage of the Rubicon . He afterwards acted with the Constitutional Assembly . The doors of the First Presbyterian Church were at all times open , and all the Commissioners to the General Assembly had an opportunity to take seats there . Yesterday I said I had handed my resolutions to the Stated Clerk , This was a mistake : I handed them to the Permanent Clerk . Judge William Jesup  --  sivorn . I was a commissioner to the General Assembly of 1837 , attended that body , and took an active part m its proceedings . I came from the Presbytery of Montrose , belonging to the Synod of New Jersey . So far as I know , this Presbytery has always been in that Synod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed , on motion of Mr. Breckinridge , to devise measures for the separation of the Church . Mr. Breckinridge was also a member of that committee . It met several times ; the two portions of which it was composed meeting sometimes separately , and sometimes together . Mr. Randall . Do you recollect whether any thing was said by any member of that committee , at the time when it was about to separate , in regard to the consequence of the refusal of the New-school members to accede to the terms proposed ? Mr. Hubbell . May it please your Honor , we object to the question . The proceedings of that committee were reduced to writing : the record has been produced , and speaks for itself . The various and conflicting propositions made by the opposite parties are all in writing , as well as the action of the house thereupon . The conversations of the different members of the committee converged in these records , and were ended by them , and , besides , are entirely foreign to this controversy . Indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Assembly of 1837 were admitted , so far merely as they related to the acts of excision ; but the other party saw fit to read the account of these efforts at compromise , and to this we did not object . It was matter of record , and , at most , immaterial and irrelevant . This is an attempt to go out of the record , and substitute for it the loose and idle conversations of individuals , of which we know nothing . They were ex-parte conversations , and no result followed them . The parties to this suit had nothing to do with them . Certain individuals , claiming to be trustees of the General Assembly , and asserting the right to oust those who now hold the office , seek to effect their purpose giving in evidence conversations , not with the /z/ trustees themselves , but between Judge Jesup and Mr. Breckinridge , These can have no more bearing on the case than any street conversations . Mr. Randall . We think this an important link in the chain of proof , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unfavorable to the cause of justice . Your Honor must connect the whole testimony  --  Judge Rogers . You had better present the question in writing , as it is an important one . Mr. Randall . I will put it in writing , and , to prevent delay , now offer in evidence " The Philadelphia Observer " of March 29th , 1838 , in which the notice of the consultation meeting , before mentioned by Dr. Patton , is to be found . This notice  --  the same as given above  --  was then read . Dr. Patton . Some of the persons whose names are appended to this notice are of the Old-school party  --  for example , the- Rev. T. S. Spencer . Mr. Hubbell asked for the piece of paper , which had been torn off from the top of that copy of the notice from which Dr. Pattoii had first read . Mr Randall produced it , and proposed to read it in evidence . It was , he said , a circular intended to accompany the notice . After looking at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected . Mr. Randall then - presented , in writing , the question which he proposed putting to Judge Jesup . His object was to prove , that , in the course of the negociations of the joint committee appointed by the General Assembly , as a part of the res gestx , Mr. Breckinridge declared , that if the New-school party did not accept the propositions of the Old-school , he would , the next day , in the General Assembly , move to exscind a sufficient number of Synods from the General Assembly to secure , thereafter , in that body , the predominance of the Old-school ; and that the other four ministers of this part of the joint committee assented to his declaration . Copies of the question having been given to the Court , and the opposite counsel . Mr. Randall , in defence of it remarked . Your Honour perceives from a perusal of that paper , that it relates to a declaration made in the meeting of the committee referred to . It is objected , that what we seek to prove is the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a total discrepancy between the course pursued by the Old-school party , and the real object which they had in view . The ex-parte declaration of Mr. Waterbury was admitted , and was gone into at some length ; and he was a gentleman not present during the proceedings of the Assembly of 1837 , and no party to them . Now , we seek to show the acts and declarations of a gentleman who moved for the appointment of this committee  --  who was the mouth piece , and  --  I say it without disrespect  --  the master-spirit of the Old-school . We wish to show a concerted plan , a conspiracy , to exclude certain Synods from all future participation in the rights and privileges of the Presbyterian Church . This is the leading feature of the case . These Synods were cut off without trial , or even notice . The great principle that none shall be condemned without a hearing was violated . I do not wish to state what are the contents of that paper , in the hearing of the jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have it before them . This is not only a part of the res gestse , but the very pivot  --  the corner stone of the whole investigation . On this declaration depends , for its character , the exclusion of the four Synods . A " motion was made to appoint a committee to agree upon terms of amicable division . That committee met , as the agents of the General Assembly . They reported , and their report was received . Then came the act of exclusion , or , as one of the counsel has said , not inappropriately , of detrusion . We now propose to show that after this abortive attempt at pacification , after the members of that committee had returned to the body , a menace was distinctly offered , and that the deed threatened Was afterwards consummated . This witness , holding in his hand the book , appealed to it , and asked for an accusation , and for trial . His appeal was met by a call for the previous question . The words of Omniscience to Adam were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Even he would not pass sentence upon poor , fallible man , without a hearing . But these reverend fathers of the Church , born and bred in its communion , have been detruded , unheard . This is the very gravamen of - the charge . No lawyer , at least , can misunderstand me , when I say , that the exclusion of these trustees , whom we claim to have superseded by our appointments , was not intended to fix any stain upon their christian character . Their amotion was with a view merely to try the rights of the respective parties . The high character of the man whose name has been put at the head of the newly appointed trustees , is a sufficient guarantee of the purity of our intentions . We wish only to try whether sixty thousand communicants , five hundred and ninety-nine churches , and five hundred ministers , can be detruded , without trial , or even the knowledge of any accusation . This is the ground of the present offer . I consider it the most interesting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit the question , hoping that your Honour will allow all the facts of the case to be developed . Mr. Wood . The question is , whether the evidence offered is material to the issue ; but a court will not nicely scan the nature of such evidence , and decide upon it , at this stage of the proceedings , but will rather admit it , and leave it to the jury . I will show how this testimony applies to the case . We proceeded to organize the General Assembly of 1838 , and must prove that that Assembly appointed new trustees . In the course of the organization , some unusual proceedings occurred . A Moderator and two clerks were removed , and others elected in their places . All this was done in the Assembly , and to prove that we were right in doing it is essential to our cause . We now want to show why we did it . Our reason was this : that there were several commissioners sent to the Assembly of 1838 , from certain Presbyteries belonging to the Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , had been recognised as branches of that church  --  the rights of which had never been disputed . That these commissioners presented their commissions to the proper officers , the clerks , but were rejected ; not on account of any real or pretended informality in the documents , not in a case of contested election , but in obedience to an illegal mandate of the Assembly of 1837 . That we demanded that the names of the commissioners thus rejected should be inserted upon the roll ; that motion after motion was made for the purpose , which the Moderator refused to put iQ. the house , and pronounced out of order ; and that , /z/ on one occasion , he said to a person who tendered to him a commission , which had been rejected by the clerks , ' ' We do not know you . " Further , that the Moderator refused to put to the house an appeal from his decision . After these repeated acts of rejection and refusal , it was that the members appointed a new Moderator , and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be decided at this stage of the investigation . The act was certainly within the power of the Assembly at that time ; and we assign as the cause of our proceeding , a deliberate , preconcerted plan , on the part of a portion of the Assemblies of 1S37 and 1838 , to exclude the commissioners from the exscinded Synods . In 1837 , resolutions were passed , cutting ofi ' these Synods frOm the Church . What then is our object ? To show a determined purpose , a conspiracy of the Old-school , carried out by their clerks and Moderator , to support the measures of excision , by excluding certain individuals . How can we prove this ? It is idle to say that these commissioners would have been admitted if they had applied at another time . Can any one believe that it was not the fixed intention of the Old-School to exclude them for ever ? The pledge exacted from the clerks demonstrates this : that clinches the nail . Well , to prove a preconcerted plan , we offer to show that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proclaimed , which was afterwards acted upon in that body ; that it was declared by a member of the Old-school portion of the committee , that unless the other portion consented to divide the church at once , without consultation , the Old-school party in the Assembly , would secure their future preponderance , by cutting off " a portion of their opponents . Is not this evidence material ? It goes to show the reason of the subsequent acts of excision  --  a deliberate design , a preconcerted plan . These we offer to prove by declarations made at the time  - -  the declarations not of a mere cypher , a dough-faced man , but of the head , the ) rime mover , the Cor3ph8eus of the party . We offer to prove that he held out a distinct menace , that unless the terms which he proposed were accepted , the next act of the Assembly would be the total exclusion of certain members . Now , if it is proper to prove this at all , in what way are we to prove it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , in the course of action , in the committee room , and in the house ? There is no other way . It is said that all the conversations in that committee merged in the different resolutions and proposals made by the two portions of it . This is not so . These documents do not show at all the design of those who passed the exscinding acts . Our object is to prove a fraudulent design . I say this without intending any disrespect to these gentlemen : they no doubt thought that they were doing what was perfectly right . But if their measures were illegal and unjust , in the eye of the law they were fraudulent . How , I say , arc we to prove all this , but by contemporaneous declarations ? There is no other method . The exscinding resolutions present only the naked fact of the excision . But it is said , that the General Assembly of 1837 had nothing to do with thaUof 1S3S ; that if the clerks made out a defective roll , the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the very thing we wish to demonstrate  --  to demonstrate , by showing a design , a pre-determined plan . Such a design and plan , I repeat it , can be proved , in this case , only by the declarations of those who were most active in counselling and carrying out the measure . TESTIMONY FOR THE RELATORS . Ql Mr. Breckinridge , a leading man among the Old-school , makes certain declarations in a committee of the house ; these declarations are acquiesced in by his party , who verify them by subsequent acts , passed with the design of securing a majority . Is your Honour prepared to say , that evidence of such a design is not material , to show that we were right in removing the Moderator and clerks , who in pursuance of the measures of excision , had refused seats to commissioners regularly appointed ? Ate the exscinding resolutions valid ? No member of the bar will say so . Even the counsel for our opponents will not say so ; and they strive to keep them in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of day . The design with which they were passed has an important bearing on the case ; and it can be proved only by such declarations . If so , the ' Court will admit the testimony . Mr. Preston . If I understand the proposition , it is to give in evidence , certain declarations made by Mr. Breckinridge , a member of the committee alluded to , as showing the design with which certain acts of the General Assembly were performed . We object to the admission of such testimony , on the ground that an individual declaration is entirely incompetent to the proof of the feelings and designs which actuated such an Assembly as that the proceedings of which are under consideration . It is offered as explanatory of the acts of a recognised public body . The declarations of a single man , declarations , too , made , not in the course of debate , not upon the floor of the house , but in a subsidiary meeting of certain members of that house  --  these are brought forward to explain public and recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those acts does not appear upon their face , the testimony offered must either contradict the record , or be consistent with it . Here then is the dilemma . If consistent , why attempt to confirm that which is already certain , to bolster up what is now fully supported ? If contradictory , shall the mere declaration of an individual overthrow the testimony which the solemn record bears of the transaction ? Shall secondary evidence destroy that which is primary ? Who ever heard of the proceedings of a great public body being expounded or explained by private declarations ? To state a case exactly in point : if your Honour were sitting in judgment upon an act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania , you would not allow your decision , as to the validity of that act , or the power of the body that had passed it , to be influenced by declarations made even upon the floor of the legislative hall , much less by declarations uttered in a committee-room . So far from acknowledging the declaration of a single man as conclusive , the concurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views not appearing on the face of the record , would not govern your decision . I venture to assert  --  using here a word drawn from a public body has never been introduced to explain the acts of that body . If so we should call on every individual member , in order to determine whether the motives and designs which actuated the whole were fair or fraudulent . But we have another serious objection to the testimony offered , depending on more important considerations . Let us look into the circumstances of the case , and we shall find more general grounds for its rejec- /z/ tion . Here I may say , that in your Honour 's decision of yesterday , respecting the admission of the Minutes of the General Assembly of 1837 , as evidence , I acquiesce . So far as that record is connected with the exclusion of the Synods , it is competent evidence ; but no farther . To the proof of other acts , or to show a fraudulent design in those engaged in the proceedings referred to , it is clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the pleadings a single fact is asserted and denied  --  the fact that certain men , the relators in this suit , were duly elected Trustees of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States . This fact we deny , and here is the sole issue in the case . It is incumbent , therefore , on the relators to prove the regular organization , the Constitutional authority , the paramount power of the Assembly to which they owe their election . That power , that authority , we contest : here is the naked issue . If they prove theirs the only true General Assembly , there is an end of our cause . It is an entire mistake  --  the fact taken for granted by our opponents  --  that we are endeavouring to set up an opposition General Assembly . We , tender no such issue . We do not assert that the Old-School Assembly of 1838 was the Constitutional Assembly : our cause rests on broader grounds . We are content with a mere general negation of the facts alleged on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how false or fraudulent , have been all the proceedings not merely of the Assembly of 1837 , and of the incipient organization of 1838 , but of every General Assembly from the year 1800 to the present time : this does not advance their proof in the smallest degree . We are anxious to keep ever in view the real , the naked issue . We are not setting up one Assembly and our opponents another . We are not contending for the affirmative of one issue , of which they have the negative ; and for the negative of another of which they have the affirmative . When we come into Court , we come as defendants , with all the privileges of defendants . Should they prove our proceedings foul , false , and fraudulent , how would this establish their claim to hold office under a righteous power ? They propose , under the authority of their Assembly , to detrude  --  I employ a word before introduced  --  to detrude from the Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church , a reverend and venerable gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds his office by virtue of the original appointment of the Legislature , independently of the Assembly of 1837 , or of 1838 , or any other General Assembly . There is no imputation of irregularity in his appointment . He is above all such imputation  --  untouched by it . We then are not called upon to do any thing  --  to prove any thing . It is for our opponents to strike down this venerable gentleman by a paramount power . Why then should we go into an investigation of the proceedings of the Assembly of 1837 ? Not one of those whom they attempt to eject from their office holds under that impugned Assembly . All of them can refer to an antecedent date as the time of their appointment , though he to whom I have just alluded is , I believe , the only relic of the original company . They all claim under General Assemblies on which no shadow of imputation rests . The proceedings of the Assembly of 1837 therefore can not affect either of the issues which the case presents . What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all sides ? /q/ Each General , Assembly at the close of its session , closes its existence , is dissolved , vanishes in thin air . The earth hath bubbles as the ocean hath , And these are of them . But is there nothing at all left ? No prolific root from which another Assembly may spring ? No germ of a future existence ? No nucleus from and around which a succeeding body may grow up ? Yes , there is such a prolific root , such a germ , a nucleus still ) reserved for a new organization . This nucleus is the surviving power of the Moderator , who presides at the opening of the new Assembly , and of the clei'ks who assist in its formation . In the year 1S37 such an Assembly was dissolved . In 1838 another was organized ; but who met for this purpose ? The elements of which that Assembly was to be composed . And why did they meet ? In pursuance of an act of the preceding General Assembly , under the auspices of the Moderator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clerks . In other words , there were materials around which a new organization was to be efiected . Thus far all of us are agreed . The validity of the proceedings which I have detailed , even our opponents , " by the advice of counsel learned in the law , " admit . All that was done , up to this stage of the proceedings , was done regularly . Now came the accepted time  --  now the period when a new state of things was to rise into existence . Still Dr. Mason turned towards the Moderator , still addressed the Moderator  - -  the Moderator not yet " shorn of his office . " But the acts of refusing to put the motion offered , and to put the appeal , were derogatory from his power , and by them was he thus shorn . The elements of the incipient organization were thrown upon the amplitude of their original powers . Up to the date of this occurrence , of the act by which it is said that that Moderator and those clerks forfeited their office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How then does the testimony ofiered apply ? Suppose the Moderator , in organizing the new Assembly , failed in his duty , committed a fundamental error , and that it became necessary to remove him ; suppose , too , that his intention was evil , corrupt , fraudulent . If the act done was illegal , the most conclusive evidence of right motives can not protect it from condemnation : if legal , the proof of wrong motives , of the most fraudulent design , can not invalidate it , or render the proceedings of the other party any the less violent , disorderly , and revolutionary . Then , no matter what motives actuated us  --  what was our concerted plan or purpose . I therefore do not here offer to vindicate any declaration or any menace . However violent or improper our opponents may consider that which they have offered to prove , we might , with safety , as regards the issue of this cause , admit the charge . But I make no such admission . We could exhibit a complete vindication , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I vindicate the declarations uttered by Mr. Breckinridge  --  I could vindicate them in a Christian and Presbyterian spirit . What I object to is the waste which the introduction of such testimony would produce  --  the waste of words , the waste of time , and , /z/ worst of all , the waste of temper , in the investigation of collateral issues ; not that we shrink from the attempt to vindicate our words . Allow me , before closing , to illustrate a position that we take in this controversy . Our friends on the other side may as well be advised of it , and I throw it out now . We contend , that no regularly organized General Assembly has been convened since the year 1800 . In 1799 , the act incorporating the Trustees of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church was passed . And whom did it incorporate . ' ' The very title of the instrument tells us whom . It is called " An Act for Incorporating the Trustees of the Ministers and Elders constituting the General Assembly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Now , are not these words  --  " the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States , " potential ? Was not the act designed to incorporate their trustees , and only theirs ? Well , in the year ISOl , the Assembly entered into articles of agreement with certain Congregational Churches , by which , Congregationalists were allowed to be represented in that body . Was not this an avoidance of the trust created by the charter ? Was that charter granted " to a mixed body of Presbyterians and Congregationalists ? Suppose Baptists , Episcopalians , Methodists , and Catholics , had been introduced , would they have formed the Assembly contemplated by the act of incorporation ? Or put a still stronger case . Suppose the persons thus admitted to our fellowship and communion , by their numbers , - their dexterity , and " the advice of counsel learned in the law , " had ousted us entirely , proclaimed themselves the true General Assembly , and appointed counsel to come into this court , and support their rights : would your Honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given ? It seems to me , that the introduction of improper members into this body corporate , or rather quasi corporate , may have vitiated every Assembly . The act contemplated none but Presbyterians  --  thorough-paced , true-blue Presbyterians . Our opponents , may it please your Honour , must show a paramount authority . Therefore , if the acts of all previous Assemblies were proved null and void , their object would be defeated . Besides , we object to an exegetical exposition of the proceedings of 1S37 : it must prote fallacious . Judge Rogers . The proceedings of the Assembly of 1837 , have a manifest bearing on the issue in this case ; but I can not perceive how the acts or declarations of individual rilembers of that body can properly be admitted to explain , or in any way affect those proceedings . I must therefore exclude the testimony . Mr. Randall . Judge Jesup , will you be good enough to state all that you know in regard to the pledge exacted , by the Assembly of 1837 , from its officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing the Assembly of 1838 . Mr. Hubbell objected to the question . The best evidence of the proceedings of the Assembly was its own minutes . On such a subject , parol evidence was inadmissible . His objection was not to the facts themselves , but to the mode in which it was proposed to prove them . Mr. Randall . In many cases the minutes are the best evidence of the proceedings of the Assembly ; but are we bound to prove by the minutes , what can not appear on them ? I propose to show , that after the exscinding /q/ resolutions of 1837 , the Moderator and clerks of the Assemblywere called upon to give a pledge , that they would act in accordance with those resolutions , in organizing the Assembly of 1S3S . That a motion was made to that effect ; but that while it was pending , the officers gave the pledge required , and then the motion was withdrawn . That afterwards , these proceedings were put upon the minutes by the clerk , but , by some gentlemen sympathising with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not bound by the minutes . What is a minute ? The mere narrative of the clerk  --  an officer not under oath . If a minute be inaccurate or defective , are we bound by it ? Is a minute infallit ) le ? Judge Rogers . Perhaps these proceedings are recorded . Is the record here ? ' Mr. Randall . We have summoned Dr. McDowell , the Stated Clerk , by a subpcena duces tecum , directing him to produce the original minutes . Dr. McDowell being called for , it was found that he was not in court . Mr. Randall . I hand to your Honour , the Old-school minutes of 1838 . There , on page 15 , is a record which will explain what I desire to prove by the testimony of the witness . The following is the part thus referred to by Mr. Randall . We copy it for the reader , though it was not laid before the jury . " The committee appointed to examine into a supposed discrepancy between the printed and manuscript Minutes of the General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accepted , amended , and adopted , and is as follows , viz. " The committee have collated the orijrinal records as they were made by the Permanent Clerk , approved of by the Assembly , and put into the hands of the Committee of Revision , with the printed minutes , and find the following omission in the latter , viz. " A resolution offered by Mr. Ewing , to appoint a committee to confer with the officers of the Assembly , who compose the Committee of Commissions , to procure from them a pledge to carry out the action of the Assembly in their official character to its full accomplishment ; which resolution was subsequently withdrawn , upon satisfactory statements before the Assembly , on the part of said officers , of their intention to do as the Assembly should direct them , which were also omitted in the printed Minutes . " Your committee impute no blame to the committee appointed by the Assembly to revise and prepare the minutes for publication , on account of this omission , although they are of opinion that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To prevent future mistakes in this matter , your committee would recommend to the Assembly the adoption of the following resolution , viz. " Resolved , That the records of the Assembly be published in all respects substantially as they are approved by that body , when submitted by the Permanent Clerk , and that in no case shall any erasure be made in the manuscript records , except by the express order of the Assembly itself . " Your committee would further recommend that the minutes be read and carefully corrected at the opening of each session of the Assembly , and that no subsequent revision or alteration be permitted , except by vote of the Assembly . Also , that the Stated Clerk be directed to record , on the transcribed minutes at their proper place , on interleaved blank pages , the whole of the omitted minutes alluded to in this report . " Mr. Randall , in continuation . That is the point in regard to which we desire to give testimony . Suppose that a resolution was offered and subsequently withdrawn : can not we prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minutes  --  minutes prepared by officers not acting under the sanction of an oath . Minutes are not evidence at all , but for the sake of convenience . If I can prove by a witness , who gives his testimony under oath , what were the contents of Mr. Ewing 's resolution , shall I not be permittecVto do so ? The printed minutes have , by agree-/z/ ment , been given in evidence instead of the originals , in order to save Dr. McDowell the trouble of testifying ; but they certainly are not conclusive . If the minutes stated that a resolution was withdrawn , would I not be at liberty to prove that it was not withdrawn , or that it was put to the house at another period , and carried ? A memorandum of the proceedings of the Assembly , made by any body else , might just as well be relied on , as the memorandum of the clerk . Judge Rogers . First give in evidence the record , which you suppose incorrect , as it stands , and afterwards you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' should be present the next morning , with the original minutes . Court adjourned . FRIDAY MORNING , March 8th.  --  10 o'clock . Mr. Randall . I now propose to call Dr. John McDowell , Stated Clerk of the General Assembly , who has been sumhioned , by a subpoena duces tecum , to produce that part of the original minutes of the Assembly of 1837 , referred to yesterday , which relates to the pledges given by the clerks , that they would carry out the decisions of that Assembly , in regard to the exscinded Synods . Dr. McDoivell being called , produced certain papers as the original minutes required . On the face of the papers appeared many obliterations , and interlineations , and several parts were crossed or cancelled with the pen . Mr. Randall . I offer to read the whole of these papers in evidence . Mr. Ingersoll . We have no objection to their being read , but to their being read as the minutes of Ihe Assembly , when in fact they are not so . These are only the rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , for approval , or correction . Mr. Randall . The witness was served with a subpoena duces tecum , and he produces these papers . Papers thus presented may always be read without inquiry , and without the attestation of the person producing them . We have offered to prove the facts in question by parol testimony . This offer was refused : it was said that the minutes , as the best evidence in the case , must be produced . Here they are : I offer them in evidence , and propose to read the whole , as well the parts erased , and crossed by the pen , as the rest . Mr. Randall , then read an extract from the papers , noting various erasures of words and sentences , as he proceeded . " Tuesday morning June 6lh.  --  Mr. Ewing offered the followinij resolution , viz : " Resolved , That a committee be appointed to confer with the officers of this Assembly , who compose the Committee of Commissions , and to obtain and communicate to this body , their explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its parts , the reform entered upon during our present sessions , by the full and exact performance on their part , as ministerial officers of this body , of all the duties either expressly directed , or necessarily implied , by the action of the Assembly , for the purification of the Church ; and which are required in g-iving entire efficacy to its acts , in all their parts , and especially in completing the roll of the next and subsequent Assemblies . " After debate , adjourned till this afternoon at 3 o'clock . " Concluded with Prayer . " " Tuesday afternoon , 3 o'clock .  --  The Assembly met and was opened with prayerThe mrnutesof the last session were read . /q/ *'The Assembly took up the unfinished business of this morning , viz : the resolution respecting the duty of the Committee of Commissions . " The Stated Clerk asked and obtained permission to make a statement , in relation to his duty as a member of the Committee of Commissions . " The Permanent Clerkobtained the same permission . Then Mr. Evving had leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks on these papers are of two kinds , erasures and crosses . They are the rough minutes made up hy the clerk . The original of Mr , Swing 's motion is not here ; what I have read is but a copy . I will ask Dr. McDowell what has become of that original . Mr. Ingersoll . We object to the witness being called upon . Mr. Randall . We have a perfect right to examine a witness producirtg papers , in obedience to a subpoena duces tecum , in regard to the character of such papers . Judge Rogers . The witness may be examined . Dr. McDowell . I have never had in my possession the original resolution offered by Mr. Ewing . Rev. John M Krebs , the Permanent Clerk of the Assembly , in answer to an inquiry respecting the paper which he had read , stating his views of duty as a clerk , in relation to the exscinding acts , said that the original of that paper was not in his possession ; that he had sent it to the printer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The original is necessary . Mr. Ingersoll . We have made no objection to any paper . Mr. Randall then produced " The Philadelphia Observer , " of December 14th , 1837 , containing a copy of a paper purporting to be that read by Mr. Krebs . Mr. Krebs . I have no doubt that it is perfectly correct . I sent the orignal copy to " The Presbyterian . " Mr. Randall then read the paper , as follows : " The undersigned , Permanent Clerk of the General Assembly , begs leave to state to the Assembly , that he has no other reluctance to answer the question proposed by the resolution offered this morning by Mr. Ewing , than that arising from the fear of the probability , strengthened by the course of debate on this resolution , that his readiness to reply , and the subject matter of his reply , in connexion with the phraseology of the resolution , may be misunderstood and misrepresented where there is no opportunity for explanation . But in respect to the precise object of the question iiself , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stated Clerks , as defined in their appointment as a Committee of Commissions , he has no hesitation in saying , that he fully recognises the authority of the General Assembly to instruct its officers , and to ascertain that they understand their duties as ministerial officers of this body , both in relation to the present Assembly and to future Assemblies , of which they continue to be officers , until they shall have been formally removed . " He considers it a dangerous principle to confide such discretionary power to the Committee of Commissions , in respect to the action of this or of any subsequent General Assembly , as it was argued this morning that this committee possessed . Five years ago , the undersigned first had the honour to sit in this house as a commissioner from the Presbytery of New York , and three limes recorded his vote adverse to the resolutions passed by the Assembly of 1832 , creating the then Second Presbytery of Philadelphia , on the ground that the Assembly had no constitutional right to form that Presbytery . Yet on the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had been a member of the Committee of Commissions in the year 1833 , might have excluded the commissioners from that Presbytery from seats in the General Assembly , in the exercise of the discretion jmpliedly attributed to the committee , of judging and acting on their private views of tliv constitutionality of the act of the Assembly , erecting that gg PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CASE . Presbytery . He believes , that after the will of the Assembly is expressed , the committee have no discretion in the case , and have no right ( as for himself he has no desire ) lo assume so high a responsibility , when acting as a mere executive officer . The conBlitutionality of the business , which is the subject matter of commands intrusted to him to execute , is not a question for him , but for the Assembly to decide ; and can be a question for him only as an individual member of this house , when occupying a seat in it as a commissioner . He considers himself , therefore , simply as an agent  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to do such other things , ( including the duty of a member of the Committee of Commissions , ) as have been specified in the acts of this and of preceding Assemblies , creating and defining the duties of his office . This opinion he has expressed in private to members of both parties in the house . " He understands it therefore to be his duty , as a member of the Committee of Com missions , and especially in view of the rules adopted this morning , on the motion of Dr. Alexander , ( and he will act on that understanding , unless otherwise expressly directed by the Assembly , ) to enrol only such commissioners to the next Assembly as shall come from Presbyteries , now , or at the close of this Assembly , recognised to be component and integral parts of the Presbyterian Church ; and that , to the Assembly so constituted , when duly organized for the transaction of business , it will be his duty to report the names of persons claiming to be commissioners from Presbyteries that may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Synods which have been declared by the Assembly to be out of the Presbyterian Church , should such persons present commissions to the committee . /z/ " Philadelphia , June 6lh , 1837 . " Mr. Randall . I suppose there will be no objection to this paper 's being cut out , that it may go to the jury . Mr. Ingersoll . Excision is a very dangerous type . We now propose to call the clerks , to show what the papers , which have been read as minutes , really are . Mr. Randall objected , that this was not the proper time for such testimony , but afterwards waved the objection , and asked Dr. McDowell to explain the matter . Dr. McDowell . The paper was not drawn up by me ; it is in the hand-writing of Mr. Krebs . Rev. John M. Krebs  --  sworn , with the iiplifted hand . I will read the minute as I prepared it , and offered it to the meeting of the Assembly , in the afternoon , to be passed upon by that body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words which I have read are the words read to the Assembly to be approved . The custom of the clerk is , to turn his face toward the members of the house , and read the minute which he has prepared . This was approved as a correct minute , without a word of dissent . These minutes are made up during the debate , and , when I am not satisfied with any expression , I make erasures and interlineations , so as to have a fair record to read at the opening of the next session of the Assembly . This is my process of making up the record , and erasures of the character mentioned are very frequent . Sometimes erasures are made by order of the Assembly . Mr. Hubbell . There are , on these papers , marks of two kinds  --  erasures and marks of cancellation . Mr. Krebs . I do not know by whom the cancellation was made , except from rumor . It was not done by me , or by the General Assembly , or by their order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in regard TESTIMONY FOR THE RELATORS . Qg to this cancelled minute , by the Assembly of 1838 ; Mr. Randall objected to his going into that matter . Mr. Krebs . The paper that I read was never directed to be put upon the minutes . Here - Mr . Randall waving his objection , the witness recurred to the former subject . The General Assembly of 1838 ordered that the parts cancellated should be recorded on the transcript of the minutes . Mr. Randall objected to the witness proceeding farther , saying that he had never meant to cast any imputation upon the clerks . Mr. Huhhell . We want to prove this cancellation an unauthorized act . And that it was on ' account of it that the original minute did not go into the printed copies , or appear on the formal transcript . In 1838 , by order of the Assembly , it was restored . Judge Rogers . We will take it as a part of the minutes of 1837 . Mr. Krebs , examined by Mr. Ingersoll . The paper that I read was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insert it in the minutes , but no motion was made to that effect , and I did not feel at liberty to insert it without . I afterwards published it myself . It did not belong to the Assembly . Examined by Mr. Randall . I do not knov/ where the original paper is . I gave it to Mr. Engles , editor of the Presbyterian , with a request that he should publish it . I read this paper by permission , before Mr. Ewing had withdrawn his resolution . First I made a statement of about ten minutes , and then read the paper . I can not tell where the original copy of Mr. Ewing 's resolution is . The copy on the minutes is a correct one . Such papers are always destroyed , as soon as a copy has been taken . Dr. McDowell sworn  --  examined by Mr. Hubbell . That you may understand the marks of cancellation which appear on these papers , I would refer you to page 498 of the Minutes of 1837 , where mention is made of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Stated Clerk , with Dr. Cuyler and Mr. Grant were appointed a commiltee to revise the Minutes , and prepare them for publication . " These minutes , on the rising of the General Assembly , were put into my hands , either as Stated Clerk , or as Chairman of the Committee . The committee met in my study for several days , and made various alterations , striking out the parts which you see marked with a cross . The obliterations had been made before . That this matter may be understood , I should say that it is customary for the whole minutes to be read over to the Assembly , at the close of its sessions ; but occasionally they are in haste , and have several times appointed a committee to make the corrections . It was under such powers that we acted in 1837 . We thought , that as Mr. Ewing 's motion had been withdrawn , it ought not to be made a m.atter of record . Mr. Grant , one of the members of the committee , differed from us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by Mr. Krebs , I never have had ; it never came to me in any form . The Minutes of 1837 were printed , I think , about the first of August : as soon as the revision was completed , they were sent to press . Examined by Mr. Wood . The statements made by the Clerks formed no part of thejyiinutes . We left out every thing , as if the trans- /z/ action had never happened . The remarks made do not now appear , but the fact that they were made does . These crosses were made by the committee . The obliterations I know nothing of . Examined by Mr. Huhhell . The statement which I made was never put on the minutes . The statement of neither of the Clerks was filed . Mine was not in writing . I can give the substance of it , if proper . Judge Jesup  --  in continuation . My recollection is that the matter was as it has been stated . In the forenoon Mr. Ewing offered his resolution ; and , in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. McDowell made a statement of his views of his duty as a clerk , of which , though I can not repeat the whole , a part is impressed upon my memory . After Mr. Ewing 's resolution had been discussed for some time , the Assembly adjourned to the afternoon . In the afternoon Dr. McDowell asked leave to make a statement ; and said , that he did not feel willing to give a pledge , as such , to the Assembly ; but would state his views . That he did not think he could properly- exercise any discretion in the matter . That he was only a ministerial officer , and , as such , would carry out the views of the Assembly , and that he should feel himself bound so to do , as long as he retained the office , whatever might be his opinion as a private individual . It is impressed upon my mind that he added , that if he found himself so situated that he could not consistently with his principles carry out the views of the General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he said so . This is all I recollect . When Mr. Ewing rose and withdrew his resolution , it was said either by him or some other person , that the explanations were satisfactory ; and leave being asked to withdraw the motion , it was granted by a vote taken . No cross-examination . Rev. Miles P. Squier  --  sworn . I was a commissioner to the General Assembly of 1838 , from the Presbytery of Geneva , which is within the bounds of the Synod of Geneva . The commissions of the commissioners from the exscinded Synods to the Assembly of 1838 , were handed to myself and Judge Brown , of Ohio , on Thursday morning , and were by us tendered to the clerks . Dr. McDowell , and Mr. Krebs . Dr. McDowell in the name of the committee replied , " We are not permitted by the instructions of the Assembly to receive these commissions ; we can not do it . Were I to exercise my own judgment I might do very differently , but I am bound by the instructions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of papers to the witness . Are these the commissions which you and Judge Brown presented to the clerks ? Mr. Squier . I have no doubt these are they . There were about fifty of them . ( After looking over them ) There can be no manner of doubt that these are the commissions . They were stated to be commissions from Presbyteries within the four exscinded Synods . No objection was made to their form . They were not received , examined , or opened by the clerks . I desired the gentlemen present to take notice of the refusal . This interview took place in the committee room of the Seventh Presbyterian Church , between nine and ten o'clock in the morning , the place and time , at which it had been advertised , that the clerks would be in waiting to receive commissions . Cross-examined by Mr. Hubbell . I had no objection to say to Dr. Elliott , that the Presbytery of Geneva was under the jurisdiction of the /q/ Synod of Geneva , but because Presbyteries , as regards the General Assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , have been irrelevant to say so . I came from the Presbytery of Geneva . I had been preaching the winter of that year in the congregation of Junius , within the boundsof that Presbytery , as a stated supply , as it is termed on the minutes . I was a minister belonging to the Presbyterian Church . The churches in that Presbytery , without exception , or , at least , as I think , not more than one , were governed by ruling elders . That one exception , if there were any , must have been the congregation of Mid- dlesex . By Mr. Ingersoll . With regard to my own Presbytery , it is as I have stated . About the other Presbyteries in the Synod I can not speak with certainty . I know of none that are strictly Congregational churches ; I do not know that all have sessions . If there be any churches in that country , within the bounds of the Synod and beyond , which have not sessions , they have , by vote , put themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders in all those churches are for life ; I do not know that all have elders chosen for life ; but all that I know have . I know of none which have committee-men . I presume there are some where all questions are submitted to the male members of the church ; I have parol evidence that there are such in that region . In the Presbytery to which I belong , all have sessions except one , and for five or six years past , my attention has been chiefly confined to that Presbytery . Several years ago , I belonged to the Presbytery of Bufi'alo : there were then some churches connected with that Presbytery , that had not appointed ruling elders . I am unable to say how many . This Presbytery now belongs to the Synod of Genesee . They were the fewer in number , and the smaller churches , I should say . Churches , when first formed in a new country , are very small , and have few male members ; hardly enough for the formation of an eldership ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the mean time such a church was represented in the Presbytery . I have no knowledge of changes , subsequent to the time of which I speak , in the Presbytery of Buffalo . It was frequently the case that these churches afterwards chose ruling elders . I now reside one hundred miles from them , and therefore do not know much about them . Mr. Ingersoll . Here is page 534 of the Minutes of 1837 , containing the reports of the Presbyteries of Onondaga and Cayuga . Please to say what churches there designated have , and which have not , ruling elders regularly ordained . Mr. Squier . I do not know whether all these have elders ; all of them that I know have . I know of none which have not . I am not as much acquainted with the churches of Onondaga , as with those of Cayuga . I do not know the number of churches in Onondaga , but it is rather large . I am acquainted in Auburn , and both churches there have ruling elders . By a rather large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacquainted , of my own personal knowledge , with the fact how many churches there are in the Presbytery of Onondaga , which have ruling elders . I have not travelled much in Onondaga . The seventeen counties in which I travelled , as Agent for the Home Missionary Society , did not embrace that Presbytery ; they did embrace all west of it . Some of the Presbyteries have*been formed since that time . In 1816 , when I /z/ settled in BufFalo , Geneva was the only Presbytery in those seventeen counties . During my agency , the following Presbyteries were formed : Out of Geneva , in 1817 , were formed Ontario , Niagara and Bath ; and in 1819 , the Presbyteries of Rochester and Genesee were created . All of these were formed by the Synod of Geneva . The geographical limits of the Presbyteries were at first large , but were afterwards cut shorter for convenience . At a later period the Presbytery of Tioga was created , and by the same Synod of Geneva . This was in a subsequent year . Also Presbytery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later period , in 1821 , the Synod of Genesee was formed by the General Assembly , containing , I think , the Presbyteries of Ontario , Rochester , Niagara , and Genesee . At a subsequent time , the Presbytery of Niagara was divided by the Synod of Genesee : the part north of Tonne wanta Creek , took the name of Niagara , the other that of Buffalo , and the latter retained the papers . The Presbytery of Chemung was subsequently formed by the Synod of Geneva . I can not now think of any more . ' I do not know that any church was ever represented in the Presbytery of Ontario , by a person not either a minister or a ruling elder . I know nothing about it , one way or the other . I do know persons , who , when I was a member of the Presbytery of Niagara , fifteen years ago , were members of that Presbytery from churches that had not yet organized sessions . To the best of my recollection , there were but a small number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and newer ones . Each church belonging to a Presbytery , has one representative . I judge there were churches in these Presbyteries , which , in the feature of not having sessions , were Congregational . I know there is one church which has the reputation of belonging to Bath Presbytery , which has no ruling elders  --  the church of Prattsburg . I do not know that this church was ever represented in Presbytery . I do not know of any such in the Presbytery of Rochester . I am acquainted with all the principal churches in Rochester , but not with all . To the best of my knowledge , those churches , which have not yet formed elderships , elect one from the male members , to represent them in Presbytery . I have never been present at any such election . By Mr. Hiihbell . I know of no church formed wholly , or partly , on the accomodation plan . There are , I should think , between thirty and forty churches in the Presbytery of Buffalo . At the time I was acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some churches in that incipient state which I have described . The common language in Presbytery was , " While you are too young to form elderships , let the male members govern the church . " I can not say , that all the churches which were thus initiated , fifteen years ago , have now become consummate . The churches of Angelica , I have always understood , had sessions ; I know of none in that Presbytery that have not . I do not know , however , that all have . I am not sufficiently acquainted with all the churches in Rochester to know about them . I do not know that all in Genesee have ruling elders ; but I know of none that have not . When I belonged , a number of years ago , to the Presbytery of Niagara , I had reason to suppose there were some churches that had not sessions in that Presbytery . I know of none such in Rochester . Re-examined by Mr. Randall . The representation from the Presbytery of Watertown . Minutes 1837 , / ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ /q/ cording to the number of ministers , and , so far as I know , always has been so . A minister without a charge , as , for example , the president of a college , always counis one in Presbytery . The right to a seat commences with his ordination . I know of no individual , of the whole number of five hundred and nine ministers , within the bounds of the four exscinded Synods , who is not a regularly ordained Presbyterian clergyman . All were such ; but I must be understood as meaning , that we received clergymen from the Dutch Reformed Church , and from the Associations of New England , without re-ordination ; the terms of correspondence did not require that they should be re-ordained . In all the Presbyteries with which I am acquainted , there are a suiFicient number of Presbyterian churches to constitute the Presbyteries . Striking out those churches not strictly Presbyterian , there would have remained a sufficient number , regularly organized , to send commissioners to the General Assembly , of 1837 . Mr. Randall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these commissions of the delegates from the exscinded Synods to the General Assembly of 1838 . The commissions were then given in evidence . Mr. Squier , in continuation  --  examined by Mr. Randall . I was present at the organization of the Assembly of 1838 . After tendering the commissions to the clerks , I presented them for keeping to a gentleman named Mr. Nixon . I introduced him to Dr. Mason , and then went into the house . 1 found the house previously occupied , very densely , at the south end , a large proportion of the gentlemen in that part of it being of the Old-school party . The sermon was preached as usual , and at its close the Moderator , Dr. Elliott , announced that after prayer he would proceed to constitute the Assembly . This prayer being finished , he took his place below , in front of the pulpit , and made a prayer , at the close of which Dr. Patton rose , saying that he held in his hand certain resolutions which he wished to offer . Dr. Elliott said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the next business was the formation of the roll , or something to that effect . Dr. Patton replied that his resolutions had regard to that very subject . Dr. Elliott stated , that they could not be received , as the roll was the next thing in the order of business ; and I think mentioned , that the clerks were ready to make their report . Dr. Patton informed him , that he had the floor before the clerks . The Moderator told him he was out of order . Dr. Patton appealed from his decision , and his appeal was seconded , to the best of my recollection . The Moderator refused to put the appeal to the house , saying to Dr. Patton that he was out of order . Dr. Patton then took his seat , and the clerks made their report . As soon as they had reported , the Moderator said , if there were any more commissions , then was the time to have them presented . Dr. Erskine Mason then arose , and addressed the JNIoderator , saying that he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyteries within the bounds of the Synods of Utica , Geneva , Genesee , and Western Reserve , which had been refused by the clerks ; that he now tendered them , ( holding them up to view , ) for the purpose of completing the roll . The Moderator inquired of him if those Presbyteries were within these four Synods . He answered they were . The Moderator replied that they could not be received , on " in words to that effect . Dr. Mason then ap- /z/ pealed from the decision of the Moderator to the house , and his appeal was seconded . The Moderator refused to put the appeal , declaring him out of order . I then rose , and mentioned to the Moderator , that my commission had been tendered to the clerks , and had been refused ; and I nowdemanded my seat , and that my name should be enrolled among the members . The Moderator asked what Presbytery I represented . I replied the Presbytery of Geneva . The Moderator asked if that Presbytery belonged to the Synod of Geneva . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Synod of Geneva . He replied , " We do not know you , " Mr. Cleaveland of Detroit then rose , and said in substance , that we had been advised , that a constitutional Assembly must be organized at that time and place , by the admission of all to their seats , and as it was evident that this could not be done under these officers , or as it was impossible to go on , and constitute or organize the Assembly under them , he moved that Dr. Beman take the chair , which motion was seconded , and put by Mr. Cleaveland . Dr. Beman rose immediately after the question had been put and carried , by what I should think a nearly unanimous vote . He was sitting near the front of the slip . A motion was then made and seconded , and put by Dr. Beman , that Dr. Erskine Mason and Mr. Gilbert be clerks , and Dr. Beman then called for nominations for a Moderator of the Assembly . Whereupon Dr. Fisher was nominated , and the nomination being seconded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voce , by calling the ayes and nays . Dr. Beman then announced to Dr. Fisher , that he was regularly constituted Moderator of the General Assembly , and should be governed by the rules of that body thereafter to be made . The Rev. Dr. Mason was then nominated as Stated Clerk , and Mr. Gilbert as Permanent Clerk , and the question was put by Dr. Fisher and carried . Some paper was then read or referred to , the purport of which I did not understand , and on the back of this , a motion was made to adjourn to the First Presbyterian Church . The paper was on the subject of the occupation of the house . 1 can not state by whom it was read , but to the best of my recollection , it was by Dr. Beman . The body then retired to the lecture-room of the First Presbyterian Church , the Moderator announcing that if there were any other commissions , which had not yet been presented , they would be received there . After getting to the lecture-room of the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions in the Seventh Church , were I think , all made in an audible voice , and all seconded ; and the question on each was put by the chair . An opportunity was given to vote in the negative , it being , to the best of my recollection , in each instance put , and a competent time being allowed to vote . So far as I could perceive , the business had the attention of the whole house . The house was very still , especially at the time when I was on the floor . Every member had an opportunity of voting on these resolutions . There was a call to order , by the Moderator , of Dr. Patton , who , when last called to order , took his seat . There were , if I recollect , some cries of order when he and Dr. Mason were on the floor . There was no interruption when I had the floor , but more when Mr. Cleaveland was on it , from Dr. Elliott and those sitting in that portion of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house which was filled when we went in , by those who acted on the Oldschool side . I can not say that they were all Old-school men , but many I /z/ knew to be so . I did not enter the house till eleven o'clock ; then it was occupied by a dense mass , nearly one third of the way from the pulpit . There was a universal rumour , that a meeting for consultation had been held in the church previously to this time . I have been a commissioner since the year 1817 , about every four years . I have never before seen such a collection of persons at that hour . I entered the house previously to the commencement of the preparatory exercises . The members did not change their places afterwards . The Assembly is always opened with a sermon by the old Moderator , who presides until a new one is chosen . The practice , to the best of my recollection , formerly was , to I'ead the commissions before all the members . The late practice , for convenience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Permanent Clerks . My recollection is not distinct as to the subject of discussing the right to seats  --  whether it is done before , or after the choice of a Moderator . No cross-examination . Dr. William Hill  --  sworn . I belong at present to the Presbytery of the District of Columbia , although my residence , for some months past , has been at Winchester , Virginia . I have been a member of the Presbyterian Church since 1787 . I have repeatedly been a commissioner to the General Assembly ; once soon after the Assembly was organized , and since , I can not recollect how often , but more frequently than any other person from the state of Virginia . I have filled the office of Moderator . It was the custom , at the time of my first acquaintance with the Assembly , for the commissions to be brought into the house , and read there . The Constitution says merely that they shall be read , but as to the points where , when , and before whom , this shall be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of years was , for commissioners , as soon as the sermon was done , to present themselves at the clerks ' table , and their commissions were read one after another , as fast as possible , and their names put on the roll . All the doubtful commissions were laid aside , to be acted upon at a subsequent period . Where nothing doubtful appeared , the names were put upon the roll immediately . If I recollect aright , the doubtful commissions were at first discussed before the house ; but this was found too tedious , and a Committee of Elections or Commissions was appointed , to examine them and make report as soon as possible . Sometimes persons appeared without their commissions , which perhaps had been lost , or had miscarried . These cases were referred to the same committee to be reported upon . I believe the common practice was , to defer acting on these doubtful commissions , until after the Moderator was chosen . Those members about whom there was no dispute were permitted to vote for Moderator . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reading the commissions , in extenso , consumed a great while , this was dispensed with , and the names merely of each commissioner , and of the Presbytery from which he came , were announced . If any commission was doubtful , or was called in question , it was always laid aside for subsequent consideration . This continued the practice , until thirteen years ago , when the custom arose of referring all the commissions to the clerks , in order to facilitate business ; and they having previously examined them , reported the roll to the house . The Constitution says nothing on the subject . Business progressed in this way comfortably and harmoniously , until these , times of excitement came . Then this plan was /z/ found to operate unfavourabl ) , and a desire was manifested to revert to the old custom , especially when , in 1837 , pledges were exacted from the clerks . It was my intention , last spring , to move the Assembly to return to the old order , as less objectionable , and less liable to abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which met in Pittsburgh . It was a pretty tedious process to get into our gear on that occasion , and I believe near two days were spent before the choice of a Moderator . The Moderator of the last year was not present . The Constitution says that the last Moderator present shall preside until a new one shall be chosen . The Moderator had written to Dr. Miller , requesting him to preach the sermon , and preside in his place . After the sermon , there was an objection to Dr. Miller 's taking the chair , and Dr. Beman presided a considerable time ; but an objection being again made , the office devolved on Dr. William A. McDowell , I believe by a vote of the house , but I am not certain whether by a vote , or by consent . Dr. Beman occupied the chair some time before his right was called in question . I think I recollect repeated instances , in former years , under the previous order , of disputed rights to seats being determined before the choice of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion mentioned . Dr. Beman 's right was disputed because he was not the last Moderator present . Dr. McDowell , the last one present , was in very feeble health , and it was to accommodate his feelings that Dr. Beman was put into the chair . The universal rule is , that the last Moderator present is entitled ta the chair . I do not know whether Dr. Beman put the question on the subject of his removal : L think he did , but am not certain . If I recollect Dr. Beman took no part in the discussions of the house . He left the chair , in obedience to its order , as soon as the decision had been made . Re-examined by Mr. Randall . I think the objection on which the moot point arose was , that Dr. McDowell was not a commissioner to that Assembly . By Mr. Ingersoll . It is not necessary to be a commissioner to preach the sermon . On this occasion Dr. Miller preached it . Mr. Randall next offered various extracts from the minutes . Min. 1823 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America , met , agreeably to appointment , in the Seventh Presbyterian church in the city of Philadelphia , May 15th , 1823 , at 11 o'clock , A.

" After prayer the commissions were read , and it appeared that the following ministers and elders v/ere duly appointed , and attended as commissioners to this Assembly , viz. " Here follows the roll of the Assembly . " The Rev. John McFarland of the Presbytery of Ebenezer , Dr. Cyrus Baldwin , ruling elder from the Presbytery of Onondaga , and Mr. Samuel Blood , ruling elder from the Presbytery of Carlisle , appeared in the Assembly without commissions ; but sufficient testimony was given that they had been chosen commissioners to this Assembly , and they were received as members and took their seats accordingly .

Court adjourned . SATURDAY MORNING , March 9th  --  10 o'clock . Mr. Randall . I have examined Dr. Patton and Mr. Squier out of the regular order of the testimony , but shall endeavor to be more methodical hereafter . The last evidence offered yesterday was in regard to the practice of deciding the right to disputed seats before the election of the new Moderator . I now give some farther extracts from the minutes , relating to the same point . Min. 1826 , p. 6 . " Mr. Josiah Bissell , from the Presbytery of Rochester , appeared in the Assembly , and produced a commission , as an elder from that Presbytery . A member of that Presbytery informed the Assembly that Mr. Bissell had not been set apart as an elder ; but that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conformity with the conventional agreement , between the General Assembly and the General Association of Connecticut . After some discussion , the Assembly adjourned till nine o'clock to-morrow morning . " May 19/i , * * The Assembly resumed the consideration of the commission of Mr , Bissell ; and , after considerable discussion , it was resolved , that Mr. Bissell be admitted as a member of the Assembly . " The Rev. Thomas McAuley , D. D. , was chosen Moderator ; and the Rev. John Chester , D. D. , and the Rev. Samuel T. Mills , were chosen temporary clerks . " M7 Randall . There seems to have been complete unanimity in regard to Mr. Bissell 's case . It was not considered as involving any important constitutional question , and even the yeas and nays were not called for . Mr. Hubbell . The counsel , I think , is mistaken in regard to the g PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CASE . unanimity of the house . There was a formal protest in Mr. Bissell 's ease . Mr. Randall . Yes , here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my notice , from having been made at a subsequent time . I will read it . Mm. 1826 , ' p. 23. * ' Protest against the admission of Mr. Bissell. - ' 1 . Because he was neither an ordained minister , nor a ruling elder . " 2 . Because he was not even a committee-man , on which ground some might have been disposed to advocate his admission . " 3 . Because he had not , either from the Constitution or from the Conventional Agreement , the shadow of a claim to a seal . " Mr. Randall . The ground of the protest , as you see , was not the time when the decision , as to the disputed seat , took place  --  its being decided before the choice of the new Moderator . All seem to have agreed , that that was the legitimate and only proper time . Min. 18.34 , fp. 3-7 . Min. 1835 , p ; j. 3-7 . " The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church met in the First Presbyterian church in this city , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly being absent , was opened with a sermon by the Rev. Samuel Miller , D.D. , at the request of the Rev. Dr. William A. McDowell , the last Moderator present . * * * After sermon , the Stated Clerk called the house to order , and informed them , that the Rev. Dr. Lindsley , the Moderator of the last Assembly being absent , the duties of the chair devolved upon the last Moderator , who is present , and has a commission to sit in this Assembly ; and therefore , he moved that the Rev. Nathan S. S. Beman , D. D. , be called to the chair . This motion prevailed , and Dr. Beman look the chair , and constituted the Assembly with prayer . " Then follows the report of the clerks upon the roll , and their report of irregular commissions . " The Assembly had a recess until three o'clock this afternoon . " Thursday afternoon , three o'clock .  --  The Assembly met . A motion was made to re-consider the vote by which Dr. Beman was called to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the apprehension that Dr. William A. McDowell , the Moderator immediately preceding Dr. Lindsley , was not in the house ; and that many others believed the rule of the house required the constituting Moderator to be in commission , which Dr. McDowell was not . This motion , after considerable discussion , was adopted unanimously . " After some further remarks , it was agreed that the original motion of the Stated Clerk should be again submitted to the house , and the vote be taken by him . Whereupon Dr. Ely put the question : " ' All who are in favor of sustaining the resolution passed in the morning , by which Dr. Beman was called to the chair , will signify it by saying . Aye . ' " This motion was lost . " It was then moved that the Rev. William A. McDowell , D. D. , being the last Moderator present , be requested to take the chair . This motion prevailed , and Dr. McDowell took the chair accordingly . " Then followed the appointment of a Committee of Elections , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Assembly proceeded to the choice of a Moderator and Temporary Clerk . Min. 1836 , pTp. 23.5-9 . Min. 1837 , pp. 411-15 . The minutes referred to , go to establish the same point as those quoted  --  the practice of deciding in regard to disputed seats before the choice of a Moderator . Dr. Robert Cathcart  --  sworn . I have been a minister of the Presbyterian Church in the United States near forty-seven years . I can not tell , exactly , the number of years 1 have attended the meetings of the /q/ General Assembly , but may safely say that , as spectator or member , I have attended forty years . From thirty to forty times I have been a commissioner . I occupied the place of clerk of the Assembly , from fifteen to twenty years . At that time there were no such officers as Permanent and Stated Clerks . Our constitution recognises no such officers . All that it recognises is , a clerk of the Assembly , and his duties are very simple . At an early period , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the occasion , sat down , and served until the Assembly was constituted . All the commissions were brought forward and put upon the table , and the clerk read them at full length . After some years , when the number of commissioners had increased , this method was found inconvenient , and then it became customary to read only the most essential parts oT each commission , as , the name of the commissioner , and of his Presbytery , and the signature of the Moderator . At this time there were so few disputed or defective commissions , that such matters were usually settled at the clerk 's table . Afterwards , when the number increased , another plan was adopted .  --  Such commissions were laid aside , till those about which there was no difficulty had been read . A Committee on Commissions was then appointed , and into the hands of that committee Avent all the doubtful cases . Then a recess was usually allowed for dinner , and , after the interval , the committee returned the names of those whom they thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committiee , and no vote passed upon them by the Assembly . Then the Moderator announced , that if any commissioners had entered the house in the interim , they should come forward and present their commissions . After this they proceeded to choose a Moderator and clerks . Since the year 1S02 the Permanent Clerk has continued in office until a new one was appointed . The report of the committee was received ex officio , without any vote . They settled who were members ; and those thus reported were put on the roll . It was never supposed that the clerks had a right to reject any commissions . The Assembly is entirely disconnected from any officers ; if the Moderator and clerks should all die , the body would still exist . Cross-examined by Mr. Huhhell . Of late , since it has been found that so much time was consumed in reading the commissions at the table , it has been the practice for the clerks to attend in the morning , before eleven o'clock , to receive commissions . Then they have reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee of Commissions , or Elections , I forget which . It is their business to examine the commissions , and see whether they are regular . Sometimes they find defects , as the want of a signature . Sometimes commissions have been lost , or forgotten . They have always reported according to circumstances . The irregular , or doubtful cases then go into the hands of a Committee of Elections . Rev. Eliphalet Gilbert  --  sworn . I belong to the Presbytery of Wilmington , in the State of Delaware . I was a commissioner to the General Assembly of 1837 , and also to that of 1838 . I went to the church in Ranstead Court , on the day of the organization of the latter Assembly , about half past ten o'clock , and found the seats around , and in front of the Moderator 's chair occupied by the brethren of the Old-school party as they are usually called . I ' then stepped round into the lobby , and handed my /z/ commission to the Committee of Commissions . As I was passing , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? These doors ought to be locked . " As I had been present at many Assemblies , and had never known them locked , I was surprised at hearing this . Soon after the doors were locked . Then I went round and took my seat in the house on the east aisle , as near to the front as I could get . After the sermon was over , and the introductory prayer concluded . Dr. Patton rose , and said , " I hold in my hand , certain resolutions , which I desire to present to the house . " The Moderator declared him out of order , saying that the first business was the report of the clerks upon the roll . Dr. Patton replied , that his resolutions bore upon the formation of the roll , and that he desired they might be presented , and acted upon without debate . The Moderator replied again , that they were out of order ; that the clerk had the floor . Dr. Patton said , that he had had the floor before the clerks . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patton appealed from his decision to the house , and his appeal was seconded by at least a dozen voices . I seconded it , and so did all who sat around me . The Moderator declared that the appeal was out of order , refused to put it to the house , and ordered the clerks to proceed with the roll . Mr. Krebs then read the roll , omitting the names of all the commissioners , from twenty-nine Presbyteries , viz : the twenty-eight belonging to the four exscinded Synods , and the Third Presbytery of Philadelphia . After the roll was concluded , the Moderator said , according to the usual form , that if there were any other commissions , from any part of the Presbyterian Church , they should then be presented . Dr. Mason , of New York , then rose , with a bundle of papers in his hand , and said , " Mr. Moderator , I hold in my hand the commissions of a large number of commissioners , which have been rejected by the clerks : I now tender them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the roll . " This motion was seconded by many voices . The Moderator asked whether these commissions were from Presbyteries in the Presbyterian Church , at the close of the General Assembly of 1837 . Dr. Mason answered , that they were from Presbyteries belonging to the Synods of Utica , Geneva , Genesee , and the Western Reserve . The Moderator replied , " We can not receive them . " Dr. Mason then said , " I do most respectfully appeal from your decision to the house . " 1 should have said , that he had already been declared out of order . His appeal was seconded by many voices . The Moderator declared him out of order , and refused to put the appeal . The Rev. Miles P. Squier , then rose in his place , and said , that he had been regularly commissioned from the Presbytery of Geneva , that he had handed his commission to the clerks , and that they had refused to receive it ; that he now tendered it to the Assembly , and demanded his seat upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva belonged to the Synod of Geneva . Mr. Squier replied , that it was within the bounds of the Synod of Geneva . The Moderator said , " We do not know you , " and Mr. Squier sat down . Here the Rev. John P. Cleaveland rose , and after a few remarks , moved a change of officers . He said , that it was evident , from the refusal of the Moderator and clerks to do their duty , that a constitutional organization of the Assembly , could not , under those circumstances , be effected ; that we had been advised by men learned in the law , that the organization must take place at that time , and in that house ; and he moved a change of /z/ Moderator , and nominated Dr. N. S. S. Beman to preside until a new one should be chosen . This motion was seconded , and Mr. Cleaveland put it , saying , " All those who are in favour of the motion , will please to say , aye . " There was a loud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All who are against it will say , no , " and I heard some murmuring , but not one loud distinct " No ! " I understood the object of the motion to be to remove Dr. Elliott , and substitute Dr. Beman in his place . Those around me voted with the same understanding . Mr. Cleaveland declared that the motion was carried , and requested Dr. Beman to take the chair . Dr. , Beman stepped out into the aisle and took the chair . Then Dr. Mason and myself were nominated clerks , /ro tern. , and the motion was put and carried . After my own election , I left my previous seat , on the eastern aisle , and passed round near where Mr. Krebs and Dr. McDowell sat , and walked down the broad aisle , to where Dr. Beman stood , that I might be ready to call the roll , which I held in my hand , if necessary . While I was thus passing down the aisle , Dr. Beman called for nominations for Moderator of the Assembly of 1S3S , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nomination was seconded . Dr. Beman asked , if there were any other nominations , but none were made : the roll therefore , was not called , but the question was decided viva voce . Dr. Beman said , " All who are in favour of Dr. Fisher 's being the Moderator , will say , aye , " and there was a general " Aye ! " Then " All who are against it will please to say , no , " and I heard several loud noes . The usage of the Assembly is , when only one person is nominated , to decide the question viva voce , and when there are two nominations to call the roll . 1 have known such a question to be determined viva voce , in a number of instances . Dr. Beman declared the motion to be carried , and introduced Dr. Fisher to his place : he had no chair , but merely stepped aside . He reminded Dr. Fisher , that he was to be governed by the rules thereafter adopted by the Assembly . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are commonly those to be formd in the appendix to the Constitution of the Church . Dr. Fisher then called for nominations for Stated and Permanent Clerks , and Dr. Mason and myself were nominated . Dr. Fisher asked if there were any further nominations , but none were made , and he then put the motion , that we should be clerks , and it was carried almost unanimously . I think there were some nays , but if so , they were not as distinct as before . These negatives came from the south-western part of the house , or from towards the west door . There were negatives on both questions , I believe , though I am not so positive of this , in regard to the last , as in regard to the motion for Dr. Fisher . I can not say certainly , because there was considerable confusion in the house . The noes came from that part of the house occupied by the Oldschool party  --  by Mr. Breckinridge , Mr. Plumer , and their friends . I am positive they came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer appointed . The question upon the first motion , that of Mr. Cleaveland , I know was reversed ; and I believe that it was reversed on all the subsequent motions . I know it was reversed on two or three . By this time there was considerable confusion in the house , and there was a motion made , that the Assembly should adjourn to meet forthwith in the lecture-room of the First Presbyterian Church . This motion was put and carried . The question was reversed , but I think there were none against /z/ it . Dr. Fisher declared that the Assembly had adjourned to meet forthwith in the lecture-room of the First Presbyterian Church , and , that , if any commissioner present had not yet handed in his commission , he should attend and present it at that time and place . I do not remember the reading of a paper , as to the reason of adjournment . Some reason was assigned , as the confusion , or the difficulty of occupying that house . We left the Seventh Churcli , and moved off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as we were convened there , or a few minutes after , the roll was called , and we proceeded to business . Dr. Patton then offered the resolutions which he had- offered in the church in Ranstead Court  --  the same as those contained in the paper read here . These were put and carried . The General Assembly of which I was clerk , continued in session about eleven or twelve days , in the church on Washington Square . The different motions , made in the church in Ranstead Court , were all made by persons having an undisputed right to seats , having been reported as members , by the Committee of Commissions , excepting Mr. Squier . They all made their motions in a loud voice  --  louder than usual  --  so that they could be heard over the whole house . They were addressed to the whole house . I should think there was an opportunity given to every member present to vote . The only thing that made it difficult to hear , was the noise at times made in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . The Moderator called to order , and others around the Moderator , cried " Order ! Order ! " a few times . The greatest confusion was when Mr. Cleaveland rose . There were a great many cries of " Order ! " from those around the Moderator , and from that part of the house , mingled with coughing , scraping , hissing , and hushing , yet not so loud but that Mr. Cleaveland could be heard . Some efforts were made to keep down the noise . Several persons rose to their feet , and there was considerable confusion in the gallery . The noise commenced in the southern and south-western portions of the house . The Old-school occupied the seats in front , but they were most compact in the south-western corner , and there was more hissing there than in any other part . The lobby is under the pulpit , at the south end of the church , and from it there are two doors , one on each side of the pulpit , into the church . Formerly these doors had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places near the Moderator 's chair , entered by them . I had never before known them to be locked . The door on each side of the Moderator 's chair was locked . The seats around the Moderator 's chair , were all occupied by half past ten o'clock , but some persons could have stood in the vacant places . The locking of the doors compelled all who came afterwards to take seats further north . I have never before seen members thus seated at that hour . The whole roll , embracing all the commissioners from one hundred and thirty-five Presbyteries , was called in the Assembly that met in the church on Washington Square , once a day . I can not state how many answered to their names the first day , but ' I think from one hundred and seventeen to a hundred and twenty . There were some upon the roll who did not answer . Afterwards the number of those that answered , was about a hundred and thirty , some ten or twelve having been subsequently received . 1 think altogether there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty . The counsel lor the respondents objecting to the witness being exa- /z/ mined , in regard to the election of the relators as trustees , M7 Randall oflfered in evidence the Minutes ( New-school ) of 1S3S , to prove the election . P. 650 . ' ' Monday Morning , May ' ilst. * i. * " Overture No 4 , was reported by the Committee of Bills and Overtures , taken up and adopted , viz : " Resolved , That for the current year the Assembly will elpct six trustees of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . " Resolved that the election of said trustees be made the order of the day for Thursday forenoon at 10 o'clock , in the manner prescribed and adopted by the Assembly in 1801 , p. 198 , 199 , of the Digest . " P. 654-5 . " Thursday , May 2ith. * * * * " At 10 o'clock the Assembly proceeded to the order of the day , viz. the election of six Trustees of the General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed to receive the ballots and report the result . The Assembly ascertained that no vacancies in the Board of Trustees have occurred by death or otherwise . They then proceeded to try whether they could elect any of that third of the number of Trustees which they are permitted by law to change , by voting for a person to fill the place of the Rev. Ashbel Green , D. D. , the first on the list . On counting the votes it was ascertained that all the votes given were for James Todd , who was accordingly deidared by the Moderator to be a trustee duly chosen in the place of Ashbel Gren . In the same manner the Assembly procpeded to vote , and unanimously elected John R. Neffin the place of George C. Potts ; Frederick A. Raybold in the place of William Latta ; George W. McClelland in the place of Thomas Bradford ; William Darling in the place of Solomon Allen ; and Thomas Fleming in the place of Cornelius C. Cuyler ; thus changing as many of the trustees as they are permitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neff , Frederick A. Raybold , George W. McClelland , William Darling and Thomas Fleming were declared to be duly elected Trustees of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . " Mr. Gilbert  --  cross-examined by Mr. Hubbell . The vacant space , of which I spoke , is in front of the pulpit , and might be approached from the other doors . I passed through that space , when I went round to act as clerk . I could get to any part of the house , after the doors by the sides of the pulpit were locked , but , as the aisles were crowded , it was not as convenient for a modest man to do so , as if they had not been locked . All other but modest men could get seats as well as if the doors had not been locked , but the nearest way to the front seats was through the lobby doors . There are four other doors to the church besides the ones that were closed . I believe , that when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass into the church were open . It is not customary , I believe , in general , for people to pass through the doors from the lobby . The Assembly has met in that church , I think , at least seven or eight times . The persons in the galleries were females . A mixed congregation of males and females , such as is usually found in a church , were seated in the back pews , on the floor of the house . There were clamorous expressions of applause from the galleries , and other parts of the house during our proceedings , especially after Mr. Cleaveland 's last motion . I did not see , around where I stood , any who were not members of the Assembly . The brethren of the New-school occupied such seats as they could get , and , very probably , there may have been some who were not members in the same seats . I do not recollect whether the clerks  --  Mr. Krebs and Dr. McDowell , came into the house after I had entered . By Mr. Preston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , /z/ when Dr. Paltoii made his motion , or not . The clerks were in advance of Dr. Elliott , and both he and they continued to occupy the same places , so long as I saw them . The gentlemen who were seated near the pulpit , to the best of my recollection , also remained in their places as long as I saw them . The gentlemen of the Old-school were the majority . I do not know that our proceedings were entirely without the body of the Old-school , but they took place on its circumference . The body of the Old-school , intervened , in a compact mass , between us and Dr. Elliott . Dr. Beman was not conducted to the chair , but stood in the aisle , in the rear of the Old-school party . The seats of the Moderator and clerks are invariably in front of the members , but I have heard of an Assembly 's having held its session in the street , without any clerks at all . The Assembly of 1837 met at the gate of a church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be two Moderators of the Assembly at the same time . I have known , however , two sitting at the same time , both called Moderators . In the year 1837 , there was one at the gate of the church in Spruce street , and another in the Central Church ; but these were not in the same house . I have never known two persons to sit in the same house , both claiming to be Moderators . I am sure that some of the Old-school participated in our proceedings at the church in Ranstead Court . The mass of them did not go with us , but remained behind . The Old-school , I believe , had a majority . Mr. Preston . Did you understand , that the Old-school were taking a part in the proceedings which you have detailed , or that they had entirely segregated themselves , and took no part ? Mr. Randall objected to the witness giving his understanding of the matter . Mr. Hubbell . Such a question though not proper for an examination in chief , is proper for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain new testimony , but to qualify that already given . Judge Rogers . The only difference between questions proper for examination in chief , and those proper for cross-examination , is in their form . Mr. Preston . I wave the question . Cross-examination continued . The meeting before mentioned , at which the New-school concerted their plan of proceeding , was not composed exclusively of New-school men . No one was excluded . I saw there some who acted with the Old-school afterwards . Mr. Randall . We object to going into the proceedings of this informal meeting . Mr. Preston . The consultations of that meeting , and the concerted plan of operations formed by the party who held it , have already been given in evidence . I do not wish to establish what is before proved , but to deduce from the testimony a fact , of which we all know very well the existence  --  that there were in the church in Ranstead Court two separate and distinct bodies , acting independently of each other . But I wave the question , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cross-examination continued . I regarded all the members present in the Seventh Presbyterian Church , as participating in our proceedings . I had supposed that we should have a strong vote against us , and was agreeably surprised to hear so few noes . The Old-school men did not go with /z/ US on our adjournment to the First Presbyterian Church . I believe they were still in their seats when we left the house . We did not regard them as having any Moderator or clerks . Mr. Preston . You have said that the votes on the several motions were unanimous , or nearly so : do you mean by this , that all , or nearly all the members present agreed to the resolution , and considered themselves as taking a part in the proceedings , or are you speaking merely of a legal fiction ? Mr. Randall . We object to the question . , Mr. Preston . The word unanimous has been used b ) ? the witness : now it is well known that there was no unanimity on the occasion of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term he uses . Mr. Randall . The question calls for not merely the opinion of the witness , but goes one step further , and asks for his opinion as to what were the opinions of others . The question being waved , the Cross-examination was continued . Taking all the Commissioners to the Assembly of 1S3S , I think there was a small majority of Old-school men present . The proceedings of the consultation meeting were not exclusive of the Old-school party ; all were invited to attend . Mr. Randall . We object to all testimony as to that meeting . No part of the evidence given in regard to the informal meetings of either party was brought out in our examination in chief . We have only made inquiry into the fact of the doors being locked , and have not trespassed upon what happened in those meetings . Mr. Preston . I trust your Honour perceives the object we have in view . A part of the proceedings concerted at the meeting spoken of , were afterwards carried out in the Assembly . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the votes on , certain proceedings were nearly unanimous . But every gentleman present knows that these proceedings were schismatic , revolutionary , and violent . Then words are not here used in their common signification . The witness misrepresents , and satisfies his conscience by a mere legal fiction . We wish to discover the meaning which the gentleman affixes to his terms . The New-school party was a minority , and the Old-school , during the proceedings alluded to were segregated from them , and did not consider themselves as acting with them . The testimony is not offered for itself ; merely to elucidate the meaning of words . Mr. Wood . The thing may be gotten at appropriately , and by a simple inquiry into facts . It may be shown how many voted and how many did not vote ; that when the witness speaks of a majority , he means a majority of those who voted ; that some voted in the negative , and that some did not choose to vote . Then it may be shown that these last were the Old-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a motion is put what is a sufficient majority to decide it ? A majority of all who vole ? Or must there be a majority of all present ? This is a question of law . Who did or did not vote is a question of fact . As to asking for opinions , designs , purposes  --  it has already been decided that this is improper . The proof of previous concert has nothing to do , /z/ that I can see , with the meaning of the witnesses . The question of design will be discussed hereafter . Judge Rogers . Such testimony as to previous plans and purposes can not be admitted ; but the witness may be required to explain the meaning of the terms he uses . Cross-examination continued . I considered the votes on the motions put by Drs . Beman and Fisher , in the Seventh Church , as nearly unanimous . M7 Preston . Do you mean by unanimity , a mental acquiescence of the members of the Old-school party in yourproceedings ? Mr. Randall . I object to the witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , which he could not possibly inspect . Mr. Preston . I want an explanation of the term unanimous  --  which means , of one mind . Mr. Ingersoll . I would say one word , which I think appropriate here . The witness is asked for the meaning of a term he uses in regard to certain proceedings . My notion of those proceedings is , that , such was the spirit of confusion which prevailed , those who did not vote were taken by storm ; found a sudden tempest raised about them ; saw and heard something that took place , on their skirts , or border , they knew not exactly what . Now if the term unanimous is left unexplained a very erroneous impression may be produced . Judge Rogers . I have said that I admit the explanation . Mr. Randall . Will the counsel please to put the question in writing ? Mr. Preston , ( having written his question . ) The witness having said that the vote on Dr. Fisher 's nomination was unanimous , I ask , " By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intentional acquiescence or approbation of the appointment of Dr. Fisher , as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church ? " Mr. Randall . I thought there was something about mental reservation in the question before . Mr. Preston . no ! the mental reservations are not on our side . Mr. Meredith . It seems to me that there is no difference between the question now offered and that first put . It is not proper for either an examination in chief , or a cross-examination . We are here attempting to prove by parol evidence , the proceedings of a certain body ; but the question now proposed , leaving what actually took place , goes to the intentions of the members of that body . Is this legal testimony ? If instead of parol proof , a minute of the proceedings were offered , could such a crossexamination as this follow ? Could we go behind that minute and ask for the opinion of a witness , as to the intentions and opinions of those who acted ? What have we to do with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ? Here , not merely the opinion of the witness IS asked for , but his opinion of what were the opinions of others . He has no means of knowing any thing about the matter . It is true that unanimous , in a strict sense , means that there is a concert of minds , but as commonly used , it expresses the state of an actual vote only  - -  what is said , and not what is thought . Will you attempt to prove the intention with which a person voted aye , or no ? We have been told , and very properly told , by one of the learned counsel , that the exegetical TESTIMONY FOR THE RELATORS. g7 history of the Assembly is not to be brought into this court . The intention of its members is to be discovered only by their votes , not by an inquiry as to motives and designs . And how much less can it be ascertained from the opinion of the witness ? There can not be any thing more than a mere guess on such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the members of the Assembly intended to do what they did ? " Mr. Ingersoll . I beg your pardon ! He was asked to explain his use of the word unanimous . Judge Rogers . The counsel desire only an explanation of the meaning of the witness . I do not see how we can get along without it . Mr. Meredith . I now perceive a slight difference between this and the question first offered . I have hitherto considered it as an inquiry whether certain persons intended to vote . We make no objection to the witness explaining his use of the word unanimous . The question presents two aspects  --  the meaning of the words used by the witness , and whether the fact was so or so . We do not object to the mere explanation , but the witness must take care that he does not give also his opinion . Judge Rogers . The witness ' opinion is not evidence , but his meaning certainly is . Mr. Gilbert  --  the question having been repeated . I use the word according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several are in favour of a motion , and , the question being reversed , there are none opposed , it is said to be carried unanimously . No reference is had to the intentions of members . I did not use the word in reference to the vote on Dr. Fisher , but to that on Dr. Beman . I used it according to legal intendment , and according to our constitution . It is impossible for any one to say whether a majority voted . The vote was very loud  --  louder than usual , and the voices very numerous . I will not venture to say that a majority did vote . I do not know that but a minority voted . I am now speaking of actual voting . Mr. Preston . If a majority had voted against you , what would you have done then ? The question was objected to . Mr. Preston . The witness has already said that there was a previous understanding and concert among the members of the New-school . As they knew at this time that the Old-school had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do if voted down . I submit the question to your Honour , Judge Rogers . I do not think this a proper question . Re-examined by Mr. Randall . The seats where members usually sit were entirely occupied , when I entered the house . There was no vacant pew , though perhaps a few individual seats here and there . Mr. Preston . A word of explanation , if you please . I understood you to say , that some of the Old-school voted in the negative . Mr. Gilbert . I did not say that some of the Old-school voted ; but that the voices came from the part of the house where they sat . Re-examination continued . I have never before known a Moderator to refuse to put an appeal from his . decision . Our rules are express on this subject . Formerly the old rules of the Assembly were in force , until new ones were adopted . This was so until Mr , Breckinridge came into the Assembly , five yeaus ago , Mr , Breckinridge was the author of the gg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every session . The old rules , as I understand it , are in operation till new ones are adopted . Rev. Dr. Erskine Mason  --  swo ) m . I was a commissioner to the General Assembly of 1838 , from the Third Presbytery of New York , which is not within the bounds of the exscinded Synods . On the day appointed for the meetino ; of that Assembly , the third Thursday of May , I went to the church up Ranstead Court . As I was going up the court I met several individuals , by whom something was said in regard to seats inside . I went to the door of the house nearly facing the court , and looking in , saw persons thickly collected in the small aisle , I then went round to the door at the other end of the building , and walking down the middle aisle got as near the pulpit as I could ; I do n't recollect how many pws there were between me and the pulpit . I found the seats immediately in front of the pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ninth pew . I took my seat , and the preliminary religious exercises commenced . At the conclusion of these exercises , Dr. Elliott , the Moderator of the Assembly of 1837 , gave noticq , that after a benediction had been pronounced , he would come down and proceed to constitute the Assembly . Accordingly he came down and took a seat in front of , and below the pulpit . Then he made an introductory prayer , at the close of which Dr. Patton rose and addressed the Moderator . He said that he held in his hand certain resolutions and a preamble , which he desired to offer . The Moderator declared him out of order , saying that the next business was the report of the clerks . Dr. Patton replied that his resolutions would consume little time , and he would not debate them . The Moderator said he was out of order , as the first business was the clerk 's report of the roll of the Assembly . Dr. Patton said , that the resolutions he wished to offer had reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of order . Dr. Patton appealed to the house , and his appeal was seconded . The Moderator declared his appeal out of order , and said that the clerks had the floor . Dr. Patton reminded the Moderator , that he had the floor before the clerks . The Moderator directed the latter to proceed with the roll . At the conclusion of their report , the Moderator stated , that if there were any commissioners in the house , whose commissions had not been presented , now was the time to present them . I immediately rose , and stated that I held in my hand certain commissions to the Assembly of 1838 , and that the commissioners to whom they belonged were present ; that these commissions had been presented to the clerks of the last General Assembly and rejected by them ; and moved , that the roll be now completed , by adding the names of the commissioners from the Presbyteries within the bounds of the Synods of Utica , Geneva , Genesee , and Western Reserve . At that time the Moderator asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the close of the Assembly of 1837 . I answered , that they came from Presbyteries within the bounds of the Synods of Utica , Genesee , Geneva , and We'stern Reserve . The Moderator declared me out of order . I then said , that , with all due respect to him , I must appeal to the house . My appeal was seconded , but the Moderator declared it out of order , and refused to put it . After this appeal was declared out of order , the Rev. Miles P. Squier rose , stating that he had handed his commission to the clerks , and that they had refused it , and now , tendering it TESTIMONY FOR THE RELATORS. gg to the house , he demanded a seat , and that his name should be put on the roll . The Moderator asked from what Presbytery he came . Mr. Squier answered , from the Presbytery of Geneva . The Moderator asked whether that Presbytery belonged to the Sjmod of Geneva ; Mr. Squier answered , that it was within the bounds of the Synod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know you . " Then the Rev. John P. Cleaveland , from the Presbytery of Detroit rose , and said , in substance , that as the Assembly could not be constitutionally organized , unless by the admission of all the commissioners present , as some of these commissioners had been refused , and as the Moderator and clerks had not done their duty , therefore he moved , that Dr. N. S. S. Beman take the chair . This motion was seconded , and put by Mr. Cleaveland , who said , " All those who are in favour of the resolution will signify it by saying , aje , " and then , reversing , " All tliose who are opposed , will signify it by saying , no . " Mr. Cleaveland declared Dr. 3eman elected . There were some who voted , no . I heard distinctly two or three noes . They came from the quarter of the house in front and to the right of the pulpit . One person in the pew immediately in front of me said , " No ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pew in which he was sitting , and took his station in the middle aisle . At that time , some one nominated Mr. Gilbert and myself as temporary clerks . This motion was seconded and carried . I still had the commissions which I had offered in my hand , and acting as clerk , considered the commissioners to whom they belonged , of whom I had a list , as on the roll . Dr. Beman called for nominations for a Moderator . Dr. Fisher was nominated , and no one else . Dr. Beman put the vote , and Dr. Fisher was chosen by a large majority . There were some votes in the negative , coming from the same quarter as before . Dr. Beman declared Dr. Fisher elected , and made way for him to take the place which he had occupied . Dr. Fisher took it , and called for nominations for clerks . Mr. Gilbert and myself were nominated the question was put , and we were elected . At that moment , Dr. Beman either read a paper , or made a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by the Assembly , and moved that we now adjourn to meet , forthwith , in the lecture-room of the First Presbyterian Church . This motion was put and carried , and Dr. Fishei- ' gave notice of the adjournment , and said that any commissioners prescHt , who had not yet handed in their commissions to the Assembly , should do so at the place and time to which the Assembly had adjourned . Then the Assembly came to order in the lecture-room of the church on Washington Square , and Dr. Patton offered the resolutions which he had wished to offer before . I should here state , that all the commissioners from the Western Synods present were now on the roll , and several others were enrolled . Afterwards the business proceeded in the usual manner . In the church in Ranstead Court , the Moderator was further from me , than the body of the Old-school party . Most of them were between him and me , and had as good a chance as he had , or a better one , to hear what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were seconded by several voices . I myself seconded several of them . The Moderator asked me if the commissions which I offered , were from Presbyteries belonging to the exscinded Synods . I answered that they were . He then said that they could not be received . I then made a tender of them to him . /z/ When Dr. Patton arose there were a few calls to order , and when I got up , there were several . These calls came from that portion of the house occupied by the Old-school ' members . When Mr. Cleaveland commenced his statement , there were loud cries of order , coughing , and scraping on the floor , but these ceased before he had concluded . There was very little noise when Mr. Squier was on the floor . The calls to order ceased before I got through . There was no material disturbance during the colloquy between the Moderator and myself : at first there were some calls to order , but these subsided . All the motions put , were put in an audable voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversed . That on the election of Moderator I am sure was ; and , to the best of my knowledge , that on the choice of clerks also . I should think ample opportunity was giv.en to all the members present to vote . The scraping and hissing seemed to come from that portion of the house where the Old-school were . Standing as I did , I could not see what took place in that part of the house ; my attention was directed before me . When Mr. Cleaveland made his remarks , he faced the Moderator . I also faced the Moderator when I was on the floor . So did Dr. Patton , and Mr. Squier . The mass of the Old-school party was between me and the Moderator . Mr. Randall . I will examine Dr. Mason hereafter , in regard to some other points , not immediately connected with the organization of the Assembly of 1838 . Cross-examined by Mr. Preston . I am clerk of the General Assembly . I am not in possession of the paper read by Mr. Cleaveland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether the paper on the minutes is that offered by Mr. Cleaveland . I did not prepare the minutes : Mr. Gilbert , the Permanent Clerk , prepared them . I never saw the paper , or read it . I was in the same pew with Dr. Beman . He sat at the door , and Mr. Cleaveland at the other end . I can not recollect the others who were in the pew . I think a gentleman named Nixon was there . The pew was full . When I was a ) pointed clerk , I took my station in the aisle . I stood , and had no pen or ink , but I had paper and a pencil . I had in my hand the commissions which I had tendered to the Moderator , and another paper containing the roll of the members of the General Assembly , including the names of those commissioners who had been rejected by the clerks . This roll was on two pieces of paper , one containing the names previously read by the clerk , and the other those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with Mr. Gilbert , had made out this roll on the floor of the house , partly from the report of the clerks , and partly from other sources , as from the information of persons who were commissioners . I had no commissions in my possession but those which 1 had offered . The others were in the possession of the clerks of the last Assembly . My own I had given to the clerks : that is , it had been given to them . The names of all the commissioners from our Presbytery were enrolled in one commission . I considered the list which I held in my hand as the roll . That was my first act . I had the names on paper , and I considered that putting them on the roll was my first act . I had really so far put them on the roll , that if it had been necessary to call it , I should have called all the names . That consideration was my first official act . /z/ Mr. Preston . Were any other of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not report any roll until we got to the First Church . The first roll had already been reported at the other house . I reported the additional names of the commissioners from the four exscinded Synods . Mr. Krebs had reported the former at the other house , and , I presume , the other commissions are in the possession of the clerks of iS3S . I can not say , precisely , how m.any were in the possession of the clerks of our house . They are not all here in this bundle . About a ' dozen were handed in after our adjournment , to the best of my recollection . Our roll was made up of those names which we had caught from the report of Mr. Krebs , with those taken from these commissions , and from the ten or twelve presented afterwards . The officers were chosen by a large majority  --  a majority , I may say without hesitation , of all who voted . There is a rule , contained in the appendix to the Book of Discipline , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the affirmative . So then , if but two voted in the affirmative , and only one in the negative , a motion would be carried . I have no means of determining , whether a majority of all the members present voted in the affirmative . I should not like to say that a majority did so vote ; but I have no doubt that a majority voted one way or the other . I can not say how many New-school men retired from the Seventh Church .  --  More than fifty-five or sixty : I should think , more than seventy . I can not state whether there were a hundred . I took no account till afterwards . I judged of the majority by the sound of the voices , and from the number who answered in the negative . I suppose that those persons , who were afterwards in the Assembly with us , voted in the affirmative . This is one reason of my conclusion in regard to the majority . Court adjourned . MONDAY MORNING , March 1 1th  --  10 o'clock . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say , certainly , whether the roll made up in the church in Ranstead Court was written by myself I had made out one , as far I could , before the house met ; and one was furnished by another person . I had made mine as full as I could . I forget which of the two was used . The deficiency in it was supplied as the clerks read . I took down names , in two instances , myself , but do not recollect that I took more than two . It was well known , beforehand , who would be the commissioners : their names had been published in the newspapers . The roll was not verified at the First Presbyterian Church , by the production of commissions . We had not the commissions which had been handed in to the clerks of 1S37 . These the ones contained in the bundle which had been given in evidence are all the commissions which we had , at first . The roll which we used in organizing the Assembly was obtained from the sources which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the commissions , if they had not been examined by the regular clerks before . I did examine each commission which I had , attentively , according to the rules of the Church . To the best of my recollection , I found them all regular . I dfl'not remember finding any fault . In making the /z/ roll , I did not compare these commissions with the form prescribed . The constitution does not prescribe any form , or , at least , any form which is obligatory  --  which must strictly be adhered to . It gives a form , and then says , " this , or a like form , " shall be used . This a commission from the Presbytery of Geneva having been handed to him is one of those thjt I examined . I would pronounce it regular . I approved of it at that time . I appealed , when the Moderator refused to put my motion . I said , that , " with the greatest respect for the Chair , I must appeal from that decision . " The right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals are often made . I can not recollect whether the right is expressly granted in the constitution . It is provided for in the regulations which have been made by the Assembly , and recommended by them to all the courts of the Church . An appeal is made to every person present at the time in the house . When the General Assembly is organized , an appeal is made to the house as organized . I intended to make mine to all those who had commissions . All there , who held commissions , were , unquestionably , members of the Assembly of 1838 , and my appeal was made to them . Mr. Preston . Did you make your appeal to the Assembly , or to the gentlemen present in the house ? Dr. Maso7i . I made it to all the persons present who had commissions ; them I considered members of the Assembly of 1838 . Mr. Preston . Did you make it to an organized Assembly , or to disorderly individuals ? Dr. Mason . That question asks for my opinion merely . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colloquy with the witness ; I will explain the question to the Court . One great difficulty under which we labor , is the use of technical terms , which may be understood in one sense by the witness , and in another by the jury . He has spoken of an appeal  --  an appeal from the decision of the Moderator . We want to get at his intendment  --  to find out the tribunal to which he appealed . Dr. Mason . I intended to appeal from the Moderator to all the persons who had commissions , whom I considered members of the As-sembly , Mr. Preston . Do you consider it the legitimate practice , to appeal from a constitutional Moderator to an unconstitutional Assembly ? This question was objected to . Mr. Preston . I will modify it so as to bring it within the rule . Has it been the practice to appeal from a constitutional Moderator to an unconstitutional Assembly ? Dr. Mason . I am , comparatively , a young man , and therefore can not speak with certainty as to the practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to take an appeal to the body over which the Moderator presides . Mr. Preston . Over what body was the Moderator presiding ? Dr. Mason . Our constitution will tell you , that he was presiding in the organization of the Assembly until a new Moderator should be appointed . This is my opinion . A new Moderator had not been appointed when I took my appeal . The new officers of the Assembly , as /q/ I Stated yesterday , took their station in the middle aisle . They were all nearly in contact . Mr. Preston . When the temporary Moderator had been chosen , what was the form of his induction into office ? Dr. Mason . Dr. Beman , when called upon , stepped out of the pew in which he had been sitting , and took his place in the middle aisle . Mr. Preston . Well , what was the form of Dr. Beman 's abdication , and of his induction of Dr. Fisher into office ? Mr. Mason . Dr. Beman declared Dr. Fisher elected . I can not recollect whether Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was not very great . Dr. Beman stepped back , and Dr. Fisher took his place . He did not call the Assembly to order , but called for business . I do n't know that many were standing on the seats of the pews . All these things were transacted as rapidly as they conveniently could be . I can not say what Dr. Elliott was doing during this time . After Mr. Cleaveland 's resolution , I did not pay particular attention to him . I do n't know whether he retained his seat or not ; or whether he used the hammer , or called us to order . I can not say whether the Newschool party were generally standing up : some of them were . My attention was directed to what was passing'around me , and I did not see the Moderator or clerks . I do not know that any proceedings were , during this time , conducted by the Moderator or clerks . I did n't hear any thing going on in that quarter . I had the roll made out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pencil . There were , on the roll which was called at the First Presbyterian Church , the names of several persons who did not appear till some days afterwards ; but they were all on the roll reported by the clerks of 1837 . Such was the case I recollect in regard to Mr. Boynton , an elder from the Synod of Albany . I do not recollect whether Mr.Martin and Mr. Fabrigue , from Salem Presbytery , appeared at the opening of the Assembly . I do n't remember at what time Mr. Glover , or Mr. Stewart , from Charleston Union Presbytery , appeared . I recollect only the case I have mentioned ; but I think there were others of the same kind . Mr. Boynton was enrolled ; but I do n't know whether he ever took his seat with us . I can not tell immediately how many took their seats in our General Assembly ; but the number enrolled was not far from one hundred and thirty . Nearly the whole of these took their seats . I do not include those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll included all those . My opinion is that a majority of all on the full roll did not take seats with us . By Mr. Hubbell . I used to belong to the Synod of Albany , and therefore Mr. Boynton 's name was impressed upon my memory . By Mr. Preston . I do n't recollect whether Dr. Green 's name was on our roll . He did not sit with us , nor did Mr. Robert J. Breckinridge . The case which I have mentioned was like one of these : Mr. Breckinridge is therefore another instance . I never attended the Assembly at the Church in Ranstead Court , after we had retired from that place . I went once afterwards to the house , but the Assembly had adjourned . The gentleman who had been Moderator next before Dr. Elliott was , I think . Dr. Phillips . I do not know whether he was present . To the best of my recollection , the one next before him was Dr.Wm . A. McDowell , but I do n't know whether ' - he was present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina was the one before him or not . He was Moderator in either 1835 , or 1836 . Each of those whom I have mentioned has held that office since Dr. Beman . By Mr. Hubbell . Mr. Boynton 's name was read by the clerks of 1837 , and in this way I know that we had it enrolled . I saw afterwards their printed roll : Mr. Boynton 's name was not there . I do not recollect whether the names of Mr. S. Glover and Mr. R. L. Stewart , elders from Charleston Union Presbytery , were on our roll . ( The Minutes ( Newschool ) of 1838 being put in his hand  --  p. 645 . ) They are on the list . They did not attend our Assembly . I do n't know how I got their names , unless as I got the others  --  from the publications of the day . I do not recollect from which Presbytery Mr. Boyton came  --  I think it was either Londonderry or Newburyport . Messrs . Glover and Stewart never answered to their names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with taking names off of the roll after the Assembly was organized . I had something to do with the preparation of the minutes for publication . I did not know that there were any such names on the roll . I can not state whether I heard their names read from the roll of the clerks of 1837 . If not on their roll , we had no reason for putting , them on ours , and they ought not to have been put there . I do n't recollect whether their names are on the printed roll of 1838 . Mr. Wm . W. Martin , and Mr. Henry L. Fabrigue , from Salem Presbytery , Synod of Indiana , were on our roll ; I do n't know whether their names were on Mr Krebs ' . I do n't remember examining the commissions of either . Originally their names had been published in the paper . We had no authority to put down any but those on Mr. Krebs ' roll . I ca n't say whether I took them from that ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brayton from the Presbytery of Oneida , I think presented his commission originally to me , and I examined it . I do not recollect in regard to Dr. James Richards of Cayuga , but think his case was similar to Mr. Brayton 's . I think I examined the conmmission of the Rev. Samuel W. Brace . He was from the Presbytery of Cayuga : I recollect that Dr. Richards and he were in the same commission , but not as principal and alternate . They came in after the opening of the Assembly . We had the commission of Mr. Justin Marsh , of Marshall Presbytery . Mr. Adam Miller , of the Presbytery of Montrose , came to our body , in the First Presbyterian Church . There was some difficulty in regard to his commission . His case was referred to the Committee of Elections , and being allowed to give evidence of his appointment , he was admitted . Mr. Jotham Goodell I do not remember . To the best of my recollection , we had the commission of Dr. John H. Haynes ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say whether Dr. Witherspoon was present in the church in Ranstead Court : I do n't know him . I do not recollect that inquiry was made , whether any person that had been Moderator subsequently to Dr. Beman was present . I do not recollect whether we called the names of Dr. Witherspoon and Dr. Phillips on our roll . They both were on it . They did not present their commissions to us , I do n't remember whether I took their names from Mr. Krebs ' roll . By Mr. Ingersoll . I recollect that the sexton of the First Presbyterian Church was at the other house , and that when we adjourned , he ran off before us . I saw him going before us. /q/ Mr. Wood . What complaints were made , in the Assembly of 1837 , in regard to irregularities in the Synods of New Jersey and Albany ? Mr. Hubbell . We object to the question . Mr. Wood . I will ; hange it . Were there any Congregational churches in those Synods ? Mr. Hubbell . We still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the court . Mr. Hubbell . The testimony offered is entirely foreign to the matter in hand , and it is peculiarly improper that it should be brought out in the r , e-examination of the witness . Mr. Wood . I offer in evidence the minutes of 1837 , page 496 . " Resolved , That the Synods of Albany and New Jersey , be enjoined to take special order in regard to the subject of irregularities in church order , charged by common fame upon some of their Presbyteries and churches . " Now I want this matter explained . Judge Rogers . What is the pertinency of this evidence , Mr. Wood ? Mr. Wood . The Assembly of 1837 abrogated the " Plan of Union , " and cut oflf four Synods ; and they based these acts on the idea of there being a necessity for them , becaube of the irregular admission of Congregationalists into the Church . We insist , that they might have cut off Congregational , without cutting off any Presbyterian churches , and that they did this very thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This inquiry is entirely foreign to the case : it has no bearing upon the organization of the Assembly of 1838 . It is not offensive , but improper . We shall have enough to do in disposing of all the matters that legitimately belong to the case , without going into those foreign to it . We object to the testimony as irrelevant . Mr. Wood . I presume that the court and jury by this time see clearly the true point at issue , and that it is totally impossible to understand the proceedings of 1838 , unless we go back to those of 1837 . I am not surprised that the counsel for the defendants wish to shut their eyes upon this subject . They may talk of a little matter of irregularity , or of a little noise and confusion ; of this seat , or that seat ; of this hammer , or that cane ; but all these are trifles light as air . The great point in this case is the exscinding resolutions of 1837 , the operation of which the Old-school party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of the pledges exacted from the clerks . This is the true point ; but it presents a question in regard to resolutions of which the opposite party are now ashamed . Had they a right to carry out the void acts of the Assembly of 1837 , in the organization of the Assembly of 1838 ? Here was the ground on which sve displaced the Moderator and clerks . They were acting out the illegal proceedings of 1837 : they were attempting to organize an unlawful Assembly . There is a principle of law , respecting all collective bodies whether they are corporations themselves , or like the General Assembly , supply or feed corporate bodies , and are therefore rwaz corporate  --  a principle which is well settled . It is this : No Assembly can be lawfully constituted without the admission of all entitled to seats , or without giving to all an opportunity to come in . On this occasion , the Old-school party , under the Moderator and clerks of 1837 , were about to organize the General Assembly , without admitting the representatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , and to this we want to bring our opponents . We mean to show that this was the ground of our displacing that Moderator and those clerks , appointing new ones ' , and proceeding to organize the body in a lawful manner , by bringing within its pale every member , both New and Old-school . It is all important to inquire into the character of the exscinding resolutions : they are like the baseless fabric of a vision . It is alleged that the mixture of Congregationalism , which it is said was found in the four Western Synods , was the reason of their being cut off . But why not take the same order in regard to these , which they did in regard to the Synods of Albany and New Jersey ? We now desire to show that they knew full well they could do this . They did not , however , attempt it , but at one fell swoop , pounced on older Presbyteries , merely because they were alleged to contain a few Congregational churches . There were churches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany and New Jersey , but for some reason , those Synods did not share the fate of the . others . We therefore wish to show that the Assembly did take order in regard to the former , for the very same cause for which they cut off the latter . If we show this we leave the Old-school party without the colour of a pretence for cutting off these Synods without trial or accusation . Mr. Randall . Your Honour will recollect the course of examination pursued by the counsel on the other side , in the case of Mr. Squier . Out of the regular order of proceedings , they inquired into the fact , whether there were any Congregational churches in the four Synods . We , then , have a right to consider this as matter of defence  --  that these persons were cut off without hearing , because they lived in an infected district . Judge Rogers . The reasons given for the act on the minutes , are different from those that the counsel assign . I do n't know which ground the defendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into before . We want to show that the mother Synod of Albany was as obnoxious to the charges on which the exscinding acts were founded , as its offspring ; and that if the Assembly had been at all consistent , it would have excluded the Synod of Albany , the mother of the Synod of the Western Reserve , and the Synod of Michigan , the child of the latter . Nay , the friends of Mr. Preston , in Charleston , ought to have been included , for there too there are Independent churches , which are as obnoxious as Congregational ones , mingled with the Presbyterian churches . Now the ground taken by the Oldschool is untenable , unless their acts be carried out to their legitimate extent . As they have not been thus carried out , they must be considered as an arbitrary and capricious discrimination , made with an ulterior , a covert design . If the Assembly stated the true cause , it ought to have been consistent in its acts . This point is directly germane to the evidence already given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reserved for the defence ; but as the opposite counsel have introduced it , as they have extracted evidence on this subject from Mr. Squier , we certainly may pursue the course thus opened . It is undoubtedly very strange , that a Presbyterian minister should be excluded , because he happens to live within the bounds of a Synod containing a few Congregational churches . Not because any one of all these five hundred and ninty-nine clergymen is not a Presbyterian : such an allegation has been avoided . Not because any one of them is a heretic ; but , living within bounds in /q/ which there are Congregational churches , they are ipso facto disrobed . Though born in the Presbyterian Church ; though many of them fathers of that church , you send them all off into the world ; you tell them , " We do not know you , yoii are not within the fold . " Can any testimony be more german to the issue ? The Old-school have chosen to adopt this ground : we propose to try who has a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excision are a mere pretext  --  I say it with respect  - -  or they would have followed up those acts consistently . With a high hand they have made arbitrary stretches of power , but whenever the rays of truth shine upon their acts , must appear their flagrant enormity . Mr. Sergeant . It is the most natural thing in the world , that each party should look at their own side with affectionate interest , and conceive all sorts of strange notions in regard to their adversaries . It is natural that each party should endeavour to pry into the designs and impugn the motives of the other ; to give their opponents a bad name . This course , however , we have not adopted . So far as my observation has gone , not a single hard word has been said by any one of my colleagues , but I am sorry to say , that there has not been the same abstinence exercised towards us . By the opposite counsel , hard words have been used , and unwarrantable motives imputed , not only to-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this we answer , we are before a court and jury , with a fit case to be decided by them ; that as to our own conduct , it is for ourselves to decide , and that we are not to be instructed on this point by others . The counsel may consider a question very trifling which is really of great pith and importance , and they may do so sincerely . Or they may attempt to ridicule and belittle questions which are greatly embarassing them , in order that they may escape into others of more easy management . They impute to us a design to keep out the light . Let me tell both these gentlemen , that we stand here upon our rights , and that no imputation whatever , from any quarter , shall drive us from this ground . If we consider any point material we will endeavour to make it appear so ; and what is not deemed material we shall try to exclude . We will not allow all the questions in the world to be drawn into this case : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions which are here called little , and some called great . Why , may it please your Honour , in this scuffling world , any question may be little or may be great , according to circumstances ; and one may be just as great as another . Certainly any ground on which a right stands , is strong enough to support that right . The other party have had full license to bring up this case for the consideration of the court , as they have thought best . We have not interfered in their plans , and if now they find themselves straightened in the issue which they have chosen , it is not our fault . If they please , they may even yet stop and begin again . What is the issue which has been selected by the learned counsel on the other side ? My colleague has already correctly . " stated it , and whether the question presented be a little or a great one , it is certainly their own question . They say that the body which met in the First Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that , as such , that body was authorized to elect a certain number of new trustees , which they are said to have done , thereby vacating the seats of the same number of the former trustees ; and they now call upqq tbeVourt to expel the latter from theiy places . Is /z/ gg PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CASE . not here the issue ? They say that they are the true General Assembly , This we deny . Now they want to go back and inquire , why we exscinded certain portions of the Church , and not content with even this to inquire why we did not exscind certain other portions . In what part of the argument have the counsel shown the bearing of this testimony upon the issue ? How does it make them the General Assembly , and give them the power of electing new trustees , and vacating the seats of the old ones ? It has not the least bearing or effect . It is only leading your Honour and this jury into an investigation , the limits of which it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to assume the powers of the General Assembly itself . How will such evidence contribute to establish the legality of their organization ? It is foreign to the subject , unless it can show that their Assembly sprung forth , though a child of confusion , still a full-grown and healthy child , able to destroy its own parent . I shall not undertake to express any opinion as to the proceedings of our opponents . I will not ascribe to them fraudulent designs : still less say that they are ashamed , which they have perhaps no more reason to be than we have : still less that the counsel now desire to form a new issue . The true question here , and that which must be broken off and separated from every other is , which body was the true Assembly . This is the sole issue . There may be a great deal even in the little hammer : perhaps it is not without real weight . The place of organization may be of considerable import . There may be a great many different things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Presbyterian Church was not the General Assembly . We not only object to the testimony offered , but think it very extraordinary . There was no objection made in the Assembly of 183S , to receiving the commissioners from these Synods . There was to be sure an admonition given by the Assembly of 1837 , that the Synods of Albany and New Jersey should guard against any infusion of Congregationalism ; or that they should get rid of such an infusion . That was all . On any and all these grounds , we contend that this testimony has no relation to the issue ; and we say that if admitted , it will lead into an interminable investigation . Judge Rogers . I think this inquiry is foreign to the subject . We must determine the legality of the Assembly 's proceedings as to the exscinded Synods , not whether they were impartial . Dr. Mason  --  re-examined by Mr. Wood . By the direction of the Assembly of 1838 , I went to Dr. McDowell , and demanded from him the books and papers of the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He declined altogether to give me any paper . Mr. Cleaveland , as a preliminary to his motion , stated in substance , that , as it seemed impossible to organize the Assembly of 1838 , under its present officers , since a number of commissioners had been refused their seats , and as it was necessary to proceed to its organization , he hoped it would be considered a matter not of discourtesy , but of necessity ; and he moved that Dr. Beman should take the chair . By Mr. Randall . This commission ( a paper having been handed to him , ) is the one that Mr. Squier presented . Mr. Boynton I never saw on the ground during the meeting of the Assembly . Mr. Krebs ' roll might have containecl the name , though itclid iot appear on the printed roll . /q/ Mr. Huhbell . Could a name have been properly put on Mr. Krebs ' roll , without the commissioner being present ? Dr. Mason . Sometimes the names of all the delegates from a Presbytery are in one commission , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name may get on the roll . I do n't know how it was in this case . Cross-examined by Mr. Ingersoll . There was no written communication made to Dr. McDowell , in regard to the papers of the Assembly . Mr. Krebs , when I called on him , was not at home : I addressed a note to hirn , and received an answer . Mr. Randall , We will now call on Mr. Krebs , for the original roll of the Assembly of 1838 . ' Mr. Krebs . It is in the hands of Dr. McDowell . ( The roll was sent for . ) ' ' Mr. Randall . While we are waiting for the roll , I will read in evidence a portion of the minutes of 1837 , page 411 . Mr. Preston . I should like to know whether the whole of those minutes are not in evidence . Unless they are , I object to the reading of extracts . Judge Rogers . Each part that is pertinent to the issue I consider in evidence ; and as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Randall then read as follows : " The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church , in the United States of Ameica , met agreeably to appointment , in the Central Presbyterian Church , in the city of on Thursday , the 18th day of May , 1S37 , at 11 o'clock A. M. , and was opened with a sermon , by the Rev. John Witherspoon , D. D. , the Moderator of the last Assembly , from 1 Corinthians i. 10 , 11 . ' Now I beseech you , brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thingf , and that there be no division amonor you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together m the same mind , and in the same judgment . For it hath been declared to me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you . ' " After public worship , the Assembly was constituted with prayer , in the lectureroom of the Central Church , and had a recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . " The Standing Committee of Commissions reported that the following persons present have been duly appointed commissioners to this General Assembly , viz. " ( Here follows the roll . ) Fortn of Government , Chap . XII . Sect. 7.  --  " The General Assembly shall meet at least once in every year . On the day appointed for that purpose , the Moderator of the last Assembly , if present , or , in case of his absence , some other minister , shall open the meeting with a sermon , and preside until a new Moderator be chosen . No commissioner shall have a right to deliberate or vote in the Assembly until his name shall have been enrolled by the clerk , and his commission publicly read , and filed among the papers of the Assembly . Appendix to Constitution  --  General Rules for Judicatories.  --  " 1 . The Moderator shall tiike the chair precisely at the hour to which the judicatory stands adjourned : he shall immediately call the members to order ; and , on the appearance of a quorum , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quorum be assembled at the hour appointed , and the Moderator be absent , the last Moderator present shall be requested to take his place without delay . " Mr. Gilbert recalled by Mr. Randall . The appearance of the names of Messrs . Martin and Fabrigue , on the printed roll , was an error of the printing committee . These names were not on the previous record ; but the committee took a wrong roll . /z/ Cross-examined by Mr. Preston . The roll which I used was originally taken from that of Mr.Krebs , and was amended , by the addition of the names , from commissions afterwards handed in . I took down the roll as he read it , by the assistance of such preparation as I had been able to make before . The names had been published in the Presbyterian : I took some from that , some from persons who held commissions , and some from other sources . Then while Mr. Krebs read , I watched , and erased or inserted names , according to circumstances . After he had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had read it . I mean to say , that I corrected my roll , which had been prepared from the Presbyterian and other sources , by the reading of Mr. Krebs . I made the corrections as well as I could . I had not the commissions of all the members ; but probably about a third part of them . I think I saw the commissions of more than one half : they were handed to me by the persons who held them . I saw the commissions from all the exscinded Presbyteries , and a great many others , before they were presented at the Seventh Church . They were not submitted to me , as clerk of the General Assembly . I was acting in an official capacity at the time : I was clerk of the consultative meeting . Mr. Preston . Was it as clerk of the meeting for consultation , that you saw those commissions ? Mr. Randall . We object to the witness going into that meeting for consultation . Judge Rogers . I do not think it a proper question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , and I wish him to explain his meaning . He says that these commissions were presented to him , and that he was acting at the time in an official capacity . We wish to show , that they were not submitted to him as clerk of the General Assembly . Mr. Gilbert . They were not presented to me as clerk of any body . I was requested by some one , I can not tell who , to look at them . Mr. Wood objected to the witness speaking farther of this matter . Cross-examination continued . There was no formal request made by any organized body ; but some one suggested that it would be best for us to see the commissions . By ' ' us , " I mean the delegates to the consultation meeting . We saw the commissions in the session-room of the First Presbyterian Church , in the hands of the members . This view of them was previous to the meeting of the Assembly . I did not see them in the hands of Mr. Krebs . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from half  --  perhaps , from one hundred and thirty to a hundred and forty . I can not say whether I saw any of the commissions of the Old-school , but think I did  - -  speaking here of the Old-school as a party in Church politics . I had seen the paper which was presented by Mr. Cleaveland . The substance of it is on our records . The paper on the record is nearly the same , but not identical ; perhaps it contains something taken from his interspersed remarks . It contains a few things which I did not myself hear . He held the paper in his hand , and read it , interspersing it with remarks , by way of apology to Dr. Elliott . Some things are in the record which I did not hear , though I thought I heard every word . I did not see the paper ' in its last shape . I am the recording clerk , and copied the minute from TESTIMONY FOR THE RELATORS . JQl a paper presented , but it was not the one which Mr. Cleaveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubbell . The insertion of the names of Messrs . Martin and Fabrigue , I have said , - was a mistake of the printing committee . I requested them to insert the roll at a particular place , and they inserted a wrong one . I did not see the proof-sheet , and can not say from what they printed . I furnished them with a roll for printing . There was a roll read at the opening of our Assembly , with those names upon it . This is not the roll completed by the clerks ; there is that error in it . The uames of these two men were called at the opening of our Assembly , and afterwards , perhaps for some days , but not very long . The error was then discovered and corrected . I do not know , that there is any necessity for inserting the roll on the minutes , but it is customary to do so . I struck out the two names by erasure  --  I can not say when . There was perhaps more than one copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With my roll , which had not these two names upon it , before them , the printing committee probably took the two names from another roll . I struck their names off , because I found I had made a mistake , and had not heard them answer . I saw a notice in the papers , that these gentlemen sat in the other Assembly . The names of Glover and Stewart I must have understood , were on Mr. Krebs ' roll . I think it very probable I made a mistake as to these two also . My recollection in regard to the matter is not very distinct . We called the names of all those who remained in the church in Ranstead Court , regularly once a day , until the close of our session . I do not now recollect , whether at the time when I gave the roll to the printing committee , I knew that I had made a mistake as to Messrs . Glover and Stewart . So far as I remember , I had not discovered the error . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleaveland , as they are recorded in the minutes , and read them aloud . Mr. Gilbert , reading  --  " The Rev. John P. Cleaveland , of the Presbytery of Detroit , rose , and stated in substance as follows : That as the commissioners to the General Assembly of 1838 , from a large number of Presbyteries , had been refused their seats ; and as we had been advised , by counsel learned in the law , that a constitutional organization of the Assembly must be secured at this time and in this place , he trusted it would not be considered as an act of discourtesy , but merely as a matter of necessity , if we now proceed to organize the General Assembly of 1838 , in the fewest words , the shurtest time , and with the least interruption practicable . He therefore moved that Dr. Beman , from the Presbytery of Troy , be Moderator , to preside till a new Moderator be chospn . " Mr. Cleaveland did not address the Moderator when he made these remarks : his face was towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Moderator . " I did not hear the word " interruption , " and some others . He said , in addition to what is there recorded , that it was no matter in what part of the house the Moderator stood . I do n't recollect any other additional words . He had a paper , from which he read , and he interspersed the reading with parenthetical remarks . I understood him to read the whole of the paper . This is the paper , in substance . It contains every main idea of his speech , so far as I recollect . Cross-examined by Mr. Hubbell . It is usual , in difficult cases , to appoint a committee to prepare a minute . This was done in the present instance ; the committeOrreported the minute , and it was adopted . /z/ Rev. Dr. Samuel Fisher  --  sworn . I was a member of the Assembly of 1S3S , from the Presbytery of Newark , Synod of New Jersey . I attended the meeting , on the third Thursday in May , in the Seventh Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I am not quite positive as to the time , ) handed in my commission to Dr. McDowell , in the committee-room , and then going round to the east door , walked down the side aisle . I found the seats near the pulpit occupied . I spoke to Dr. Green and others , and sat down on a bench in front of the pews ; but finding this seat uncomfortable , walked up the aisle about one-fourth of the distance from the front pew to the rear of the church , found a pew not yet full , and took a seat at the far end of it . Dr. Elliott concluded his discourse and then gave notice , that , after the blessing had been pronounced , he would take the seat before the pulpit , and proceed to constitute the Assembly . Accordingly , he came down , and constituted the Assembly by prayer . As soon as he had prayed . Dr. Patton rose , and addressed him , saying that he had some resolutions which he lesired to offer . The Moderator told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the report of the clerks upon the roll . Dr. Patton replied , that he was very desirous to present them at that time . The Moderator told him , he was out of order , and , the second time , directed the clerk to proceed with the roll . Dr. Patton appealed from the decision , and his appeal was seconded . The Moderator declared the appeal out of order , and refused to put it to the house ; and , I think , told the clerk to go on , or said that the next business was the report upon the roll , or something , to that effect . Dr. Patton said that his resolutions had reference to that very object . Dr. Elliott told him , that he was out of order ; that the clerks had the floor . Dr. Patton said , that he had had the floor before the clerks . The Moderator told him , he was out of order , and he then sat down . The clerk having finished the roll , and stated that there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it was at this time , ) was appointed . Dr. Mason then rose , and presented a resolution to the effect , that the names of the commissioners from the four Synods of Utica , Geneva , Genesee , and Western Reserve , should be added to the roll , saying that they had been presented to the clerks , and by them refused . He was called to order . Then a conversation took place between him and Dr. Elliott . Dr. Elliott asked , whether those commissions came from Presbyteries within the bounds of , or belonging to , the Presbyterian Church at the close of the sessions of the Assembly of 1837 . Dr. Mason replied , that they were within the bounds of the four Synods mentioned , naming them again . The Moderator said , " They can not be received . " Dr. Mason replied , that he must , respectfully , appeal to the house from that decision . His appeal was seconded ; but the Moderator declared it to be out of order . Dr. Mason then held up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the names should be put upon the roll . He was again pronounced out of order , and he sat down . Immediately , the Rev. Miles P. Squier rose , on the opposite side of the aisle , and held up a commission , which he said he had received from the Presbytery of Geneva . He said , that it had been presented to the clerks , but that they had refused him his seat . The Moderator asked , if the Presbytery of Geneva belonged to , or was connected with , the Synod of Geneva . Mr. Squier answered , that it was within the bounds of the Synod of Geneva . The Moderator /q/ replied , " We do not know you . " Then Mr. Cleaveland , from the Presbytery of Detroit , rose , with a paper in his hand , but did not read all from the paper . I sat in the next pew to him , and had seen the paper before . He prefaced his remarks by saying , that whereas the Moderator and clerks had refused to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had repeatedly refused to perform the duties incumbent upon them , so that the Assembly could not be regularly organized ; and as we had been advised by counsel , learned in the law , that it must be organized at that time , and in that place , therefore he moved that Dr. Beman should be Moderator of the preliminary meeting . This motion was seconded , put to vote by Mr. Cleaveland , and carried by a large majority . Dr. Beman stepped out of the pew , and walked up the aisle the ' width of three or four slips , to about the distance of twenty-five or thirty feet from me , and stated , that the next business would be the election of clerks . Dr. Mason and Mr. Gilbert were nominated ; the nomination was seconded , and the question put , and carried by a large majority . Afterwards he stated , that the next business was the election of a Moderator . Some person nominated me ; the nomination was seconded , and the question was put , and carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but did not stand on the seat , that is not my habit  --  I walked to the front of the pew , and into the aisle , within a few steps of where Dr. Beman stood . When Dr. Beman declared me elected Moderator , he turned towards me , and told me , that I should be governed by the rules that the Assembly shold adopt . After this , I took the station which he had left , saying , that the next business was the choice of clerks , and called for nominations . Dr. Mason and Mr. Gilbert were nominated , and none others . I put the question , in a distinct and loud voice , and it was carried by a large majority . I said , " All those who are in favor will say , aye ; " then , " Those opposed will say , no . " I used very few words . After the clerks had been appointed , a motion was made to adjourn to the First Presbyterian Church . This was seconded , and put , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was carried . I then announced , that if any persons had not presented their commissions they should present them at the First Presbyterian Church . We went to the First Church , and conducted our business as usual . I sat looking toward the south-western portion of the house , and heard all that passed . I have detailed the facts as correctly as possible . I mean by a majority , what is usually called so , in our ecclesiastical judicatories . There , when a question is put , and voted upon viva voce , if there are one hundred ayes , and but ten noes , the motion is said to be carried by a large majority . It is not known whether all vote . If the roll is called , then account is taken of the vote of each person present . On Dr. Beman 's nomination , there seemed to be about ten or twelve noes : they appeared to come from the quarter where the brethren  --  I do n't like to call them the Old-school  --  sat . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pews , and I was looking toward the south-west part of the house . There was one negative on my left hand , coming from a pew occupied by our brethren of the Old-scliool . The others came from the same quarter . The resolutions were offered in an audible voice , and could have been heard by any body disposed to hear . The most dense portion of the Old-schoal sat in the south-west corner of the house . The /z/ Moderator was south of the great body of those gentlemen , though some were partly behind him . I have been a minister of the Presbyterian Church thirty years this spring , and have attended the General Assembly about once every three years , making in all eleven or twelve times . I am conversant with the rules of the Assembly . Where but one person is nominated to any office , the question is taken viva voce . Where more than one , the roll is invariably called . I have never known in any Assembly , a refusal to put an appeal . I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself . Cross-examined by Mr. Preston . I had never previously been Moderator . I do n't recollect that , at the time , I saw Dr. Witherspoon present . I did see Dr. Philips . Dr. Beman had been Moderator  --  I can not state in what year  --  probably about 1831 . Dr. Witherspoon afterwards appeared as a member of the Assembly . My nomination was seconded . A call was made for other nominations , but there was no reply in my hearing . Dr. Beman announced my election and stated to me that I was to be governed by the rules which the General Assembly should adopt . He stood with his face directed toward the south-east corner of the house , it being turned partly towards the Moderator , and partly towards me . He sat in the pew next behind me . He walked jnorth two or three slips  --  ( as the oblong pews are called at the east , to distinguish them from the square ones . ) His face was towards me when he announced my election . When he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he stood in a quartering way . The mass of the New-school brethren were north of me , on both sides of the aisle . Dr. Beman sat near the front of them , and not in their centre . The largest portion of the Old-school was in the south-west corner . The densest mass of the New school were collected in my rear . When Dr. Beman announced that I had been chosen Moderator , I walked towards him , with my back to Dr. Elliott . When I had taken my station , I did not address the Moderator , but the meeting . I stood quartering towards the Moderator , my arm resting on the west side of the pew , as I am a little lame . By turning a little , I could see the great mass of both the New and Old-school brethren . I was at the east end of the pew in which I sat , and Mr. Cleaveland was in the pew behind me . There were some persons east of him in the slip . When he made his suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did not address the Moderator . First he made a preamble , which was followed by his motion . He put the motion to the Assembly . It is usual for a Moderator to take his seat near the pulpit . I did not take mine there , because a paper was put into my hands , signed by the Presideni of the Board of Trustees of the Church , giving permission for the liouse to be occupied by the Assembly organized under the Moderator and clerks of 1837 , but by no other . No disturbance was wished , and I feared tiiat an attempt to take the Moderator 's chair might create an improper disturbance . I did not know but that the trustees had placed men there , to prevent my taking the seat . It is usual to take that seat in organizing the Assembly , but I do n't know , whether it would not have l ) een a greater violation of order to attempt to take it . It is unusual to organize the Assembly standing in the aisle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbecoming to attempt to take /q/ the Moderator 's chair . The resolution did not , that I know of , refer to that chair in particular , more than to any other part of the house . It was from motives of prudence that I did not take the chair . I took the station that I did , in order that there might be no interruption in organizing the Assembly . We could thus do it more speedily , and with less disturbance . My reasons were prudential ones . I thought that Dr. Elliott would not resign the chair , although he is a very polite man . Something was going on in the other part of the church , during these proceedings , and there was a great deal of noise and confusion . When J ) v. Patton offered his resolution there was considerable noise . This was partly behind the Moderator , and around him . While Mr. Cleaveland had the floor , there was a very great noise . Some one said to the Moderator , " Why do n't you put him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the motion appointing Dr. Beman Moderator was put , there was apparently a calm . The brethren of the Old-school looked on in a kind of silent astonishment . There was no further outbreaking of noise , until notice of the adjournment was given , and the announcement to commissioners , who had not yet presented their commissions , had been made : then there was a great shout , and clapping and hissing from the gallery , which I had not anticipated . We did not obey the cries of order ; we acted on the principle that we had superseded the JVIoderator and clerks , and were going on under another organisation . There vvere calls of order from members of the body , but we did not obey those . We paid no attention to cries of order , before the Assembly was fully organized . The number of members of all classes that were present , before we left Philadelphia , whose names were upon our roll , was about two hundred and eighty . I did not say the New-school roll , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first meeting , but we received some afterwards . I should think more than one hundred voted on the question of adjournment . The voting on the different questions was louder than was necessary or proper , but there was no other disturbance than this in our part of the house . When these proceedings began , most of the members were sitting , but after I stepped into the aisle , some rose up from their seats . I noticed on the west side , some who had got up on the seats . I can not say that the most were on their feet . I can not tell what length of time elapsed from Dr. Beraan 's taking his stand in the aisle , until the adjournment , but I suppose there was time enough to put all the motions : 1 should think not less than ten minutes . The proceedings were carried on with considerable rapidity  --  as fast as they could be distinctly attended to . Our object was to get through as speedily as we could with propriety . The design of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as short as was consistent with the attainment of our purpose . When we went out , I presume we left the body that had sat before me , with Dr. Elliott and Mr. Krebs , in their places , but I did not look back . I do n't know how many went with us to the First Presbyterian Church . Some time afterwards we had about one hundred and thirty  --  perhaps a few more or less : I am not positive . il/r . Preston . Was your election entirely unexpected ? Mr. Meredith . Every ecclesiastical preferment is entirely unexpected and undesired . /z/ IQg PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CASE . Mr. Preston . I should be glad if the witness instead of the counsel would tell me so . The question was overruled . Mr. Presinn . I wish to ask an explanation of Dr. Fisher as to the paper of Mr. Cleaveland , of which he has spoken . Mr. Cleaveland said , that * ' we had been advised by counsel learned in the law . " Who did he mean by * ' we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court . Dr. Fisher . A number of gentlemen felt themselves aggrieved by the acts of the Assembly of 1837 , I among the-rest . I consulted a lawyer , and so did others , to find out how we might get our rights . And I and others were informed by lawyers , that our Assembly must be organized at that time and place . We went individually to different lawyers , in different parts of the country , as I in my own country , others in New York , and others in Philadelphia , and were individually advised . I do n't know that there was any concert in the matter . TJiose aggrieved sought how the ) ' might recover their rights . 1 had been admitted to a seat , but I felt that when an old brother , such as Dr. Richards , President of the Seminary of Auburn , was excluded , I was aggrieved . When any one member suffered , I suffered . Re-examined by Mr. Randall . There was , at all times a constitutional quorum present in our Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a quorum . ( Some one mentioning that the nam ber required was fourteen , ) I thought that it had been changed to nineteen . Court adjourned till four o'clock . MONDAY AFTERNOON  --  4 o'clock . Dr. Fisher .  --  Cross-examination continued by Mr. Preston . We called the roll every morning  --  the whole roll , including the names of the gentlemen who remained in the Church in Ranstead Court . I can not tell how many ever answered . No investigation on this subject was made in the Assembly . I stated this morning that nineteen were a quorum ; but 1 find that the rule requires only fourteen or more , one-half thereof being ministers . This rule is applicable to the organization of the Assembly . I do n't know , except from the Constitution , what number is required for a quorum ; but from the Constitution , I should say that with fourteen we could always proceed to business . 1 have known Synods and Presbyteries to carry on their business without a majority being present . I can say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last acts of the Assembly of 1835 were performed without a majority of those who had been on the floor being present . The roll is called every morning unless this is dispensed with . At the dissolution of the Assembly I believe it was not called . I think at many of the Assemblies where I have been , the roll has not been called at the close , or the absentees marked . It is a general practice , but there have been many exceptions to it . I was ordained by the West Consociation of Fairfield , Connecticut , and there I remained for four years . I received a call to preach to the Presbyterian congregation at Morristown , thirty years ago this spring , and had the usual constitutional questions put to me , which I answered . My ordination in Connecticut was by a Consociation composed of clerical and lay /z/ delegates . The General Associations of Massachusetts , Connecticut , and New Hampshire , still continue to exist . Ee-examined by Mr. Randall . It is usual for clergymen to join the Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could mention a number of such instances , where they have came from bodies in correspondence with the General Assembly . Dr. Cuyler and Dr. Junkin were received in this manner . It is not customary to re-ordain in any case , but they go through a formula of examination , if they do not come from bodies in correspondence with the Assembly . Ordination in our Church is the setting apart to the Gospel ministry , by prayer and the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery . If a person thus ordained has no charge , he is styled an evangelist . When a person not ordained is called to a congregation , he is first ordained , and then pronounced to be installed . When he has already been ordained , the ceremony of installation is performed , and the questions are put , but there is no laying on of hands , and no re-ordination . I do not know whether Dr. Janeway was in the Dutch Church before he entered the Presbyterian . I joined the latter Church in 1809 , and he then was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church in Philadelphia , and I think clerk of the General Assembly . Ordained clergymen , on joining the Presbyterian Church , are never re-ordained , though they are sometimes examined . Rev. Robert Adair  --  sworn . I am a minister of the Presbyterian Church , and pastor of a church in Fourth street , between Arch and Market , where we are worshiping temporarily in the Academy . I attended the Assembly of 1838 . I went to the place where it was to meet , the Seventh Presbyterian church , or the Tabernacle  --  I ca n't say precisely at what time , but not very long before the meeting . The house was then well filled , but I succeeded in getting a seat about midway of the church , on the west side of the middle aisle . At the close of the usual services , the Moderator announced , that immediately after the benediction , he would constitute the Assembly , and accordingly he came down and constituted it with prayer . After he had thus constituted it , Dr. Patton , of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he wished to offer , I do n't know precisely what he said . The Moderator told him he was out of order , as the first business was the report of the clerks upon the roll . Dr. Patton said , that his object was to complete the roll . The Moderator replied , that the clerks were on the floor . After this there was more conversation between them , and Dr. Patton appealed to the house . The Moderator declared the appeal out of order , and Dr. Patton took his seat . The clerks then proceeded with the roll . After they had ended . Dr. Mason rose , with a bundle of papers in his hand , and said something to the Moderator in regard to what they were . I do n't recollect what he said , only that he had a bundle of papers of which he made a tender . After some questions had been asked , to which he responded , the Moderator pronounced him out of order . Dr. Mason said , that , with great deference to the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Moderator told him his appeal was out of order , and he took his seat . Dr. Elliott then announced , that if there were any commissioners who had not presented their commissions , that was the proper time to present them . Mr. Squier then rose , and intimated that he had handed his conTmission to the clerks , and that they had refused it ; jQg PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CASE . and he now claimed a seat . A conference took place between him and the Moderator , after which the latter said to him , " We do not know you , Sir , " and Mr. Squier took his seat . Then Mr. Cleaveland rose , and after some remarks , the purport of which I do n't know , made an allusion to the importance of securing a constitutional organization , at that time and place . He then moved that Dr. Beman should be temporary Moderator , and this motion was put and carried . Dr. Beman came out of the pew into the middle aisle , and said that the next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A nomination was made of Dr. Mason and Mr. Gilbert ; the motion was put , and was carried . Afterwards the choice of a Moderator was announced as the next business , and nominations were called for . Dr. Fisher was nominated , and the question was put and carried . So as to the appointment of regular clerks . Dr. Mason and Mr. Gilbert were nominated , and the question was put and carried . After this , there was a motion made to adjourn , and this also was carried . Dr. Fisher then announced , that the Assembly would- now proceed to the First Presbyterian Church , and that if there were any con ; imissioners there , who had not presented their commissions , they should avail themselves of that opportunity to present them . I ca n't say whether all these questions were put distinctly , and in an audible voice ; my presumption at the time was that they were . It appeared to me at the time that they were put in the usual mode of presenting questions . I have known other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put . Mr. Randall read from the Minutes of 1835  --  first from page 22 , the record of a motion carried by a vote of yeas 130 , and nays 78 ; and then from page 32 , the record of a motion carried , by yeas 76 , and nays 15 , to show thatresolutions were sometimes adopted , without a majority of the members of the Assembly being present and voting . Mr. Jidair  --  examination continued . I could not see what number of members voted . My position was about midway from the pulpit , on the west side of the middle aisle . 1 heard some negative voices . They seemed to come from the direction of the Moderator , or from a point a little to the south of south-east from him . I do n't know whether I was sitting north or south of Dr. Fisher . I was about opposite to Dr. Beman , when he came out into the aisle . There were ladies in the pew immediately in the rear of me . I can not say , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that from which the ayes came . My impression at the time was , that the negatives came from some persons in the aisle . They seemed to come from a point a little south of south-east from myself . I was the second person from the door of the pew . Cross-examined by Mr. Ingersoll . I came out of the church with the body of my friends . They left the pews which they had occupied , promiscuously , as a congregation usually do . I do not recollect whether I was in the lead of the column . I was not a member of the Assembly of 1S3S . I accompanied to the First Presbyterian Church those who removed . I can not say how long it was from the time that Dr. Beman took his station , till the adjourninent took place . My interest in the proceedings was so absorbing , that I could not take any note of time . When the Moderator declared the appeal out of order , no appeal was taken from his decision . In our courts nothing of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What could have manifested Dr. Mason 's acquiescence in the Moderator 's decision , more clearly than his taking his seat ? Mr. Adair . There was an usurpation of authority on the part of the Moderator , that precluded any attempt to recover the rights of the members , without resorting to an appeal to the house . The rights secured by our book had been invaded . Mr. Ingersoll . Suppose a member had moved that the Moderator should take a drink of water ; and he had decided the motion out of order , and also an appeal from that decision out of order , what would have happened then ? Mr. Adair . The house would treat such a person as a lunatic ; but here there was a pertinence in the I'esolution offered . ' Mr , Ingersoll. yes , that is your opinion , but I differ from you , though perhaps I do not know so much as you do of the lex parliamenti . Mr. Adair . I have never heard of such a thing , as an appeal from the judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . In our movement from the house , there was a confusion and uproar in the galleries , but nothing of the kind on the part of the members of the Assembly . By their conversation , I should judge , there was a great deal of excitement among them , but there was nothing indecorous ; they only seemed excited and very much interested . I ca n't say whether any preparation appeared to have been made before-hand , when I entered the First Presbyterian Church . By Mr. Hubbell . There were others besides members on the floor of the church in Ranstead Court  --  both males and females , as there always are . There were spectators sitting among the members , as usual in the morning , other arrangements not being made until afternoon . I felt at liberty to take any seat I found unoccupied . The house was unusually crowded at an early hour , but I have seen it crowded commonly on such occasions . The galleries were filled . I entered first at the northeast door , and then at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the gallery , and had taken my stand by the organ . From there I saw seats below that were more convenient , and availing myself of this information , I went down and took one of them . I could estimate the number of negative voices only by the sound . The negative sound was much smaller than the other . I was the distance of one seat from the aisle . Mr. Cleaveland was a little east of south-east from me , when he made his motion . I mingled among the commissioners in the First Presbyterian Church , on the outer part , among the lobby members as they are called . A place for the lobby members was not marked out at that time ; I do not know whether any was designated afterwards . I do n't recollect whether there was a discussion on our arrival , in the First Presbyterian Church , in regard to these proceedings . I believe the Assembly was constituted with prayer , and went on regularly to the roll , and to vote on Dr. Patton 's resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ecclesiastical body , known a case of a Moderator 's refusing to put an appeal . Mr. Sergeant . May not an appeal , under some circumstances , be out of order ? Mr. Adair . I think it may . Mr. S. Whose busihess then is it to declare it out of order ? /z/ Mr. A. I have no experience in reference to that matter . Mr. S. Suppose an appeaj out of order , does it not belong to the Moderator to declare it so ? Mr. A. This would be making the Moderator judge in his own case . Mr. S. But if an appeal is out of order , who is to decide in the first instance ? Mr. A. The house will decide : they will say the appeal is out of order ; but I have gone to the limits of my knowledge on these points . Mr. S. I want to know whether it is not the business of the presiding officer to decide in the first instance , that anappeal is out of order ? Mr. A. No , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to say that the General Assembly is different from all other deliberative bodies ? Mr. A. We have certain rules , but I do n't know how they compare with those of other bodies . Mr. S. Suppose an appeal is out of time : suppose that it is not made until the next day  --  how then ? Mr. A. The Moderator must decide in the first instance , and the good sense of the man who makes the appeal will prevent any difficulty . Mr. S. You mean to say , that the Moderator must decide in the first instance , and that the good sense of the man must afterwards help him somehow or other  --  do you ? Mr. A. Our books'make an appeal always in order . Mr. S. Is there nothing said as to the proper time and place ? Mr. A. I do not know . Mr. Preston . If a Moderator decides an appeal out of order , who is to determine the propriety of his decision ? Mr. A. The house must decide ; and in such a case , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . The sole question that would then come before the house , would be in regard to the right of appeal . Mr. P. Suppose I made a motion , and the Moderator declared it out of order , and I then appealed , and my appeal also was declared out of order , what question would go before the house ? Mr. A. I can not answer : these matters are beyond my province . Such a case has never occurred . It would require the opinion of some of our aged patriarchs . Mr. P. It actually occurred in this instance . Had the gentleman a right to put any other question to the house , than that in regard to the Moderator 's decision ? Mr. A. The question should be either to reverse , or to confirm the Moderator 's decision . Mr. P. Did the question put by Mr , Cleaveland either reverse or confirm Dr. Elliott 's decision ? Mr. A. The house was not reached : it did not get access to that appeal . The Moderator declared the appeal to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that question . The house did not decide on the point of order . Mr. Randall . Here is No , 29 of the " General Rules for Judicatories . " Please to read it . /z/ Mr. A.  --  reading  --  " If any member consider himself aggrieved by a decision of the Moderator , it shall be his privilege to appeal to the judicatory ; and the question on such an appeal shall be taken without debate . " I thought it impossible that an appeal should be declared out of order . No time is specified for an appeal from the decision of the chair ; an appeal is always in order . I know of no usage giving a clerk a right to put a question ; I only supposed such a case . Cross-examined by Mr. Preston . These rules are usually adopted at the commencement of the session of each Assembly . I suppose they vvere adopted in the First Presbyterian Church , but I am not certain . Dr. Cathcart.  --  recalled . After an appeal is made , it is sometimes wjthdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it put , the Moderator is obliged to put it . I never knew an instance to the contrary , until in the Assembly of 1838 . When an appeal is put and prevails , the Moderator 's decision is reversed . This was an extraordinary case . Neither the Moderator or clerks had a right to reject any commissions . It was for the house to decide whether the commissions were valid , though it is true that the Assembly of 1837 , attempted to bind the Assembly of 1838 , hand and foot . Mr. Randall offered the minutes of 1837 , p. 498 . " Resolved , That calling the roll previously to dissolving the Assembly be dispensed with . " Mr. Archibald McElroy  --  affirmed . I am connected with the press , as reporter for the United States Gazette . I did not attend at the Church in Ranstead Court very early , on the morning of the organization of the Assembly of 1838 . When I went in , the Moderator had nearly finished his discourse . I took a seat , and waited until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constitute the Assembly , which he did , by prayer . After the prayer , Dr. Patton rose , and requested permission to offer a paper which he held in his hand . The Moderator told him that he was out of order ; that the first business was the report of the clerks upon the roll . He appealed , and the Moderator declared the appeal out of order . Dr. Patton then took his seat . The clerk reported the roll , which , as I afterwards ascertained , had upon it upwards of two hundred names . The Moderator then said , that if there were any commissions which had not been presented to the clerks , then was the time to present them . Dr. Mason rose , holding in his hand certain commissions , which he attempted to offer . The Moderator asked the question , where they were from . He answered , from the Synods of Utica , Geneva , Genesee , and the Western Reserve . The Moderator decided that he was out of order , and also that an appeal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the meantime , had made some Remarks which I do n't recollect . Mr. Squier then rose and said that his commission had been presented to the clerks and rejected , and he now demanded his seat . The Moderator decided that he was out of order ; he appealed , and the same course as before was gone through . The conversation I did not understand . Mr. Cleaveland rose , with a paper in his hand , that related to the organization of the Assembly . What I heard was the same that has been given in evidence by others . He moved that a Moderator should be chosen , and that or . Beman should take the chair . Dr. Beman /z/ accordingly took the chair . He then stated that the next business was the nomination of clerks . This was gone through with in the regular way , and Dr. Mason and Mr. Gilbert were chosen clerks . Afterwards he said , that the next business was the elecion of a Moderator , but I did not hear him call for nominations . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and Dr. Fisher was elected Moderator . After that election , Stated and Permanent Clerks were chosen , and after this . Dr. Fisher announced that the Assembly had adjourned to the First Presbyterian Church . During the time that these motions were made , there was considerable noise and confusion . I was in the east aisle , about half way up ; I went in at the north door . I do n't know what was Dr. Beman 's position before he rose , or until he had taken his place in the aisle ; I was to the north of him . I moved across the aisle , and took my stand on the seat of one of the pews . I did not , see Dr. Beman ; his friends were between him and me . I came into the house after the sermon had commenced . I heard some of the questions reversed : I can not say which . I thought there were noes on some of them . I do n't recollect whether they were all reversed , but I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nays . I can not say from what part of the house these negatives came . 1 could hear the question put very distinctly . Dr. Patton was about half way up the church , and I six or eight pews lower down . I was to the east of him. - I first stood in the east aisle ; then on the seat of a pew west of this aisle . Dr. Patton was south-west of me , in a diagonal direction . My position in regard to the others was about the same ; Mr. Cleaveland , however , was a little farther off . The noise never prevented me from knowing what was going on . The noise consisted of the Moderator 's calling to order , and rapping with his hammer ; and a request was made by some gentleman , who rose , that he would let them go on . After Mr. Cleaveland had finished his paper , or his remarks , and Dr. Beman had been chosen Moderator , some gentleman rose and said , " Oh , let them proceed . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south-west quarter of the house . I did not see him , but I knew his voice . It was Mr. Breckinridge of Baltimore . This stopped the hammer . After his interposition , the Moderator was quiet , and the hammer too . Cross-examined hy Mr. Hubbell . I am a member of the Franklinstreet Church  --  Mr. Adair 's . Franklin-street is west of Franklin Square . We are now worshipping in the Academy . I arrived at the Seventh Church near the conclusion of the sermon  --  probably about twelve o'clock . I remained about ten minutes at that church , after the others had gone , and did not , at that time , go to the First Presbyterian Church . 1 attended to take notes of the proceedings . I attended the two bodies , at each church , every day , to take notes . I did not hear a mingling of ayes and noes , upon any of the questions . Some of those who were immediately around me , when I was listening to Mr. Cleaveland , were members , and some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on my right , spectators ; the most of them ladies . None of the spectators , that I heard , joined in the voting . I did not join my voice to those of the members . I think I may safely say , that none whom I knew to be spectators voted . I do not know that all who voted were members . /q/ I saw among , the spectators a number of persons , with whom I was acquainted , but 1 can not mention any of them now . All were seated when I went into the church , with a very few exceptions . After the proceedings commenced , some rose in my neighborhood , I was not seated at all . I stood up on the seat of one of the pews , that I might see . When I took my place on the seat , I think either Dr. Patlon or Dr. Mason was reading . There were three or four other persons standing on the seat of the pew in which I was . This was after I had altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hear better . Dr. Beman when be took the chair , in the aisle , was , it may be , ten or fifteen feet from me . I did not take particular notice of the distance . Mr. Cleaveland moved that Dr. Bemah should take the chair . When he made that motion , I did not see there were persons standing between him and me . He was farther off from me than any of the others . He , 1 think , was not standing on the seat , when he made his motion . I thinlc all the persons between Mr. Cleaveland and myself , were on their feet . There may have been fifty or a hundred between us . Some were standing on the seats and some were not . I do not recollect that I took any pains to look at Mr. Cleaveland . I frequently write , listen , and talk at the sam.e time , but I was not writing or talking , at the time of the transaction of which I apeak . I got upon the seat to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should have been obliged to have gone very near Mr. Cleaveland , or to have asked some of those who were standing between us to sit dotvn , in order to have seen him , I ca n't say whether those standing on the seats were spectators or members , or whether they had their hats on or oflf . Those immediately engaged in the organization , Dr. Beman , Dr. Fisher , and the clerks , were all standing on the floor . Rev. Jimasa Converse  --  swo7n . I am a minister of the Presbyterian Church from Virginia , I was present at the organization of the Assembly of 1838 . I went to the church in Ranstead Court , on the third Thursday of May , between the hours of nine and ten o'clock , and found there a body , which , at that time , appeared to have a recess . I then left the house , in company with Mr , Dickinson . I returned to it before the sermon was preached , and found that part of the house around the Moderator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the gallery , but on reaching it , found that also densely occupied , by ladies and gentlemen . 1 therefore went back , and found a seat under the gallery north of the door . After the sermon was closed , Dr , Elliott announced that he would proceed to organize the Assembly , and he cam.e down to the front of the pulpit , and made a prayer . The prayer being over , Dr , Patton rose , and proposed to ofier certain resolutions . The Moderator declared him out of order ; then some conversation ensued , which I did not hear , because of the noise around me , Dr , Patton , in a respectful manner , appealed from this decision . The Moderator told him he was out of order , and Dr. Patton then took his seat . On his being seated , the clerk read the roll , or a part of it ; after which , the Moderator announced from the chair , that if any person had not been enrolled , that was the proper time to present his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , saying that he held certain commissions , and he moved that the roll should be amended , by the addition of the names from them . The Moderator pronounced him out ofrder , and there were cries of order from six or /z/ twelve voices round the Moderator . Dr. Mason said , " With great respect , I appeal , " hut Dr. Elliott told him the appeal was out of order , and he took his seat . Then the Rev. Mr. Squier , from the Presbytery of Geneva , rising , demanded his seat in the house . The Moderater asked , from what Presbytery he came . He answered , from the Presbytery of Geneva . The Moderator asked , if that Presbytery belonged to the Synod of Geneva ; and he replied , that it was within the bounds of that Synod . The Moderator said , " We do not know you . Sir . " Mr. Squier then took his seat . The Rev. Mr. Cleaveland next rose , and stated in substance , that it was impossible to proceed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and place . He held a paper in his hand , but made some remarks without reading . He then moved that Dr. Beman should be Moderator , until a new one was elected , in order to proceed with the organization . This motion was put , and carried by a large majority . The question was reversed , and there were a good many noes . Nominations for clerks were then called for , and the Rev. Dr. Mason , and the Rev. Mr. Gilbert were nominated ; the question was put , and they were elected . Then nominations for a Moderator of the Assembly of 1S38 were called for . Dr. Fisher was nominated , the question was put by Dr. Beman , and he was elected by a large majority ; and according to my recollection , there were several noes when the question was reversed . The next nominations were for Stated and Permanent clerks . I do not think that I heard Dr. Fisher put this question . There was , at the time , some confusion in the part of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After this election , there was a motion made to adjourn to the First Presbyterian Church . This motion was seconded , put , and carried . I am not confident , but think , that Dr. Fisher after the adjournment , announced , that if any commissioners had not been enrolled , they should repair to the place of adjournment . A scene of confusion then . arose in the galleries , and clapping and hissing from every side of the house . The Assembly adjourned , and I think about one half of those , who had occupied the seats where the delegates sat , left the house . I next saw those who retired , at the church on Washington Square . I did not go there immediately with them . Cross-examined by Mr. Hubbell.  --  I went to the church in Ranstead Court , to hear the sermon , and see ni ' friends . I went , at half past nine , to meet some friends  --  the Rev. Mr. Hurd of the Synod of Mississippi , and some persons who were classmates of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten or fifteen minutes , after the adjournment of the New-school party to the First Presbyterian Church ; or I might not have been there more than five minutes . I do not know that I heard Mr. Breckinridge 's remark . I heard some remark , but what it was , or from whom it came , I can not say . I am a Presbyterian clergyman . I was not a delegate to the Assembly . I heard Mr. Cleaveland make a statement , and it was in substance that which I have stated in my narrative : I can not repeat the very words . None of the spectators , to my knowledge , participated in the voting . There were very few spectators among the members under my observation . I did alter my position ; I rose when other spectators were rising around me . I do not recollect at what part of the business this was , but I think it was when Mr. Cleaveland was reading . Some rose around me , but I do not think there was a /z/ general rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beman after he took his seat in the imaginary chair , but do n't remember distinctly . In the extreme north end of the church , there were some standing up on the seats , back of the commissioners . I saw among these , no persons that I recognised as commissioners , but I do not undertake to say that I recognised every commissioner in the house . I do n't know whether the spectators generally went away with the retiring body . A good many went away , but a good many remained when I left the church . I did afterwards attend , as a spectator , the sessions of the body that remained , preside , at present , in this city . I then resided in Richmond , Virginia . I originally came from New Hampshire . I belong to a Presbytery in Virginia , and have no ecclesiastical connexion with any Presbytery here . I  --  m editor of " The Religious Telegraph and Observer , " published in this city . I edited the same paper in Virginia . I have commented and expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oldschool party . I have both written and spoken my opinion , in regard to the proceedings wliich are now the subject of litigation , Court adjourned . TUESDAY MORNING , March 12th.  --  10 o'clock . Mr. Charles H. Dingee  --  affirmed . I attended the General Assembly of 1838 , in Ranstead Court , at its opening , as a spectator , I went to the church near twelve o'clock . I stood all the time , in the north gallery of the church , in front of the organ , in the centre of the house , as regards east and west . After the religious services , the Assembly was constituted with prayer as usual . First after this preliminary . Dr. Patton arose , and wished to offer a preamble and resolutions . The Moderator told him he was out of order . I heard this distinctly . He refused to put them , or allow them to be read . Dr. Patton remarked , that the paper in his hand , or the resolutions which he wished to offer , related to the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of order , as the next business was the report of the clerks on the roll . Dr. Patton appealed from the decision of the Moderator ; that appeal was seconded , but the Moderator declared it out of order , and refused to put it ; he said that the clerks had the floor . Dr. Patton reminded the Moderator that he had the floor previously to the clerks . The roll was then read by one of the clerks  --  I think by Mr. Krebs . After the reading of the roll , the Rev. Dr. Mason of New York , moved , that the names of the commissioners from within the bounds of the Synods of Utica , Geneva , Genesee , and the Western Reserve , should be admitted to the roll , and at the same time , he tendered their commissions . This motion was also declared to be out of order . Dr. Mason appealed from the decision of the Moderator , and his appeal was seconded . The Moderator then announced , that if there were any of the commissioners present , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper time to present them . The Rev. Mr , Squier rose , and informed the Moderator , that he had tendered his commission to the clerks , and they had refused it , and he demanded that his name should be put on the roll . Mr. Squier was asked whether he belonged , I think , to the Presbytery of Geneva , and also whether that Prestjytery was within the bounds of the Synod of Ge- Ijg PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CASE . neva . He answered in the affirmative . The Moderator informed him , " We do not know you . " Then Mr. Cleaveland of Detroit rose , and said , that , as the Moderator and clerks had refused to do their duty , it became necessary that then and there the Assembly should be organized ; and that this advice had been given by counsel learned in the law . He informed the Moderator , that without intending any discourtesy to him , with the fewest words , and in the shortest time possible , he would then and there organize the General Assembly . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be Moderator , until another should be chosen , and that Messrs . Mason and Gilbert should be the clerks . Mr. Cleaveland held a paper in his hand , and he occasionally looked at it , but certainly did not read from it . I had an opportunity to observe him distinctly . He did not , at any time , appear to be reading from this paper . His resolution was seconded , and the question was taken in both the affirmative and the negative and was decided in the affirmative . After this . Dr. Beman rose , and came out into the aisle . I then came down out of the o-allery into the middle aisle of the church , and just as I got down , the motion was made to adjourn to the First Presbyterian Church , and was carried . I do not know whether there were any negative voices on the election of Dr. Beman . I heard a very peculiar sound like an aye . J know the question was reversed . This motion was made in an audible voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house could have heard it . I was as near to the speaker as the Moderator was . Mr. Cleaveland was standing in a pew on the east side of the centre aisle . When he first rose , he faced the Moderator ; afterward , he faced the south-west corner of the church . He had papers in his hand , and I could see the use he made of these papers , and when he referred to them . Cross-examined by Mr. Hubbell . Very soon after he addressed the Moderator , Mr. Cleaveland turned his face towards the south-west corner of the church . When he arose he addressed the Moderator , and the house through the Moderator . I am not positive wdiether he had got through his preamble before he turned his face . I left the gallery soon after Dr. Beman took his place in the aisle  --  very soon after the clerks had been appointed . There had been no other business transacted . I went immediately , as soon as I could get down , into the body of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ladies were going down at the same time . I was perhaps about two or three minutes in the transit . When I got down they were engaged in the question of adjournment  --  this question passed while I was there . Dr. Beman , when he took his place in the aisle , faced , I rather think , the south directly ; but I am not positive . Dr. Beman was presiding when I came down , and put the question , of adjournment , which was then under consideration . I have seen Dr. Beman very repeatedly , and have heard him preach often . Dr. Beman put the question of adjournment . I am not positive whether he reversed it , but my impression is that he did . At that time 1 was anxious to get out of the house . His tone was loud enough to be heard all over the church . I should say , that I stood not more than twentyfive feet off from him . I had a distinct view of him , when he put the question of adjournment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks , Mr. Cleaveland faced the Moderator , but afterwards his face was turned obliquely . He stated that the Moderator and clerks , having refused /q/ to do their duty in the organization of the Assembly , it became necessary , in the shortest time , and with the least disturbance possible , then and there to organize the General Assembly . I know Mr. Cleaveland very well when I see " him . I had known him by sight before . He is not very large , but stout  --  I suppose about five feet eight inches in height ; he has light hair , and is about thirty-five years of age , or a little over . I am not positive in regard to the language which he used , when he reversed the question . I think he said , " those of a contrary opinion . " This was pronounced in a loud voice ; Mr. Cleaveland do n't speak low generally . I heard but one response , and I think that was " Aye ' . ' ' Mr. Cleaveland seemed somewhat agitated when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much in his hand ; or if I did , I do not recollect that fact . His voice , when he commenced , had something peculiar in it , and was like that of a man agitated . Bt/ Mr. Ingersoll . I made no note , at the time , of these proceedings . I am connected with the Third Presbyterian Church in this city  --  Mr. Brainerd 's , and , formerly , Dr. Ely 's . I was anxious to get out of the house in Ranstead Court , to get a seat at the other church . Before the vote was taken , there were a good many standing about where I was , immediately in front of the gallery . When I came " out of the church , I was a little ahead of the main body , and walked very fast , and I got a seat . The sexton had unlocked the door , while I was in the Square . I think I saw him going before us . I am not positive , but I think I had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ranstead Court or not , I ca n't say . I did not hear Mr. Cleaveland say , in the First Presbyterian , Church , that he had been agitated . Mr. Randall . The witness has fallen into a slight inaccuracy . The first motion you say was made by Dr. Patton , the second by Dr. Mason  - -  Mr . Ingersoll . I object to this method of examination : it is a direct violation of the rule that forbids leading questions . Judge Rogers . Mr. Randall only stated what the witness had said . Mr. Randall . You stated that " Dr. Beman put a question , after Dr. Fisher had been appointed Moderator . Now recollect  --  was it Dr. Beman or Dr. Fisher that put that question ? This method of examination was objected to , but the objection was overruled . Mr. Dingee . I recollect distinctly that it was Dr. Fisher . Cross-examined hy Mr. Hubbell . On my way down , I heard the name of Dr. Fisher . I was on the stair-case , behind the ladies , when I heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or from where it came , I can not say . The stair-case comes down into the lobby . The termination of the stairs in the gallery is the only part of them that is in the house . I know Dr. Fisher . There he is , ( pointing him out in the courtroom . ) When I went into the lower part of the church . Dr. Fisher was standing near where Dr. Beman had been standing , when I had left the gallery , and Dr. Beman was near him . I do not recollect distinctly about their position , but ' I think it was just as I have stated . The first I knew of Dr. Fisher 's being Moderator was his putting that vote . I then supposed he was Moderator , from the fact of his putting it . I did not inquire , but was afterwards satisfied that it was so , when I went to the church , and found him in the Moderator 's seat  --  -I mean the First Church . 1 did Ijg TRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CASE . not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moderator . It is so long since these occurrences happened , that I have forgotten a good deal , not expecting to ' be called upon to testify in the case . Dr. Fisher  --  re-called . From the acquaintance which I have had with the order of the Presbyterian Church , for the last thirty years , in all our judicatories , I should say that when a motion is made , the Moderator is judge in the first instance . If he decides that it is out of order , and the person making the motion acquiesces , there is an end of it . But a party who feels himself aggrieved , has a right to appeal from the Moderator 's decision to the house . It is then the imperious duty of the Moderator to put the appeal : he can never finally decide upon his own decision . If he persists in refusing to put an appeal , he virtually abandons his office . Mr. Preston . This is clearly mere matter of argument . Judge Eogci 's . The witness must confine himself to facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals , but never of an appeal upon an appeal . Such a thing would be a perfect absurdity . Mr. Sergeant . This is merely the witness 's opinion . Cross-examination continued . I know of no case , where two questions of equal grade can come before a legislative body at the same moment . Mr. Sergeant . Are you aware that some of the counsel have intimated a different opinion ? - Dr. Fisher . I did not know that they had . Mr. S .. Were you present at the examination of Mr. Adair ? Dr. F. I was present , and some of the questions I heard , but some I did n't hear . The next evidence offered was , Append , to Const.  --  Gen. Rules . R.9 .

I am a minister of the Presbyterian Church , and have been so for about ten years , i have taken an active interest in the concerns of that Church . I was a member of the Assemblies of ' 31 , ' 34 , and ' 35 , and was present at that of ' 36 , a part of that of ' 37 , and most of the Assembly of ' 38 . I have taken some pains to collect information , on the subject of the materials of the Assembly of 1838 , I am generally acquainted with the localities of the various churches that compose the General Assembly . Mr. Randall . Have the Old-school portions of the Church any geographical advantages ? This question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phelps . I can state in general terms , that fhe Presbyteries of Pennsylvania are what are generally denominated Old-school , and those Presbyteries , which have generally sent representatives of the New-school to the Assembly , are situated in the northern and western parts of the /z/ Church , and some of them in the south-western and southern portions . The Old-school have the advantage of contiguity over the New . Judge Rogers . What do you mean by that ? Mr. Phelps . I mean that they live nearer to Philadelphia  --  the place where the Assembly usually ineets . I have been at some pains to ascertain the position of the churches in the city and liberties of Philadelphia , in regard to these two parties . The churches of the Third Presbytery are sixteen in number , and those of both the other Presbyteries do not together exceed ten or twelve . I ought to explain that the Third Presbytery is New-School . There was a church , in the southern part of the ci/q/             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
