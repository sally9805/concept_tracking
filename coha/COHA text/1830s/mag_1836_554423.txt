txt THE present volume of the " Library of American Biography " fully sustains the reputation of that very useful and popular work . It consists of three parts . The first is a brief memoir of that eminent lawyer and orator , William Pinkney of Maryland , by Henry Wheaton , now our Minister Resident in Berlin . Its inaterials are chiefly drawn , as the author announces in a note , from his larger work , published in 1826 , entitled " Some Account of the Life , Writings , and Speeches of William Pinkney , " and from an article on that work , in the twenty-fourth volume of our Journal . Having treated the subject of Mr. Pinkney 's life and genius at such length before , we have nothing now to say , except that Mr. Wheaton , in the preparation of the present sketch , has manifested his characteristic good sense and good taste , and made a valuable contribution to our means of convenient access to an acquaintance with an illustrious man . The second part , a Life by Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , member of the Continental Congress for Rhode Island , and a signer of the Declaration of Independence , is a truly delightful composition . It actually practises on us the hewilderin0 delusion of making us feel as if we had known the man . No one whom we ever did know , resembles him at all points ; but he remains as perfect an idea in our minds , as if it was an idea obtained by personal familiarity , instead of reading . Every trait is individual . Every touch is graphic . The character is that of an upright , true-hearted , unpretending , energetic man ; ambitious of no distinctions , but calm , prudent , and i'esolved in all exigencies ; followed by a confidence which the silent influence of desert has won , and not any care to attract regard ; and always making the very best of life , for himself and others . This it is , in a general way of description . But the ji ases , in which these qualities and dispositions are manifested , are all its own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and life , that the outline is cut , as if with steel , on the memory . We can not , of course , follow the writer in this felicitous narration of facts that individualize a character . We must content ourselves with extracting the following beautiful paragraphs on the true dignity of old age . " It remains to speak of him in his closing years . It may be supposed , that we are entering upon a distinct era , in which , though he may still he recognised , he must yet he materially changed ; that his course must be henceforth downward ; and that , with the general feeling of tenderness and veneration for the old , we have now only to observe the decay of what we may have admired in its strength . Such an anticipation , with respect to the aged , is so common , as to be thought natural . But , after all that has been written of old age , is its true value , and the character it may and ought to possess , enough considered ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of condescending admiration , that he should have lived so long ; and he , in turn , may be pleased with this distinction , and even live the longer for it , as if to protract and augment the honor . " Sometimes , we make old age picturesque , with its wintry snows and reposing apathy . The harvest is ended , the earth is sealed ; there is to be no more growth . Or it is a noble pile , time-honored , time-worn , and falling into slow decay . There is to be no more splendor or cheerfulness , no more of life as it has been , within those walls . Or , again , we make old age senti. mental . It is passively and gratefully receiving cheerful tendance from the young ; it is patiently recountin* its experience , and distilling its long-treasured wisdom ; and the children are gathered round the bed of the patriarch for his blessing . And are these the best lights and positions in which we may look on those , who are approaching the appointed boundaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which it appears as a highly moral and intellectual state of man . It may be granted that the senses have lost much of their quickness ; but the imagination , now freed from distracting excitement , is as able and disposed as ever to shape anew the materials they have supplied , either for its own solace and delight , or for the beautiful expression of thought and emotion . At the very season when mere animal existence is less a blessing , and the animal spirits have almost ceased to excite and sustain , and passion is no longer to stimulate and crave and be fed , the imagination still lives to animate the purely intellectual exercises , to preserve or restore the // early love of natural beauty , to keep the affections warm and old remembrances distinct ; and , indeed , to give the mind much of the light and vivacity of youth . " It is the period of aequisition as well as of contemplation . A long experience of life has not yet furnished all , nor the best , that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valued , and that the methods of pursuit have often been wrong ; so that even a little that is seen and meditated upon in the latter day , may be worth more than masses of crude opinions , fancies , and purposes , which occupied the supposed vigor of life . The mind was often stationary then , from the all-surrounding pressure of outward things , which seemed to make it intensely active , because they wholly engrossed it ; but now it may be truly said to be advancing by a power from within . The effort is not merely to keep what has been purchased , and not to recede from a point that has been gained . Life is better even now than a mere resistance of evils . The future is entered upon as offering higher studies , and as a corrector of the past , and with a religious feeling of the importance of the days that remain , as closebordering on the endless pursuits of another state of action . The temper is softened and spiritualized . Active engagements are still pursued for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become feeble . Intimacy with the young is cherished from sympathy with their exuberant spirits , and from a desire to be strengthened by their fresh-growing thoughts , and from a prophetic interest in the life that is before them ; an intimacy of perfect equality , except that the aged bend to the young , and give more than they receive . Add to such considerations as these , the blessing of a good nervous system , and health scarcely interrupted or impaired to the end , and some idea may be formed of Mr. Ellery in his closing years . " - pp. 1*lO - 13*3 . The third memoir is of Cotton Mather , a personage entitled to a place in Mr. Sparks 's American Biography , by several distinct and acknowledged claims . His early reputation , and the prominent part he took in the ecclesiastical affairs of New England ; the great and long-continued consideration which he enjoyed with the people at large ; his literary attainments and unquestionable ability of a certain kind ; the contributions he made to the materials of our early history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be desired ; and last , though not least , his grievous errors of conduct , on several important occasions , give him an undoubted eminence // above most of his contemporaries , and make him one of the most remarkable characters that belong to the early period of New England . But , though his name is familiar to every mouth , the materials of a full account of his life , are unfortunately scanty . They are sufficient , however , to give a tolerably accurate idea of his course as a public man , and of some leading qualities of his character in private . His public career is so closely connected with the history of the times , that it may be pretty well understood , and his own diaries , divulging his more private course of thought and action , are characteristic in the highest degree . We are glad that the task of collecting these materials , and illustrating Mather 's life , has fallen into hands so well able to discharge the duty . Mr. Peabody has clearly used the utmost industry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has woven , from these scattered materials , an exceedingly graceful and lively narration . The current has been lately setting pretty strongly against the reputation of this famous divine ; and possibly there has been a general disposition to underrate both his abilities and his moral excellence . Mr. Peabody is a more indulgent judge ; and , while he passes a deserved censure upon Mather 's bigotry and vanity , and reprobates severely his conduct during the Salem delusion , he is equally solicitous to exhibit the fairer features , that , in his view , marked the man . That he has rightly struck the balance between foibles , faults , and virtues , is more than we would venture to affirm ; for , undoubtedly , Mather was one of the oddest men , * that ever lived in the tide of times . " But his only aim has evidently been to ascertain the exact truth , and state it in the most clear and simple form . The story is told with great beauty of style . It is pleasant , polished , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The narration is interspersed with extracts from the writings of Matlier and others , skilfully selected , and tastefully introduced ; and the reader 's interest never flags , for the writer 's spirit never fails . Cotton Mather was born in Boston , Feb. 12th , 1662-3 . His mother was the daughter of John Cotton , a man of the first celebrity in his day . He manifested early in life , a passion for books , and was educated at the free school in // Boston , by Mr. Benjamin Thompson , and by the wellknown Mr. Ezekiel Cheever , who prepared him for college . He seems to have gone through an unusual preparatory course ; since we hear , " says Mr. Peabody , " of his studying Homer and Isocrates , besides many Latin authors , not very familiar even to those who had taken a degree . " The following particulars are interesting , and the curious speech of President Hoar is amusingly characteristic of the a and of the estimation in which Mather 's family was held . " He entered college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very early , and certainly is too early both for the pursuits and temptations of the place . But he seems to have had a strong anibition , which aided his better principles , in securing him from moral dangers , and making him attentive to his duties . He wished and expected to be a great man ; and though expectations of this kind are not often shared by others , in his case , on account of his birth , they were thought appropriate and graceful . When he became a member of the institution , Dr. Hoar , who was then president , gave him according to custom , this head for his initial declamation ' ; " Telemacho veniet , vivat modo , fortior matas . ' " We have little information concerning his rank in college ; but , judging from its close , it must have been sufficiently high ; for , when he took his first degree , President Oakes , in his Latin oration at the commencement , expressed himself in a strain , which may be thus translated . " Mather is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hearers , I confess I am wrong ; I should have said , what names ! I shall say nothing of his reverend father , since I dare not praise him to his face ; but should he resemble and represent his venerable grandfathers , John Cotton and Richard Mather , in piety , learning , elegance of mind , solid judgment , prudence , and wisdom , he will bear away the palm ; and I trust that in this youth , Cotton and Mather will be united and flourish again . ' " Such an address , on such an occasion , would now make a considerable sensation . The effect of it was to fan the flame of Mathers ambition , and so to make him what all expected him to be . But it doubtless had another effect , which was to produce much of that jealousy in others , and that discontent in himself , which brought so much unhappiness on his later years . Some poet of the day alluded to what he called his ominous name ' ; " Where two great names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater make . ' // Bein* blessed , as his son informs us , with a modest inquisitiveness , ' a gift which is said not to be uncommon in New England , he made rapid advances before taking his second degree , which he received from the hand of his father . The Thesis , which he then maintained , was the divine origin of the hebrew points ' ; but he afterwards saw reason to change his mind , and held the contrary opinion to the last . " Such a man as Increase Mather would not regard learning and intellectual accomplishments as so important as religious education . His first efforts , therefore , were directed to the formation of a Christian character in his son , who had sufficient fervor and readiness to receive impressions , and wanted the judicious counsel , which his father was well able to give . We are told , that almost as soon as he began to speak , he began to pray , and practised this duty constantly in all his earlier years . He often composed forms for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently reproved them for profaneness and misconduct , and set them the example of avowing his religious principles fearlessly on all proper occasions ; a kind of inoral courage , which , if it were more generally found in the young , would save many from ruin ; for the truth is , that many are led away , not merely against their judgment , but actually against their will , for the want of firmness to bear up under the ridicule of those , whose good opinion they would not value . " - pp. 172 - 174 . Though Mather was destined to the clerical profession , both by his own tastes , and by hereditary influences , he occupied himself in teaching , seven years after leaving college . He had under his instruction many young men , who afterwards rose to distinction ; and he used to say , that he " would give all he was worth in the world , for the measure of grace and sense , which he saw in some that were once his scholars . " In 1680 , he was invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's associate in the ministry ; and in 1684 , he was regularly ordained pastor . As a preaclier he seems to have been highly acceptable , and found , as he expressed it , " strange respect among the people of God , " to such a degree that he candidly confesses that " proud thoughts fly-blowed his best performances . " The details of his professional labors are extremely interesting and characteristic , but we must refer the reader to the volume itself . // The following account of his mode of turning common incidents to matter for edification , is striking . " The disposition to derive improvement from all circumstances , for himself and others , attended him through life ; and though it was always sincere , it did not always manifest itself in the most judicious and edifying manner . He determined early in life to let no suggestion pass by him ; and many , which most men would never have thought of turning to purposes of instruction , were welcomed as excitements of devotion in his soul . " When the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led into spiritual meditations . If they happened to be brewing , he would say , Lord , let us find in a glorious Christ a provision for our thirsty souls ; ' when baking , Lord , let a glorioiis Christ be the bread of life unto us ; ' and on the washingday , which is not apt to bring the mind into a devotional frame , he would say , 0 , wash us thoroughly from sin ! 0 , take away our filthy garments from us . ' These ejaculations were provided and used on all such occasions . So in all his personal actions . Late in his life he writes in his Diary , The snuffing of my candle is a frequent action with me . I have provided a great number of pertinent wishes and thoughts , and prayers and praises , to be formed upon the occurrences in my life , which afford occasions for them . ' It must have been by an oversight that this action was so long omitted . For all his mature life lie had been accustomed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another day , and pray that it might be spent to his glory . When he heard a clock strike , he would pray that he might so number his days , as to apply his heart unto wisdom . When he knocked at a door , he used it as an occasion for reviving the memory of the promise , Knock , and it shall be opened unto you . ' When he mended his fire , it was with a prayer that his love and zeal might be kindled into a flame . When he put out his candle on retiring to rest at night , it was with an address to the Father of lights , that his light might not go out in darkness . When he paid a debt , he reflected , that he should owe no man any thing but love . " He bore upon his mind a great number of ejaculatory prayers , prepared for the occasions when they were to be used . As a specimen , those which were sometimes used at table may he given . Looking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , Lord , carve a rich portion of thy graces and comforts to that person . ' Looking on a geritlewoman stricken in years , Lord , adorn that person with the virtues which thou prescribest for aged women . ' For one lately // married , Lord , marry and espouse that person to thyself in a covenant never to be forgotten . ' For a gentlewoman very beautiful , Lord give that person an humble mind , and let her be most concerned for those ornaments that are of great price in thy sight . ' " So when he walked the streets , he implored secret blessings upon those , who passed by him . At the sight of a tall man , he said , Lord , give that man high attainments in Christianity . ' For a lame man , Lord , help that man to walk uprightly . ' For a negro , Lord , wash that poor soul ; make him white hy the washing of thy spirit . ' For a very little man , Lord , bestow great blessings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them wise virgins , and as polished stones in thy temple . ' For a man going by without observing him , Lord , I pray thee help that man to take a due notice of Christ . ' For a very old man , Lord , make himn an old disciple . ' For a wicked man , Lord , rescue that poor man , who , it is to be feared , is possessed by Satan , who leads him captive . ' " When he had a family , he taught his children , in like manner to use the incidents of life as so many suggestions from on high . Some years after this he writes ; Two of my children have been newly scorched with gunpowder , wherein , though they have received a merciful deliverance , yet they undergo a smart that is considerable . I must improve this occasion to inculcate lessons of piety upon them ; especially with relation to their danger of everlasting burnings. ' " - pp. 191- 194 . The second chapter gives us an entertaining account of Mather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his proceedings in the business of witchcraft . The political history of the colony , upon which the Mathers exercised considerable influence at that time , is also rapidly treated . The peculiarities of Mather are perhaps more conspicuous in this portion of his life , than in any other . His curious superstition , and his formal observances , seem to have had then more occasion for their display than at other times ; at any rate , the relation of them presents a strange jumble of grotesque absurdities , in the midst of scenes of ferocious bigotry and tragical delusions . We pass to Mather 's affecting account of his wife 's death . " The black day arrives ! I had never seen so black a day in all the time of my pilgrimage . The desire of my eyes is this day to he taken from me . Her death is lingering and painful . All the forenoon of this day , she was in the pangs of death , // and sensible till the last minute or two before her final expiration . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her devout soul was full of satisfaction about her going to a state of blessedness with the Lord Jesus Christ . As far as my distress would permit , I studied to confirm her satisfaction and consolation . When I saw to what a point of resignation I was called of the Lord , I resolved , with his help , to glorify him . So , two hours before she expired , I kneeled by her bedside , and took into my hands that dear hand , the dearest in the world , and solemnly and sincerely gave her up to the Lord . I gently put her out of my hands and laid away her hand , resolved that I would not touch it again . She afterwards told me , that she signed and sealed my act of resignation ; and before that though she had called for me continually , after it , she never asked for me any more . She conversed much until near two in the afternoon . The last sensible word that she spoke was to her *veeping father ; " Heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - p.272 . Mr. Mather records a great many struggles he had with the Devil ; but it strikes us that the following is the most perilous of all his encounters with the wiles of the arch enemy . " There was a young lady , whom he describes as so remarkably accomplished , that no one in America exceeded her , abounding in wit and sense , with a comely aspect , and most winning conversation , who , after writing to him once or twice , made him a visit , and gave him to understand , that she had long felt a deep interest in his ministry , and that , since his present condition had given her more liberty to think of him , she had become charmed with my person to such a degree , that she could not but break in upon me with her most importunate requests , that I would make her mine . ' She however declared , that the chief interest she felt in the attachment arose from her desire for religious improvement ; for , if she were once connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be secured . " To a proposal so direct and flattering , it was not easy to make any other than a grateful reply . It was not altogether to his taste , but he could not say so to her . All at once , a way of escape seemed to be offered ; and , nothing doubting that it would answer the purpose , he told her of his austere manner of life , and the frequent fasts and vigils , which his wife was expected to share . But , instead of being daunted by this communication , she told him that this was the very thing of all others , which she desired ; for she had already weighed all those discouragements , but was prepared with faith and fortitude to encounter them all . // " Then , ' he says , I was in a great strait how to treat so polite a gentlewoman , thus applying herself unto me . I plainly told her I feared whether her proposal would not meet with insurmountable objections from those , who had an interest in disposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be time taken to see what would be the wisest and fittest resolution . In the mean time , if I could not make her my own , I should be glad to be any way instrumental in making her the Lord 's . ' " Having secured this reprieve , he seemed to breathe freely , though he was utterly unable to discover any way of escape from this affectionate persecution . " This matter appears for some time to have oppressed his very soul , and the manner in which he treats it is too characteristic to be passed by . After a time , the Diary proceeds ; My sore distresses and temptations I this day carried before the Lord . The chief of them lies in this . The most accomplished gentlewoman , mentioned , though not hy name , in the close of the former year , one whom everybody sees with admiration , confessed to be , for her charming accomplishments , an incomparable person , addressing me to make her mine , and professing a disposition unto the most holy flights of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am in the greatest strait imaginable what course to steer . Nature itself causes in me a mighty tenderness towards a person so amiable . Breeding requires me to treat her with honor and respect , and very much of deference ; hut religion , above all , obliges me , instead of a rash rejecting of her conversation , to contrive rather how I may irnitate the goodness of the Lord Jesus Christ in the dealing with such as are upon a conversion to him . ' No contrivance could arrange the matter to his mind for again he says , As for my special , soul-harassing affair , I did , some days ago , under my hand , beg , as for my life , that it might be desisted from , and that I might not be killed by hearing any more about it . ' But even his written solicitations produced no effect , so desirous was she to secure the welfare of her soul . " - pp. 273 - 276 . We should be glad to make further extracts from this agreeable hook ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in our hands forbids . Nor is it necessary to say any thing further ; the interest of the subject , and the beauty of the narrative will give it an immediate popularity and wide circulation.
