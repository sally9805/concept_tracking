txt The early history of Iceland has received less attention , than it may fairly claim . An American , at least , ought to be familiar with the fortunes of those , to whom belongs the singular honor of discovering our continent , though it was reserved for a more fortunate race to make it the seat of empire . This information he may readily find in the recent work of our learned countryman , Mr. Wheaton , who has combined in it most of the facts , which a general reader would desire to know . There is one point only , to which we can now refer ; and this , rather with the design of appealing to his authority , than to add any thing to what he has given . It relates to the beautiful form of civilization which started into life among these cold and barren rocks , like the magical vegetation of a polar spring , at a period when thick darkness covered the nations . About fifty years after the original settlement of the island , the singular spectacle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refinement , which seems to belong to a later age than the opening of the tenth century . The Norwegians had established a patriarchal government , or a mitigated feudal system , on their first arrival . This was soon afterwards exchanged for an essentially republican form , some of the prominent details of which are found in the narrative of Dr. Henderson . The island , agreeably to its natural divisions , was separated into four provinces , over each of which a Chief Magistrate was chosen by the people to preside , the smallest proprietor of land being entitled to a vote . No precise account is given of the duties of this officer ; but he is generally described as an arbiter in civil controversies , and a minister of religion . The provinces were subdivided into three or more prefectures , under the government of elective officers , who , like the // former , united various judicial and religious functions . There was a still farther division of the prefectures into districts , in which bailiffs were elected to decide inferior controversies , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed from their decisious to the courts of the prefectures , whose judgments were subject in their turn to the revision of the tribunals of the province . These last were composed of deputies from the prefectures , convened on extraordinary occasions . The General Government was an assembly of persons from every quarter of the island , who exercised the supreme legislative power , and determined controversies in the last resort . A Chief Magistrate , chosen for that purpose by the people , presided in this assembly , and was invested with the additional dignities of chancellor and preserver of the laws . This form of government undoubtedly presents substantially the features of democracy ; but the account is not very clear as to the tenure of the various offices , nor so precise in other respects , as to enable us to determine with entire certainty the character of the system . We are bound to say , that there is a portentpus difference between the view of it here given by Dr. Henderson , and that of Dr. Holland , who accompanied Sir George Mackenzie on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have derived their information from the same historical sources ; but the former , as we have perceived , describes the government as a pure republic , while the other insists that it was altogether aristocratic in its nature , and makes no mention of the trifling circumstance of the election of public officers by the people . We do not feel competent to decide , where these gentlemen disagree . This task may be safely intrusted to Mr. Wheaton , from whose remarks upon the subject it appears that , as is not unusual in such cases , both are partly right , and in some respects , in error . The chiefs who originally emigrated from Norway brought with them to the island a multitude of followers , whose relation towards them resembled that of the Roman client to his patron . Something of the feudal relation was long preserved , in their reverence for the patriarchal authority of their chiefs ; but the possession of property and civil rights imparted to them a proud spirit of personal independence , which was confirmed by the agency they certainly exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , the system was a remarkable development // of the republican principle ; and it is a fact worthy of the observation of all who are interested to observe the operation of that principle , that it was accompanied by an extraordinary progress in some of the higher arts of civilization . Montesquieu expresses his admiration , that this great political conception should have originated in the forest . I-us surprise was not unwarranted ; but the only forests of Iceland are those which are thrown upon it by the sea . This form of government endured for three centuries . No sooner was it established , than the golden age of Iceland began to dawn ; and many circumstances were combined to render this a very memorable period . It was not until ages afterwards , that the revival of learning took place in the South of Europe ; and when it did , it was little more than the revival of the learning of earlier times ; there was nothing in the new literature , which could be considered at all original or peculiar . The literature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient or foreign models ; it was affected by no other influences than those arising from the character and feeling of the people ; but it blended the imposing grandeur of the Scandinavian Mythology with the brilliancy of high poetical conception , in a language surpassed in copiousness and energy by no modern tongue . Her historians , who bore at the same time the sacred character of bards , went forth to foreign countries , proclaiming the deeds of Northern heroes in their bold and figurative recitations . They xv*re the chosen companions of conquerors and kings ; in the day of battle , a conspicuous station was sometimes assigned to them , that they might witness and relate its fortunes ; and they took precedence of all others at the royal board in the festive hall . Such honors inspired them with lofty and chivalrous sentiments ; nor is it fanciful to suppose , that the magnificence of their native scenery tended to produce a more enthusiastic feeling . The altar of the poet is erected in solitary places ; the fire burns brightest , when he communes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the early period of the republic , their works were preserved only by memory ; hut they were afterwards written , and collected , and formed the literature of which we have already spoken . From this time , they obtained an influence over the popular mind , which is hardly yet impaired . The heart of the humblest cottager still burns within him , as he reads this record of his country 's early glory . At the same time , the // lawgivers of Iceland brought with them from other lands the treasures of experience and wisdom . A code adapted to the necessities and situation of the people , unwritten indeed , but administered in the various tribunals , and preserved in the interpretations of the highest magistrate , already mentioned , thence known by the significant title of Lo * dgumadr the Living Law , was coeval with the republic , and Lurvvts in part in the recorded statutes of the present day . Such was the condition of Iceland , before its glory was departed . Nothing more than the reflection of it now remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present state of a people , once so prosperous ; and there is no better source from which to draw this information , than the work of Dr. Henderson . Very few travellers have been led by curiosity to wander on the borders of the arctic circle ; considering the ordinary purposes for which they wander , they may as well take a different direction . The regions of luxury , refinement , and the arts now lie nearer to the sun . Civilization prefers the refuge of a milder climate . Here there is little to attract those , who care not to observe character and manners in peculiar situations , unless they wish to visit some of the grandest and most beautiful scenery of nature , or like Sir George Mackenzie , to study geology on the borders of a half extinguished volcano . The object of Dr. 1-lenderson was like none of these ; his was altogether a mission of charity . It is because his representations bear strongly the evidence of truth , that we are induced to notice them so long after their publication in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not soon obliterated by the footsteps of another , and we are acquainted with no more recent one than he . He went to Iceland as the agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society , to inquire into the moral and religious situation of the people , and to provide them with the scriptures in their native tongue . We are unwilling , in mentioning the name of this association , to pass it by without remarking , how much , in common with others of similar name , it has accomplished for the benefit of men . The first suggestion of them was a great and fortunate conception . It was an attempt to embody in a visible form the high and comprehensive spirit of Christianity itself , as it came from above : not clinging with a convulsive grasp to ceremonies or unessential doctrines , as if they grew dearer in proportion as others rejected them , nor kindling dis // .79 Henderson 's Iceland . sensions among its followers ; but glowing with the beauty of unity and peace , and bearing with it the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region beneath the sun , where the sound of these messengers of mercy has not gone forth ; their name and praises are uttered in the palm-groves of the tropics , in the dreary wastes of polar snow , and the beautiful islands of the South sea : - wherever there is a heart to feel , or a tongue which can adequately tell , the good they have already done ; and they are yet to be expressed with deeper gratitude in lands on which they shall hereafter bestow the gift of light and life . Dr. Henderson set sail from Copenhagen in June 1814 , and came in sight of Iceland on the 12th of July . A few days after , he landed at Reykiavik , the capital of the isiand . This is the spot , where , according to tradition , the first Norwegian settler fixed his residence , because the door-posts of his old habitation , which he had thrown into the sea by way of compass , came judiciously to anchor here . It is now a town of some note , in fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the spring it is resorted to by the inhabitants from every quarter of the country , to receive a scanty supply of foreign luxuries in exchange for their own productions . This circumstance , together with the fact that the highest civil dignitaries have selected it as their place of residence , have brought together a small number of the least gregarious people on earth ; the whole population does not exceed that of the smallest of our villages . The market season was over before Dr. Henderson arrived , so that he lost his expected opportunity of meeting with individuals from all parts of the island , and was compelled , more for the benefit of his readers than his own convenience , to make several journeys in pursuit of them . Inns there are none , and their place is poorly supplied by a tent , which the traveller carries with him . The houses are in general too miserable , to render him at all ambitious to become the object of hospitality ; though he has no reason to complain of a want of such liberality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best road is a mere foot path , often diversified with frightful precipices of rock or lava . The baggage of the traveller is carried on the backs of horses , whose instinct is of more value in overcoming the difficulties of the journey , than the judgment of their masters . Strange tales of their sagacity had been told to our traveller , which // nothing but his own experience could induce him to believe . One evening , after crossing a rapid and dangerous stream , he found himself on the borders of a desert tract , through which the path was not to be distinguished in the dark . In this emergency , he bethought himself of placing the oldest and most discreet of his horses in the van , and suffering it to select its own course . After riding several miles , his progress was stopped by an elevation , over which he passed several times without being able to ascertain its nature ; until one of his servants chanced to perceive a window , and it was at length discovered , that they were mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit of that day 's journey . It wQuld not be very edifying to the reader to trace the course of Dr. henderson very minutely through farms or villages , most of which are wholly unknown to the geographer . We shall therefore content ourselves with referring to some of the more important portions of his narrative . He first traversed the island in a northerly direction . On the evening of his first day 's journey , he reached the borders of the Lake Thingvalla , near which is situated a village of the same name . In the immediate vicinity of the village is a spot , once the most important in the island , and still consecrated by many imposing associations . This is a long tract of solid lava , covered with the richest verdure of sumnier , but lying in the midst of utter desolation . On each side , ravines of unfathomable depth divide it from immense masses of rock and lava , piled up in wild disorder , as if thrown out by a volcano , and in just keeping with the horrors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the general assembly of the nation held its meetings for more than nine hundred years . It was thence appropriately called the mountain of the law . Here too , the decrees of the great tribunals of justice were pronounced ; and here Christianity was solemnly proclaimed as the religion of the land , eight centuries ago . We may well conceive , that the pride of man would be humbled amidst these evidences of the operation of a higher power . It is not unreasonable to believe , that the magnificence and horror of the scene elevated and purified the minds of those who were appointed to ordain law , and administer justice ; certain it is , that they imparted a reverence and solemnity to the decrees of these assemblies , which nothing else could give . A code of laws , as we have already observed , was regularly // adopted by the people at Thingvalla in the early period of the republic . They were indebted for it to Ulfiiot , one of their countrymen , who visited other countries of the north at an advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of jurisprudence , and on his return submitted the results of his researches to the judgment of the civil authorities . The patriotism and learning of this remarkable person would have done honor to any age ; and his system has received the enthusiastic approbation of those most competent to understand its merit . More than three centuries afterwards , another code , the substance of which is still in force , was adopted in the same manner ; its spirit and character have not been materially changed by subsequent edicts of the Norwegian or Danish kings . At this day , the different departments of the law are accurately studied , and well understood . The penal law has nothing sanguinary in its character ; the moral qualities of the people are such as to leave little room for the enforcement of its severest penalties . When , a few years since , a person who had been guilty of murder was condemned to die , no person could be found to undertake the office of executioner ; the criminal was in consequence sent to Norway , where less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accused of a crime , which does not subject him to the punishment of death , or imprisonment for life , there is no such thing as confinement before trial ; he is only solemnly admonished by the ruler of his parish , not to stray beyond the limits of his jurisdiction . Some provisions of their civil code are evidently founded upon the old republican principle . The property of persons dying intestate is divided , and the only privilege of the eldest son is that of prior choice ; the portion allotted to a daughter is half of that of a son ; and half the estate is given to the widow in the way of dower . The early records of the country afford reason to believe , that the trial by jury was formerly in use ; it is now wholly unknown . The day after he left Thingvalla , Dr. Henderson reached the valley of those boiling fountains , which are well known under the appellation of the Geysers . A number of these springs are constantly in action ; but there are two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite the curiosity of travellers . The first of these is a huge basin , more than one hundred and fifty feet in circumference , with an elevated VOL xxxv*-No. 76. 11 // border , formed by the gradual deposits of the fountain ; in this , the water is constantly rising or falling before or after an explosion . When Dr. Henderson first approached it , he found it in a state of comparative repose ; in a few hours , the agitation of the earth around assured him , that he was about to witness its action in the most imposing form . The agitation gradually increased , until its noise resembled the rapid discharges of artillery ; presently , a vast column of water was projected perpendicularly to a considerable height in the air , partially concealed from the view by thick clouds of vapor , and surrounded by a thousand jets , playing in every direction from its base , like those of an artificial fountain : then , as if it had gathered strength by repeated efforts , the torrent rushed madly up to a still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sunk tranquilly down into its source . Nothing can exceed the beauty of the scene , when its waters are flashing in the sun , and the colors of the rainbow are reflected from it sides . The play of the New Geyser is still , if possible , more striking and sublime . Its force is proportionally increased by the smallness of the orifice from which it is projected ; and its waters , in their wildest agitation , are thrown to the height of more than two hundred feet . Dr. Henderson exults in the discovery of the means of setting this tremendous enginery in motion , by casting stones into the spring . He was not aware that others had ascertained the same fact before him . We do not find , that he has attempted to explain the causes of its operation . It is commonly ascribed to the expansive force of steam confined in cavities beneath the surface ; and there are abundant indications elsewhere , that the foundations of the island are somewhat insecurely laid over a volcano , which has made more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of his journey to the north , Dr. Henderson found an opportunity to visit Thorlakson , the most distinguished poet of modern Iceland . The foes of pluralities will be comforted to learn , that this remarkable person , who is a clergyman in charge of two parishes , enjoys a salary of no more than thirty dollars a year , which he divides with another minister , who aids him in performing his parochial duty ; his age and infirmity having disqualified him for officiating in both societies . His residence is in a singularly romantic and beautiful spot . Three rivers , each flowing through a small and fertile // valley , unite their waters into a broad and rapid stream before it ; behind , several cataracts are tumbling over steep and craggy precipices ; the distant prospect is bounded by the majestic outline of noble mountains . Nature has done her part to provide him with a poet 's dwelling ; and if poverty be the parent of inspiration , there are other circumstances in his situation eminently poetical ; but the most wretched of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pearls of poetry are strung . The door of this edifice is four feet high ; it leads into a single room , sufficiettly large for a man of moderate size to repose at length , and containing the essential furniture of a bed and a table ; over the latter , a small aperture , dignified by the name of window , admits the daylight of the arctic circle . This is the apartment , in which the veteran bard completed his translation of the Paradise Lost ; a work , which is said to overflow with the spirit of its divine original ; but unfortunately , the three first books of it alone are published , and his poverty will long prevent the publication of the rest . Not disheartened by this untoward circumstance , enough of itself to extinguish the ambition of writers of any other country , he has made some progress in the translation of Klopstock 's Messiah . It must not be supposed , however , that he is a mere translator ; his original writings are praised as full of force and beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic writers , and Finnur Magnuson , who is remarkable for the purity of his writings in Danish and Latin , as well as in his own language , are the only other recent poets , whose fame approaches that of Thorlakson . After reaching the northern coast , Dr. Henderson directed his course towards the eastern shore , and travelled thence , in the vicinity of the sea , back to Reykiavik . In a journey like this , there was not much room for incident ; the greatest natural curiosity which he encountered was the ice-mountain of Breidamark , in the south-easterly part of the island near the sea . It is more properly a plain than a mountain ; though towering to a great height , its top is a vast and level field of ice , extending nearly twenty miles to the north-west till it reaches the Ora3fa-Yokul , which rises to the height of more than six thousand feet ; two thousand higher than Mount Hekia . The tract covered by the Breidamark was once a fertile region , through which the waters flowing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying with them in // 84 July , their progress masses of ice ; which , settling on the plain , gradually accumulated into an immense unbroken glacier . This has been for centuries advancing towards the sea-shore , sometimes with a rapidity which it is difficult to explain . When Dr. Henderson passed round its base , it had completely covered the track of travellers of the preceding year . In 1793 , it advanced more than two hundred fathoms . If it should continue to press forward in the same manner , the communication between the southern and eastern districts by this route , now the usual and only eligible one , will be entirely lost . The Orinfa mountain , just mentioned , is not only the loftiest in Iceland , but has been rendered remarkable by the great devastation made by its eruption about a century ago . Nothing can be more striking than the account of this calamity given by Jon Thorlakson , the aged minister of a neighboring parish . He was in the midst of his service on the Sabbath , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event was to follow . Rushing from the church , he saw a peak of the neighboring mountain alternately heaved up and sinking ; the next day , this portion of the mountain ran down into the plain , like melted metal from a crucible , filling it to such a height , that , as he says , *no more of a mountain which formerly towered above it could be seen , than about the size of a bird ; volumes of water being in the mean time thrown forth in a deluge from the crater , sweeping away whatever they encountered in their course . The Oriefa itself then broke forth , hurling huge masses of ice to a great distance ; fire burst out in every direction from its sides ; the sky was darkened by the smoke and ashes , so that the day could hardly be distinguished from the night . This scene of horror continued for more than three days , during which the whole region was converted into utter desolation . But even this was surpassed by the eruption of the Skaptar , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable distance from the sea , which took place about fifty years ago , spreading its torrent of lava an hundred feet in depth , to the distance of forty or fifty miles on two of its sides . Mount Hekla is in danger of losing its reputation as a volcano . It sinks into insignificance when compared with some of the other burning mountains of the island , though it appears to have exceeded them all ' in the number of its eruptions . Dr. Henderson passed near its base , without attempting to ascend it // But his neglect to do this did not arise from want of enterprise or curiosity ; as he afterwards accomplished the more difficult task of ascending the Sna*fell , a mountain which stretches through the whole length of a large peninsula on the western coast . On the summit , a tutelary divinity is supposed by the natives to reside , who is indignant when the pure atmosphere of his lofty abode is profaned by the breath of man . He found nothing but a prospect of astonishing magnificence and beauty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by Dr. Henderson of the sulphur springs near Reykiahlid , in the northern part of the island . After ascending the Sulphur mountain , from which sulphur is taken by the peasants as an article of commerce , he witnessed a scene , of which he gives this account . Almost directly below the brink on which I stood , at the depth of more than six hundred feet , lay a row of large caidrons of boiling mud , twelve in number , which were in full and constant action ; roaring , splashing , and sending forth immense columns of dense vapor , that , rising and spreading in the atmosphere , in a great measure intercepted the rays of the sun , who stood high above the horizon in the same direction . The boldest strokes of poetic fiction would be utterly inadequate to a literal description of the awful realities of this place ; nor can any ideas , formed by the strongest human imagination , reach half the grandeur , or the terrors , of the prospect . I stood for about a quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes intensely fixed on the dreadful operations that were going on in the *ibyss below me , when turning to the left , I had a full view of the tremendous Krabla , the Obsidian mountain , and two or three other volcanic mountains , whose names I could not learn with any certainty . Leading our horses down the side of the mountain , in a zig-zag direction , we advanced towards the hverar ; but as the steeds grew rather restive , and the soil began to lose its firmness , we left them behind us , and proceeded , with wary step , among numerous burning quagmires , till we came close to the springs . Excepting two , which lie at the distance of twenty yards from the rest , they are all crowded together into one vast chasm of the lava . Some of them remain stationary within the crevice , but roar terribly , and emit much steam ; others boil violently , and splash their black muddy contents round the orifice of the pit ; while two or three jet , at intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most remarkable , however , is that at the northern extremity of the chasm . Its smallest diameter , down at the surface of the puddle , may be about fourteen feet , but it opens // gradually to the edge , where the chasm is at least twenty feet across . The water , which was quite turbid and black , was comparatively quiet about two minutes , when it broke forth in a most furious manner , jetting to the height of between ten and fifteen feet , and splashing between the jets , in oblique directions , on every side , which rendered it dangerous to stand near the margin . What increased the danger , was the softness of the soil , which appeared to fill other chasms close to the great one , so that , on making a sudden leap to avoid being scalded , a person can hardly avoid plunging into semi-liquid beds of hot clay and sulphur , an alternative still more shocking . The jetting is accompanied by a harsh roar , and the escape of a vast quantity of vapor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harvest-home , and the ordinary occupations of the people during the winter . We may here remark , that he was led to the opinion , that the winters of Iceland were not remarkably severe ; but the one which he passed there was considered far milder than usual . From the accounts of other travellers , however , it would appear , that the cold , though long continued , is not commonly so great as it is in the same latitude on the continent , The most important branch of rural labor in Iceland , is the hay-making . About the middle of July , the peasant begins to cut down the grass of the tfin ( the green around his house ) , which is immediately gathered to a convenient place , in order to dry , and after having been turned once or twice , is conveyed home on horseback to the yard , where it is made up into stacks . At the poorer farms , both men and women handle the scythe ; but in general , the women only assist in making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island , where there is much hay , the peasants hire men from the fishing plains , who are paid for their labor at the rate of thirty pounds of butter a week . They cut by measurement ; the daily task being about thirty square fathoms . Hay-harvest being over , the sheep and cattle that had been out all summer on the moantains are collected ; the houses are put into a state of repair for the winter ; the wood needed for domestic purposes is brought home to each farm ; the turf is also taken in . During the winter , the care of the cattle and the sheep devolves entirely on the men ; and consists chiefly in feeding and watering the former , which are kept in the house , while the latter are turned out in the day-time to seek their food through the snow . When the snow happens to be so deep , that they can not // scrape it away themselves , the boys do it for them ; and as the sustenance thus procured is exceedingly scanty , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The farm hay is given to the cows alone . All the horses , excepting perhaps a favorite riding horse , are left to shift for themselves the whole winter , during which season they never lie down , but rest themselves by standing in some place of shelter . The domestic employments of this season are multiplied and various . The men are occupied in fabricating necessary implements of iron , copper , wood , &amp;c. ; and some of them are wonderfully expert , as silversmiths ; their work , at times , in this , being only distinguishable from that done in Copenhagen by the absence of the stamp . They also prepare hides for shoes ; make ropes of hair or wool ; and full the woollen stuffs , which is generally effected in the following curious manner . Both ends being knocked out of a barrel , it is filled with the articles to be fulled , when it is laid on the side , and to men lie down on their backs , one at either end , with their feet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it against each other . Smaller articles they full by placing them between their knees and breast , and then moving backwards and forwards with the body , turning them always with their hands till ready . This accounts for the very awkward motion which the Icelanders almost always fall into when sitting , and from which many of them can not refrain even in church . The fishermen full their mittens by dipping them now and then in the salt water , while plying at the oar . In some parts of the country , the men also spin and knit like the women , and some of them weave . ' We have already observed , that it is not our purpose to follow Dr. Henderson in his various journeys , through places that are hardly known except by his descriptions ; and we turn with more pleasure to those portions of his work , in which he describes the character and manners of the present inhabitants of the island . We are naturally curious to know what traces of their ancient state are yet to be discovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that of other nations . Their means of literary improvement are at this time limited and few ; but the love of literature has not passed away ; and it is surprising to see with what tenacity they cling to it , under every disadvantage . Only a single school remains in the island ; and the privileges of that are exclusively reserved for those who are destined to fill the various offices of church and state . Parish schools , and institutions of any sort for general education , are altogether unknown ; // 88 Henderson 's Iceland . the law makes no provision ; so that little is to be expected , except what chance or individual exertion may do . The only regulation which bears the semblance of a legal provision for instruction , is one , by which every clergyman is required to teach his parishioners of all ages the catechism at least twice a year . A century ago , there were several schools established in various districts , the endowments of which have since been taken by the Danish crown , and given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned . This is calculated to receive no more than twenty-five scholars ; and besides being thus limited in the extent of its advantages , its popularity has been diminished by the objections of many to certain religious sentiments embraced by its instructers . In the absence of the ordinary means of education , and separated from each other as individuals and families are during the long and dreary winter season , it might be expected that the people would decline into a state of hopeless ignorance ; but the fact is otherwise ; every defect is as far as possible supplied by a system of which no better examples can be elsewhere found . It is the grateful task of the parent to instruct the child ; in this way , he relieves the weariness and solitude of winter ; and from it is derived a fertile source of happiness . Dr. 1-lenderson has given us a pleasing description of a winter evening in an Icelandic family , when all its members are assembled to pursue their various tasks , while the Sagas , or some other historical or religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest . Owing to the deficiency of books , they are compelled to copy such as can be had for this purpose ; often , some itinerant historian , whose memory is stored with legendary tales , claims their hospitality , until his literary resources run low , when he finds a willing audiencq in another cottage . All travellers agree , that it is rare to find an individual who can neither write nor read ; the hand-writing of many is described as being of remarkable beauty . With such a disposition for acquiring knowledge , and so much leisure as their climate gives them , it is unfortunate that their opportunities should be no greater . The only printing-press of the island was for many years rendered useless , by an unhappy difference of opinion . Its proprietor was convinced , that his own works were the only ones worth reading , and refused to publish any other ; while the people were equally strong in the belief , that there were scarcely any which were less so ; and refused in consequence to // buy them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to qualify the remark , that the law does nothing to aid the spirit of improvement ; it interferes only in the way of penalty . The ecclesiastical code provides , that clergymen may prohibit the marriage of females who can not write and read ; and the ministers of justice , when inflicting punishment on the young for small offences , have occasionally applied the whip with great propriety to the parents also , for bringing them up so ill . The character and efforts of the clergy have done much to cherish and promote this spirit . There is no country , in which this class of men are more true to their honorable calling , or revive more vividly the remembrance of the apostolic age . With a compensation , to which the most disinterested might object , and the mere name of which would freeze the blood of the incumbent of a princely benefice , scarcely a single instance is known , in which their conduct has brought discredit upon their sacred office . They are in general men of some literary ambition and attainment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest living has no higher revenue than two hundred dollars ; that of the greater portion varies from thirty to fifty dollars ; and there are several , in which it does not exceed five . Making every allowance for the high value of money , there is certainly nothing of affluence or luxury in such an income . Small glebes are often attached to the churches , but the benefits of these are limited by the unproductiveness of a soil , upon which no grain has been cultivated within the memory of man . A tithe is paid , not according to the produce , but the fixed rent of the land ; but where this rent does not commonly exceed five or six dollars , it may be conceived that the portion of the clergy must border on the scanty . We are struck with admiration , when we see bright examples of genius , learning , and moral worth , shining out from these abodes of privation and wretchedness . Their habitations are earthen cottages , in no respect superior to those of the poorest peasant ; stoves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them ; there is but a single apartment , which has any other flooring than the naked earth ; and it would be unjust to apply to their contents the name of furniture . Besides the manual labor by which the deficiencies of their compensation are supplied , they are compelled to encounter perils of every description in the discharge of their arduous duties fording rivers swollen by the mountain torrents , // 90 Henderson 's Iceland* climbing precipices rendered dangerous by ice and snow , and wandering through wild and desolate tracts , in the dead of winter . Such men do no less honor to the Lutheran church of which they are members , than to the discriminating judgment of the various governors and bishops of Iceland ; the dignitaries , to whom the selection of them is confided by the crown of Denmark . Dr. Henderson , in common with other travellers , bears equally emphatic testimony to the general worth of the people . Even in Reykiavik , where the example of foreigners is very unfavorable to morality , it has had little influence on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some say , from the absence of temptation , or as others more charitably believe , from the general diffusion of religious principle , crimes of a heinous nature are hardly known . Their bearing indicates a lofty sense of personal independence ; they feel a just pride in the glory of their ancestors , and the former distinction of their country ; there is no people , who cherish a warmer feeling of patriotism or a deeper attachment to their native land ; it is one of their favorite proverbs , that the sun shines on no happier region than their own . These characteristics are the more curious , because they are rarely found among a people whose physical condition is so little to be envied . It seems to be generally ordained in the system of Providence , that civilization shall find her permanent abodes , neither beneath the tropics , nor on the borders of the polar circle ; neither in a land which yields its abundance without the intervention of labor , nor where a scanty subsistence is hardly wrung from the reluctant soil . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial exception to this law ; and it is the more honorable to her people , that they nearly triumphed over nature , in formerly maintaining wise institutions of government and law , and a commendable spirit of moral improvement now , on the very boundary of the habitable globe . One or two extracts from this work will illustrate , as fir as a few examples can , the intelligence and information of the peasantry . As I rode along , ' says Dr. Henderson , I was entertained by the interesting conversation of a peasant , who was travelling to Reykiavik in order to dispose of his country produce . The knowledge he discovered of the geography and politics of Britain quite astonished me . He gave me a long detail of the events that transpired during the usurpation of Cromwell , and proposed // several questions relative to the Thames , Tay , Forth , &amp;c . His acquaintance with these things he had derived principally from Danish books ; and having lately fallen in with an interesting work in German , he has begun to learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents . ' Of another peasant , the author says , Finding that he took a very lively interest in the success of the British and Foreign Bible Society , I gave him a brief view of the extent of its operations , and read to him the very interesting letter addressed by the King of Persia to Sir Gore Ouseley , relative to the new version of the Persian New Testament . Having mentioned that it was dated in the year IS29 , a little boy , who was standing beside us , observed , that " it must be a very old letter . " " No , my lad , " replied the peasant , turning to him , " you must recollect that the letter is not written according to our computation ; it is dated agreeably to the Hegirak . " ' The success which attended our author 's honorable mission , would of itself be enough to prove , that these representations are not exaggerated . Wherever he directed his course , he was received with kindness and almost with enthusiasm . The copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own resources were inadequate to supply the deficiency ; when the society , of which this gentleman was the agent , liberally interposed to relieve them . He found the clergy universally ready and anxious to second his benevolent efforts ; the copies which he carried with him were received with unaffected gratitude , of which be has given several instances , that almost put the indifference of Christians elsewhere to shame . It is not the least among the evidences of this , that the venerable Thorlakson expressed his thanks to the society in a poem , which breathes much of the fire of his earlier days . Some portions of the work have been omitted by the American publishers ; but the more interesting parts are preserved entire , and its value to the general reader is very little , if at all , impaired . We should regret the loss of the appendix , in which the author treats at length of the literature of Iceland , if the information it contains were not readily found elsewhere . The work is not the production of a scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other objects than a critical examination of physical phenomena ; but it gives a deep and familiar insight into the domestic character and manners of a // simple and virtuous community . Not that the author was indifferent to the natural wonders , which are so liberally scattered over the face of this wild and peculiar region ; these he describes with animation and felicity ; while the principal charm of his narrative arises from the fact , that it is a fireside picture.
