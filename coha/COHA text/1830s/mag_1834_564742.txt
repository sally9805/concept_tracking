txt a writer , whose philosophy was equaled only by his poetry , and who was illustrious in both , it is declared , that spite of pride , in erring reason 's spite , One truth is clear ,  --  whatever is is right . " This well-known and oft-recited couplet constitutes , in its spirit and meaning , the theme on which I purpose to make a few observations . It is a succinct coniment on what has been well denominated the harmonies of nature ; that prevailing aptitude between the various works of creation , which holds them in practical accordance with each other , and produces the grand result termed optimism . To this word a twofold interpretation has been affixed . By some philosophers , it has been made to express the best system and condition of things that the Deity is able to produce ; by others , the perfection of the present system according to its grade , without saying whether , as a whole , it might or might not have been formed on a higher model . The difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so essential as to render it imperative on me to express a preference of either over the other . I therefore decline doing so . Both parties , concerned in. the inquiry , concur in the belief , that , in its totality , creation is balanced as it ought to be ; that it is , in all respects , fitted to itself ; that there is not , in the *ntire machine , a faulty pin or pivot , axle or wheel ; that , , therefore , no portion of it could be revolutionized , without producing discord , and marring it operations ; and that , to this , man does not constitute an exception , but is as well suited to his sphere , as any other subject of the animal kingdom is to that in which it moves .. In the remarks I have to offer on this form of belief , it will be perceived , that I am a proselyte to it ; that I consider it not only alone consistent with truth , but alone compatible with sentiments of becoming regard toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essential element of religion , as inculcated by the structure and economy of the universe-by all we see , all we know , and all we can imagine of creation and its God . Nor was my adoption of it , in strict language , a voluntary act . I was not at liberty to perform or decline it at option . Evidence from every quarter , collected by observation and matured by reflection , pressed on me with a force , which I could not resist , and compelled me to adopt it . The term " compelled " is here employed neither figuratively nor inadvertently , but intentionally and in its literal meaning . As relates to the adoption of opinions , the laws of mind are as fixed and compulsory as those of matter . Being equally under the authority of nature , they are executed by her with no less strictness , and must be obeyed . This sentiment is not at war with a belief in the freedom of the will . There are involuntary actions of mind as well as of body-actions , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be resisted . We are at perfect liberty to examine any given subject , or to decline it , at pleasure . So far we are free agents . But , being engaged in the examination , if evidence be fairly presented to us , and our minds are sound , and unbiaced by sinister influence , we are driven into a conclusion , whether it be agreeable to us or not . Under such circumstances we can no more choose whether to believe , disbelieve , or suspend our opinion , than we can whether we shall fall downward or rise upward , by the principle of gravitation , when that , which supports , is soddenly withdrawn ; no more than we can , whether we shall feel pain or pleasure , or not feel at all , whemi our flesh is lacerated , or an i nited body is applied to our skin . Hence no man , who faithfully and industriously inquires , and avails himself of every accessible source of information , is morally responsible for the opinion he forms , whether it be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not culpable . I e forms it of necessity , and is no more blame-worthy on account of it , than he is on account of his complexion or figure . Over a sound and well-disciplined mind , evidence is as controling and imperative , as are the laws of gravitation over ponderous bodies . It might perhaps be perceived , without any acknowledgement of mine to that effect , that I not only attach some importance to these remarks , as expressing a general truth , but that I feel at present a person I interest in them . In the ca // pacity of a stranger , I am addressing an audience , " to whose good opinion I am far from beinir indifferent ; more especially as relates to my moral character . That many xviii deem some of the sentiments , I am aboot to deliver , unfounded , I can scarcely doubt . Bot that does not disquiet me . To err is human ; and it does not mortify me to confess , that , in that respect , I have my full share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a spirit of enlightened liberality will prevent the charge from extending any further ; and that my supposed errors will not be visited on me as actual faults . Whether right or wrong , the views I shall deliver have not been hastily formed . They are as mature as time and industry , with such powers as I possess , have enabled me to render them . The subject of them has often and intensely occupied me by day , when some who may probably censure me for them were pursuing their amusements , and by night when they were unconsciously pressing their pillows . Perhaps , therefore , troth might justify me in alleging , that they have as little ground to blame me for differing in opinion from them , as I have to blame them for differing from me . And I am not so illiberal as to prefer any accusation against them on that score . I shall close these observations by adding , that roy purpose is to treat the subject under examination as a in tter of philosophy only , leaving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology . And now to return from this digression , under an engagement not again to wander from my theme . I have professed myself an optimist . Hence , according to the exposition already given , my belief is , that all things are as they ought to be ; that creation is throughout in harmony with itself ; that it presents a scheme of universal adaptation ; and that , therefore , if one part of it is wrong , it is all wrong . And I repeat , that this creed is forced on roe , and riveted in my mind , by a power of evidence , which I can no more resist , than I shall be able to break the grasp of death , when he shall have received his commission to lay his hand on me . A few of the reasons which have led to these views I shall briefly specify . A detail of the whole of them would fill volumes . In the language of the schools , my matter of argument shall be drawn a priori arid a posteriori . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of a GREAT FIRST CAUSE , who is eternal in being , and infinite in wisdom , goodness , and power . Nor is he 1555 so in justice , mercy , and his other attributes . I believe him to have been the creator and e arranger of the universe . He not only called it into being ; he placed it in order , and laid it in subjection to the laws which govern it ; and in obedience to those laws was every subsequent event to occur . This view of the subject appears , I think , to give the best interpretation to that beautiful text of Scripture , setting forth , that not even a sparrow can fall to the ground without his notice , or in contravention of his purpose . Yet , according to the prevailing hypothesis on the subject , thousands of events in direct opposition to his will ( which is his law ) are occurring every moment ; and he is obliged to be constantly repairing , by special interposition , something which he has previously allowed to go wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a want of wisdom or power to prevent it . The soundness of the positions here laid down will not be controverted . Let us advert , then , for a moment , to their necessary consequences . Is the Deity eternal in existence ; was he anterior to all other existences , and did all others necessarily proceed from him ? then is he literally the parent of all things , whether xve denominate them good or bad . But he could not produce beings in direct opposition to his own nature , and in active hostility with his own views . For perfection thus to produce iniperfection is impossible . Good and evil , each being positive and exclusive , can not stand related to each other , as parent and offspring . An assertion to that effect would be self-contradictory . Let this point be examined inure closely and analytically . Was the Deity , in the morning of creation , as he is now , infinite in goodness and purity ? From a necessity arising orit of his own nature , he wished for a creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or worthy of him . An intention to produce one marked with imperfection , would have testified conclusively to his own imperfection . I mean his imperfection in morals . Was he , as he is now , infinite in knowledge and wisdom , ? He comprehended , of course , every thing requisite for the accomplishment of his desire Was he , as * This article was prepared and delivered , by invitation , as a public address , in a place where the author was a stranger ; and iris riot deemed necessary to alter the language . There is even some fitness in it to the present occasion , the author being also a stranger to the readers of the New-England Magazine , whose good opinion would be gratifying to him . // 19 he is now , infinite in power ? He was perfectly competent to the execution of his design . Creation , then , must have been originally perfect , and in complete accordance with the wishes of its author . This , no one will venture to deny . Each part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whole ; and the whole was obedient to the God that made it . There was in it no defect any more than in himself ; nor could any power but his own produce one . But to allege that he , of his own accord , and in opposition to his own moral nature , which consists in perfect goodness , holiness , truth , and **25;852;TOOLONG , would capriciously and causelessly mar his own work , would be a charge against him , marked alike with presumption and absurdity . It would be to assert the production of an effect , not only without a cause , but in direct opposition to every existing cause . Between every effect and its cause there prevails , of necessity , a native affinity . In other words , every thing produces in its own likeness . Good directly produces good . When associated with and aided by competent wisdom and power , it is impossible for it to produce evil . From what source then can evil proceed ? From evil alone ; or from some sort of imperfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencement of duration , before the work of creation began , when the Deity dwelt in immensity alone , no evil existed , either in act or intention . The Deity himself was all in all ; and he was all perfection . How then could evil gain an existence ? The answer is plain . It could not gain it at all , except through the paradox of an effect without a cause ; or , what is still worse an effect in opposition to all existing causes . Shall I be told that the Deity permitted evil , but did not produce it ? I reply , that , admitting the existence of evil , he , being the author of all things , created that which did produce it , and hence indirectly produced it himself , having the power to prevent it . In the strictest sense of the term , therefore , by permitting it he was accessary to it . By acting in such a way , man not only incurs blame , but subjects himself to punishment . One individual sees another about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having the power to prevent him , declines to do so . He always shares the guilt , and , if strictly dealt with , the penalty also . Such , ifI mistake not , is both the law and the practice . Let no mortal , then , charge on the Deity that , which would stamp himself as a felon . If , then , positive evil does exist , the Creator of all things is as certainly the author of it , directly or iiidirectly , as lie is of positive good . The case is not in the slightest degree altered by allegiry , that he made men and angels free agents , and that they perpetrated evil of their own accord . When he gave them their freedom he gave them also their propensities ; for they could no more create their propensities than they could create themselves . II is perfect foreknowledge , therefore , apprized him of the result . He knew that , with the power and disposition he had imparted to them , they would do mischief . Yet he permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . This was worse than mere connivance at evil . To bestow both the power and disposition to crime , and then to connive at the commission of it , is to be its real author . It is to place the dagger in the assassin 's hand , encourage him to use it , and invigorate his arm when he strikes the blow . This picture of enormity , offensive as it is ) is not so dark as that , which is affixed on the Deity , in the usual delineation of his character . He is charged with having created man , and bestowed on him propensities , which he knew would hurry him into vice . He then forbade him , under the most grievous penalty , to commit a crime , which it was confidently known to him he would commit , in obedience to an inclination which he had himself implanted in him , as a part of his constitution . Nor did this prohibitory command communicate to him any countervailing inclination . It was arbitrary , and in opposition to a principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deity , offended at the issue of his own arrangement , inflicted punishment . Such is the representation given of the Ruler of the universe , whose nature is perfect . Comment is needless . The following case is analogous , though much weaker . A father trains his son to vicious practices . He then sternly forbids him to commit a crime , for which he has cultivated in him a propensity , until it has become irresistible . The youth disobeys , and suffers death by his father 's command ! Another view , somewhat different , which is at times presented , respecting this same point , is , that all things were created in perfection ; but that they afterwards degenerated and ran into evil . This proposition refutes itself . Had they been made perfect , and placed under laws equally perfect , and in due accordance with them , they could not have degenerated . The very process of degeneracy bespeaks // imperfection . To pronounce any thing perfect , and yet liable to deteriorate , is to assert a contradiction . Shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human intellect can not comprehend , and of sacred things , which ought not to be familiarly approached and handled ? I reply , that this is an attempt to evade the question , and to prevent inquiry . Were I to add , that such an effort indicates , in those who make it , some doubt of the soundness of their doctrine , I would not say more than circumstances justify . Truth solicits scrutiny , at the same time that it defies it . Conscious error alone shrinks from investigation . I am not speaking of mysteries , but of the obvious relation of cause and effect ; so obvious , indeed , that no one who will carefully examine the subject can fail to perceive it . Nor is any thing too sacred to he made a theme of inquiry . The touch of the reasoning faculties of man desecrates nothing . The admonition , " approach not , lest you tread on sacred ground , " is too often given from unworthy motives , and for unholy purposes . It is not half a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against inquiring into the " divine right " of kings to enslave their subjects ; and in many parts it is given so still . In the eye of the church , the inquiry is unholy ; and in that of the state , criminal . With the latter , the man who practices it , does so at the hazard of losing his head ; with the former , of forfeiting his salvation . But , wherever light and reason prevail , all such warnings are disregarded ; and those who represent any thing as too sacred to he examined , are considered under the influence of superstition , personal interest , or hypocrisy . Serious apprehensions are entertained that those who wear the mitre and the gown continue to urge the admonition now , from the same motive with those who sway the sceptre  --  to perpetuate their own power . But , be the motive what it may , the practice is injurious , and ought to be abolished . It puts fetters on the human mind , narrows its range of action , plays the unrelenting tyrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the perpetuation of ignorance , credulity , and prejudice . Lu the preceding chain of reasoning , it has not been my intention to clothe a paradox in the garb of seeming truth . I disclaim now and forever all connexion with premeditated sophistry , and every form of disingenuousness . My only object has been to exhibit what I conceive to be the essential and eternal relation between cause and effect ; in other words , to sustain truth , the only end at which I ever aim . If I have erred , a frank and manly exposition of my errors will be gratifying to me ; because it will instruct myself as well as others . If , on the contrary , 1 have been successful in my effort , it clearly follows , that all things are as they ought to be , and as they were originally intended to be ; and that positive evil is but a name ; in the words of the poet , that " all partial evil is universal good . " I shall now present a brief view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my subject ; that , I mean , derived a postsriori ; or , in simpler language , which is furnished by observation . In this part of my task , I encounter but one obstacle . The body of testimony which liresents itself is so great , and all so excellent , that I find it extremely diffic , ? lt to select . Nature is replete with it . It forms a constellation of truths so bright and forcible , as to produce conviction in all who examine them without prejudice , and with the attention they deserve . Look around on creation , a far as mortal ken can reach , or the most minute investigation penetrate ; from worlds to atoms , and through all living and dead matter ; and nothing is ( liscovered but one universal scheme of aptitude . The more rigorously that scheme is scrutinized , the more perfect it is found to be , and the more deep and permanent is the admiration it excites . There exists nothing inappropriate to the place it occupies ; nothing can be indicated redundant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single article that would not be for the worse . Would you change the figure of suns and l ) lanets that are scattered through space ? It is clearly demonstrable , that nothing but spheres would answer the purpose for which they are intended . Mould them into any other form , and unless a corresponding alteration be made in their economy , and the entire system to which they belong , ruin will ensue . Would you , by elevating plains and vab. leys , or by lowerintr hills and mountains , reduce the surface of the earth to a level ? You would unfit it for the subsistence of the living beings , both vegetable and animal , that now inhabit it , and convert it into a desert , until new and suitable races should be formed . The effect of a radical change in the atmoosphere or the ocean would be the same . Any material alteration in the relative extent of land // 21 and sea would derange the present order of things , and call for a new one . So would alterations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and night , and the various meteors that shed their influence around us . All this could he satisfactorily proved , had I leisure to dwell on it . To the student of nature it seems self-evident . In tracing this beautiful scheme of adaptation it is worthy of remark , that the snore essential any agent is to the existence and welfare of living matter , the more extensive is its prevalence , and the more ahundant its quantity . This is especially true of water , air , light , electricity , and the matter of heat . There is reason to believe , that if entirely deprived of either of these , living existence on earth would cease . Certainly this would be the case with all forms of living matter now in being . Water , air , light , electricity , and the matter of heat , are e sseritial to them . They are therefore attainable in every part of the globe . This remark is applicable also to color . The shades , that are most salutary as well as most pleasing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forests , are green ; and distant mountains , the ocean , and the heavens , are blue . But these are the objects that are most constantly looked on . Render them white , yellow , or red , or give to them any strong and glaring color , and they will injure the eyes of animals , unless they also are changed , and brought into harmony with them . The truth of this appears from the injury dune to the organs of vision by looking too long at the sun , or at a-volcano during an intense eruption , and by the light reflected from islands of ice , and from plains and mountains covered with snow . It further appears from the well-known fact , that the impression of blue and green rays of light is least painful and injurious to eyes that are inflamed or unusually sensitive . However pleasing other colors may be for a time , they can not be so long and constantly looked on with safety as these two . Were there time to do justice to the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the peculiar adaptation of all vegetables to the places where they grow in a native state . This constitutes one of the most delightful of the harmonies of nature . The adaptation embraces several points , each of which may be considered a genus , subdivided into species and varieties . The leading points are soil , climate , humidity , and elevation above the level of the ocean . The diversities in these are exceedingly numerous , each giv ? ng existence , according to fitness , to different plants . From this arises the boundless variety of the vegetable kingdom , every peculiar tract of country producing according to its native character . Hence , could the whole surface of the earth be embraced at a single view , it would exhibit a magnificent panorama of vegetable mosaic . It would be tessalated by the diversified growth of the tropics , the temperate climates , and the polar regions ; and by that of valleys , plains , hills , and mountains . Oceans , lakes , and rivers , would add to the variety , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins . Seasons also would have their influence . This picture , so beautiful to the eye of taste , would be still more so to the spirit of philosophy . In the latter point of view , its beauty would consist in the great scheme of aptitude indicated by it . Each description of plants would be seen flourishing and smiling in the situation allotted to it , and best suited to its character , by the wisdom and beneficence of the PARENT of all things . No interchange of place between any two species could be effected without injury to each  --  the deterioration , certainly , if not the extinction of both . In fine , the whole would pre ent a portrait of optimism , as resistless in its philosophy , as it would be grand in its outline , and rich in its coloring . Shall we-turn our attention to the animal kingdom , and inquire for a moment into the character and condition of that interesting department of nature ? Here again we find nothing but order and aptitude-every thing precisely as reason says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another , for the purpose of subsistence , is no exception to this . Were there time for the analysis , it could be easily shown , that , instead of being marked with cruelty , or indicating a defect in the harmony of nature , that is a dispensation of benevolence and wisdom . When we refer , therefore , to a future period of concord and felicity , in which all strife among the inferior animals shall cease , the lion reposing with the lamb , under the shadow of the same branch , on which the eagle and the dove shall be perched in amity-in referring to such an event , I say , we speak as poets , not as philosophers ; and predict a state of things , which , in the literal meaning of the terms , will never occur . It belongs to the same strain of fiction with the " golden age ' of the Greeks and Romans . Were it possible , moreover , that it should occur , unless it were accompanied by many other corresponding changes , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than happiness . It would suhvert the aptitude which now exists , constituting the beauty and order of earthly creation , without which felicity would be but a name . The animal kingdom is composed of many kinds of beings , to which the same remarks that have been made on vegetables are strictly applicable . Each kind inhabits by instinct the place that is most suitable to it , and pursues from the same cause the mode of life that best befits it . Let the least change be made in either respect , and mischief will ensue . To be more particular . To people the three great localities , or , as they were once termed , elements , of water , earth , and air , there are three distinct families of animals ; fish , quadrupeds , and birds ; or , to speak more comprehensively , as well as more accurately , animals that swim , animals that walk or creep , and animals that fly . And an interchange of their abodes could not be made without extinguishing the whole . Between these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as links to complete the chain of being . But I can not descend to the notice of minuthe . Immerse animals that fly , walk , or creep , in the aqueous element , and they will be drowned *in water ; bring those that swim into the atmosphere , and they will be drowned in air . It is as real drowning in the one case as in the other . In both , the suspension of respiration , from immersion in an unsuitable element , is the cause of death . But this is not all . The proper food of these three classes of animals is found only in the situations they respectively inhabit . Examine , moreover , their form and general provisions , and they will be found specifically adapted to their places of residence and modes of life . The figure of a fish is precisely fitted for gliding through the ! water , and its fins , tail , and their movement , to propel and guide it . The rudder of a ship and its motions are but a clumsy imitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another provision of no small importance is the position of the scales of a fish and the mucus which covers them . The lubricity given by this to the body of the animal , while it aids in protecting it from irritation , facilitates not a little its passage through the water . The force of this remark will be perceived by contemplating for a moment the effect that would be produced by roughening the scales , and inverting their position , so as to make them point in a forward direction . By such an alteration the progress of the animal would be greatly impeded , if not entirely prevented . Equally well fitted to stand , walk , run , or bound , is the figure of quadrupeds , with the limbs and feet that support them , and the muscles that give them motion . To these purposes their whole frame is admirably adapted , as a minute analysis of its mechanism demonstrates . Nor is their covering less peculiarly suited to their wants . Is the climate cold ? it is thick , furry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparse , and comparatively cool . Does the animal resort to the water for food or sheller ? it is calculated to give the requisite protection from that element . In variable climates , moreover , the hair of animals changes , that the covering it affords may be suited to the different seasons of the year . It is thicker and longer in winter , and thinner and shorter in summer . It is also in the former season , to render it a better preservative of the warmth of the body , mixed in many quadrupeds with a larger quantity of fur , than in the latter . In all its changes its fitness is preserved . The aptitude of birds to inhabit the atmosphere would seem , if possible , still more complete . Their figure , pointed in front , is peculiarly adapted to pass with ease through the yielding element . Their bodies have but little comparative weight ; their muscles , especially those that move the wings , are uncommonly powerful in proportion to their size , and their wing-feathers are models of lightness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their capacity to inflate various parts of their bodies with air , by means of tubes communicating with the lungs , increase their fitness for their aerial mode of life , particularly for the art of flying . Nor must I pass unnoticed the aptitude of their feathers to protect them , not only from mechanical injuries , but also from cold , rain , and every form of atmospherical moisture . The down of those that inhabit the north is analagous to the fur of northern quadrupeds , and subserves a similar purpose . They also , like quadrupeds , change their covering , from lighter to heavier , and the reverse , to fit it to the temperature of the different seasons of the year . The power to inflate their bodies with air , and thus increase their dimensions , bestows on certain sea-fowls a striking aptitude for their mode of life , It enables them to render themselves , at pleasure , much more buoyant in water , than they would be without it . This capacity they bring into action whenever their safety calls for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are rarely seen , except // 23 at a great distance from land . When they are overtaken by a tempest , therefore , their l ) reservation depends entirely on their buoyancy . And that is the emergency , in which their instinct prompts them to exercise their art . Hence they distend their bodies with air to near the double of their usual hulk , and , floating with the lightness of a wave-tossed feather , ride out the storm in safety . Of this practice , the little auk affords , in its economy , a well-known example . Did the occasion permit me to descend to particulars , it would be delightful to contemplate the peculiar aptitude , in form , armor , instinct , and other attributes , of each species of the feathered race , for its own economy and mode of life . In this view of the subject , the eagle , falcon , and other birds of prey , with their beak , claws , boldness , and strength  --  to which must be added their quick and penetrating vision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So would fowls that frequent the water . Do they wade , and feed on living animals ? Their legs are long and destitute of feathers , their necks long and flexible , with powerful muscles , and their beaks are also long , horny , and pointed like a spear . They are thus well calculated to reach and harpoon their prey . When they have arrived , moreover , , at the proper place , their instinct directs them to stand motionless , until the animal they are in quest of has approached within a suitable distance . They then , with the swiftness of an arrow , aim at it a stroke which seldom errs . Do they swim , and subsist on grass , roots , ooze , or small aquatic animals ? Their legs are short , their feet broad and webbed to serve as paddles ; their bodies flat and also broad that they may float the better ; they have a propensity as well as a power to dive in search of food , and their bills are in every way fitted to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , are especially calculated to afford protection fror.i water , by means of their mattedness and oily character . Add to this , that their eyes are fitted for vision under water , as well as in air . This is an aptitude so peculiarly beautiful , as to merit a few remarks in illustration of it . When the rays of light enter the eye-ball , they must be refracted . so as to decussate each other , before they reach the retina . The power of the ball to refract is in proportion to its rotundity , and the superior density of its humors compared to the density of the medium from which the rays enter it . Is the medium rare ? The humors need not be very dense , nor the ball very globular . Is the medium dense ? The reverse is true . The humors of the eye must be also dense , or its form very round ; or both conditions must exist . Without these relations vision is imperfect . Water is a denser medium than air . When a duck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its eye in the same condition , which suits the purposes of its vision when it is afloat . It has no power , however , to alter the density of the humors of that organ . But it has a power to alter its figure , and render it more globular , by the action of muscles intended for that purpose . And it does so . Hence , as relates to vision , nature has bestowed on it a twofold aptitude ; one for the exercise of that sense in the atmosphere , and another in water , becau seits economy requires it to pass a portion of its time in each element . Fish reside in water alone . Their eyes possess , therefore , as every one must have observed , both the qualities which contribute to a strong refractive power . Their humors are very deiise , and their figure very round . Nor is this all . Their substance is much more combustible than that of the eves of animals that live in air . But Sir Isaac Newton discovered that , other things being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to its combustibility . Hence the perfect adaptation of these aquatic animals to exercise vision in their native element . Nor would I say less in admiration of the suitableness , mental and corporeal , of the various species of quadrupeds for their respective spheres . lii every instance , instinct is peculiarly adapted to the form and constitution of the being , as well as to its mode of life and power of action . The strength , fangs , arid ferocity of the lion , tiger , and panther , with their furtive approach , and arrow-like spring on their prey ; the watchfulness , timidity , and swiftness of the stag and the antelope ; the harmony between the size , structure , and instiiicts of the elephant ; the form and general economy of the camel ; and the peculiar adaptations of the monkey and beaver races , with thousands of traits of other animals equally striking , might be here recited . Indeed , to the rule referred to there is no exception . The same aptitudes are manifested every where . To show how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be perfect harmony between its instincts , form , and mode of life , let us suppose that harmony broken . Give to the lion the instincts of the horse , and to the // Thoughts on Optimism . horse those of ' the lion . Render the latter herbivorous , and the former carnivorous . The consequence is plain . The horse will be unable to take and destroy his l ) rey , and then tear , champ , and eat it , and the lion will be equally incapable of cropping and eating grass ; and they will both die of hunger . Even admit the possibility of their procuring and swallowing their food , they will be unable to digest it , from the unfit character of their stomachs , and the organs associated with them in the process of nutrition . hence disease and death will follow . Interchange the instincts of any other different species of animals , their figures and general organization remaining unaltered , and the issue will be the same . The whole will perish . The migration of birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So is the winter torpidity of the animals that sustain it . The former , finding the temperature of the atmosphere becoming disagreeable to them , and their food growing scarce , remove from their residence to another very distant one , more suitable to them , where their wants can be supplied , and their condition be comfortable . The instinct , which directs them , in this movement , has long excited the admiration of philosophers , and is indeed one of the most remarkable in the history of animated nature . It never guides the voyagers amiss . With the truth and faithfulness of the needle to the pole , it " points the phalanx and directs the way , " until the emigrants arrive at their land of promise . Over plains , mountains , and seas , and through darkness and tempest , it conducts them unerringly , no matter how far , to the consummation of their design . The grandeur of this harmony unites with its beauty to render it striking , and give it impressiveness . Animals retire into their hybernacula , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservation of their lives . The temperature of the atmosphere becomes too low for them , and their food fails . Nor , from their increasing debility , on account of cold , would they be able to take food , did it even abound . Unfit to travel , they can not migrate to a remote and more congenial sky . But one alternative remains . They must perish , or select a winter abode in their native place . In making this selection instinct guides them , and their choice is in harmony with their wants . Their hybernacula protect them at once from cold , enemies , and accident . Add their susceptibility of a state of complete torpor or seeming death , during which they need no food , and of resuscitation in the spring , when warmth and food are again awaiting them , and the whole constitutes an adaptation marked alike by wisdom and benevolence . The strength and beauty of this aptitude are not a little increased by the consideration , that no animals except those who are thus compelled to it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain so for several months , and then revive . The constitutions of the beings , therefore , are accurately adapted to their peculiar destinies . All this , with myriads of other phenomena , of a siniilar description , which might be easily adduced , did time hermit , constitutes so many proofs of optimism not to be resisted . Nor am I acquainted with a fact in the empire of nature , which , when examined and understood , in all its relations , does not testify to the same effect . Are any persons inclined to admit the perfection oh* creation in all other respects , but to deny it as relates to the character of man ? Will they pronounce imperfect and faulty the formation of that being intended to be the first on earth , and the favorite of Heaven , on whose frame and endowments there is reason to believe that his Creator bestowed peculiar pains ? To sport with imputations like this , appears to me to be high-handed daring . To speak plainly of it , it is. virtually to question the intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all things . It is to charge him with having introduced a defective wheel into the great machine he was pleased to construct . Of no other interpretation does it fairly admit . Nor can it be denied that a defect in the work bespeaks a corresponding defect in the workman . That as is the effect , so is the cause , is a truth to which all creation responds . If man , as a part of the universe , be in any respect faulty ; if his being tend in any way to derange universal harmony , or to impede in the slibhtest degree the march of things toward their great consummation , his AUTHOR is to blame-not himself . lie neither made nor endowed himself , any more than the breeze that whispers , or the dew that falls . Nor is he any moore responsible for a defect in his original constitution . But if no such defect existed , he furnishes now as fair and faultless an example of adaptation , as any other object creation contains . If he was originally faultless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for him to be otherwise than // 25 faultless still . I mean as relates to the whole universe and his own destiny . Subsequent deterioration could proceed from nothing but primiUve defect . But confiding fully , as I do , in the perfection of the rt*ficer of creation , I can not , for reasons already stated , admit of the existence of any defect in the product . With an author already quoted , therefore , I am compelled to believe , that " Respecting man , whatever wrong we call , May , , must be , right , as rel tive to all " - and that " The general order , since the whote heran , - Is kept in nature , and is kept in ian . " But perhaps I may he told that thig is poetry . 1 shall offer a few further observations , then , in plain prose , and endeavor to show , that , as far as I have time to analyze him , man is in as perfect harmony with himself , and with all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it be otherwise ? He , like other beings , is formed in necessary subjection to constitutional laws . Those laws constitute the spring and arbiter of his actions ; and Heaven has ordained that they should do so . In obeyin , , them , therefore , entire , and in their true spirit , giving to each the grade it justly claims , preferring , I mean , the laws of his intellectual and moral to those of his animal nature , he fulfills , like other beings , the end of his creation . This subject is at once extensive , multifarious , and intricate . To do it justice , within the limits to which I must confine myself , is impossible . Instead of discussion , I must be content with a few references ; and , instead of arguments , confine myself to hints . Man , as just intimated , possesses a threefold nature ,  - -  animal , intellectual , and moral ,  --  each of which is composed of a number of faculties . His animal faculties relate chiefly to his own personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imtnediate connexions . Of the first class the principal ones are , to breathe , to eat and drink and digest food , to take exercise and repose , and to avoid danger . For the discharge of these duties to self he is amply provided . He is not only furnished with the powers and means to perform them , but with strong constitutional instincts irnl ) elling him to that effect . As respects this point , his provision of aptitudes is not only perfect , but full of beauty . His propensity to breathe is irresistible , and his respiratory apparatus in harmony with the atmosphere , and without a fault . Of his propensity to eat and drink , and his digestive apparatus , the same is true . The former can not be resisted , nor the latter improved . Both are in harmony with food and drinit , the necessity of using them , and the ends to be answered by them . Nor is man 's desire to take exercise and repose less imperious , or his fitness to do so less perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either is necessary , and powers calculated to enable him to enjoy them . The dangers which surround him , though numerous and varied , he is able , by circumspection , to discover and avoid , or , if preferable , repel . This is true , whatever form or character they may assume , provided he employs , to their full extent , the means and powers of safety , with which he is provided . If danger threatens him in a greater number of shapes than it does the inferior animals , he is , in an equal de.ree , more fruitful in expedients to protect himself from it . Has nature declined to cover him with hair , feathers , fur , or down , as a protection from the weather ? She has enabled him to select his material , according to judgement and taste , and prepare a more suitable covering for himself . Has she denied him the teeth , claws , and strength of the lion , the trunk of the elephant , and the swiftness of the eagle , to overtake wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified him to construct weapons of o ? fence , which neither the lion , the elephant , nor the eagle can escape or withstand . As respects his duties to himself ; then , his fitness is complete . Before entering on the consideration of his duties to his own race , let us contemplate man , for a moment , as the head of the animal kingdom-time highest specimen of earthly creation . What are his qtmalifications for this station ? I answer , Precisely what they ought to be . Confer on hitn one more , and it will be superfluous ; take one from him , you render him defective ; revolutionize one , and you again unfit him . This topic is too extensive for a minute analysis ; but a few remarks on it are requisite to my purpose . As head of the animal kingdom , mans province is to rule . And that his provision for this is ample , appears from the fact that he does rule . To this end his corporeal attributes are perfectly adapted . CGmmapared to those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and countenance are emblems of superiority , and his port and air so lofty and commanding , as to bespeak authority , and generally to secure it . Most wild animals acknowledge his supremacy by flying from his presence . The most powerfial and ferocious of them rarely attack him , provided he faces them and stands firm , or boldly advances ; more especially if they observe that bis eye is fixed on them . Even the lion and the tiger have been thus held at bay , and have finally retreated . Their spring is usually made when they fancy themselves unseen . But man 's figure is not alone majestic and commanding . Its aptitude for action is perfect . I mean for action of every kind and in every direction . The facility and speed with which man can wheel , and meet danger or return violence from every quarter , and toward every point , wlietber horizontally , upward , or downward , give him reat advantages when engaged in conflict . In this respect no other animal is comparable to him . But of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arm are the most efficient . Fancy can figure nothing to equal them . Without them he would be feeble , and incapable of either defence or annoyance . With them , when armed and dir cted by mind , he is clothed in earthly omnipotence . He forms with them and brings into action every engine of power and destruction that genius can devise . He thus subdues the lion , the tiger , and the rhinoceros , and tames and domesticatee the horse , the camel , and the elephant , and renders them subservient to his wants and wishes . He arrests , moreover , in their flight , the stag and the antelope , circumvents the cunning of the fox and the beaver , and takes even the leviathan , " as with a hook , " and appropriates him to his uses . Nor can the feathered race escape him . The condor and the eagle are taken in his toils , or flaIl under the aim of his arrows or his fire-arms ; the swan , the peacock , and the falcon decorate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . collected mt aviaries , delight him with their notes ; arid the ostrich , the heron , and the bird of paradise resign to him their plumage ; while the eider-duck and other water-fowls surrender to him their down , as a pillow of repose . Other classes supply the luxuries of his table . In fine , through the instrumentality of the organs mentinned , he bec es literally the " monarch of all he surveys , " whether by land , sea , or air , and makes the whole animal kingdom feel in some way his supremacy , and pay him tribute . In this respect , therefore , his fitness for his station being without defect , the harmony is complete . But man is indebted to Isis hand and arm not only for his dominion over the inferior animals , but for almost all his powers and advantages in civilized life . Architecture of every kind , and machinery of every description , with its products , are the issue of them . Under this head fall writing , the formation and use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid statuary . In a word , but for the subserviency and adroitness of the hand and arm , genius would conceive and wisdom dictate to no purpose-art would fail , and the world be uncultivated . But I must have done with man 's mere corporeal fitnesses , beautiful as they are , and few of them as I have specified , and speak of some of those that belong to the mind . In this view of my subject , the external senses first present themselves . They are intended to connect niams with the world in which he lives , and render him familiar with every thing around him . They are the inlets to the elements of all his knowledge . And for these purposes their fitness is without defect . The external world is made up of matter , with its properties and relations . With these properties and relations it was indispensable that man should be acquainted , that he might avail himself of them for his wants and wishes . And his external senses , with their kindred faculties , are in perfect harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man 's vision and faculty of color take cognizance of them . Is it filled with sound , which may be formed into articulate speech , or modulated into song ? His ear , and his faculties of language and tune hear , understand , and enjoy them . Are some bodies sapid ? His tongue tastes them . Odorous ? His olfactories smell them . Hard , soft , rough , or smooth ? His touch feels them . Hot , or cold ? He has a sense to recognize those qualities also . Have external bodies form , size , and weight ? lie has faculties which qualify him to become familiar with them . Number and duration are other essential attributes of creation , which man ought to know ' . For these he huas also corresponding faculties , which give him a conummud of them . In all these respects , then , his adaptation to the external world is complete . Nor is it less so . as respects the relations of things , as might be clearly demonstrated , could I dwell on the snibject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation are in perfect harmony with them . By // means of these , he acquires a knowledge of similitudes and dissimilitudes , contrasts and analogies , and also of some portion of the chain of cause and effect , whose first link is in the hand of the Deity , and its last in the consummation of all things . Is any one prepared to allege that it is not in his physical or intellectual , but his moral attrihutes that man is deranged , and constitutes a blot on the escutcheon of nature ? Will it he contended that positive evil , unaccompanied by any advantage , is thus introduced into the world , . to brood like a canker-spot , insulated and alone , on the otherwise unsullied face of creation ? I am aware that this is the opinion of many , I might say of a majority of the inhabitants of Christendom , and that those , who oppose or even question it , incur censure , as if they were enemies of morality and religion . But I also know and feel that the imputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not of abstract opinion . Iheir true province is to regulate sentiment and conduct , not philosophical belief ; nor can sound philosophy affect them otherwise than favorably . He , therefore , who honestly endeavors to promote truth , is their advocate andfiiend in design , although he may fail to benefit them in their interests , by falling into error . It is time that the world were disabused of the belief , that man can not be strictly n-moral and religious , without professing certain opinions , and adhering to certain dogmas , against which his reason and conscience rebel , merely because they are upheld by authority . That uch a sentiment prevailed during the dark ages , when superstition sat like an incubus on Christendom , does not surprise us . It was worthy of that period of gloom and barbarism . But it is as groundless as it is uncharitable , and as unsuitable and disgraceful to the present day , as a belief in sorcery . Under these impressions , united to a belief that the tinies will tolerate liberal discussion , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than that of committing mistakes . And under even that misfortune , a consciousness of correct intention , and of having , with some care , examined roy subject , will shield me from self-reproach . My views of the entire perfection of the scheme of creation are such , that I do not , and can not believe in the existence of positive evil , either moral or physical . I am even least inclined to a b lief in the former , because it would testify to the deeper defect . In this position I wish to be distinctly uride*stood . In common with every other rational being , I ani a disbeliever in accident or chance . All events are the issue of established principles and laws . Principles and laws ( I mean those of creation ) come only from the Deity . To contend that they come from any other source , would be to assert the existence of more Creators and Supremes than one . For to establish original laws and principles , and render them operative , is as truly a creative work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allege that the Deity has ever founded a law or principle of abstract evil . I shall be understood to mean a law or principle productive of evil alone . But if he did not found it , no other being could . It does not therefore exist . All natural laws and principles , then , tend to good ; nor is it possible that they can produce both good and evil . That would imply a contradiction . In direct opposition to every known l ) rinciple and fact , it would show that the same cause can produce not only different but opposite effects ; positive good and positive evil being the reverse of each other . But this is an absurdity , which no person of intelligence will venture to advocate . Thus , then , the matter seems to stand . Good necessarily arises out of what we misname evil . In other words-in obedience to existing laws , which the Deity himself established , every event tends to the production of ultimate benefit ; nor is any special interference of Heaven necessary to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the order of the universe , as it is for the earth to revolve on its axis , or a ponderous body to gravitate toward its centre . What we call evil then produces good . But this could not be the case , were good and evil the opposites of each other . Opposites can not stand related as cause and effect . Light can not produce darkness , nor cold heat . This is no paradox . It is a plain statement , sanctioned by every principle of causation , as well as by common sense . Let the subject be analyzed and contemplated in another point of light . Every event , whether physical or moral , must occur by chance , or in conformity to a law established by the Deity , or by some other law-giver  --  a malign one if the event be positively evil . But chance , as a productive cause , is denied by every one , and is in itself an absurdity . Nor is it compatible with just conceptions of the creator , to believe that he permitted any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right of imposing laws on his own creation . Such permission would be a resignation of his supremacy to a spirit // of evil . But no view so derogatory to the Deity can be for a moment entertained . The inference is palpable . No event can possibly occur but in strict conformity to his own laws . But it is requisite that I endeavor to prove my positions by a few examples . Every attribute of human nature is strengthened and brought to perfection only by exercise . Let any one of our powers , whether corporeal or mental , be consigned to a state of entire inaction , and it will be debilitated and rendered useless , if not entirely extinguished . To this not a single exception exists ; nor can one exist , because the result is in obedience to a law of our constitution . Is a muscle rendered inactive ? It becomes in time powerless . Our senses of vision and hearing ? The same is true of them : they lose their strength and accuracy , and become at length extinct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also degenerate , and become unfit for their functions . Nor does this law apply less certainly or less forcibly to our moral faculties than to those of our intellects , or to our muscular powers . They likewise grow weak by inactioi*i , and strong by exercise . This , I repeat , is as true of benevolence , veneration , conscientiousness , and firmness , as it is of the muscles of the blacksmith 's arm , or of the opera.dancer 's leg . The philanthropist becomes more enthusiastic in philanthropy , by pursuing it , and the judge more inflexible in his love of justice , by daily practice in his high vocation . Nor will any one doubt that a sentiment of piety is greatly strengthened , by daily acts of solemn worship , united to a habitual contemplation of the perfections of the Deity , as displayed in creation . But our moral powers can not be exercised , except on suitable objects . What are those objects ? I answer , Our vices , our propensities to vice , or our misfortunes . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified . The reason is plain . No other exists . The sole end of our moral faculties is to check vice or vicious propensities ; or to counteract , in some way , what we denominate evil . To particularize Were it not for misfortune or want , of some sort , on what would our benevolence be fully exercised ? Palpably on nothing-because no one would need it . The faculty would therefore languish and fade , under the influence of inaction . Indeed , without something to exercise it on , it would be a superfluous attribute-an endowment without an end to render it tiseful . Extinguish misfortune and want , then , and you sap the foundation of one of our brightest virtues ; you lop from human nature the beauty and ainiableness of the virtue of benevolence . Could the feeling even exist under an entire deprivation of objects to act on , it would become a painful want , like hunger without food to satisfy it , or thirst without water to allay it . To be endowed with it in such a case would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is itself an evil . Again . Were there no propensity in man to do wrong , what would become of the faculty of conscientiousness , or a sense of justice ? on what would it be exercised , that it might gain strength and do good ? The answer is plain . It could not be exercised at all , for want of a suitable object . Its only end is , to prevent or punish wrong.doing , or repair mischief , or to dispense due rewards to those who have done so . Even its name , as well as every action too , has an exclusive relation to something that is or may be wrong . The very existence of a sense and active principle of justice supposes the existence of a contrary principle , which it is intended to counteract . Without something thus opposed to it , to give it action , it would be an unmeaning and supernumerary endowment ; as much so as an eye would be without light , or an ear without sound . Suppose a race of beings perfectly innocent called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their attributes ? Or , would they understand the meaning and object of it , admitting them to have it ? Unquestionably they would not . It would be to them a feeling undefined and inoperative , and therefore useless . Stronger still-it would be an incumbrance to them . It would resemble a sixth external sense , without any quality of matter for it to act on . Of firmness or fortitude , the same may be said . Misfortune alone can give it exercise . Remove all kinds of affliction and trial , arising from what we call evil , and its sphere of action will be effaced . It will be an attribute as superfluous and useless , as the sense of smell would be in a world without odors . The school of misfortune is the only place where it can be exercised , improved , and rendered useful . It is arid can be manifested only under suffering , difficulty , or l ) rivation of some kind . Bodily pain , the loss of friends or fortune , the disgrace or calamity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape , can alone draw it forth . At least , it can never be powerfully called forth in any other way . Ham- // 29 anony and fitness required , then , either that it should not he conferred on man , or that it should have something on which to act . To cautiousness or prudence the same remarks are applicable . It presupposes the existence of difficulty and danger . Without these , it would he hut a name ; at least , it would he an unmeaning faculty . Did no evil , so called , prevail , why should we he cautious and prudent ? No necessity to " take care " would exist . Hence the instinct prompting to it would be given to us in vain . The sentiment of hope speaks a similar language . It is suited only to a state of trial . Its end and use are to sustain and encourage us under difficulty and suffering , or some sort of privation ; and these result much more frequently from moral than from physical causes . Were we steeped only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a world of unalloyed happiness , we should not want it ; hut in one like that where our lot is cast , in which the cup of life is mixed , we could not do without it . It would be given to us , then , without either ohject or meaning , did not evil make an essential ingredient in the dispensation under which we live . Of a sentlinent of piety , the same is true . That calamity heightens it , is known to every one ohservant of the course of human events . Hence uninterrupted prosperity is universally declared to he unfriendly to religion , by rendering man unmindful of his dependence on Heaven . Even profligates , moreover , have been often reclaimed hy sickness and other distressing occurrences . I once witnessed , during a tempest at sea , when it was confidently believed that the vessel would be lost , ample proof of the position I am maintaining . Many were earnestly engaged in prayer , who never bent a knee in times of safety . To be sure , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , difficulty and danger strengthen moral feelings generally ; and , among the rest , that of piety . Thus might I analyze tbe whole moral character of man , and show that every element of it has a positive and necessary relation to vice , misfortune , or some form of suffering . His moral powers are intended to put the requisite restraint on his animal , and from the exercise and practice alone of doing so do they derive strength and habits of vigorous action . To speak more definitely ; it seems plain ; from the preceding remarks , that our practical virtues depend on our vices for their very existence . Extinguish the latter , and the former will dwindle and perish for want of food . A viceless world would be a virtueless one ; and what we call " perfect innocence " would be wedded to weakness . Man 's entire nature clearly proves that he was not formed for a world of innocence . A faculty of resentment is as essentially a part of his constitution as that of vision or hearing . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of it ? There would be nothing on which to exercise it-nothing to resent ; and hence the faculty would be superfluous . The faculty of hearing , bestowed on the inhabitants of a world destitute of vibratino* hod ies , would not be more so . Let what is called evil , then , be extinguished , and the present harmonious condition of things will be rendered incongruous . In further confirmation of this truth , let us examine the most distinguished acts of virtue that man has exhibited , and we shall find that they arose out of an oppo*ition to vice . Let us again inquire into the lives of individuals the most illustrious for habits and deeds of virtue , and we shall be convinced that it was a struggle with vice which rendered them so . Indeed , the very term , virtue , implies a struggle . It is the performance of duty , in defiance of difficulty , danger , and death . Had there been no Tarquin , there would have been no Lucretia ; no vice or misfortune in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cato ; no tyrant of Switzerland , no I'ell ; no oppressors in England , no Alfred ; no lawless attempt to enslave America , no Washington or Bohivar . This catalogue might be extended indefinitely , and would still terminate in the same truth , that vice alone gives existence and immortality to virtue . Of patriotism , high heroism , distinguished firmness and fortitude , splendid benevolence , and all that gives lustre and value to human morals , this is true . Nor is it less obviously so , that evil is also the cause of all great intellectual strength and its products ; in simpler terms , that it is the parent of knowledge . It awakens the faculties of the Otellect to action , and urges them to examine nature , in quest of means to prevent or remedy itself . But for disease and death , where would be the knowledge of the physician , his acquaintance with the structure and functions of the human body , their relation to deleterious and salutary agents , and with the properties and character of every thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world would be in darkness . Without strong // Thoughts on Optimism . inducements , man would not submit to the immense labor he sustains in cultivatin* so extensive a field of science ; and did universal health prevail , the inducement would be withheld . Had injustice never had being , in the various shaped that moral wrong has assumed , where would have been the displays of wisdom and eloquence , and every other form of intellectual excellence , which the world has witnessed in politics and law ? The disasters of nations arisin , , from crime have contributed much to the richness and splendor of history ; and wars , resulting from a similar cause , have been a prolific source of human glory . Look into the history of every branch of philosophy , and you can trace both its origin and progress to some sort of misfortune or want . This is equally true of astronomy , meteorology , mechanics , chemistry , mineralogy , geology , and every thing entitled to the name of science . That which we denominate evil is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of all the most resplendent efforts of genius , in the form of poetry , the same may be affirmed . Without perhaps a single exception , they owe their origin to what is called moral evil . Such is the source of that splendid production , the song of Moses , and of all the finest effusions of the poetic muse in the book of Job , the Psalms of David , the writings of Isaiah , and every other portion of the Old Testament . When he coumposed the Iliad , Homer sang the wrath of Achilles , and its terrible consequences . The destruction of Tiny , and the effects resulting from it , many of them highly immoral and blameworthy , constitute the foundation of the Eneid , and give it much of its grandeur . Dante immortalized himself by denouncing the vices of his times , in strains as intense as the infernal fires to which he doomed them . Tasso sang of evil and crime , in his Jerusalem Delivered . Shakspeare did the same , when he gave us the highest wonders of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar cause , even Milton would have continued " mute " and " inglorious . " He.would not have represented , in thoughts so worthy of them , either the glories of the Celestial or the horrors of the Tartarean regions . Nor would he , after describing " such wars " as the " imumortals wage , " have restored to his race a " Paradise " of fiction more fascinating than the real one whose " loss " he com , amemorated . Pope 's finest effusions were elicited by vice and imperfection ; and Byron would seem to have invoked the spirit of wickedness as his Muse . His Manfred , one of the most stupendous productions of human genius , testifies to this . In fine , without evil and necessity to stir them to action , the human race would be drones and ignoramuses . The constant warfare , which exists between vice and virtue , want and intellect , elevates their moral character , and gives them knowledge . So true is the declaration of the poet , that " All tbiugs subsist by elemental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did time permit , it would be easy to demonstrate , that the propensities of man , which , when indulged to excess and under false impressions , lead to vice , are , when duly regulated , as essential to practical virtue , as any other attributes of his nature . Finally , and to speak with reverence . Were there not something , on which to exercise it-something I mean to be forgiven-where would be the nmeaning or the use of the most delightful and lovely , and what is usually deemed the usost glorious attribute of the Deity-his MERCY ? Clearly there would be neither usefulness nor significancy attached to it . It would be a dormant possession , unemployed and fruitless in creation , and , therefore as far as we can judge , unsuitable to the character of the PossEssoR , not to say unworthy of him . Universal and perfect aptitude requires an appropriate object for the exercise of each of the divine perfections . In relation to the attribute of mercy , therefore , in common with all the others , things are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally intended to be , and as they were accordingly settled at the beginning , under the governance of positive laws . Such , in brief , are my views of Optimism . Is any one inclined to ask me , What will become of virtue , on the arrival of the millenium , when crime shall have ceased , and universal innocence begun its reign ? I reply , that that period is far distant , and many unforeseen and great changes must take place in the condition of our race before its arrival . It is to be so radically different from any thing we have seen , that we cammuot brirmg it fully within the action of judgement , nor draw any rational inferences respecting it . But , at whatever period of timne it may occur , we have reason to believe that man will still be man-greatly improved in his character , but not revolutionized . He will still possess animal , intellectual , and moral powers ; and the inferior , as at present , must be governed by the supe // 31 nor . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as now , although not perhaps so intense . The animal faculties of the many will not then have to he governed , as at present , by the moral ones of the few . Human nature will be so improved , that each member uf it , when mature , will be competent to govern himself . But with children and youth the case will be different . During their immaturity their animal propensities will necessarily preponderate and tend to lead them into excessive and irregular indulgences . They will therefore require moral training and restraint , to retain them within the paths of virtue . Thus will the moral faculties of the whole community find employment . But the ruillenial condition of man will occur only as the result of natural causes . Miracle or direct heavenly agency will have no share in its production , any more than in that of other improvements . In plain terms , it will be the product of education made perfect ; completely adapted to the human constitution , and ably administered . As nothing , therefore , but natural exercise will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal powers , nothing but a certain amount of the same exercise habitually performed , will enable them to retain it . Because they have gained the victory , they must not slumber , or become inactive , else the animal propensities , which are and must be always on the alert , will resume the supremacy . Hence practical virtue will of necessity continue . The aggregate of mural feeling will be much greater than it is now ; because , as already stated , each adult will possess enough of it for his own government . I shall only add , on this subject , that the chief difference between the condition of human nature , under the mnilleniumo and at the present time , will be , that men are governed now by laws enacted and sanctioned by the authority of states ; but then , such will be the degree of intellectual and moral improvement , that every man will be a law to himself . His own cultivated nature will serve him as a rule of correct action . Exempt from all human authority , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God alone . These are my views respecting a millenium , should it ever occur ; an event " devoutly to be wished , " to which hope looks forward with fond desire , and the anticipation of which sober reason does not reject . Will any one assert that the tenor of the doctrine I advocate is to encoura , , e vice in opposition to the precepts of morality and religion ? The charge is unfounded . The doctrine does not encourage vice . Every tenet of it proves that it does not . It only denies the propriety of making such changes in the constitution of human nature as would unfit it for its present sphere , or indeed for any sphere , and render it useless . I repeat , that the propensities of man , which , when improperly imidulged , lead to vice , are , under suitable discipline , as essential to his usefulness , as his moral feelings , or the faculties of his intellect . Without them , he would be as inert and inoperative as a vegetable . The doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . It contends that they make primitive and necessary elements of the human constitution . Instead of being extinguished , therefore , as positive evils , it recommends that they be cultivated as indispensable springs of action , and placed under the control of the moral and reflecting faculties . It further maintains , that this is the correct order of things ; that the lower faculties should submit to the higher ; and that the discipline here recommended tends directly to the l ) romotion of virtue ; that , in fact , practical virtue consists in the proper regulation of the propensities , under temptation amid difficulty , directing them to their true uses , and rendering them subservient to itself ; and virt'eous feeling is a disposition to do so . Hence the doctrine is friendly to education , well devised and skillfully administered , as the only mode of-improving our race It contends , moreover , that , by time wisdom and beneficence of the dispensation under which he lives , man has the control of all the means requisite for his earthly perfection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of Optimism ? I answer , that they are numerous and great . It is the only doctrine that does justice and due homage to the SUPREME Bvmse , by ascribing to him perfection in all things-in his glorious works , no less than in his nature . It truly and effectually " indicates the ways of God to man ' - which no other sclseme of philosophy does . It alone recognizes , in a sense worthy of the subject , the mnighty truth , that not a sparrow , nor even less than a sparrow , can fall to the ground without his permission , through the Ian 's he has established . And that fall , small as it is , it regards as an event essentially connected with the scheme of his universe , and contributing its part to the consummation he meditates , no less directly than the revolution of a world . Impressions like these produce a moral effect above all price , and not easily conceived of by those who have not felt them . They give to the optimist serene content with // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . They soothe him with a conviction that he Jives under a system of wise , beneficent , and immutable Jaws ; a parental government , whose constitution consists in the perfections of the MosT hen , and whose statutes and their execution are conformable to that SUPREME LAW . Hence his confident belief ; and the delight his benevolence derives from the prospect , that all things are co-operatic , , to the same end , the production of ultimate and universal happiness . Finally . Will it be objected to the views maintained in this discourse , that they virtually deny the existence of a Special Providence ? I reply , that they are intended to do so . Where a General Providence exists , under the governance of perfect laws , a special one is not only unnecessary , but inadmissible . The belief in a special providence presupposes imperfection in the laws and economy of creation . It is tantamount to an assertion that there are such numerous and radical defects , in the machine of the universe , that it is perpetually going wrong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great work it was designed to accomplish . In consequence of this , the SUPREME MECHANIST is compelled to be as perpetually interfering , by his immediate agency , to remedy some deficiency in the machinery devised and constructed by himself . For a Special Providence is nothing else than a direct interposition by the Deity , to do some act to which the laws of nature are incompetent , in plain terms , it is the performance of a miracle . Such is the fair amount of the matter , let its advocates dis*uise it in words , as they may . We certainly can view it in no other light . This view of the economy of creation is not mine . Nor do I deem it respectful to the AUTHOR of creation . My creed is , that every event , small as well as great , falls out in obedience to general laws , which are , in all respects , as perfect , as the Deity can make them . When the universe was called into existence , those laws were framed and imposed on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Free from all defect , like their FRAMER , they require no immediate and rectifying interposition from HiM , to aid them in the performance of every good and necessary work . Those , who proudly claim to be orthodox , contend , that the Deity overrules every event to a good end , by his special influence ; I , that his primitive and general ordination of things brings it to that end , without his special influence . Such is the only difference between us . But it is great . My views appear to myself philosophical and broad ; those of my opponents mechanical and narrow . Let the controversy be submitted to the arbitrement of the enlightened and liberal , and I fear not the award . My conceptions of creation and its movements are honorable to its AUTHOR ; those of the orthodox the reverse . Such at least is my rooted belief . A God of entire perfection is the only one we can acknowled e and do homage to . To be perfect , he must produce perfect results . He roust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not one so defective , that he must be hourly engaged in supplying its failures , or rectifying its faults . To the God of the universe , we dare not impute such deep imperfection , as the belief in a Special Prov -- idence implies .

What emotions of sublimity did I feel when I reached the juncture , where the dark Neponset , the mother of frogs and mud-turtles , rolls her copious streams to join the billows of Boston harbor ! What sensations of alarm entered my breast as we doubled that long cape called Farm-bar , renowned for periwinkles and clams !

But when we came to sail through the narrows of Squam rock , and finally pass the Moon ; my imagination became dizzy , and I felt like a man in a balloon , who has bid farewell to sublunary scenes , and scarcely expects again to tread the terrestrial ball . Bounding billows ! how did you roll in majesty to my youthful eye ! Mighty scenes ! how did you impress my childish fancy with the first ideas of vastitude and magnificence ! Alas ! our conceptions are all relative . Every thing depends on the state of the mind .

A man in the Moon , may see Castle Island , the city of Boston , the ships in the harbor , the silver *vaters of our little Archipelago , all lying as it were at his feet . There you may be at once social and solitary ; social , because you see the busy world before you , and solitary , because there is not a single creature on the island , except a few feeding cows , to disturb your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveying the scene with my usual emotions , when my attention was attracted by the whirring wings of a little sparrow , whom , in walking , I had frightened from her nest . It may be necessary , perhaps , to tell some of the clerks in Washington-street , who , six months from the country , are apt to forget all the objects among which they were born and bred , that this bird always builds its nest on the ground . I have seen their nests in the middle of a corn-hill , curiously placed in the centre of the five green stalks , so that it was difficult , at hoeing time , to dress the hill without burying the nest . This sparrow had built her nest as usual on the ground , beneath a little tuft of grass , more rich and thick set than the rest of the herbage around it . I cast a careless glance at the nest , saw the soft down that lined its internal part , the four little speckled eggs which inclosed the parent 's hope . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came away without the least imagination that I should write a dissertation on the Bird 's Nest in the Moon . But our minds are strange things . That bird 's nest has haunted me ever since . I could not but inquire why Providence , who inspires all animals with an unerring instinct , had not moved the foolish creature to build her habitation in a safer place . A multitude of huge animals were feeding around it , one tread of whose cloven feet would crush both bird and progeny into ruin . I dould not but reflect on the precarious condition to which the creature had committed her most tender hopes . I was thinking how the interest of two beings , both created by the same high hand and supported by the same kind power , might cross each other , and neither of them know it , until the fatal moment when the feebler might be annihilated by the stronger power . A cow is seeking a bite of grass ; she steps aside merely to gratify that idle appetite ; she treads on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , what is a trifle to one being is destruction to another . Before I proceed any farther , I think proper to apprize the reader that I was in a right frame of mind to write a meditation on a broomstick ; and , however much wits may sneer and critics condemn , I am determined to make something of my bird 's nest . As I came away from the island , I reflected that this bird 's situation , in her humble defenceless nest , might be no unapt emblem of man in this precarious world of uncertainty and sorrow . We are impelled , by some of the tenderest instincts of our nature , to form the conjugal connection ; the eye of some matchless beauty attracts our attention , and melts our hearts ; we form the tender union , and we build our nest ; commftting to it the soft deposits of our gentlest affections . But where do we build this nest ' ? Are we any wiser than the foolish bird ? No  --  the nest is on the ground of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . We are doubled in wedlock and multiplied in children , and stand but a broader mark for the cruel // arrows of death and destruction , which are shot from every side . What are diseases , in their countless forms , accidents by flood and fire , the seductions of temptation , and even half the human species themselves , but so many huge cows feeding around our nest , and ready , every moment , to crush our dearest hopes , with the most careless indifference , beneath their brutal tread ? Sometimes , as we sit at home , we can see the calamity coming at a distance . We hear the breathing of the vast monster ; we mark its wavering path-now looking towards us in a direct line-now capriciously turning for a moment aside . We see the swing of its dreadful horns , the savage rapacity of its brutal appetite ; we behold it approaching nearer and nearer , and it passes by within a hair-breadth of our ruin , leaving us to the sad reflection that another and another are still behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy folly , but rather to *veep over thy condition and my own . Our situations are exactly alike . Thy choicest comforts come entwined with pain ; and no sooner is thy callow young developed , than thou feelest all the cares that distract a parent 's heart . How often hast thou been driven from thy nest ! How often hast thou fluttered thy wings in agony , and taken up the wail of sorrow , as if thy children were already lost . The careless step , so indifferent to another , was rapture or despair to thee . A man must be a fool not to perceive that these remarks are written by a parent ; and I am sure they are dictated by feelings , which none but a parent can understand . Well , then , let me tell the secret , and be as foolish as the best of them , since , in this hard age , none but a fool would have a feeling heart . The other evening I walked into the chamber where my children were sleeping . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown carelessly over his head , tired with play , now resting in repose ; there was little Sal with her balmy breath and her rosy cheeks , sleeping and looking like innocence itself . There was Lucy , who has just begun to prattle , and runs daily with tottering steps and lisping voice to ask her father to toss her into the air . I solemnly wish , if these remarks are read by any youthful bachelor of ' forty , who boards and means to board all his days in Tremont House , that he would read not a syllable farther . As I looked upon these sleeping innocents , I could not but regard them as so many little birds , which I must fold under my wing , and protect , if possible , in security in my nest . But when I thought of the huge cows that were feeding around them ; the ugly hoofs that might crush them into ruin ; in short , when I remembered tire Bird 's Nest in the Moon , I trembled and wept . But why weep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sparrow ? It is very possible , that the nest which I saw was not in so precarious a condition as it appeared to be . Perhaps some providential instinct led the bird to build her fragile house in the ranker grass , which the kine never bite , and , of course , on which they would not he likely to tread ; perhaps some kind impulse may guide that species so as not to tread even on a bird 's nest . At any rate , chance might lead to an escape . I have never heard , and I despair now of ascertaining the important fact , that the nest I saw was actually crushed by the foot of a cow . Perhaps the joyful mother saw her young expand their wings , and inherit their paternal air ; perhaps the progeny of those // very eggs are now singing in the groves around Boston . There is a merciful God , whose care and protection extend over all his works , who takes care of the sparrow 's children and of mine . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes to learn to pray , he must go to sea ; but , with all due submission to the author of this wise remark , I think we should rather say-Let him be married and have a family of children . It is almost impossible to be an infidel with a little progeny rising round you . If Hume could have seen a little lisping girl , come and climb his knees and address him as a father- " Papa , who made all things ? " he would have almost . involuntarily answered-God . If a man wishes to learn to pray for protection during the night , let him go , as I have done , and see his children asleep , and remember the pestilence that walks in darkness . Let him experience the feelings of an anxious father , bending over the sleeping forms of his tender children , and conscious of the thousand dangers , seen and unseen , that hover around their defenceless heads . It was over her dear little sleeping infants ,  --  if she had any ,  - -  I imagine , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer were not enjoined to the perfection it would be permitted to the weakness of our nature . We should be betrayed into it , if we thought it sin ; and pious ejaculations would escape our lips , though we were obliged to preface them with-God forgive me for praying ! " A family of children walking amidst a thousand dangers , and often escaping , is one of the most striking proofs of a particular Providence that ever met my mind . To talk about the general laws of nature , immutable and unbendible to the interposing will of the Deity Away with such metaphysical trash ; it is just fit for old bachelors to write . Until I had children , I never knew what the Scriptures meant , when they say that the very hairs of our head are all numbered . I was once standing in a public road , and saw a team of three yokes of oxen and a horse , moving very fast along the road without a driver . A little child was standing in the road directly before the wagon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle passed directly over the child , throwing it down , and apparently crushing it into jelly . Every spectator thought it dead ; its life was not worth a pin 's fee ; the anxious mother ran to rescue her offspring ; but , alas , too late ; and her piercing shrieks spoke her despair . But lo , when the little urchin was picked up , instead of being found a corpse , as was by all expected , its roguish smile seemed to say that it regarded the event as a good joke , which it would willingly see repeated . Every one of the beasts , though moving so rapidly , had contrived to shun the child ; and this event , together with the Bird 's Nest in the Moon , have convinced me that verily there is a God , and that he governs the world by a particular providence . I have often thought it was unfortunate that some of the great geniuses , who have undertaken to enlighten the world by their infidelity , were not married men . It would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their spleen , than all the long volumes of rejoinders which have been written by metaphysical theologians . For , to say nothing of the powerful smiles of a woman , when that woman is your wife , reflecting and beaming the very benevolence of a creating God ,  --  there are some things in a married life , which are enough // to overthrow the faith of the most stubborn infidel , that ever apportioned his incredulity to his ignorance . I myself was rather inclined to infidelity when I was first married . But the smiles of the honeymoon softened me , and 1 bought a Bible to lie in our parlor . When my wife first sent me after the doctor , at midnight , my faith began to waver ; and I was absolutely staggered when I heard the new-born infant cry . As I looked on the little miracle , I was ashamed , and renounced my former faith ; and every new prattler , that has risen around me , has made me a better Christian . I now actually read the Bible with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell my former companions in infidelity , when they try to flout me out of my religion , that they are welcome to our old belief  --  to all its wisdomii and all its comforts . They are old bachelors still . And no wonder that such an unnatural life should lead to such an absurd faith . Hume was an old bachelor , and every page of his philosophy smells of his folly . Hobbs was an old bachelor , and so was Voltaire , and Rousseau , and Jeremy Bentham , and Tom Paine . I have always thought it a thousand pities , that Madamoiselle Curchod did riot wind her chains more effectually around Gibbon 's heart . I imagine that Cupid , the little god of love , might have expelled a great deal of Paganism , and perhaps infidelity , from the pages of his splendid history . Sorrie , to be sure , will be infidels in the bosom of wedlock , as some would be fools in the very palaces of Solomon . But this is not the order of nature . Her virtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plato has written , in which lie describes the closing scene in the life of Socrates , Plato makes his master Socrates , in the course of the discussion , attempt to account for the existence of scepticism ; arid he traces it to the same cause as that which produces misanthropy . He thinks that men of rash judgements and irritable tempers , when they have once confided in a character , superficially virtuous , and have found themselves deceived , pass a judgement on the whole species , and spend the rest of their lives in revenging their disappointment by railing at mankind . In like manner , he supposes , that when a hasty mind has been deceived by an apparent demonstrati&amp;n and afterwards discovers that the demonstration is false , it loses its confidence in all reasoning , and views all things in the universe as floating , like the waters of the Euripus , without order and without end . Such a man is mw TS OI'TLfl ) - ri*g &amp;X , *Os ( * *spjOshj , deprived of the certainty of real existence , and imputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have generally noticed that infidelity and misanthropy have an affinity for each other , and are often combined in the ' same heart . But how is a man to avoid misanthropy ? No man ever became a misanthrope under the smiles of an affectionate wife , and surrounded by a family of ruddy children . These are tender chains , which connect us with the universe ; they hind us in harmony with our species ; they lead us to feel our need of a higher protector ,  --  to see the glory and the goodness , arid therefore to believe in the existence of God . When a man is once on a wrong track , every step he takes only leads him so much farther out of the way . God , when he built the world , designed to pack men together in families ; and it is the only // way in which you can throw the human species together , without impairing their principles and endangering their virtue .

G.@@183068755.txt EVERY wise man , before he attempts to introduce any reform , will answer for himself two questions ; First , Does the evil exist which it is proposed to cure ? and second , Does it admit of any remedy more desirable than the evil itself ? As to the first of these questions , when applied to the Militia , we apprehend no two persons will give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our own eyes and ears furnish us with , of the reality of the evil which we propose to consider , namely , the low yet sinking condition of the militia of our Union . Does any one doubt the fact ? If there be such an one , let him attend the inspections , trainings , and reviews , not merely of a few populous cities , but of the whole country . Let him read the Returns made to the Adjutant-Generals , of the several states , and , especially , if a citizen of Massachusetts , that officers Report , in this corn monwealth , enumerating amonr other things , the companies without officers and without organization . Let him learn , too , from that Report , the startling fact , that , while the population of the state has been constantly increasing , the number of enrolled militia-men has been diminished . Let him inspect the books of the volunteer companies , and compute the number of " fine members , " as they are called , that is , of those who , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . Above all , let him mingle with the mass of the people , and learn what they think and feel in regard to the present condition of the militia . He , who shall make this inquiry , or any part of it , will not , we pledge ourselves , any longer doubt . But , in truth , the existence of the evil is not doubted ; it is on all hands acknowledged . The public prints have , at various periods , teemed with complaints upon the subject . Even the voice of the pulpit was , on one occasion , at least , heard . All have not agreed in their remedies , but none have denied the necessity of a ref&amp;rm of some kind . Neither have men of influence shown any disposition not to listen to these complaints . The same opinions have been repeatedly expressed in our legislative halls . In compliance with the public sentiment , which seemed imperatively to call for some change , the legislatures of various states have , at different times , made many essential alterations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts we shall not undertake to examine , except such as may be supposed to have had an extensive and general bearing upon the character and condition of the militia ; arid then but incidentally . Of all these remedies , which the legislatures , in their wisdom , have provided for existing evils in our Militia System , we shall , for the present , only say , we doubt whether they are likely soon to make it in in reality , what it is often asserted to be , " the right arm of public defence . " Without considering directly the fitness either of the original provisions or of subsequent changes to the accomplishment of those great objects , which we rrmust presume they were designed to effect , we have something to say as to the causes , which have produced the present lamentable state of things . These causes may be classed under two heads , natural and artificial ; meaning , by the former , all those natural // events , which legislation has not occasioned , and could not have prevented , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and amendments of laws , which , at various times , and for various purposes , the difl*rent legislatures have seen fit to enact . First , then , under the head of natural causes , we say a great change has taken place in our social condition ,  --  we refer particularly to the Atlantic states ,  --  and that this has been an efficient means of depressing the militia . When our country was first settled , immediate necessity of self-defence made every man a soldier . The untamed and the untamable Indian , and the wild beast of the forest , were his neighbors , and his gun the only mode of intercourse , as well as the only means of defence . The farmer , who was unskilled in its use , could hope to save neither his dwelling nor his corn-field . No law was then needed to compel men to keep themselves armed and equipped ; for nature 's Iirst law , the love of life , had already done that . Necessity , therefore , required every man to keep arms and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; and afterwards , when time and in* creased population had freed them from Indians and wild beasts , the game , with which the woods and marshes abounded , kept up the practice of using them . Gunning became the favorite amusement of all classes . In. early times , it was frequently even a matter of profit . When game was plentiful a good hunter would make handsome wages from the sale of his skins . The passion for owning and using firearms became , in this way , a sort of national characteristic ; and this circumstance had no small influence upon the militia . Men were not then , as now , *obliged to be at the expense of buying and keeping in order a gun and equipments merely for the purpose of using them two or three *times a year on a militia training-field . These were an indis ' . pensable part of a man 's furniture , whether he trained or not . They were not either , as in some more modern instances , any refuse or worn-out things , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were selected with attention , and kept with care . No rust ate into their barrels , no spots stained their stocks . Their owner would have been both mortified and grieved at any neglect of them . But now our condition is wholly different . The Indians , where any remain , are wretched outcasts , and , so far from being able to molest others , are glad to receive , in all humility , any pittance which the charity or pity of the white man may deign to bestow . The wolf and the bear , which once harassed our men and terrified our women and children , are now never seen but in the cages of itinerant show-men . The game , that once filled our valleys and marshes , and repaid the hunter 's toil with substantial profit ,  --  although that toil , the manliest of all amusements , is , like virtue , its own reward ,  --  that game has degenerated into here and there a stray fox or deer , a few sea-fowl and such birds , like the robin and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first tries his erring aim almost disdains them . In consequence , the practice of gunning is fast ceasing ; few good marksmen are to be found ; few new guns are pu.rchased , especially by the yeomanry ; and , in a few years , according to present appearances , the skillful use of the gun and the rifle will be extinct . It is easy to see the influence of all this upon the militia . We shall not attempt to make it clearer by illustra // tion . What makes it a matter of more serious regret is , that no laws can afford any relief . It is the inevitable result of natural causes . Another cause of the same sort is to be found in the present and recent peaceful state of this and other civilized nations . Peace has its blessings , rich and great , but yet one of its effects is to unfit men for war ; and , moreover , to render unfashionable and unpopular all warlike exercises and all military preparations . Such has been its effect in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rich with the usual comforts of such a state . It has afforded us other pursuits , which have absorbed all our spirit , and left no room for military excitement . The passion for military exercises has , in consequence , wholly forsaken us . Nobody sighs now for the " tented field ; " and , consequently , none are much interested in any imitations of it . A war for a few years would infuse more military spirit into this nation , and , consequently , do more to raise up the militia than all the enactments that ever darkened the statute-book . This particular incident of a state of peace , as it tends to injure a most valuable public institution , is to be regretted ; yet we would not be understood to regret the existence of peace . We are not quite so deeply in love with a favorite system as that . We speak only of a single evil flowing from what is , in other respects , and on the whole , a great good . We have spoken of the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of peaceful pursuits : to these we may add the growth of many poptilous and wealthy cities , as one of the natural causes that have an unfavorable bearing upon the militia . It is a common and true remark , that the common regular portion of the militia is inferior , in discipline and appearance , in the city , to the same portion in the country . While this effect may be in some degree owing to the greater number and superior character of the volunteer companies in the cities , still , it is mainly to be attributed to other causes , among which the peculiar habits and occupations of inhabitants of cities are deserving of particular notice . All that we have said of the change of our habits , through the advancement of cultivation and the diminution of game , applies with tenfold force to cities . Trhere the citizen frequently has never used a gun . He knows nothing about it ,  --  he cares nothing about it . His exploits have nothing to do with sharp-shooting . The sight and touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , too , a training or muster serves partly for a holiday . The very fact of its bringing together so many , whose comparatively distant residences make them unfrequent visiters or companions , prevents a military meeting from being an absolute and wholly unrelieved burden . But in cities , compactness of situation and similarity of employments give easy and ready intercourse with one another , to all who desire it ; and no apology , in the shape of military duty , is needed to excuse the spending of time . Again . That part of the population of cities , who are most likely to become members of the standing companies of militia , contain a much larger proportion of boisterous , unruly persons , whom neither fear nor decency can much restrain . These deter others from connecting themselves with the same companies , disgust the officers , prevent suitable men from taking offices , and , in fine , degrade and disgrace the whole corps. // The value of time , too , is greater in cities than in the country , and many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay their fines , rather than to do duty . But we shall touch upon This point hereafter under another head . Suffice it for the present , that through this and other causes of the same tendency , the militia loses the respectability and tone , which the presence of men of standing and pride would give it . Shame is of all things most ruinous to military spirit and excellence . In peace , the rewards of this excellence must be found chiefly in show and appearance ; but in cities , and with the standing companies , the show is all afailure ,  --  the appearances all disgraceful . Nobody 's pride , we venture to say , is gratified . We proceed now to say something of those causes of the decline of the militia , which , for the sake of distinction , we have called artificial . Our meaning by this term is , that these causes have originated in the laws and practices of some one or more of the states , and not in the condition of the people . There are I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the variety in the laws prevalent in the different states . It would be altogether improper and unprofitable , in a publication designed for general readers , and those too of all sections , to go into the details and distinctions of each state-law ; and , on the other hand , equally unprofitable to give nothing hut barren generalities . We shall endeavor , as well as we can , to steer clear alike of ScylIa and Charybd is ; not professing , of course , to enumerate all such causes , but chiefly those , which have come under our own observation or within our hearing . There are two general plans or systems , after which most of the systems of the several states , in their most important particulars , seem to have been framed . These will furnish us with a foundation for those remaining observations , which we wish to submit upon this subject . One of them provides merely for the organization and equipment of the militia ; the other adds to these requirements some degree of discipline . According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and present their arms for inspection ; according to the second , they commonly meet three or four times in the year , and are drilled and trained , as well as inspected , by their officers . We shall first consider that system , which provides only for the organization and equipment of the militia . As is well known , Congress have only made a law upon this subject of the most general character ; providing only for the enrollment of all within certain ages , excepting the principal civil officers of the federal government , and such other exemptions as the states shall make . The several states have , therefore , made such additional laws as they thought proper . In many of them , the legislatures , willing to relieve their people from what was esteemed a burden , however necessary it might be , have in fact allowed all discipline to be dispensed with . A more important step could not have been taken , so far as the interests of the militia are concerned . We in fact consider the militia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as almost a nullity . What , indeed , is the real worth of that which has been retained ? The men are , it is true , divided into companies , regiments , and brigades . Regular lists of the usual officers for each of these divisions are either elected or appointed , and the soldiers , or rather privates , ( for they can not be called soldiers , ) have arms // either of their own , or borrowed property , which they annually exhibit for inspection and a pretended approbation ; and this is all . It may be a little better than nothing ; for , through these officers , a channel of communication is kept open between the government of the state and its militia . If a company or regiment were ordered out in full , there would be somebody already appointed to the corn mand , and this would be worth something , as it would prevent bickerings and rivalry . But here we stop these officers would know nothing of their duty ; would never have manmuvred a company , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; would have never executed the evolutions ordered by their superior officers , and could not then do it , nor would have ever learned the meaning of those technical terms , in which military orders are express* ed . And ig at some school or encampment for officers , they had been taught these things theoretically , they would be ill able to apply them to practice on a battle-field . Substantially the same would be the case of the soldiers . They would have guns in their hands , and would know the names of their officers ; and that would he all . They would not know the meaning of those terms in which officers give directions , and , from utter inexperience , could not make a single movement in a body without confusion . We say , then , that under such a system , the militia is almost a nullity . Neither are its ill effects confined to those states which have adopted such a system . They spread into others , filling the people with discontent , and stirring up a thousand murmurs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , these legislatures are obliged , by the force of popular feeling , to relax , in whole or in part , the rigor and efficiency of their own systems , although against their better judgemnent . So at last many suffer for the folly of a few . We shall not enlarge upon this topic , as our purpose is not to prove or portray the present degradation of the militia , hut to elucidate the causes which have produced it . We regard it , however , as a practical abandonment of the great principles on which all militias are and should he founded ; but it would be of little avail to ring the changes upon the evils , present and future , which are likely to follow from it . If . people can not see what is palpable to all , but blind or heedless observers , they must wait till the great teacher , E perience , sharpens their vision . But many of the states have followed , in the formation of their laws , the other general plan to which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct , as well as organize and equip , the militia . In them , as might have been expected , the militia is not quite so low and wretched as in the others , and yet far from being what it ought to be . The principal idea of their plan was correct , and , therefore if they have failed to accomplish what was desired , it must be attributed to the filling up , as it were , of the system , to defects in the mode of reducing the leading idea to practice . To some of the most important of these we invite the attention of the reader ; of course , they will not be found of universal application , but affecting , some one section or state , and some another . One of the most efficient of them has been the system of exemptions , the number of which has been very great . We have already remarked , that the general law of Congress , exempts the chief officers of the general government from service in the militia , and gives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as it shall see fit . Accordingly , in most of the states , the officers of the several departments of the state governments , together with those whose occupations and pursuits were thought to give them peculiar claims to indulgence , have been , for the most part , exempted ; and in many , where several days ' service is annually required , the elder part of those within the prescribed age , have been likewise exempted on the condition of paying a small commutation. these last are a very numerous body . The period of service , according to the general law of Congress , is from the age of eighteen to forty-five ; and , in those states where this practice obtains , it is usual to exempt all above the age of thirty or thirty-five . It would not be easy to ascertain the exact number of those thus exempted , on account of age , office , or occupation ; but , we may safely say , they form at least about one half of the whole enrollment . Some of the evils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out . They have been most injuriously felt in the country . The population there is comparatively thinly-scattered , and the companies must , therefore , be either small in number , or else include so large an extent of territory as to make it burdensome for the soldier to travel to the training-field . The exemption of one half , at least , and at one blow , as it were , has been , in this respect , a great evil . A single company contains so few members , that all spirit and military pride is extinguished ; both officers and men are alike ashamed to appear in public . All those motives which operate most strongly in the mind of the soldier are destroyed . A soldier , that hangs his head , will never be seen on a parade-field when he can help it ; and he , who does not expect to make part of a public exhibition , will seldom take much pains to be well drilled . The influence of these things has been extensively felt in the country . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , in many more , impossible to induce them to accept . The reason of it is plain . To hold a militia office is no longer an honor but rather a disgrace . At any rate the officer , whatever may be his qualifications , never escapes ridicule . If his own deportment be unassailable , that of his soldiers is always open to attack . Accordingly , the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts , in his last Report , informs us that a large number of companies in the country are entirely destitute of officers . There are other evils that attend this system of numerous exemptions . It will be perceived , from what we have said , that , among those exempted , a considerable proportion belong to the more refined classes of society , as they are sometimes called ; the members of the learned professions seem to be peculiarly favored , in this respect , with the exception , perhaps , of lawyers . This circumstance has , in our opinion , caused no little injury to the militia system . It has , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented whatever they might have done , toward maintaining the respectability or raising the character of the militia body . Nor is this all . It has occasioned more soreness of feeling , perhaps , than every thing else connected with the system . People saw , or rather thought they saw , which is much the same thing , an attempt to impose the burdens of defence upon the poorer and less genteel classes of the community . It was , no doubt , a mistaken idea ; but as it was honestly entertained , its effects were // nearly as bad as if it had been correct . It is this notion which has gained attention for the multiplied attacks which have of late been made upon the whole system , as well as given virulence and personal feeling to those attacks themselves . There is no necessity for giving any color to such a notion . If there are any officers , who could not , with convenience or propriety , appear in the ranks , let them pay an equivalent . This would make all right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great number of exempts , we are anxious to press UI ) Ofl the attention of the reader ; for we think it one of great importance , and yet one which is little considered . There is nothing which excites more dissatisfaction , in the mind of the militia-man , than to see , at every muster or training , a concourse of spectators many times outnumbering the whole body of soldiers . He can not bring himself to believe that all is right and equal , where so many are free from burdens whic.h he has to bear , and which he is taught to consider a universal duty . We do not mean to assert that there is any thing wrong , , or , at least , , any thing of much importance ; we only wish to have it understood that every appearance of unfairness should be avoided . Some , we know , are in the habit of representing militia service as a privilege or boon instead of a burden . We do not agree with them at all . In some foreign countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of defence , we dare say those subjects would esteem it a privilege of great value to be allowed to keep arms .. But the situation of our people is very different ; and , consequently , all reasoning drawn from the opinions and feelings of the people of such foreign countries must be fallacious and deceptive . Besides , to go through the formal , tedious drillings oi a militia training , and to keep fire-arms and use them at one 's pleasure are very different things . Neither will the vanity of exhibiting one 's self upon a parade-field , nor the love of military exercises , ever transform militia service into a pleasure , except , with a small portion of the people , and these are the proper members of volunteer companies , and none others . It may lighten , but will never change the nature of the burden . Those who think to tickle the fancies of our working-men , by holding up such an idea , have much mistaken their character . No doubt , you may occasionally find a silly , inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , or the epaulet that glitters on his shoulder , than of good sense and honesty , who may be caught by such a bait . But the great majority always will and must regard service in the militia as a burden , but yet one which they are willing to bear , in common with other citizens , whenever and wherever patriotism may require . Let , then , , no apparent distinctions be made which might wound an honorable self*respect . They will not be ' quietly borne . Another cause , which has had an extensive influence upon the character and standing of the militia , especially in the cities , is , the system of " fine membership . " The laws of most states have made provision for volunteer companies ; those who are members of them are free from duty in the standing or common militia companies . But it is not required that these members should do active duty . They join the volunteer companies with the understanding that they are to pay the fines imposed by law for absence from standing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of " fine members . " It has been asserted , though we do not vouch for the truth of the assertion , that , in some cases , captains have compounded with these members for a sum much less than the regular fines . If it ever has been done , it was a gross violation of duty . These flue members are very numerous . Some have been induced to become such , perhaps , by the hope of having part of their fines remitted ; but most by fashion and pride . The volunteer companies are composed , for the most part , of the more wealthy or the more fashionable classes ; and this , of course , draws to them all those , who , holding a more equivocal position in society , are extremely anxious to be considered of the first rank . This ef1*ct has been constantly increasing , for a number of years , till at last there is scarcely a single private in any standing company of the great cities , who is not , by occupation , a manual laborer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not of the same class . In the cities , and in large business towns , where one of the chief objects of ambition is to be admitted and received in what is called good society , this has an immense influence . The consequence is , that the number of men of standing and substance in the common companies , is very small ; of educated men , absolutely none at all . These companies are often badly ojjlcered , and always badly disciplined . Few have sufficient leisure , military taste , and spare money , to induce or permit them to become active members of the volunteer companies ; the great mass of middling and wealthy people , therefore , become " fine members , " and between the law on the one hand , arid their own pride on the other , are taxed twelve dollars a year , ( or whatever may be the amount of the penalty ) in the shape of fines , nominally , for the support of the militia , but really , for the support of the volunteers . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their heads and hands for a fortune , ( and these are a majority , ) are ill able to pay . But this is the source from whence the revenues of the volunteers flow , and by means of which they are enabled to maintain their great ostentation and parade , and to pay their enormous expenses for music , and sometimes for entertainments . But the effect of this upon the militia in general is most pernicious . The standing companies are without discipline , and without character ; nearly half of the citizens of the proper age and qualifications do no duty at all ; while the volunteers , who have but few active members , are alone well disciplined . Nor is this all ; a sentiment unfavorable to the militia spreads from the city to the country , and makes the institution itself universally unfashionable and unpopular . Its influence is felt at the present moment , and it is by no means unlikely , that , in the course of a few years , the volunteer companies will themselves be its victims . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the militia , is , the difficulty of collecting the fines , which the laws impose for the violation of its requirements . No one , not conversant by actual experience , can adequately feel the weight of this difficulty . A breach of the militia statutes is regarded , in law , somewhat in the light of a criminal offence , and the practice of the courts ( we refer particularly to Massachusetts in this and subsequent remarks , but suppose the case to be the same in others ) requires the prosecution to be conducted with nearly the strictness of an indictment . The process of enrollment must be performed with as much exactness and even as much atten // tion to forms , as if the rolls were deeds that involved the fate of great estates . Little , trifling inaccuracies or variations xviii frequently annul the whole proceeding . Every man must be enrolled on the company lists , and furnished with a warrant ordering him to appear at the appointed time and place of meeting . Consequently the place of abode , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowded city , this may well be thought a work of no little labor and difficulty . How liable , for example , must every clerk be to make mistakes as to the Christian names ! Yet the courts have decided that a warrant , which omits or mistakes the middle name or initial , shall be inoperative , although there be , in fact , no uncertainty as to the person meant . Again , somebody must be produced who can swear that the individual on trial was absent or otherxvise delinquent , as the case may be . This may not always be easy . Besides , the law makes it the duty of the captain to prosecute every offender ; and yet , if , through any of these many liabilities to mistake , he fail to make out his case according to the technicalities of the law , he must pay his own costs of suit . This is a burden which deters all captains from prosecuti.ng to judgement all offenders , unless they are quite certain they can satisfy all the nice , and sometimnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of this upon the militia are very evident . In the first place , a great number escape from paying any fines at all . As I have observed , if the captain does not feel certain that he can prove toe liability of the delinquent , he does not attempt to do it . In this way , many others are encouraged to hope for the same impunity . If their friends and acquaintances escape , why may not they ? They are emboldened to try at least . From the difficulties of proof a great many do escape ; and when they do not , the embittered spirit that is engendered in a lawsuit , makes them ever after the unrelenting foes of the militia and its officers . I-low much of the present ill-will , manifested towards this institution , has proceeded from this cause , it is impossible definitely to estimate ; but none , who have had opportunity personally to observe its influence , will think it small . We think a partial remedy , at least , for this evil , mnight be discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned , at considerable length , those causes which , in our opinion , have been chiefly instrumental in producing the present state of the militia . There is one more , which we shall but just glance at . It is the general coldness of feeling , amounting , in many instances , to absolute contempt , which is shown by a majority of the most influential members of society . This is not a point , which can be made stronger or plainer by any extended discussion . Let every reader look about him and listen to the tones which men of education and refinement allow themselves habitually to indulge in towards this institution , or rather towards its officers and members . What are the epithets applied to the public parades ? what the names given to the poor , pelted standing companies ? For ourselves , we can not endure , that this noble system , built up as it is upon the true principles of genuine republicanism , equal social rights , and common social interests , should ever be treated with arrogant contempt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , much less openly express them.
