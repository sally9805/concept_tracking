txt WE have prefixed to this article the title of one of the most esteemed among the writings of Edmund Burke , which is remarkable for its perfect adaptation , in many particulars , to our country at the present time ; and we purpose to lay before our readers some of its pertinent passages , with such commentary as they may require and suggest ; premising only , that the system of administration , against which Eurke aimed this piece , is the same , which drew upon itself the ire , and called into action the pen , of the terse and vigorous Junius . We begin with an extract disclosing the general text of the essay " It is the nature of despotism to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary pleasure ; and to annihilate all intermediate situations between boundless strength on its own part , and total debility on the part of the people . To get rid of all this intermediate and independent importance , and to secure to the court the unlimited and uncontroled use of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private favor , has for some years past been the great object of policy . if this were compassed , the influence of the crown must of course produce all the effects , which the most sanguine partisans of the court could possibly desire . Government might then be carried on without any concurrence on the part of the people . " Here is the very scheme of the party now in power , described in just such language as the times demand : - To secure to the court ( Executive ) the unlimited and uncontroled uses of its own vast influence , under the sole direction of its own private favor ; so as , in the usual temper of despotism , to hold power only by its own pleasure , and to level down all the degrees and checks between boundless strength on its own part , and helpless debility on the part of the people . But how was this end to be reached ? " The first part of the reformed plan was to draw a line which should separate the court from the ministry . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be formed ; one which should be in the real secret and confidence ; the other merely ostensible , to perform the official and executory duties of government . The latter alone were to be responsible ; whilst the real advisers , who enjoyed all the power , were effectually removed from all the danger . " Secondly , a party under these leaders was to be formed in favor of the court against the ministry : this party was to ha e a large share in the emoluments of // government , and to hold it totally separate from , and independent of , ostensible administration . " The third point , and that on which the success of the whole scheme ultimately depended , was to bring parliament to an acquiescence in this project . Parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a total indifference to the persons , rank , influence , abilities , connexions , and character of the ministers of the crown . By means of a discipline of which I shall say more hereafter , that body was to be habituated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * Members of parliament were to be hardened into an insensibility to pride as well as to duty . * * Thus parliament was to look on , as if perfectly unconcerned , while a cabal of the closet and back.stairs was substituted in the place of a national administration . With such a degree of acquiescence , any measure of any court might well be deemed thoroughly secure . The capital objects , and by much the most flattering characteristics of arbitrary power , would be obtained . Every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the personal favor and inclination of the prince . Ihis favor would be the sole introduction to power , and the only tenure by which it was to be held ; so that no person looking towards another , and all looking towards the court , it was impossible but that the motive , which solely influenced every man 's hopes , must come in time to govern every man 's conduct ; till at last the servility became universal , in spite of the dead letter of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret springs of all the public mischief exposed to the eye . First ,  --  two cabinets were to be formed , one composed of the ostensible ministers , and the other of a back-stairs cabal ; secondly ,  --  a party attached to the back-stairs cabinet , and hostile or indifferent to the responsible heads of department , was to be organized and cemented together by official bribes and public jobs ; and , thirdly , Congress was to be corrupted , or bullied into taking its cue from the back-stairs court of the White House . To set these new springs in action , it was necessary for the conspirators to make many alterations in political arrangement . " In the first place , they proceeded gradually , hut not slowly , to destroy every thing of strength , which did not derive its principal nourishment from the immediate pleasure of the court . The greatest weight of popular opinion and partyconnexion were then with - and - . Neither of these held their importance by the new tenure of the court ; they were not , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were required by that tenure . - was first attacked . Not satisfied with removing him from power , they endeavored , by various artifices , to ruin his character . * * The great ruling principle of the cabal , and that which animated and harmonized all their proceedings , how various soever they may have been , was to signify to the world , that the court would proceed upon its own proper forces only ; and that the pretence of bringing any other into it was an affront to it , and not a support . Therefore , when the chiefs were removed , in order to go to the root , the whole party was put under a proscription , so general and severe , as to take their hard-earned bread from the lowest officers , in a manner which had never been known before , even in general revolutions . * Thus , for the time , were pulled down * * the two only securities for the importance of the people : power arising from popularity , and power arising from connexion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to supply the blanks according to their own judgment : they can be at no loss to discern the true analogy . This administration has , indeed , labored diligently to pull down the only securities for the importance of the people . But such a change could not be made without a mighty shock of the public system ; and ,  --  " To reconcile the minds of the people to all these movements , principles correspondent to them had been preached up with great zeal . Every one must remember that the cabal set out with the most astonishing prudery , both moral and political . Those who , in afew months after , soused over head and ears into the // deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption , cried out violently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments , which had formerly prevailed . This marvelous abhorrence , which the court had suddenly taken to all influences , was not only circulated in conversation throughout the kingdom , but pompously announced to the public , with many other extraordinary things . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective view of the court , gorgeously painted , and finely illuminated from within , was exhibited to the gaping multitude . Party was to be totally done away , with all its evil works . Corruption was to be cast down from court , as Atd was from heaven . Power was thenceforward to be the chosen residence of public spirit ; and no one was to be supposed under any sinister influence , except those who had the misfortune to be in disgrace at court , which was to stand in lieu of all rices and all corruptions . A scheme of perfection , to be realized in a monarchy , far beyond the visionary republic of Plato . The whole scenery was exactly disposed to captivate those good souls , whose credulous morality is so invaluable a treasure to crafty politicians . Indeed , there was wherewithal to charm every body , except those few , who are not much pleased with professions of supernatural virtue , who know of what stuff such professions are made ,  --  for what purposes they are designed , and in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to depict more accurately , to describe with more cutting truth , the hypocritical pretensions of purity and reform , which General Jackson paraded in advance of himself , at all times , before he became President , and the gross and abominable corruptions , of which those extravagant professions were the harbinger ? " Those who , in a few months after , soused over head and ears into the deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption , cried out violently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments , which had formerly prevailed ! " Ho*v emphatically does this represent General Jackson 's twaddle about appointing members of Congress to office , and interfering with the freedom of elections ! " And party was to be done away , with all its evil works ! " So General Jackson exhorted Mr. Munroe . " Corruption was to be cast down from court ! " Ay , there was to be " no more cakes and ale . " Retrenchment and reform were legibly inscribed upon the list of executive duties ; and we see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , which , although they have utterly " vanished , " - As the baseless fabric of a vision ; Yet , unlike that , have left " a rack behind . " Substituting , in the next extract , the words " members of Congress " for " peers and commons , " and it truly represents the obliquity of all the Jackson slander of the opposition Senators and Representatives . " One of the principal topics which was then , and has been since , much employed by that political school , is an affectual terror of the growth of an aristocratic power , prejudicial to the rights of the crown and the balance of the constitution . * * It is true , that the peers have a great influence * * in every part of the public concerns . * If any particular peers , by their uniform , upright , constitutional conduct , by their public and private virtues , have acquired an influence in the country , the people , on whose favor that influence depends , and from whom it arose , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a peer is the despotism of the aristocracy , when they know and feel it to be the effect and pledge of their own importance . * lie is but a poor observer , who has not seen that the generality of peers , far from supporting themselves in a state of independent greatness , are but too apt to fall into an oblivion of their proper dignity , a d to run headlong into an abject servitude . Would to God it were true , that the fault of our peers were too much spirit ! It is worthy of some observation , that these gentlemen , so jealous of aristocracy , make no complaints of the powers of those peers , neither few nor inconsiderable , who are always in the train of a court and whose whole weight must be considered as a // portion of the settled influence of the crown . This is all safe and right ; but if some peers ,  --  I am very sorry they are not as many as they ou* ht to be ) - set themselves , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-stairs influence and clandestine government , then the alarm begens ; then the constitution is in danger of being forced into an aristocracy . " We have alluded , already , to the system of a double cabinet , which distinguishes the Administration . It is truly set forth in the following passage " All sorts of parties , by this means , have been brought into administration , from whence few have had the good fortune to escape without disgrace ; none at all without considerable losses . In the beginning of each arrangement , no professions of confidence and support are wanting , to induce the leading men to engage . But while the ministers of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power , while they have all their canvas spread out to the wind , and every sail filled with the fair and prosperous gale of royal favor , in a short time they find , they know not how , a current , which sets directly against them ; which prevents all progress , and even drives them backwards . They grow ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity to po er , only serves to remind them the more strongly of their own insignificance . They are obliged either to e ecute the orders of their inferiors , or to see themselves opposed by the natural instruments of their office . With the loss of their dignity , they lose their temper . In their turn they grow troublesome to the cabal , which , whether it supports or opposes , equally disgraces and equally betrays them . It isfound necessary to get rid of the heads of ad inistration ; but it is of the heads only . " Would it not seem as if these expressions had been conceived and written in view of the fate of Messrs . Ingham , Branch , and Berrien and especially that of Mr. Duane ? Hear what Mr. Duane himself says , and compare the two statements . " Mr. Reuben M. Whitney called upon me , at my lodgings , at the desire , as he said , of the President , to make known to me what had been done , and what was contemplated , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication thus made to me created surprise and mortification . I was surprised at the position of affairs which it revealed , and mortified at the low estimate which had been formed of the independence of my character . * * I had heard rumors of the existence of an influence at Washington , unknown to the Constitution . The conviction that such influence existed , at least in relation to the matters then pressed upon me , was irresistible . I knew that four of the six members of the Cabinet , before I became a member of it , had been opposed to any present action in relation to the deposits ; and I also knew that four of the six members of the existing cabinet entertained the same views . I felt satisfied , not only that the President was not in the hands of his constitutional advisers , but that their advice was successfully resisted by persons , whose views I considered at variance with the public interest and the President 's fame . " Surely , Mr. Duane and Burke are speaking with reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the inner constitution of the cabal , canearilia , kitchen-cabinet , or whatever it may be , which Burke and Mr. Duane had in their mind 's eye . " That this body may be enabled to compass all the ends of its institution , its members are scarcely ever to aim at the high and responsible offices of the state . They are distributed with art and judgement through all the secondary , but efficient , departments of office , * * so as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the throne , and on the other to forward or frustrate the execution of any measure , accord.ing to their own interests . " // Just the position of William B. Lewis , Amos Kendall , and the rest of the cabal . " With the credit and support which they are known to have , though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excuse for salary , they possess all the influence of the highest posts ; and they dictate publicly in almost every thing , even with a parade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from these nominal leaders , the trained part of the Senate , instinctively in the secret , is sure to follow them ; provided the leaders , sensible of their situation , do not of themselves recede in time from their most declared opinions . " We think no member of Congress , or other person , familiar with affairs at Washington , can fail being struck with the faithfulness of this representation . In all the proceedings upon the hank , it was more especially apparent ; and the insolence of the cabal , its " parade of superiority , " its disposition to " dictate publicly in every thing , " and the instinct of the " trained " members of Congress , were all manifest together on occasion of the choice of a Speaker of the House last winter in place of Mr. Stevenson . " it will not be conceivable to any one who has not seen it , what pleasure is taken by the cabal in rendering these heads of office thoroughly contemptible and ridicnlous . And when they are become so , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Mr. Cass is a good sort of a man who can not take a hint ; Mr. Woodhury is " yes and no ; " Mr. Branch , Mr. Ingham , Mr. Berrien , Mr. Duane , Mr. McLane , are thrust out of place with various degrees of indignity ; Mr. Barry alone , willing to be made " thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous , " is " well supported . " is it not literally true ? " The members of the court-faction are fully indemnified for not holding places on the slippery heights of the kingdom , not Jnly by the lead in all affairs , but also by the perfect security in which they enjoy less conspicuous , but very advantageous situations . * Whilst the first and most respectable persons in the kingdom are tossed about like tennis-balls , the sport of a blind and insolent caprice , no minister dares even to cast an oblique glance at the lowest of their body . If any attempt be made upon one of this corps , immediately he flies to sanctuary . * * Conscious of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exterior ministers . Like janissaries , they derive a kind of freedom from the very condition of their servitude . They may act just as they please ; provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their institutions ; ** enjoying at once all the spirited pleasure of independence and all the gross lucre and fat emoluments of servitude . * * The whole system , comprehending the exterior and interior administrations , is commonly called , in the technical language of the court , double cabinet . " We may add , that General Jackson himself has borne testimony to the existence of the cabal or camarilla behind the throne ; since , on a well-known occasion , he spoke of the heads of department , the only cabinet known to the laws , as his cabinet proper ; on which account the people have very aptly styled the other cabinet , his cabinet improper . Some are accustomed to call it the kitchen-cabinet , we suppose , by way of indicating its meanness . However , as one of the organs of the administration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindicated and justified the kitchen , we take this last to be , at present , on the whole , the authorized , and , as it were , classical denomination of the interior and improper cabinet . // Now for the mischievous effects of this double cabinet upon the public welfare . " It is this unnatural infusion of a system of favoritism into a government which in a great part of its constitution is popular , that has raised the present ferment in the nation . The people , without entering deeply into its principles , could plainly perceive its effects , in much violence , in a great spirit of innovation , and in a general disorder in all the functions of government . This is the fountain of all those bitter waters , of which , through an hundred different conduits , we have drunk until we are ready to burst . The discretionary power of the crown in the formation of ministry , abused hy had or weak men , has given rise to a system , which , without directly violating the letter of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * * One great end undoubtedly of a mixed government like ours , * * is that the prince shall not he able to violate the laws . This is useful , indeed , and fundamental . But this , even at first view , is no more than a negative advantage-an armor merely defensive . It is therefore next in order , and equal in importance , that the discretionary powers , which are necessarily vested in the monarch , whether for the execution of the laws , or for the nomination to magistracy and office , or for conducting the affairs of peace and war , or for ordering the revenue , should all he exercised upon public principles and rational grounds , and not on the likings or prejudices , the intrigues or policies , of a court . This , I said , is equal in importance to the securing a government according to law . The laws reach but a very little way . Constitute government how you please , infinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the exercise of the powers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers of state . Even all the use and potency of the laws depends upon them . Without them your commonwealth is no better than a scheme upon paper , and not * living , active , effective constitution . * * When , therefore , the abettors of the new system tell us , that between them and their opposers there is nothing but a struggle for power , * we must tell those , who have the impudence to insult us in this manner , that of all things we ought to he most concerned , who and what sort of men they are that hold the trust of every thing that is dear to us . Nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation , but what must render us totally desperate , or soothe us into the security of idiots . " And the personal nature of the objections to a system of administration in the hands of back-stairs favoritism , is well stated in these words " The people of a free commonwealth , who have taken such care that their laws should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so senseless as to suffer their executory system to be composed of persons on whom they have no dependence , and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to those powers , upon the use of which the very being of the state depends . " Of this description are Amos Kendall and his associates ; men , who may have ability and integrity , but if they have these qualities , their genuineness has not yet been assayed , and marked , and made current by any proofs of public confidence . They have insinuated themselves into power through the mean by-paths of sycophancy and personal subserviency . They possess no constituency , so to speak ; they are not linked by elective ties to one part of the people , nor made known to the rest by responsible public services . These are conditions , without which no man becomes an ostensible head of department ; and they apply , with equal force , to the actual possessor of power in a free state , whether he belong to a cabinet proper , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have got together avowedly without any public principle , in order to sell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate , and are , therefore , universally odious , ought never to be suffered to domineer in the state ; because they have no connexion with the sentiments and opinions of the people . * * Here it is that the people must , on their part , show themselves sensible of their own value . Their whole importance , in the first instance , and // afterwards their whole freedom , is at stake . * * We are at present at issue upon this point . We are in the great crisis of this contention ; and the part which men take , one way or the other , will serve to discriminate their characters and their principles . Until the matter is decided , the country will remain in its present confusion . " True : how can we have peace , until the domination of that corrupt cabal of men , without any principle but to sell their conjunct iniquity at the highest price , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ones , applicable to the situation of Congress . " Parliament was , indeed , the great object of all these politics , the end at which they aimed , as well as the instrument by which they were to operate . But , before parliament could be made subservient to a system , by which it was to be degraded from the dignity of a national council , into a mere member of the court , it must be greatly changed from its original character . * * The virtue , spirit , and essence of a house of commons , consists in its being the express image of the feelings of the nation . It was not instituted to be a control upon the people , as of late it has been taught , by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency . A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy ; an anxious care of public money , an openness approaching towards facility , to public complaint : these seem to be the true characteristics of a house of commons . But an addressing house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commons full of confidence , when the nation is plunged in despair ; in the utmost harmony with ministers , whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence ; who vote thanks , when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachinents ; who are eager to grant , when the general voice demands account ; who , in all disputes between the administration and the people , presume against the people ; who punish their disorders , but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them : this is an unnatural , a monstrous state of things in this constitution . " This parallel is just to the letter ; in addition to which we have two means , or tests , of judging whether the legislature be corrupt or not ; for it is so , when we see ,  --  " First , a rule of indiscriminate support to all ministers ; because this destroys the very end of parliament as a control , and is a general precious sanction to miso'overnment : And , secondly , the setting up any claims adverse to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers , the present Congress has given ample evidence . Has it set up any claims adverse to the right of free elections ? Yes , in Letcher 's case , described point by point5 in the following passage " In the last session , the corps , called the King 's friends , made an hardy attempt , all at once , to alter the right of election itself ; to put it into the power of the house of commons to disable any person disagreeable to them from sitting in parliament , without any other rule than their own pleasure ; to make incapacities , either general for descriptions of men , or particular for individuals ; and to take into their body persons who avowedly had never been chosen by the majority of legal electors , nor agreeably to any known rule of law .

C.@@183068845.txt THE great national road , which traverses the vast ridges of the Alleghanies , stretching nearly from the Atlantic to the valley of the Mississippi , often presents scenery of the most beautiful and imposing character . rrhe traveler , as he approaches the western termination of this road , looks around with amazement upon the high peaks piled up like a rampart against the horizon . Their blue outlines , distinct as the folds of a pillowy cloud , seem penciled on the sky . South and north these immense chains stretch away in the distance far beyond the reach of human vision . One fine morning in autumn , during my sojourn in the West , I ascended , on horseback , one of the loftiest points in the midst of this mountain scenery . On reaching the summit , I dismounted from the vigorous animal , who had borne me up the acclivity , and , leaning upon his arched neck , I gazed around over a prospect of bewildering magnificence . Far down in the valleys beneath me , the mist rolled like a sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the prismatic colors of sunlight had been decomposed and mingled with its waves . From the east a flood of crimson was beginning to illume the peak on which I stood . The sky overhead was intensely blue , but the daystar 's brightness was not yet eclipsed . A few drifted clouds , in narrow ridges , fleckered the wide expanse , and were flushed with the early radiance of morning . The forests , which hung around me , now motionless , now quivering through every fibre , as the light breeze inclined their tops , were variegated with a myriad brilliant dyes . Autumn 's subtle alchemy had transmuted every leaf . Masses of glittering foliage looked beautiful in decay . The huge sycamore towered proudly among its fellows , spreading forth its long and silvery branches , which shone in strange contrast with its leaves of scarlet and yellow . But its trunk was still entwined by parasitical evergreens , and grape-vines had clambered to its very top . Nor was animation wanting to the scene . Birds of rich plumage darted from bough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured forth songs of ravishing melody . Far away , a line of light marked the issuing of a noble stream , which rushed on its course to pay due tribute to the Father of Waters . As I looked around upon the various objects of wonder and of interest which attracted my glance , my heart swelled high with emotion . I stood in the midst of a country , vast in extent , and unparalleled in the increase of its population . Its early history , its youthful struggles , its triumphant rise , its immense resources , and that comprehensive spirit of enterprise , which had already effected so much and gave such promise of the future-all these passed rapidly through my mind , and pictured forth images , which I will not trust my pen to describe . I thought of the thousands of my countrymen , who were at that moment awaking in every direction to renewed life and activity , and I exclaimed in my enthusiasm- " They rise to labor over thy undulating fields , 0 hardy Pennsylvania ! They reap the luxuriant harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold thy lofty hill-tops , blushing in the red rays of morning , 0 beautiful // Virginia ! Ever memorable Kentucky no longer the dark and bloody ground , ' but blessed with a population , who " - " Must not forget the price of their inherirance " - exclaimed a voice near me . The tone of the exclamation was low , but yet so startling , that my horse snorted with terror , and I stopped short in my soliloquy , without , however , altering my position . " Go on , " said the same mysterious voice , after a brief pause ; and glancing round-somewhat indignantly , I must confess-I saw , close by my side , an old man in the garb of a hunter , leaning upon his rifle , and bending on me a glance so earnest and yet so strangely tender , that every feeling of anger vanished in a moment from my heart . The individual was above the middle height . In his prime , his stature must have been handsome and commanding . From a subdued expression in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been overcome , but not till after long and severe struggles . The lines and muscles , which had once swollen under strong and overpowering excitement , were still apparent , although the fervor , which had glowed beneath them , was suppressed . Like the lava-streams and the fissures of a spent volcano , they still hore witness that the flames j*ad once raged terribly within , though now the secret fires were extinguished . For nearly a minute we were both silent ; hut at last the old man exclaimed- " Why do you not go on ? Give wings to your aspiring thoughts , to your brilliant anticipations . Too soon shall those thoughts and those anticif*ations be checked and cast down . Why do you not go on I know not how it was that I stood silent and immovable . Perhaps some spell , like that by which the ancient mariner detained the wedding-guest , was in the " glittering eye " of the old hunter . I fin*iIly replied , however , that my curiosity had been naturally awakened by the manner in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for myselg I was always more successful in soliloquy than in any other species of oratory . " I have disturbed your meditations somewhat unceremoniously , " said the old man ; " but trappers and savages are not the best models of courtesy , neither is the desert the most fitting school for politeness . My story , " continued he , " is , after all , but that of thousands , who , like myself , were among the pioneers of the West . But the memory of those men is fast passing away . Their exploits , their sufferings , will soon be forgotten in the political quarrels and speculations of the day . Though martyrs to the cause of civilization , the very progress of that mighty power will only throw them the farther into the shade . " How happens it that , under peculiar circumstances of scene or situation , some hidden sympathy connects the hearts of those who had before been strangers , and brings out that mutual interest which leads to a mutual confidence , and an interchange of common feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , questions and replies followed in a quick succession , and in a few , very few minutes the stranger and myself were better acquainted with eachother 's sympathies and disposition , than we should have been after years of the ordinary intercourse of life . fle at last fell into such a train of observations on his own career , that I was justified in my curiosity to know something more of its details ; and his story , as far // as I can gather it from my own recollections , and from some rough notes , mna ( le at my next stopping-place , ran somewhat after the following fashion " Stranger ! I was one of the earliest emigrants from New-England to the valley of the Mississippi . My native village was beautifully situated in view of the Atlantic , and if its hills were barren , and its climate ungenial , its inhabitants were thrifty and warm-hearted . I lived a contented man , until one day I fell in with an individual , who had visited the massive forests and the broad savannahs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surpassing fertility and the delicious atmosphere of that land of promise . My mind was filled with dreams of wide-extending plains , of natural vineyards , and of noble streams . I grew wearied of the rugged a spect of my native place , of its stubborn and rock-ribbed soil , its rusty cedar-trees , and its scanty fields of corn and potatoes . I resolved to emigrate to the West . But there were serious ( lifliculties in the way . My family consisted of a wife and two children ; the expenses and difficulties of the journey were considerable , and the dangers not a few . My wife at first dissuaded me from the undertaking ; but when she saw my earnestness to enter upon it , she withdrew her opposition , and consented to quit kindred and friends , and take up her abode with me in the wilderness . She was a gentle and beautiful creature , brought up in tenderness , but fearless of hardship and deprivation . On my power of protection , she seemed to place the most implicit reliance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have reconciled her to any situation , even were it full of peril . We were both young , and both with less experience , perhaps , than a parent ought to possess . We quitted our native village , not without regret . I think that in the course of all my sufferings , I never experienced a more miserable moment than that , when , seated in the vehicle , which transported us from the home of our youth , 1 saw the church steeple sink beneath my view , and the houses disappear , like familiar faces , from my sight . Mournful recollections of the past , fitful and mysterious glimpses of the future , doubts , anxieties , and self*reproaches , seemed to cast ill omens upon the success of my undertaking . How were they fulfilled ! " I will not detain you with a description of our long , tedious , and eventful journey . Over these ridges , the road was extremely toilsome and dangerous . We descended the Ohio in one of the flat-bottomed boats , which used to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigrants were pourin* towards Kentucky . I followed in their trail , and finally selected a rich tract of land in the neighborhood of a considerable station , and commenced the usual operations of a settler . With a little assistance , I erected a log-house , and cleared a portion of my land for cultivation . The soil amply repaid all the labor which I expended upon it . My crops of corn the second year were immense . My stock of cattle and horses , with trifling care and expense , was increased an hundred fold . My garden supplied me with fruits and vegetables in abundance . All the necessaries and most of the luxuries of life were within my reach . To the culture of the grape I paid particular attention , and was rewarded with a plenti vox*. vii . 46 // ful vintage . The maple-tree , which grew in profusion on my estate , offered a suitable object for well-directed labor and enterprise . I invented a process of clarifying the substance which exudes from this tree , and could prepare from it sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation was improved to a degree , which was a subject of astonishment to my neighbors . I erected a ne* t and commodious house , extended my orchards and vineyards , and , instead of blackened stumps and halfburned timber , I beheld around me fields of waving corn , gardens of freshest verdure , and a prospect of increasing loveliness , comfort , and delight . My *vife seemed more beautiful than ever . My family had not increased since we quitted New-England ; but Charles and Virginia , as our two children were called , were to us a constant source of gratification and amusement . Charles was now grown into an active , dark-eyed boy of nine years of age , and my little daughter was unfolding like a most sweet flower to the air of the *vilderness . I know not how I can speak of these things now with so much moderation ; but mighty , indeed , must be the grief , from which thirty years can not take the sting . " The struggles of the first settlers of the dark and bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths , the hardships which they had to encounter , their courage , their unbaffled perseverance , and those high and extraordinary virtues which danger seemed to developthese often furnished us with ample topics for eulogy and wonder . In that part of Kentucky where I had taken up my abode , all apprehension respecting a hostile incursion of the Indians , had subsided into a firm and fatal conviction of security . I see that you anticipate the result to which my story tends ; but permit me to proceed . Straggling bands of Indians occasionally visited my house , where they were hospitably received . I flattered myself that I had secured their lasting friendship by my conduct towards them . The event proved that I was mistaken . " Stranger , it was on a morning in autumn  --  a morning beautiful as this-that I joined a party of young men from a neighboring station , who were setting out on a chase . There seemed no cause for uneasiness at that time in leaving my family for a day or two . But , at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dark , undefined thought of evil clouded my gaiety . This , sir , is no after dream . The fact is well impressed on my mind . My comrades remarked my anxiety , and inquired the cause . I was ignorant of it myself . The circumstance was inexplicable to me then , and has been ever since . I do not often venture to reflect upon it . " But I soon forgot my vague and melancholy presentiments in the gaiety and exhilaration of the chase . The deer yet roved in considerable numbers through the vast forests , which extended around us . The scene , on this occasion , was refreshing and delightful . The nervous and impatient baying of the hounds , the rich echoes of the huntsman s horn , the shouts of those engaged in the sport , as a new object of pursuit started in view , all tended to quicken the blood , to sharpen the faculties , and to enliven the imagination . I had dismounted for the purpose of tightening the girths of my saddle , when I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a moment after , an old Indian , whom I recognized as one to whomn I had once made a // present of some tobacco , stood before me . He pointed , breathless , in the direction of my house , and said these words-I shall never forget them- ' Look to your home . The Shawnese are cowards , and spare neither women nor children . haste , or you will be too late . ' A dreadful thought , which it was madness to entertain , crossed my mind . I remember calling one of my coml ) anions of the chase , and imparting to him my misgivings . He promised to collect the rest of the party , and follow in the direction of my house . I looked round to see the old Indian , but he had disappeared . I leaped into the saddle , and , dashing the rowels deep into the flanks of my horse , I sped like a whirlwind towards my home . When I look back upon that dreadful ride , it seems all like a dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane , you may form some conception of the nature of my journey . Trees , hills , cattle , and corn-fields , seemed to rush by me like pursuing spectres . Sky and earth appeared confounded . It was as if I were borne forward by a mere act of volition ; and , with my rifle grasped in my right hand , and the reins held loosely in my left , while with my spurs I galled the poor animal who was performing his death-race , I must have been an object of astonishment , if not of a*ve , to a spectator . " Stranger , on ascending the bill , which com*manded a view of my estate , I beheld my house , with its enclosures , in flames . 1 uttered a cry of horror at the sight . My horse made fearful leap forward , and then fell dead beneath me . I speedily disentangled myself from the saddle , and ran on towards my burning house . Five or six Indians were visible , in different directions . I believe they belonged to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I approached the scene of desolation with desperate haste , I saw my little Virginia running towards me , pursued by a tall , half-naked savage . I ' he moment she beheld me , her slight frame seemed to be filled with renewed animation . She again rallied her energies to escape her dreaded foe , and exclaimed- ' 0 , dear , dear father you have come to  --  to save - Scarcely had she uttered these words , than-God of justice !  --  the barbarian flung his hatchet , with unerring aim , and my little daughter , my tender playmate , my solace , my pride , my most treasured hope , fell quivering , and wounded unto death , into my arms . A smile of subdued terror , of confiding joy , of affection strong to the last , passed over her innocent features like sunshine , and her pure soul fled to the heaven , whence it came . Leaving her on the green turf , I looked around for her destroyer . He was not to be seen , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew he must be lying in wait for my life . A dreadful foreboding urged me forward . My house was still in flames , and , rushing towards the threshold , I throttled the savage who opposed me , and called by name upon my wife and son . I received no answer , and was about to dart through the midst of the flames , in search of them , when a half consumed timber fell upon my head , and I was borne senseless and stunned to the ground . I will not excite your sympathies by details of all the distressing circumstances attending the destruction of my family . My wife and boy , after a brave resistance , and after both had been painfully wounded , were killed , together with two of my slaves . The attack was totally unexpected . Indeed , I have since thought that it was but very // suddenly undertaken by the Indians , who , at the time , were inflamed with whisky . As for myself , I was dragged from under the smouldering ruins , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest station . Here I was carefully and kindly attended ; but I did not regain my consciousness until the expiration of several days . Then , what a tide of horrible recollections poured in upon me ! The friends , under whose roof I was , could not but admit the full extent of my loss . They informed me that the remains of my family had been decently interred-that nothing was left of my house but naked rafters and heated ashes-that my orchards had been consumed or spoiledand that my cattle had been driven away . After listening to this catalogue of disasters , I stood , for some time , with fixed eyes , speechless and motionless . Then , bidding my host farewell , I took my rifle and hunting-accoutrements , and went forth into the woods  --  and there , for years , has been my home . My hostility to the Indians has been acthrouuh forest and tive , savage , and unrelenting . I have pursued them through prairie . I have shot them down as I would so many wild beasts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have slain my thousands . And my revenge has been great ! " One night I had a dream , which made a powerful impression upon me . I dreamed that , on a sultry day in summer , I stood by the side of a spring of water , which bubbled up from its marble basin clear as crystal and cool as the heart of an iceberg . An old Indian , wearied and panting with heat , came to drink of the clear fountain . He filled a gourd with the water ; but as he lifted it eagerly to his lips , I dashed it from his hands . He looked at me a moment , in astonishment , but quickly composing his features , he addressed me ,  --  ' I suppose that my white brother has some fire-water to give me . But I want it not . I know its treachery . I have lived to see my tribe dwindle away before its consuming fierceness . Once my people were numerous as the leaves of summer in our forests . The white man came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and fell to earth as the wasted leaves in autumn . Our lands were taken from us , and we-we-if we resisted because our *vi wams were burned and our hunting-grounds invaded-were made to feel the vengeance of the white man . Oppression , injury , and fraud , exercised towards us , were virtues in the eyes of the whites ; but our indignant resistance was savage barbarity , cruelty , and revenge ! The weak must yield to the strong ; and we must soon be an extinguished people . The advancing waves of civilization are driving us towards the Pacific . There may we have rest ! ' " And as the old Indian said these words , he again lifted the gourd filled with the crystal water to his lips . But , with an insatiable ferocity , I raised my rifle , and shot him through the heart . The fancied report awoke me . The stars were shining brightly through the green network of leaves , which the tall sycamores , with their intertwining boughs , formed above me . An almost unnatural quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dream . The words of the old Indian yet rung in my ears . A train of reflections passed through my mind , which roused me to a sense of my sinful and relentless passions . My feelings were softened and subdued . I prostrated myself upon the dewy turf , and poured out my soul in prayer to that invisible Spirit , // 365 towards whom a mysterious sympathy raised my aspirations . My repentance was entire and unreserved . I arose an altered man . I had rendered myself terrible to the Indians by my successful and ever-eager hostility . I now found it impossible to inspire them with confidence in my good intentions . A revulsion of feeling in their favor had made me desirous of devoting the remainder of my life to the amelioration of their condition . But they received my advances with distrust and with threats of vengeance . I at last quitted the wilderness , of which I had been a habitant for more than twenty years , and determined to return to the village of my birth . I am thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was when I first traversed these mountains The old man finished his narrative and , as we were going in opposite directions , we bade each other farewell . The mists of the morning were by this time dissipated , and the sun shone forth with fervid brightness . I again mounted my horse , and continued , with new food for reflection , on my solitary way . E. S.@@183068849.txt NEVER were the eyes of a nation fixed more intently upon a legislative body , than were those of the American people upon the Senate during the last session of Congress . The exciting questions upon which they were called to act , the repeated petitions for relief , by which they were besieged from all parts of the country , the extraordinary attitude , in which they stood , of opposition to the House and to the Executive-all combined to render their proceedings interesting and momentous . And though the relief which was prayed for , they could not grant , and though baffled in their exertions to restore confidence and prosperity , yet the firmness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stand , must long be gratefully remembered by the reflecting portion of the people . For several months the Senate Chamber was the great point of attraction to all visiters at Washington , and the seats for spectators were crowded to an unparalleled excess . The general stagnation of business afforded many classes of citizens leisure to quit their homes ; and strangers from all quarters of the union daily poured into the metropolis . Among those who contributed to make up the throng was myself ; and , though my stay was brief , I was fortunate enough to hear the principal speakers on the floor of the Senate . That precious document , the Protest of the President , was the order of the day when I arrived ; but much time was also occupied in the presentation of memorials , and in discussions upon the deranged state of the currency . The first person who caubht my eye , on entering the Senate Chamber by the middle door , was the Vice-President , who , with his hands in his pockets , was jauntily pacing the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can not be denied that this personage is aufait in matters of dress and fashion ; but the smirks and grimaces of a petit-maitre contrast oddly with the gravity and decorum of a deliberative assembly . All at once , I saw the little man approach his table , and rap on it with a small ivory baton . The effect was electric . Silence immediately ensued ; and a prayer from the chaplain opened the session . The proceedings of the day before were then read by the clerk . I was soon after startled at hearing from the VicePresident , the words , " The gentleman from Massachusetts , " and , turning , I perceived that Daniel Webster had risen to speak . 1-us remarks , however , were brief , though delivered with his usual impressive eloquence . They were upon the presentation of a memorial from some county in Pennsylvania . I afterwards heard his sublime speech upon the Protest , and never were the powers of human oratory more triumphantly dis*Aayed than by him on that occasion . Mr. Webster 's strength lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hearers , hut in the manner in which he brings out his strong phalanx of arguments , and displays them to the reasonthe noblest faculty of the human mind . His intonation is deep , and his action elegant and dignified . His phraseology is pure , manly , and unincumbered with those tinsel ornaments , to which some of our orators descend . He is less successful as the haranguer of a popular . and excited assembly , than as the expounder of constitutional law of // the repeller of executive aggression in the seat which he honors . Still does he sometimes introduce into his speeches bursts of eloquence , which stir the heart like the voice of a trumpet , and are the more stirring because unexpected . But the weapons of fair and unembellished argument are those which he generally employs , while we see that much of his force is in reserve . Mr. Clay was often engaged in light skirmishes with Forsyth , and others of the administration party , during my attendance on the dehates . In these encounters the Senator from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently gave him an advantage over his antagonists . I remember that , on one occasion , when he was replying to a somewhat heated opponent , a sudden squall came up and rattled the window-curtains , so as to produce a considerable noise . The orator stopped short in the midst of his remarks , and inquired , aloud , what was the matter ; and then , as if divining the cause of the disturbance , he said- " Storms seem to be coming in upon us from all sides . " The observation , though trivial as related , was highly amusing under the circumstances which gave rise to it , and from the manner in which it was uttered . Mr. Clay rarely fails to rivet the attention of his audience , and to reward it . His enunciation is clear and melodious , and he expresses strongly what he deeply feels . He is not over cautious in his choice of phrases and epithets , when speaking of the usurpations of the present incumbent of the presidential chair , or of the " lean and hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always happy in his illustrations , and no one can tell a good story with better effect . He possesses the highest qualifications of a genuine orator . I heard Mr. Calhoun once or twice in the Senate . He is not a frequent speaker , but is always listened to with interest and with delight . He is rapid in his utterance , and is too apt , in his eagerness , to leave parts of his words behind him but half enunciated . He has been accused of being metaphysical , but the charge is unjust . His speeches do not drag their slow length along to the usual Congressional extent , but are lucid and forcible without being diffuse . He does not hammer upon his arguments as if he thought the apprehension of his hearers was of the nature of an anvil , but generally offers such as do not need much enforcement or elucidation . Mr. Calhoun 's personal appearance would at once impress a stranger with the conviction , that he was an extraordinary man . He is somewhat tall and slim in stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He manifests a schoolboy negligence of dress . His forehead is prominent and intellectual , jutting over a pair of full , lustrous gray eyes , which beam with the soul 's fire . His chin , if physiognomy may be trusted , denotes firmness . His face is indented with premature wrinkles , and , at times , when shaded with intense thought , its severity reminds one of the chiseled features of some antique sage . But when lighted up with the animation of social intercourse , its expression is benignant and attractive . In conversation Mr. Calhoun is unrivaled. lie is earnest and eloquent without being dictatorial , and his ready affability , his entire destitution of pretence , his frankness and simplicity of manner , render him a favorite with all his personal acquaintances . His colleague , Mr. Preston , has , within the past year , taken no inconspicuous stand by // his side among the foremost men in Congress . Mr. Preston is perhaps now the most popular and gifted speaker in the Senate . His rhetorical acquisitions are no doubt great ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To a mind imbued with elegant literature , and to powers of oratory confirmed by long practice , he unites a vigorous understanding and genius of a high order . His voice is flexible and richly-toned , and his management of it is perfect . His pronunciation is always classical and correct . He is profuse and animated in his gestures , and his style of delivery is energetic and thrillingly effective . Over the fluctuating sea of human passions and prejudices , he exercises the control of a Prospero ; and , as he wills it , the waves tower and foam , or sink into the serenity of a noonday calm . He is an orator for great occasions , and , like his kinsman , Patrick Henry , he is most eloquent on the spur of the moment . Some of his most fortunate efforts have been those which were wholly unpremeditated ; and his reported speeches convey an imperfect idea of their effect when spoken . He is a devoted Whig , and an uncompromising foe to the arbitrary measures of the present dynasty . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stands six feet and a fraction in his slippers , and is stout and well proportioned . His countenance is open and manly , with no prominent trait , and his complexion is somewhat florid . His hair  --  but candor compels me to admit that the orator , who attracts such general admiration , the observed of all observers-wears a wig . The circumstance would not be readily discovered , but he shows so little solicitude to conceal it , that often when speaking , he raises his hands to adjust his borrowed integument . Mr. Preston , like most of the warm-hearted gentlemen of the south , is a delightful companion , cordial in his manners , kind and unsuspicious in his intercourse , and high-minded in all his relations . He is a staunch nullifier , and , in the opinion of some , this caps the climax of his good qualities . Mr. Poindexter of Mississipi is useful and statesman-like in the station which he occupies . He is not a fluent or powerful speaker , but his remarks are usually pungent and sententious . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and in a low tone of voice , as if he were uttering mere common-place . In this manner he often takes an adversary by surprise . He is untiring in his attention to legislative business , and , unlike many of his fraternity , shows an impatience to proceed with all possible despatch , and bring the session to a close . He is a fearless opponent of the recent aggressions of the President and his reckless advisers , and it is a very fair proof of his vigilance and integrity , that he has incurred their most bitter hatred . Among the most estimable members of the Senate is Judge Porter , of Louisiana . This gentleman is an Irishman by birth , and his father was one of that honorable band , who , with Emrnet , fell victims to the cruelty of Ireland 's oppressors , and paid , on the scaffold , the price of their devotion to liberty . The son has proved himself worthy of the blood from which he sprang , and which was spilled in so sacred a cause . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their tools , which subjected his parent to persecution unto death . Judge Porter is a true-hearted Whig . His opposition to the present administration is strong and decided , because , in the doctrines which // it has dared to avow , he sees , with abhorrence , the features and the elements of a despotism more odious , if possible , than that from which he fled . He is warmly attached to our free institutions . In the Senate he is always listened to with respect and attention . lie is an agreeable and animated speaker , somewhat rapid in his delivery , and with an accent sufficient to remind one of his origin . His talents are of the first order , and his literary attainments brilliant and various . Mr. Waggaman , his colleague , is one of the finest-looking men I remember to have seen . lie is a graceful and intelligent debater , and an honor to the state which he faithfully represents . I was amused by the contrast between the Senators from Maine . Mr. Shepley , the Tory champion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal butt at Washington . lie is a perpetual laughing-stock , an innocent buffoon , an unconscious merry-andrew , and a very bad joke . His drone is melancholy discord , his drivel is unadulterated nonsense . Never was individual so misplaced . When he rises to bray , legislation is obstructed , seats are forsaken , and a ludicrous panic is depicted on the faces of his hearers . His exhibitions of imbecility are often truly painful , and he is always happiest in his conclusions . But if Maine is abused in the unfitness of one of her Senators , she is no less honored in the transcendent abilities of the other . Mr. Sprague is one of the proudest ornaments of our national legislature . Ready and eloquent in debate , sagacious in his investigations , and bold in his expositions , he is a thorough statesman , and a first-rate orator . Though one of the youngest members of the Senate , he has acquired a renown , which the most sterling talents alone could have conferred . He has , as might be anticipated , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now hold the reins of go vernment ; but his manly and independent course must place him high in the estimation of honest and unprejudiced men . There is no state more worthily represented than Virginia , in the Senate . I heard Mr. Leigh speak but once , while at Washington . He is ardent and voluble in his delivery , and choice in his language . He is said to be surpassed by few in the variety and extent of his information ; and his popularity is rapidly on the increase . In person , he is short and thick-set , with an amiable countenance and expressive features . Governor Tyler entered early into political life , and his experience has been considerable . He is an unostentatious speaker , but occasionally startles by his high-toned eloquence . He preserves a respectable standing among the many able legislators , with whom he has to compete . Judge Mangum of North-Carolina is a vigilant friend of the constitution , and a valuable accession to the party , which holds up that palladium of our liberties as a banner and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , and his style of speaking is impressive to a remarkable degree . In person he is tall and commanding , and his face is indicative of true nobility of soul . This gentleman , together with Mr. Ewing of Ohio , and Governor Tyler , has lately been a visitant of our city , and the impressions , which he carried away were , I believe , as favorable and as gratifying as those , which he has left behind . Mr. Ewing has been subjected to the haughty sneers of the Tory journalists , because his origin was humble , and he has risen from the obscure // station of a stable-boy to the eminence which he n&amp;w enjoys . Perhaps these fastidious gentlemen may trace some affinity between his old employment , and the Augean task , which he has recently so ably completed , of investigating the concerns of the Post-office Department . If ever a representative merited the entire confidence of his constituents , and of the public , Mr. Ewing is the man . Honesty and truth beam in his features , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skillful and temperate debater ; and native good sense forms the foundation of all his remarks . I regretted that I did not have an opportunity of hearing Mr. Southard . His published speeches have attracted much attention , and his oratorical powers are said to be great . I was much pleased with Mr. Frelinghuysen 's chaste but vigorous style of speaking . He is an accomplished legislator , and a most worthy and patriotic man . rrhe hireling paragraphists of the administration press have attempted to ridicule him , because he is so undiplomatic as to manifest , on all occasions , a supreme regard for religion and morality ; but I believe that most persons will not be inclined to consider this a serious objection to him , either in his political or social relations . Mr. Chamhers of Maryland is an efficient member of the Senate . his voice , however , is defective , and his manner is not that of a finished orator . He is a dangerous antagonist , and always has an appropriate flow of words at his command . Just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annihilation of that immaculate politician , the honorable Isaac Hill , of whom , little has since been heard . De mortuis nil nisi bonum . Delaware furnishes a talented delegation to the Senate . Mr. Clayton possesses a highly-gifted intellect , and is a profound statesman . His legal acquirements are very extensive . He is a fine , manly speaker , and is untiring in his devotion to public business . Dr. Naudain , his colleague , is a consistent democrat of the old scho9l , and inimical to the arbitrary sway of the office-holders and their military chieftain .. What will the minority in the Senate do , now that they are deprived of that Antteus-iike gladiator , Mr. Forsyth ? Who will now rally their shattered forces , and lead them forth to the unavailing encounter ? Who will audacious venture singly into the field in the face of an opposing host ? What new Ajax will arise and defy the thunders of popular indignation ? But I am growing mythological , and do not wish to excite the jealousy of Colonel Benton . To descend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ex-senator from Georgia ? It assuredly will not easily again be filled as it has been . Mr. Forsyth is no ordinary man . He would be a consummate orator , if his heart could only go with him in what he says . lie is an admirable tactician , and , though often compelled to retreat , it is rare that he is completely subdued . His voice is rich and sonorous , his action graceful and emphatic-and , were it not for a suspicious twinkle in his eye , and a betraying smile on his lip , one mibht. suppose that he was half sincere , even when making the declaration , that the removal of the government deposits from the Bank of the United States produced no distress in the community ; or when defending the monstrous doctrines maintained in the Protest . Mr. Forsyth was the indefatigable and indiscriminate advocate of all the measures of General Jackson ; but the reward of // his labors was constantly before his eyes . The job was venal and vulgar , but the compensation was a lure not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the price of his prostituted talents has been paid him ; and the President 's Senator is now the President 's Secretary of State . Mr. Wright of New-York is rather an engaging speaker , courteous and dispassionate in his manner , and moderate in his delivery . 1-us voice , however , is neither powerful nor clear , and his pronunciation is somewhat primitive . Wilkins of Pennsylvania has been sent minister to Russia , since the spring , lie is a slim arid gaunt-look ing personage , with stiW gray hair , and sharp , sunken features . He is an orator of considerable repute , and , in point of abilities , among the first men of his party . I must not forget Colonel Benton of Missouri . rrhe extraordinary history of this gentleman 's connection with General Jackson is well known . having been concerned in a tavern-broil , with our venerable chief magistrate , a scuffle ensued between them in the street , in the course of which , the old Roman fired a pistol in his face . But the valiant colonel did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as the author of a " horrible outrage , " and of " the most outrageous affray ever witnessed in a civilized community . " He lived , still longer , to become the warmest advocate of his elevation-not to the scaffoldbut to the highest office in the gift of the nation . Strange and inconceivable revulsion of feeling ! He is now the active supporter of the man , whom he has publicly asserted to be a ruffian and a brawler ! The Tories are proud of Benton . They laud him as the prince of orators . He is a boisterous braggadocio , who seems determined to make up in noise what he wants in argument  --  to split the ears of the groundlings . His phraseology is meretricious and bombastic , his metaphors are incongruous and absurd , and the whole style of his delivery is in the worst possible taste . Ancient Pistol was a fool to him . The colonel is a large and redoubtable-looking person ; but it does not take long to discover that the lion 's skin is assumed . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contents , by the quantity of sound , which they emit-when struck . One word of Mr. Grundy. lie is an indifferent speaker , but stands conspicuous among his friends , in consequence of paying some respect to an enlightened public opinion . He justly passes for an honest man ; for , as the credit of integrity is uniformly conceded to him from the other side of the House , we may , at least , grant him the full benefit of the concession . Honest he unquestionably is ; as honest , per haps , as any intelligent man can be , who continues an ardent and uncompromising partisan of the administration . In taking a deliberate review of the Senate , it must be obvious to an impartial observer , that more than five-sixths of the virtue , talent , and eloquence of that body are arrayed in opposition to the administration , under which , for the last year , the best energies of the country have been shackled and bent . Of course , with the Tories , the cry is still , " Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chieftain 's progress to despotic power ! Shall the veteran hero of NewOrleans , whose breast is covered with the scars of many a fray-shall he be dictated to , and withheld by , a parcel of temporizing legislators , // who , perhaps , never handled a musket in their lives ? " This may be very good logic for the office-holders , hut the people will spurn it with contempt . The aliens , the hereditary bondsmen , who flock to our shores , and , with perjury upon their souls , are se&amp;it to mingle in our elections , may also find the doctrine a very palatable one ; but the sons of freemen , the honest yeomanry of the country , will not , without a terrible struggle , part with those liberties and those institutions , which our fathers fought for and bequeathed . E. S.@@183068859.txt IT is gratifying to all friends of the Union that a more easy communication between the northern and southern states has naturally led to a more frequent intercourse . Prejudice , interest , political dissension , have done much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to dissipate these evils . Different as the character of the two sections may be , the common sympathies are more numerous than the unreflecting consider them . There is no reason under heaven why the union of feeling and reflection should not be as complete , as are our political connections . Bound together by a common constitution , we should be also bound together by alliances of mutual regard and friendship . We have said that the northern and southern characters materially differ . There is more quickness , more ardor , a greater disregard of consequences , more active impulse , with the citizens of Virginia and the Carolinas than with us . In New-England we are more prudent , more reflective , not in the main less generous , or less disinterested than they . There is a cautious population here , more industrious , perhaps , certainly more absorbed in the cares and avocations of life . All these peculiarities arise from our social condition , and the character of our soil and climate . A southerner is more easy and familiar with strangers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , from the habits of hospitality current in his country , is taught to treat them with kindness and leave them as friends . The traveler sleeps and breakfasts with the planter ; and the planter is at leisure to ride with him about his grounds , or to join him in the sports of the chase . Our merchants and farmers must look to their affairs in person ; they have little time to spend in entertaining even their friends ; and think they do all that is required of them in building fine hotels for the accommodation of visiters . The spirit of hospitality is not by nature more ardent in the South , but by habit and circumstances ; which , if they do not absolutely change , greatly modify and control nature . We have been led to these reflections by noticing , in a southern journal , a few judicious comments on the same subject . " Our people , " says a correspondent of the Fredericksburg Arena , " ought to travel Northward oftener . They would learn much that is valuable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would profit much more in unlearning the prejudices which ignorance alone and misrepresentation , have fostered against their Northern brethren . The latter , too , have some , though fewer , reciprocal prejudices , which a closer scrutiny would cure . It is of unspeakable importance that these mutual dislikes should be weeded away . The perpetuity of our Union , and the peace , the liberty , the happiness of its members , may , in a great degree , depend upon the accomplishment of that expurgation. " // At a time like the present , it is of the highest importance that the most friendly relations should be cultivated with our southern brethren . All minor differences , all perverse prejudices , all unholy excitements must cease . Geographical lines must not continue political and moral demarkations . A peaceful revolution in our political masters must be made , or the last hopes of civil liberty perish . In this revolution the high-minded , intelligent , and patriotic , of all portions must unitecordially and with their whole hearts-with the fixed resolution , that principle , integrity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contest , and that all sectional jealousies and local predilections shall be sacrificed on the altar of the common weal . With such an union every thing will be gained , without it nothing . II . MATTHIAS THE PROPHET . THE success of this imposter is one of the most singular affairs of the day . It is a proof that human nature will ever continue what it always has been , in spite of the march of mind , and the spirit of improvernent . True enough it is , that every Darby will find her Joan , and every imposter his dupe . Fanaticism and infidelity will flourish in defiance of the birch of the schoolmaster ; they are spirits which his rod can not lay . It is now between two and three years since plain Robert Mathies converted himself into the Prophet of the God of the Jews . Of his previous history we know nothing . His career commenced in Albany , and was soon after continued in New-York . Proselytes were , at first , few ; his profession did not prosper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most wealthy merchants of Pearl-street fell into his snare ; their names were Pierson , Mills , and Folger . Their credulity and confidence knew no bounds . They embraced the doctrines of the new prophet with implicit belief . His wardrobe needed a supply ; and could the prophet appear in garments less costly than the robes of earthly princes ? Funds were raised by his followers . The vestures of Matthias shone with gold and silver ; his jewels were rich and rare , his sword was of costly workmanship . This weapon , according to the imposter , is the Sword of Gideon , and was miraculously put into his possession . As a proof of its celestial temper , the blade bears evident marks of native manufacture , with the national motto of E Pluribus Unum . The bondage of his three victims became complete . Mr. Pierson was finally liberated by death , under circumstances which throw the strongest suspicion on the prophet . He unquestionably died by poison . His death alarmed Mr. Folger and his family , and they determined to abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Folger was resolute , and the wretch attempted to administer poison . The family fortunately escaped . Matthias was immediately arrested , and the circumstances above detailed soon became public . Matthias was arrested in Albany , where his wife and daughter have been residing , in very indigent circumstances ; supporting themselves by menial occupations . Among the articles found in his possession , appertaining to his trade as prophet , was a six foot rule , marked like a carpenter 's scale , and intended to be used for the purpose of dividing // New-Jerusalem into lots for the faithful . A key , resembling gold , was designed to unlock the gates of heaven . In his trunk were found linen and wearing apparel of the most rich and costly description . " Linen shirts , " says the New-York Times , " of the most exquisite fineness , the wristbands fringed with delicate lace ; silk stockings and handkerchiefs , kid and other gloves , and a great variety of other similar articles fitted out the trunk ; the other contained his goldmounted cocked hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout with velvet and silk ; a new green and a brown frock-coat of similar quality ; the former heavily embroidered with gold , and the latter with silver , in the form of stars , with a large sun on one breast and seven stars on the other ; two rnerino morning dresses , and other rich et ceteras , too tedious to mention . ' But the cap sheaf ' of all were two night-caps , made of linen-cambric , folded in the form of a mitre , richly embroidered-one with the names of the twelve apostles written around it , and Jesus Matthias ' adorning the front in more conspicuous characters ; the other surrounded with the names of the twelve tribes , the front embellished the same as the other . The whole betokened the utmost extravagance and lavish expenditures of money and labor ; and months must have been spent by female hands , probably those of some one or more of his deluded dupes , in ornamenting and making up the apparel of this dainty carpenter and prophet . " Matthias awaits in prison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Full details of the whole affair will , undoubtedly , be made . In its present development it forms one of the strangest chapters in the history of the human mind . It laughs to scorn the philosophy of an intellectual era . Human nature is essentially what it always has been , and all the schoolmasters in the universe can not change it . Delusions , hardly less absurd than those of the times of witchcraft , are current every where at the present moment . III . MARCH OF ANARCHY . THE recent melancholy indications of a state of confusion and anarchy , of a growing disregard of law and order , an increasing and irrepressible spirit of turbulence and tumult , must excite in the most unreflecting mind the most serious considerations . Where had this spirit birth ? In the nature of our own citizens , or in the example of a licentious foreign population ? In the nature of our government , or in the character of those who have administered it ?  --  a character which uniformly gives a tone to its subjects . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our government . It was exhibited in the forcible seizure of the public monies , and the inflammatory and violent measures by which it was sustained . We will carry through the President 's will , exclaimed the government , perish what may ! We will carry through our will , echoed the sovereign people , perish what may ! The insolence , with which popular deputations were received at Washington , was another exhibition of the spirit of violence . It first openly broke out in the mobs , at the charter elections in New-York . It next appeared at the riots which followed some movements of the antislavery societies ; next at the burning of the Ursuline Convent at // Charlestown . It has since been traced in blood and fire at the elections in Philadelphia , and Heaven only knows where it is to end . The display of any inclination on the part of the government to substitute force for law , to compass its ends by coercion and violence rather than by the law and constitution , will invariably lead to popular insurrection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the report of the committee of Boston citizens on the burning of the Convent , " when popular will shall take the place of law , whether this be by riots and tumults or under the form of judicial proceedings , the grave of our nation 's happiness and glory will have been prepared . Life , liberty , and property will be held at the will of malignity , prejudice , and passion ; violence will become the common means of selfdefence ; and our only refuge from the horrors of anarchy will be under the comparatively peaceable shelter of military despotism . " IV . JAMES SHERIDAN KNOWLES . THE reputation of Mr. Knowles as a popular dramatist is well established , both in this country and in Great-Britain . His success is an earnest of the return of a purer taste , and leads us to hope that the reign of the harlequins and the men-monkeys will not rise upon the ruins of the legitimate drama . Like most authors of native genius , Mr. Knowles has fashioned his productions after no borrowed model . His style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaffected . None of his plays are purely tragic they are chequered , as all fair representations of human life ever must be , with light and shade , but so relieved as not to present any incongruity in the management of the plot . Mr. Knowles , we believe , never thought of impersonating before the public the fine conceptions of his fancy until just before the appearance of his well-known play , the Hunchback . The affairs of the Covent Garden Theatre , in London , were , at that time , in a desperate condition . The proprietors had reduced the salaries of the actors one half , and were in arrears to them to a considerable amount . Charles Kemble , the manager , was pacing the green-room with clen&amp;hed fists , looking ten times more tragical than he ever did upon the stage . Utter bankruptcy seemed inevitable . At this moment , Knowles , with his characteristic generosity , stepped forward and offered to perform in his play himself ; " he did not profess to know much about acting , but the novelty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly accepted . The Hunchback was produced , the author taking the part of Master Walter . Its success was decided and overwhelming . Pit and boxes were crowded every night of its presentation , with applauding spectators . The credit of the theatre was retrieved ; its coffers were replenished ; the actors were paid full salaries , and their long-pending demands at last liquidated . Thus , by the genius of one man , an infinite degree of private distress was averted , and prosperity restored to an establishment , on which some hundred individuals depended for bread . But was Knowles , the actor-bard ,  --  the individual who saved the whole concern from impending ruin ,  --  was he adequately rewarded for his sacrifices and his exertions ? A weekly stipend , which one of our hack players would refuse to rant for , was allotted him , and the manager finally 4 // had the impudence to give him this grudgingly . We forbear com* menting upon the transaction . Mr. Knowles showed that he did not possess the talent of making a shrewd bargain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managerial virtues . Mr. Knowles arrived in this country last September . After performing several nights with eminent success in New-York , he made his appearance on the boards of the Tremont . His reception in this city was enthusiastic , but his audiences were rather select than crowded . His style of acting is chaste , spirited , and effective . His utterance is clear and emphatic , his action expressive and natural . There is much of the hurried energy and the startling colloquial manner of Kean in his performances . We never witnessed acting which was marked by more of the impressiveness of reality , than some parts of his personation of William Tell , particularly the scene with Mdcthal , when he learns that Gesler had wantonly put out the old man s eyes . his manner was here that of a man struck speechless with deep horror , appalled with a sense of incredible cruelty and wrong , burning with fierce indignation , fixed in a purpose of terrible vengeance . It was a study for a great painter . It is gratifying that the merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever may have been the illiberality with which they were recompensed in England . His qualities , as a man of high moral worth , of candor , and magnanimity , are no less remarkable than his talents as an author and actor . We have been told that Mr. Knowles is at present employed upon a new drama , the scene of which is laid in America , and one of the characters of which is an aboriginal inhabitant of our soil . The experiment is a hazardous one , but we can not doubt of his success . V. ENGLISH STRICTURES UPON THIS COUNTRY . WE are , there is no denying it , a thin-skinned race of people ; sensitive to abuse and resentful of obloquy and detraction , though the source whence they proceed be ever so obscure and contemptible . An old woman across the pond , who , with arms a-kimbo , appears and rails at us in the elegant phraseology of Billingsgate , may set the whole nation in an uproar . A profligate libeler , who sneers at our institutions and misrepresents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a very general and unnecessary degree of popular indignation . A solemn twaddler , like the reverend Isaac Fiddler , who exposes his own tenuity of intellect in attempting to narrate how he browsed and how he brayed in this country , and how his " father had a cow what used to milk herself , " is straightway made a subject of consideration , and thrust before the public in the shape of a neatlypresse ( l octavo . A foreign journalist , who aims at us a paragraph barbed with malice and loaded with stupidity , is instantly pointed out and denounced as a formidable sharp-shooter . His abuse is placed before our eyes in a multitude of shapes , and he is plainly proved to be no friend to the republic . We were lately amused at seeing extensively copied into our papers from the London New Monthly Magazine , a vulgar article , purporting to be an attack upon  --  the city of New-York . This truly alarming and momentous circumstance was speedily made known to the public // through the vigilance of the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have yet resulted . The writer in the New Monthly , which , by the way , seems to have passed from the hands of Bulwer into those of an incompetent scribbler , has been , it appears , to see a panorama of New-York , which has been opened for exhibition in London . Of the picture he speaks with true Cockney glee ; but the city he is inclined to think is " no great shakes . " He does not believe that there is a house on either side of Broadway , that a London tradesman would live in . And he must say , " that the figures and carriages , which no doubt are perfectly characteristic , are quite in keeping with the scenery ; dirty omnibuses , shabby hackney-coaches , tumble-down horses , and scampering fire-engines , with one landau , form the group of carriages , while a motley crowd of slaves ( ! ) and swaggerers , Yahoos and Yankees , exhibit the pedestrian part of the population to no greater advantage . " He says nothing of the English paupers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aforesaid Yahoos and Yankees . The writer is kind enough to admit that the Hudson is a very fair river for a new country , and that the surrounding scenery , which has not yet been spoiled by American taste and genius , looks beautiful . Seriously : we are utterly indifferent to the flippant sarcasms and the defamatory tirades of the English press . We do not consider it a matter of very great importance whether their travelers speak well or ill of us . For opinions founded in ignorance and maintained through prejudice we have very little respect . But we do regret that the growing good feeling between the two countries should be rudely checked by assaults , like those in the New Monthly . A great fault with our people , is , an undue deference to English opinions and precedents . Our literature , our associations , are so interwoven with those of England , that it is hard to assume towards her that unbending rigidity and indifference of demeanor , which we may preserve before other nations . But this subserviency to British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independence of sentiment and of feeling , must be achieved , since our proffered alliance is rejected with insult and with contumely . And why should we not have sufficient self-respect to effect this emancipation ? Why should we be so absurdly sensitive to what they may say of us in England ? Why should we either be disquieted by her censure or elated by her praise ? She has ever proved but a capricious and unnatural mother . Why do we , like an overgrown booby , persist in remaining tied to her apron-strings ?
