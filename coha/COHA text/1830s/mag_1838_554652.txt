txt WE can not profess to have kept ourselves au courant of this last of the forms of agitation which signalize these stirring times . We see from the advertisements , that books upon the subject of spare diet are succeeding one another with marvellous speed ; but , as to reading any of them , we are content to do better with our time . It seems , that they have made // disciples enough to justify the assembling of what is called , after the mode of the day , an " American Convention , " and , the journal of the proceedings of that body having been sent us , we have bad the curiosity to look it through . The Convention sat in the new Marlborough Chapel , in Boston . How numerous it was does not appear , except that one of the speakers complains of its thinness , " compared with other meetings of confessedly less importance . " But , if all was true that was said on the occasion , of the reducing power of the food to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear that accommodation would not be found , even had the attendance been large . The members had been preparing to make room for one another , by an expedient not absolutely unlike that described in the meeting of another society . " Behold a wonder ! they but now who seemed In bigness to surpass Earth 's giant sons , Now less than smallest dwarfs , in narrow room Throng numberless , like that Pygmean race Beyond the Indian mount . " At all events , the officers were no fewer than nine ; viz. one President ( not two , which we see is a new method of organization approved in some quarters , the hint being probably borroxved from the associate kings of Brentford ) , five VicePresidents , and three Secretaries . The President , on taking the chair , after the customary declarations of " great diffidence , " " entire reliance on the indulgence and assistance " of the assembly , and the " very novel circumstances " under which they were met , proceeded to pump into his associates the spirit of martyrdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own weakness and blindness ; for we know that every reform that has benefited the human race , whether in the religious , moral , social , or political world , has been commenced and carried on by the people , generally by the humblest of the people . " We know that the reform we anticipate is one of immense magnitude , that it strikes at some of the strongest vices and worst passions of the human character , and that it must require large sacrifices of time , labor , and money . We know that those who act as pioneers in this cause must , like all other reformers , suffer ridicule , reproach , and abuse , perhaps even peril fortune and ljfe itself ; yet we do not , on that account , // feel at liberty to withdraw from the great and glorious enterprise . " Could any thing be more magnanimous ? Assuredly not , if this were not well understood to be the way for people to take , to whip up themselves and others into making something out of nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begets opinion , and opinion breeds substance . " The President tells his assessors , that they are exposing themselves to grievous opposition and dislike ; here is the " report . " T hey think it very hard that they should be so hardly dealt with ; here is the " opinion . " And so they go lustily to work , with speaking , and writing , and all such sorts of vigorous demonstration ; and lo ! the " substance . " The President 's valor is uncalled for . His fortune is safe , except so far as he chooses to tax himself with a waste of it on Graham tracts . His life is in no other peril than the serious one to which he may doom it from insalubrious fare . If he loves bran bread , or roasted quills , or powdered charcoal , he is a free man , let him eat them to his fill , and be quiet about it . We dare say people will not trouble him , if he does not annoy them with solicitations to share his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not go about to work upon the pride of the credulous , and set them in whirligig motion by the threat , that , if they venture to move , there is somebody standing ready to crowd upon them . The President 's enthusiasm naturally blazed up under the breath of his own panegyric , till , before he ended , he found himself fain to " believe that the blessed cause of human improvement , the spread of the Gospel , and the universal regeneration of the world , can never be successfully carried forward without the aid of the great work which we are now assembled to advance . " This life-giving potion administered , the Resolutions came on , of which the following took precedence . " Resolved , that to all persons in health the exclusive use of a diet consisting of farinaceous vegetables and fruits , with the addition of milk at certain ages and in certain circumstances , if entered upon properly and gradually , is not only safe , but preferable to any other ; and that to many persons afflicted with eruptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // indispensable , and affords the only hope of a permanent cure . " This Resolution covers a good deal of ground , and is of pretty solemn import . Whether it obtained the concurrence of the meeting , is not told . If it did , we are to presume this to have been brought about under the influence of the argument which followed . It was sustained by three speakers . Of these the first said , among other things equally cogent ; I thought myself in the possession of perfect health , and , while I was accustomed to apply ice to my feverish head , and often subject to sick headache , I never dreamed that this was disease . I regarded and spoke of myself as well , while now I believe there was a tendency of blood to the head . " Now we make it a rule not to scrutinize a gift horse over jealously ; all volunteer advice , provided it is not too officiously volunteered , we receive with meek thankfulness . But we like to know from whom it comes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its worth ; and , when we take counsel concerning diet , or any other subject whatever , we would rather it should be from some one , who , when " subject to sick head-ache , " and applying ice to his feverish head , is led to entertain at least some vague suspicion that he is diseased . This gentleman has lost , on a vegetable diet , just thirty times the penalty of the bond which Antonio forfeited to Shylock , and declares himself to be in his own judgment the gainer to precisely that amount , having so much less weight to carry ; so differently does the same thing strike different minds , and so back-handed a compliment is it henceforth to be esteemed , to be told that one gains flesh . " Before , " says he , that is , before adopting the new regimen , " there was an indescribable feeling at the pit of my stomach , which made me dissatisfied with myself and my efforts . " If that indescribable feeling at the pit of his stomach gave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on this occasion , his new fare has done him yeoman 's service ; and , if he ever abandons so serviceable a friend , he deserves to have his retribution in all Caliban 's aches , " cramps , and side-stitches that shall sew his breath up . " Next came a physician , who , naturally being , by professional right , the Sir Oracle of the assembly , // " spoke of the advantages the missionary in different climates might derive from a correct diet and a proper regimen . Their lives , he said , after entering upon their missionary labors , averaged only about eight years , whereas they might average twenty-four . " The average age to which missionaries have lived , within a given time and space , is no doubt a calculable thing ; though the inquiry , if extended over a sufficient range to be of any value , must needs have cost some pains . But by what resource of his art did the speaker ascertain , that , with a different treatment of themselves , missionaries might hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither twenty-three nor twenty-five ? It was learned , we presume , through the same channels of inquiry with plenty of other weighty matters , which in the course of this discussion were announced with the same easy confidence , and received with the same easy faith . The speaker plainly knew whom he had in hand , when he traced to the introduction of his specific the comparative mortality , in two successive years , at an Orphan Asylum in New York . " The year previous to the change in that institution , in 1833 , there was much sickness among the children , and thirty to forty deaths . The year after the change there were but three deaths , and two of those were idiot children received from the almshouse ; the other also came from the almshouse much diseased , and died very soon after entering the Asylum . " When we get up a Society , which we are projecting , for the encouragement of tornadoes , ( physical tornadoes we mean , - the raising of moral ones is already largely provided for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this occasion convened , we mean to illustrate the point in hand by calling attention to the fact , that the September of 1815 , that of the great gale , was extremely healthy in these parts , compared with that of 1817 , when the elements were in no such commotion . The third advocate of this resolution was an aged gentleman , of various experience . He had served his country in arms and in council . " At length he began to preach , but it was in great weakness . **** * Found that something must be done . At length he resolved to abandon all drinks but water , and to live chiefly VOL . XLVTT. - NO. ci . 49 // on gruel . He did not at this time wholly relinquish all flesh meats , but used them very sparingly . On this regimen he soon began to amend , and his constitution to recover its wonted vigor . He was finally able to perform the ordinary labors of a clergyman with great ease . From that time to the present , his health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great age , he is now able to preach three times on the Sabbath , and six times during the week . " Till better informed , we scruple to congratulate this gentleman 's flock on the abundance of his labors . We have awful misgivings , when we think of the nine weekly forthholdings of a preacher , in whose mind there has been established so close an association between sermons and watergruel . Passing over a dead mass of other twaddle , consisting partly of relations of personal experience , and partly of more metaphysical matter , we arrive at the second Resolution , which was as follows ; Resolved , that we view with deep regret the waste of human life from an abuse of medicine , through learned and unlearned quackery ; and that nothing will so soon arrest the progress of this alarming evil , as a correct knowledge of the science of human life . " No very perilous proposition , one would think , being plainly equivalent to another ; viz , that nothing will go so far to obstruct the consequences of bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , it was thought worthy of two speeches , one of which , says the editor of the " Proceedings , " contained " interesting remarks , " while the other was " in an interesting strain of remark and anecdote . " He regrets , however , that he has " received no notes . " We regret it too . The world is the loser . That part of the discussion must have been worth hearing , if the speakers honestly undertook to maintain the high argument , to which the Resolution bound them , though , in such a beating of the bush as must have ensued , we blame not the sharpest-scented reporters for being baffled . A letter of encouragement from Utica having been read , Mr. Graham , the Corypkeus of the enterprise , next took the floor . Sir , " said he , " a note has just been put into my hand , with a request that I will answer it before this Convention . // It states , that a popular preacher of this city , on Sunday morning last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of dietetics at the present day , affirmed , that those people who pay most attention to their diet , and are the most particular in their food and drink , are always the most unhealthy and feeble and miserable ; while those who pay no attention to their diet , but eat and drink every thing and any thing that comes before them , are always the most healthy and vigorous and happy . " We think it likely , that the " popular preacher " did not lay down his proposition in quite all this breadth . But we have no means of knowing who he was , and possibly he may be a person bitten with a sort of antagonist madness , and himself breaking ground for an association on extreme principles of his own . However this may be , we apprehend that most sensible people will be inclined to acknowledge , that there is a basis of truth in the first part of what he is represented to have maintained . We have supposed , that few things were better understood , than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavoidably to doom one 's self to an imperfect digestion . As a choice between evils , no doubt it is a course sometimes to be taken . A man who is in a poor way must needs avoid things which would make him worse , even though his very caution so to do should compel him to get better slowly . But the very vice of the position is , that , as soon as he begins to be curiously observant of his digestion , his digestion will begin to labor . Just as surely as there are nerves which go from the brain to the stomach , so certainly , we hold , he who , having deposited something in the latter receptacle , goes to bethinking himself about the manner of its reception there , will find that the gastric juice will poorly do its office . Some diet , no doubt , is better , and some worse ; but safer , we insist , to a well man , is a hearty , old-fashioned New England breakfast , including bacon and eggs , custards , cucumbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , with no thought about the matter , than a sipping of gruel with a Grahamite 's speculations and solicitudes . But to get away the soonest possible from this theory of ours , - for the very thought of a theory of diet makes us tremble for the result of our own next experiment in that way , - Mr. Graham seems to imagine , that he disposes of the argument of the erring // preacher , by a story which he tells of a family of four brothers . " Three possessed remarkably healthy and vigorous constitutions . They grew up to be more than ordinarily large , well-formed , and powerful men . They undoubtedly had constitutions , capable of sustaining life , under the most favorable circumstances , to the age of a hundred and forty or a hundred and fifty years . They ate and drank heartily of whatever they relished , without any regard to the effect of their dietetic habits on their health , and as a general fact enjoyed what is commonly called good health , most of their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , if I remember correctly , they fell short of this considerably ; so that they actually lived but about one half of the period of their constitutional capabilities . " To make a long story short , the other brother , of a more feeble constitution , by force of forswearing all but thin potations and mastications , arrived at the age of ninety-seven or ninety-eight ; nor then did he come fairly by his end , but through " disease brought on by exposure . " And the case of this family , says Mr. Graham , " will show what is true of the whole human race . " We perceive that Mr. Graham knows one thing , whatever else he may know or ignore . It is , that , first , allow a disputant to make his premises to his liking , and , secondly , allow him to determine for you what inferences they will sustain , and you have put him in a pretty fair way to work conviction on your mind . Three other resolutions followed . In speaking to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anatomy , physiology , and hygiene ' * into our colleges and schools , a venerable speaker , father of a gentleman honorably distinguished in public life , presented to the meeting the case of his son , ( whose name , to avoid mistake , is given by the editor in the margin , ) who " he did not doubt was a useful citizen , to some extent , even now ; but he was equally confident he would have been far more useful , had the education of his physical powers been duly attended to . " The second resolution , viz. " that a knowledge of the human structure shows , that there is no good reason why the vast majority of mankind should die an unnatural rather than a natural death , " appears to have passed sub silentio . It must be owned to be another tolerably safe proposition , and , upon its terms ( though of course more was meant than meets the // ear ) , about as insignificant as safe ; nobody ever having surmised , as far as we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to die , need the appliances of the bullet or the cord . - At this crisis , the just pent-up inspiration broke forth into a world of speech . Though the discussion became widely discursive , the man of straw which the champions understood themselves to be demolishing was as follows " Resolved , that the general impression , that there must be just such an amount of physical suffering in the world , be the mode of living what it may , is the offspring of gross and culpable ignorance , and a practical denial of the established laws and goodness of the Creator . " It is related of a valetudinarian divine in the South , that after a long pulpit exercise , being inquired of by his servant how he felt , and replying that he thought he was better , the humble friend rejoined , that he had hoped it would be so , when he saw that " master was getting so much wind off his stomach . " We are sure that some of the numerous participators in this portion of the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , grandiloquent , casuistical , and severe . " Twenty-five years of my life , " said he , " have been spent in constant suffering and pain . * * During all that time , I was the patron of physicians and druggists , swallowed all sorts of nostrums from learned and unlearned quackery , and , like the woman in the Scriptures , was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse . " Who can wonder ? - " .1111 disease and sickness is crime . " " Sir , we must throw the responsibility of each person 's health on himself , and make him alone feel accountable for it . " Avaunt , then , ye bed-ridden reprobates , whom only sentimental fools will pity and wish to succour . A gibbet for a cancerous eruption ; a dungeon and hard labor for life for a pulmonary tuberole ; imprisonment in the common gaol from thirty days to six months for a rheumatic shoulder , according to the aggravation of the offence . " Parents must be made to feel , that for the sickness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pretence , tearful mother , of regretting what you yourself have done , nor wear out the long watches of the night over the couch of your fevered child ; but away to the whipping-post , for a baggage as you are , and take the deserts of such as you . One is tempted to be made serious by such outrageous // extravagances , inharmonious as that mood would be with the spirit of the scene . One of the speakers who followed the President , ( bearing a different testimony to the effects of the wonder-working diet from that of his coadjutor , mentioned above , who rejoiced in a narrower waistband , ) reported , that he never was stronger , heavier , happier , or healthier in his life , " than he now was by the help of his spoon victuals while the last speaker , who possibly may have been selected for the purpose of conducting the lofty march of thought to its climax , said , " that he had repeatedly suffered extraordinarily organized man ! from the use of water , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead pipes ; and that he was confident , entirely so , bold asserter ! that many of the evils of human life might be traced to our own errors . " The meeting having broken up after the reading of two letters , - one of them ( horrescimus referentes ) from the " Principal of the Teacher 's Seminary " in a neighbour State , - and two or three pages of the sheet remaining unused , the editor treats us to a sketch of two speeches made by the arch-hierophant of these mysteries at another of these American meetings , that of the " American Physiological Society . " Of one of these the most salient point is , the proposition , that " experience , on which we all rely with full confidence , in almost all cases misleads and betrays ; * a proposition , which for any one , especially for the teacher of a system which professes to make experience its oracle , may pass for rather strong doctrine . In the other , we have the following delicious piece of nonsense , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of health and the science of physiology would effectually promote the agricultural and horticultural interests of the community . " Geology , mineralogy , chemistry , meteorology , botany , zoology , physiology , and other natural sciences , are of more immediate interest to the tiller of the ground than perhaps any other man ; and , when things are rightly understood and rightly ordered , such qualifications will be the ordinary attributes of our agriculturists . " " Our wheat , our rye , our corn , our potatoes , and every other vegetable substance entering into the food of man , are rendered more or less healthful according as our agricultural and horticultural operations are more or less in conformity with the physiological laws of our nature . " // " Agricultural and horticultural operations " we take to be long words , that mean ploughing , harrowing , raking , hoeing , watering , weeding , and such like . It would be worth an inquisitive man 's while to visit some place where he might see these things going on " in conformity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if at the plough-tail or on the manure-heap he should encounter a swain profound in as many sciences , as have names terminating with the Greek cadence which resounds through Mr. Graham 's burdened period , our sight-seer would be all the better paid for his trouble . The beginning and the end , the sum and substance , of all this lugubrious business , we take to be , that such substances as meal and water , or , on a larger interpretation , meal , potatoes , and apples , - for the doctors differ as to the degree of license , - make the nutriment on which physical , intellectual , and moral man is to thrive , if thrive he do at all ; and that , accordingly , certain teeth , fastened in the human jaw , and marking their possessor for a carnivorous creature , if not put there by mistake , were designed but to furnish him an occasion of the more meritorious self-denial . The dish that erst " ran away with the spoon " did a good thing for itself , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; knife and fork are obsolete abominations . The times of selfcomplacent Jack Homer are gone by ; nobody , while he eats Christmas pye , may henceforward give himself credit for a spark of goodness . As , in our innocence , we used to read our Bibles , the thriving of the holy children when they lived on pulse , yet rivalled in vigor and comeliness the sharers of Nebuchadnezzar s own board , was altogether contrary to nature , and was simply a miraculous result . We are to be better instructed now ; the elements of their rotundity and fair liking were in their generous food . Sterne thought he had added a touch to the picture of his prisoner 's discomfort when he threw in the water-cruse and crust . Nothing could be more mistaken , as presently the honest citizen will show ; he will take care to have such abuses righted , reclaiming those delicacies for himself , while the convict will be made to work through his time of durance on champagne and oysters , plum-pudding and roasted pig . We were brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of potatoes relished // with butter-milk . Sly rogues ! the laugh has been all along rightfully on their side . They wanted no competition , and so were too knowing to tell us how things stood ; now that we are wiser , we must count them the most enviable of nations , and grudge them all but their butter-milk , which is just so much de trop . But we must look higher yet . We dishonor such a great matter by regarding it with personal considerations . The interests of humanity are suspended on a pot-hook . The womb of events in the learned , the social , and the religious world , is the seething cauldron of the household hearth . The seminal principles of human progress are in the herb garden . All flesh is grass , and if man grows , it must be grass that expands him . If we could look upon such doings as mere matter of tomfoolery ) we should be quite content to pass them by . Nobody ought to find fault ( though these people do ) with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with them . " In this the patient must minister to himself ; " and , among reasonable people , it has long been a received truth , that " every man , at forty , is a fool or a doctor , " and , in the latter case , competent to some independent judgment in the matter . Even the getting together to enjoy a mutual comparison of symptoms and nostrums , if that were all , might not be without its use . It might find innocent occupation for active spirits of that class who love to tramp and shout , till the echoes are weary , in some sphere of the bigness of a wafer-box . The head of one of our Colleges , a few years ago , being asked why he did not put down a certain mountebank association among the students , replied , that he left it for a valve for the spirit of deviltry to escape through . So this , if all could end as it began , in " large discourse , looking before and after , " might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the morbidly excited impulsiveness of the day . But it would be flattering ourselves unreasonably , to suppose that such a meeting will alone suffice for the present satisfaction of its members , and that they will go away to be quiet till the time comes for another similar season of refreshment . The most immediate and palpable ill effects of the strong stimulants with which they have been plying one another , if not the most serious that need to be apprehended , are yet by no means of trifling amount . A person whimsical about his // diet is a standing nuisance wherever he is or goes . If an evil fate places you at his beard , you find your best comfort in the thought , that honceforward you will use greater circuinspection , and know beforehand whom you undertake to visit . If he becomes your guest , and can eat notbing which you set before him , compelling you to see that your hospitable intent is an ill odor in his nostrils , or if , meeting on common ground , he insists on entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a good relish are devouring , and the excellent virtue of his own different fare , - all the customary subjects of friendly converse being made to give way to this high theme , - you feel that the bee in his bonnet is to you little better than a nest of hornets . All this one can perhaps manage to put up with . But a sober man 's patience is more seriously tried , when he finds these schemers qualifying themselves as " reformed " persons , and accustoming their partisans ' to apply other terms of that language of mighty meaning , which belongs to virtue and vice , to the use or rejection of their vile cookery . And much more is coming hereafter , if they are to have their way . The end is by no means yet , as they give us ample warning . Already they have worked themselves into a paroxysm of enterprise . " The objects of this Convention , " said one speaker , " are second in importance to none of the moral and religious enterprises of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " avers another , " that are now presented to improve the condition of the human race , there is none that deserves more attention than this . " Already a brisk fire of abuse against dissentients , - that effective a*rent of reform ,  --  is opeiAed from this park of baby artillery , and the " ignorance of the multitude , the cowardice of lukewarm friends , and the avowed opposition of enemies " are in good set terms rebuked and defied . It is pity that people should be so turbulent and vituperative , especially at the beginning of their work . Courtesy is neither fish nor flesh , that they should throw it to the dogs and have none of it . " Fair words , " if ancient saws say true , " butter no parsnips " ; so that there was no need of eschewing such words for fear of coming too near to the pollution of animal fare . But so it is . The language of exaggeration , reproach , and menace , makes VOL . XLVII. - NO. ci . 50 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions . It nerves the timid who are already engaged , and browbeats the timid who are yet to be enlisted . Various pregnant hints , already thrown out , show , that they who enlist in this service are enrolling themselves for a long war ; and that it will not be for want of good will , on the part of the present movers , if the power of something , which is to call itself " public opinion , " is not tried to the uttermost for the regulation of private habits . There can scarcely be a deep so low in these matters , that a lower can not be found by such as are diligent in the quest . The host , which has introduced itself into the ovens and the kneading-troughs , has not yet followed up the assault of its leader upon the bedchamber ; but how soon that is to come to pass , who knows ? Our respected fellow-citizens , who , if the newspaper account of their festivity was correct , became so joyful upon the pure element a year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves already left far behind in the march of improvement , if we may judge from a diatribe , which we lately fell in with , on the inexpediency of opening the lips for the reception of any fluid whatever ; and , since " every thing which affects thequality of the soil and the character of its produce , has a most intimate relation not only to our health of body , but to the general well-being of man , " and since of course it belongs to associations and pledges to take care for the application of this principle , we may be pardoned for seeing , in gloomy perspective , the next step taken in mutual engagements , that the contracting parties will only prepare composts for their grounds in certain proportions , or boil their greens in water filtered , or boiled , or medicated , after some prescribed fashion , and that , - so suited themselves , - they will further raise an intolerable outcry after such as like better some other way . The truth is , the times are strangely and sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year round . Some plague there is in the atmosphere , which the chemists had best bestir themselves to detect , if they mean to have it remain in breathing condition . First came the Cholera , and that was bad enough . Then , for a year or two , people took to drowning , hanging , and shooting themselves , far and near , for any strange reason or none . Not less rabid now , if more harmless , they are forming societies and organizing conven // tions without end , for all sorts of folly and mischief-making , as well as many sorts of good . Who can tell what is to come of it ? Let us hope the best . Folly is a suicide , and there is a wise and kind Providence above us all.
