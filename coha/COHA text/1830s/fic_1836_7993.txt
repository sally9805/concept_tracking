Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE THREE SCEPTRES . A VISION . from The three sceptres ( 1836 ) ' Bring forth the sceptres of command ! '  --  That awful voice I heard  --  ' And let the subject nations stand ! '  --  The waiting world appeared . Then drew the sceptre-bearers nigh ; Old Asia , first , crept cowering by ; Then Europe , with her troubled eye , Then young America ; Each placed her sceptre , passed , and then , Unveiled before the sons of men , A sword , a crosier , and a pen Upon the altar lay . Again the voice uprose , and loud Like battle-cry it came , And wildly , from that heaving crowd , Echoed the shout  --  ' For Fame ! ' Brother ' gainst brother fiercely stood , The earth was graves , the seas were blood ,  --  Kingdoms were crushed , as wasting flood Had swept o'er crumbling clay ; Till ' mid the din a dove appeared ! The gentle tone of ' peace ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sword had passed away . Then like a storm of ashes hurled From the volcano 's height , A thick , dark cloud rolled o'er the world , Blotting mind 's heavenly light ; And men sunk down in utter dread , Mailed warriors weak as infant 's tread , And monarchs , with uncovered head , Stooped low the cowl before ; And superstition 's iron reign Has seared the heart and shrunk the brain  --  Ha !  --  thought 's strong grasp has rent the chain ;  --  The crosier 's sway is o'er ! Pure as the light on altar glows , Lit up by prophet 's prayer , A small , soft , steady light arose On earth , on sea , on air ; It shines as shed from seraph 's wings , Withering all vile , old , useless things  --  Like scorched flax from the grasp of kings The reins of empire sever ; It burns from craft his mask of night ; Intemperance blasts with perfect light , And shows the Ethiop 's soul is white  --  ' The pen  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its trumpet tone Burst like a swelling river ; From land to land went sounding on ' The pen  --  the pen forever ! ' I saw earth 's joyous millions move , Justice their shield , the banner love  --  While freedom 's eagle , high above , Soared with unslumbering eye ; Cool springs gushed forth ' mid arid sands , Bright flowers sprung up in desert lands , And bonds of peace , from angel hands , Were linking earth and sky .
