txt /q/nage. . /z/ A D l%Jkl S E M E N T /z/ The rapid and extensive sales of the two former editions of this work have encouraged the author to prepare a third . He has carefully revised this edition , and added three new plates , viz : Plate 64 on Imposts , and Plates 71 and 72 on Cornices . He feels confident it comprises as great a variety of useful matter as can be produced for the price at which it is afforded ; and he has not , as will be seen by a careful perusal , filled this work with useless pictures , and essays of unmeaning matter , more for show than utility : he therefore submits it to an enlightened public , after tendering his sincere thanks for their very liberal patronage of the two former editions , hoping to receive a share that may be due in this . /z/ The term Architecture is originally derived from the Greek language , in which it signifies the principal handcraft , or mechanical operation ; an expression very applicable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , few of the other practical arts could be desirable , or indeed of any value whatever . In the genial climates of the interior of Asia , where human beings first appeared , defence from the inclemency of the weather was not an object of research . Shelter from the intense rays of the sun , and from the torrents of rain peculiar to those climates ; protection from the wild beasts of the field ; the necessity of privacy , and complete separation from their fellow-creatiiMa ; these and other motives , which might easily be specified , wouW , nevertheless , render architecture , howewar rude and simple , one of the jearliest arts of life . To attempt to trace architecture back to iu origin would , therefore , be an idle enterprise . From the Hebrew Scriptures we learn , that it was arrived at considerable perfection , even under the second generation of mankind ; for there we learn , that Cain after the murder of his brother , withdrew from the habitation of his parents , and built a city in a remote quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudeness to refinement , is thus related by Vitruvius , whose celebrated treatise on architecture appeared in Italy in the reign of Augustus Caesar , about the beginning of the Christian era . His notions were formed on tradition and conjecture ; for the writings of Moses , which contain the most ancient account of the origin of the human race , and of human society , were either unknown , or generally disregarded in his time in Europe . * In the first times , ' says Vitruvius , ' men lived in woods and caves ; but at last , borrowing hints from the birds , which built their nests with equal ingenuity and industry , they began to form huts for themselves . These huts were , probably , at first conical , because that figure is of the most /z/ ll obvious construction composed of trees or branches fixed in a circle on the ground , and joined together in a point at the top ; the whole covered with reeds , leaves , and clay . Findings however , in the course of time , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , the form of the hut was changed to that of a cube , or of a parallelepiped . Marking out the space to be occupied by the Intended structure , they fixed in the ground uprightrunks of trees to form the sides , filling the intervab with branches closely interwoven , and covering the whole with clay . The sides being thus complejied , , r long beams were placed on the upright poats , which , being well joined at the angles , kept the aides firm , and likewise served to support the covering , or roof of the building , composed of other beams , on which were laid beds of reeds , leaves , and clay . When the art of constructing habitations was so far advanced , men bethought themselves of methods of rendering their dwellings not only commodious for present use , but elegant and durable . They stripped the bark and other inequalities from the trunks and branches employed in the walls , raised them above the damp ground , by placing them on fiat stones , and covered each post with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spaces between the ends of the joists were closed with clay , and the ends of the joista themselves were covered with thin boards , cut in the form of what are.called triglyphs . The position of the roofs was also altered : being flat , they were ill calculated for throwing off the rain ; they were therefore raised up in the middle , so as , with the horizontal beams connecting the uprights of the walls , to form a triangular pediment or gable . From these simple elements , architecture took its beginning ; for when wood was found inconvenient for constructing durable dwellings , and men set themselves to erect more solid and extensive buildings , of clay dried in the sun , or stone , they still imitated the fds of those parts which necessity bad originally introduced The upright /z/ posts , with the flat stones under and above them , were converted into columns with their bases and capitals ; the beams , rafters , and layers of materials composing the roof , were gradually improved into architraves , friezes , triglyphs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' - So far Vitruvius . It may be further remarked that in many countries , among the rudest tribes of men , excavations and fissures of rocks , hollows of trees , and caves of the earth , have served as habitations . Travellers inform us ofa tree growing in Africa , the hollow of which affords a habitation for thirty negro families ; which is said to be the largest tree in the world . They also inform us of a subterraneous city or cave , occupied by moors , in which there are several hundred inhabitants . Armstrong , in his * Journal of travels , in the seat of war between Russia and Turkey , ' has the following observations : * The Georgian , or Tartar dwellings are seldom to be found above ground : the tops are covered with beams of wood , branches of trees , and above all , with a coat of earth , which make them level with the ground . The natives are frequently disturbed , when sitting jound the fire , by the leg of some unfortunate cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not unconuaon for the lambs to fall through , and spoil whatever may happen to be cooking . ' But among a civilized people , the desire of seeking for more agreeable habitations must be soon felt . The nature of the climate and the materials which it more leadily afforded , regulated , in a great degiee , the construction of the first buildings in which men sheltered themselves . According to Diodorus Siculus , the first buildings of Palestine were of reeds and canes interwoven , and so compact as not to admit of the rain and wind . Wood appears to be a material so proper for building and so easily wrought , that men would , in all ages , employ it for these purposes , in places where it could be easily procured . The branches of trees , stuck in the ground and rudely interwoven , formed a material for constructing them . It is probable that this method of setting trees on end and binding them together at the top and bottom , first gave rise to the idea of base and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay and covered over with leaves and turf , they presented t model of those cabins , in which , according to Vitruvius , the earliest tribes of men were accustomed to dwell . At first , before men became acquainted with edgetools of iron , trees were felled by means of fire , or by axes made of sharp stones . They undermined the trees by little at a time , by continuing a fire at their roots ; and by the same means they could divide a tree into the requisite length . By degrees , however , tools for cutting and smoothing wood , were invented : the tools for smoothing were at first nothing more than sharp stones , sufficiently hard and free from brittleness . Some of our North American Indians make use of the same kind of tools at the present time . ' The use of bricks or masses of clay formed in moulds and dried in the sun , or baked in stoves , as the materials of buildings , is of very great antiquity , and is a sufficiently obvious invention/ According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks : Go to , let us make BRICKS , and bum them thoroughly ; and they had brick for stone , and slime had they for mortar - Gen. ch. xi . v. 3 . Pliny informs us that in the most remote ages of the Egyptians , they made use of bricks for building their houses , and tiles for covering them . To employ stones for the same purpose was very natural , where they were abundant , and found in masses sufficient to be removed by manual dexterity . Architecture is arranged in different orders , according to the nations by whom , or the country in which it was originally employed ; such as the Greek , the Roman , the Saxon , the Norman , the Saracenic or Arabian , the Gothic , &c.; The Greek architecture is divided into the Doric , the Ionian , and the Corinthian , so named from the inventors , or from those parts of Greece , or of the Grecian colonies in Asia Minor , where each kind first appeared . Roman , or Italian architecture was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being employed , as it is said , by the ancient inhabitants of Tuscany , and the last being a later improvement adopted by the Romans , compounded of the two Greek orders , thoJonic and the Corinthian . When architecture was in its glory in ancient Greece , the Ionic was the favorite order , as being the most graceful , light , and elegant . Of this order were the temple of the Delphic oracle , the temple of Apollo , at Miletus , and the temple of Diana , at Ephesus : The Ionic then , with decent matron grace , Her airy pillar heaved . ' Afler the Ionic , the Corinthian was introduced , which , in attempting greater perfection , has deviated from the true simplicity of nature . It marked an age of luxury and magnificence , when pomp and splendor had become the predominant passion , but had not yet extinguished the taste for the sublime and beautiful . Attempts were made to unite all these characters , but a chastened judgment is not satisfied ; a corrupted taste is only pleased : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * In the Composite order this deviation is more remarkable : this was invented by the Italians , and although rich and profuse in its ornaments , discovers an obvious want of correct taste and judgment , and shows that the Greeks /z/ had exhausted all the principles of grandeur and beauty , in the original orders . And in these , they had arrived at the acme of perfection , because the Composite could not possibly have been introduced without combining all the rest ; consequently , simplicity is destroyed ; which is in conformity with nature , and the great concomitant of beauty . It is said this order was first used hy the Romans in their triumphal arches , to show their dominion over the people whom they conquered. * An order in architecture consists of two principal parts , the column and the entablature , or parts supported by the column . Of these two principal parts , each consists of three subdivisions ; those of the column are the base on which it rests , . the shaf , or tall tapering portion , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the entablature are first , the architrave , then the frieze , and above all , the cornice . Each of the smaller parts is again subdivided and distributed in various ways , according to the orders to which they belong , as existing in antique monuments , but more frequently according to the taste and * An anonymouB writer on the history of architecture observes , that the Art is supposed to have arrived at its glory in the time of Augustus Cssar ; but was , as well as other polite arts , neglected under Tiberius . Nero , indeed , notwithstanding his vices , retained an ancommon passion for Architecture ; but luxury and dissoluteness had a greater share in it , than real magnificence . In the time of Trajan , Apollodotus excelled in the art ; by which he obtained the favor of that prince , and erected that famous pillar called ' Trajan 's , * which is remaining to this day . But after this time , Architectnre began to decline , though it . was for some time supported by the care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the western empire , and sunk into corruption . All the most beautiful monuments of antiquity were destroyed by the ravages of the Visigoths , and from that time , Architecture became so coarse and artless , that these professed Architects were totally ignorant of just designing , wherein the whole beauty of Architecturb consists : hence a new manner of Architecture called Gothic , took its rise . Charlemagne industriously labored for the restoration of Architecture ; and the French applied themselves to it with success , under the encouragemant of Hugh Capet . His son Robert prosecuted the same design of modern Architecture , and by degrees , ran into as great an excess of delicacy , as the Goths had before done of massiveness . To those we may add the Arabesks and Moresk or Moorish Architecture , which were much of the same nature with the Gothic , except that as the former wore brought from the north , by the Goths and Vandals , the latter was brought from the south by the Moors and Saracens . The Architects of the thirteenth , fourteenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture , seemed to make perfection consist wholly in the delicacy and multitude of ornaments , which they lavishly bestowed on their buildings , but frequently without conduct or taste . In the two last centuries , the Architects of Italy and France assiduously endeavored to retrieve the primitive simplicity and beauty of ancient Architecture ; nor did they fail of success , - insomuch that now most churches , palaces , &c.; are built entirely afWr the antique . fancy of the authors who have written on the subject of architecture . The principal character of the various kinds of architecture depending on the column and its requisite accompaniments , the whole is commonly and almost universally divided into five species or orders , viz. the Tuscan , the Doric , the Ionic , the Corinthian , and the Composite . This distribution and arrangement would seem to have been founded on the progressive proportion , strength and ornament of the orders ; they are , however , well calculated to mislead the student and the architect , in tracing the origin and gradual advancement of each order . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above orders , it is sufficient for us to know , that the Greeks employed only the Doric , the Ionic , and the Corinthian ; and that the Tuscan and Composite , were only used in Italy ; the one more rude and the other more ornamented than the Greek orders , which occupied a middle rank . To attain , therefore a proper knowledge of the principles of architecture , the student ought to confine himself to tha three Greek orders , not only because in them these pcjji ciples are the most displayed , but because of all th monuments of antiquity which have subsisted to nrodern times , few , perhaps none , can be pointed out in ' ' which the Roman or Italic mode of construction i certainly to be traced . In architecture , various terns are employed in a peculiar sense , of which the followyig are the chief ; - Column is a Latin word signifying , in general , a pillar or supporter of some superincumbent load ; but is now confined to a round pillar , smaller above than below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which it was originally drawn . When the pillar is not round and tapering , but square and of equal dimensions above and below , it is called a pilaster . The column consists of three principal divisions : 1st , the base , from the Latin term basis , the foundation on which any thing rests : 2d , the shaft , or circular tapering portion ; and 3d , the capital , from the Latin term for the head , or the principal member . The base is subdivided into different small parts , according to the order to which the column belongs ; but all the lowermost part is the plinth , from the Greek term for a brick , because the ancient bricks were in general about square , and comparatively thin , resembling our paving bricks or tiles . Above the plinth lay the torus , a round moulding resembling a rope , so called in Greek , and imitating the band tied round the bottom of the original tree , as the plinth did the flat brick or stone on which it stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two members was sometimes introduced a hollow channel , called scotia , from the Greek word for darkness , because little light could enter it . /z/ The colamn was generally quite plain and smooth in its whole length ; bat in baildings where ornament is particalarly admitted , the shaft was cut into a succession of small perpendicular channels , resembling the inside of a pipe or flute cut lengthwise into two parts ; hence the shaft is ceiled Jluted , In some instances one third part of the fiutings from the bottom , was , as it were , filled up with the half of a round rod lying in the hollow . It is singular , that although the fiutings may have been originally intended as ah imitation of the natural hollows of the bark of a tree , and might therefore be expected in the earliest productions of architecture , it is only in the more improved works that fluted columns are to be found . The capital is variously subdivided and ornamented in the different orders ; simple in the Doric , more ornamented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , however , a narrow moulding runs through the shaft , near the upper end called the astragal , because it seemed to occupy the position of the upper bone of the neck . Because the word astragal also means , in the Greek , the heel , Ihu in some treatises on architecture most ridiculously called oy thai name . The uppermost member of the capital is the abacus , po called , as being broad and thin , like the board or tablet mofifoyed by the ancients in arithmetical calculations . /z/ The volute is an ornament introduced in the Ionic order , being , as its Latin word implies a spiral scroll , imitating the ends of some flexible substance loosely rolled up . The capital of the Corinthian order is encirded by rows of leaves of different sorts . The parts which rest upon , and are supported by the columns , are comprehended under the general name of the entablature , because , agreeable to the meaning of the term tabula , in Latin , they consist of boards , planks , or stone slabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound of three principal parts , first the architrave , next the frieze and uppermost the cornice . The architrave is so called by a name Partly Greek and partly Latin , as being the principal beam which , resting on the capitals of the columns , supports the remaining parts of the entablature . In some cases it is plain , in others it is broken in two or three pieces , like so many separate beams lying on each other . The frieze consists of one piece , but commonly enriched with sculpture of different sorts . In the Doric order , this ornament consists of two whole channels , and two half channels , forming one , if joined together , and therefore called by a Greek name triglyphs , or three hollows . The square spaces between the successive triglyphs are called metopes , a term expressing the hollow open spaces between the beams , the ends of which are represented by the triglyphs . In these metopes are sometimes represented the head of some divinity , the skull of some animal used in sacrifice , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building on which the ornaments were introduced . The cornice , from the French comiche , and the Latin corona , is so called because , being the uppermost part of the entablature , it crotens the whole architectural distribution of the columns ; and it is divided and ornamented in different ways , according to the order employed . 1 . The first Grecian order in point of antiquity is the Doric , so named from the Dores , a small tribe in Greece , or , as some say , from Dorus , an Achaian chief , who first employed that order in erecting a temple to Juno at Argos . In all the most perfect specimens of this order now remaining , the column springs immediately from the foundation , having no base properly so called , but only a small swelling round the bottom , resembling what we see at the root of a tree , and sufficient to show that we see the whole of the shaft . The base , we learn from Vitruvius , first appeared in the Ionic column . The Doric column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong ; the entablature placed upon it , is , of course , more massive than that of the other orders , being in height one-fourth part of the total height of the column . 2 . The Ionic order derives its name from the tones , a Greek people on the east coast of the Archipelago , whose capital was Ephesus , celebrated on many accounts , but particularly for the magnificent temple of Diana . This admirable structure was in length 425 feet , and in breadth 220 6et : it was surrounded on all sides by a double range of marble columns , 70 feet in height , and consequently 7 feet 9 1-2 inches in diameter at the bottom . The Ionic column is taller than the Doric , containing 9 diameters , or 18 modules ; and , although simple , is nevertheless graceful and majestic . If the Doric were meant to represent the manly robust figure of Hercules , the Ionic might properly be the emblem of the dignified simplicity and elegance of Diana . In this order , as has been already observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ornament peculiar to the Ionic column is the volute , or spiral scroll already mentioned , which is described by a succession of portions of circles , drawn from different central points . The height of the whole entablature is 2-6ths of that of the column , being the medium between that of the Doric , which is 2-8ths , and that of the Corinthian which is 2-lOths . The height of the base is one module , or half the diameter of the shaft . 3 . The Corinthimn order took its rise in the flourishing days of Corinth , a celebrated city commanding the communicaiion of the peninsula of Peloponnesus , with the continent of Greece . The beautiful foliage of the capital of /z/ this order is traced back to the following incident . A young lady of Corinth dying , her nurse carried her playthings in a basket , the day after her funeral , and placed it on the grave . The basket , coverea with a flat tile , was placed accidentally on the stem of the plant acanthus , which , sending out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned downwards when they peached the tile . This object struck the fancy of a celebrated sculptor of those days , Callimachus , who immediately introduced a figure of it on the top of an elegant column of his invention . Thus the capital of the Corinthian column always resembles a deep narrow basket covered with a tile , and completely sorrounded by foliage . Such is the account given by Vitruvius ; but later writers on architecture have imagined they coulddiscover this ornamented capital , in the description given of the Temple erected by Solomon , in Jerusalem ; with this difference , that there , the foliage represented branches of the palm , and not the leaves of the acanthus . It is , however , to be observed , that the foliage of the Corinthian capital , is frequently an imitation of the leaves , not of the acanthus , but of the olive , and of other plants , according to the taste of the architect . The Corinthian column is in height 10 diameters , or 20 modules , of which tie base is 1 module @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shafl measures 16 2-3 modules . The entablature is 1-5 of the column . 1 . The Italic order is called the Tuscan , as having been employed by that ancient people , once very powerful in Italy . It is , however , remarkable , that no vestiges now exist of any building in which the Tuscan column was em- ployed to support an entablature , or any other weight . Vitruvius , it is true , gives instructions for erecting temples according to this order ; but it does not appear that such edifices were actually erected . The only examples of the use of the Tuscan column that have come down to our times , are the admirable monuments still subsisting in their original perfection , the column of Trajan aud Antonius , in Rome , and the column of Theodosius , in Constantinople . The column erected to the honor of Trajan , ( next to Julius Csesar , perhaps the most valuable of the Roman emperors , ) who flourished a century after Christ , is in all 118 feet high . The shafl of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameters , each J 1 feet 2 inches . The pedestal supporting the column is a cube of S modules ; the base is 1 module , and the capital 2-3 module . - On the capital is another pedestal on which stood a colossal statue of Trajan : but this was removed , and one of St. Peter now occupies the same place . The other column , commonly said to have been erected to Antonius , is of the same kind , but a little smaller ; it now supports the statue of St. Paul . The magnificent , but unhappily situated column , /z/ or monument , erected* in London , to commemorate the dreadful conflagration , which in 1666 , laid waste the greater part of that city , although copied from those in Rome , and of considerably larger dimensions , is not properly Tuscan , but a fluted Doric . 2 . The other Italic order is called the Composite , because it seems to be a combination of the Ionic and the Corinthian orders , to which last it bears the greatest resemblance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volute in the capital , in addition to the Corinthian foliage . A specimen of the Composite order , richly ornamented , is to be seen in the triumphal arch , of which are represented in scripture , the golden candlestick of seven branches , and other precious articles , carried away from the last temple of Jerusalem . Besides columns , properly so called , which are always circular , another kind of pillar called pilasters , are frequently employed , especially where a great weight is to be supported . The plan of a pilaster is usually a square ; but those , the plan of which is a parallelogram , are also introduced . The chief use of pilasters is to support arch Thus the piers of a bridge are in fact short pilasterAxJne arches separating the nave from the side-aisle ji. aurs church in London , and of St. Peter 's inJfcme , are supported on pilasters . In some buildingp , ntis true , wo find ranges of arches supported on 9glum of even the delicate Corinthian order ; but as ourans are of a tapering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and as this diminution is increased in the eyes of the spectator , by the distance of the upper part , the columns have a slender , and even a feeble appearance , and consequently are ill adapted for supporting an arch . On the other hand , pilasters being of equal dimensions all over their height , and very short in proportion to their diameter , possess a solidity and strength capable of bearing arches of the greatest weight and magnitude . By pilasters we also mean an ornament applied to walls , internal and external , resembling in parts and form , a column , but flattened instead of round . Pilasters of this sort have their base , shaft and capital , and are plain or fluted , according to the architectural order to which they belong . It is a matter still unsettled whether such a pilaster ought to diminish in breadth , like a column , or to retain the suae breadth above and below , like a solid pier . Pilasters usually project one fourth part of their breadth from the wall to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised from the ground , and on pedestals ; a construction not withiut its propriety in certain cases , as in our churches , where the galleries rest upon pilasters and the fronts of the gallery coincides with the pedestal of the column which rises to the roof . Pedestals are by no means essential to columns or pilasters ; /z/ bat when employed , they mast be formed and ornamented , conformably to the order of the columns they support . Columns are placed at different distances , according to their destination , and the spaces between them are termed inUrcolumniations . This separation in the Greek orders , varies ftom one diameter and a half of the lower end of the column to four diameters ; but if the Tuscan column were employed , the architrave being supposed to consist of beams of timber , the intercolumniation may be much wider than if it consisted of blocks of stone . That interval , however , between columns , which has received the sanction of the best monuments of antiquity , and of the most judicious architects , is equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence it is called Eustyle , from two Greek terms ; expressing the proper arrangement of columns . The latter term , stylos , a column , enters into the composition of several other architectural terms , as pycnostyle , to express columns placed close together ; prostyle , a number of columns placed as in a portico , before the en trance , front of a building , of which we have examples in Pi0ndon , in the churches of St. Marti n-in-the-Fields , of Hanover square , of St. George , Bloomsbury , in imitatioPltAfjicient edifices in Rome , &c.; When ranges of columns argrried quite round the outside of a building , they form a peilityle . Arches may perhaflu h considered less magnificent than ranges of columns ; but they are very solid , and liable to few accidents . The importance of arches , in affording a commodious passage over a river , needs no illustration . It has long been the practice to construct bridges of arches increasing in width , and consequently in height , from each end to the middle , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The arches have also been generally semicircles . The practice was first laid aside in France , where many noble bridges are now to be seen , consisting , like the ancient Greek and Roman , of arches , all of the same span or width , and the same height ; so that the road is carried on a level all the way along the bridge . In order to keep the bridge low , the arches vary greatly from a semi-circle , being segments of circles of large diameter . Nay , in some instances in France , the arches are portions of ellipses , and not circular , by which measure the crown of the arch is kept very low . On this most improved plan , a bridge is constructed in London , over the Thames , between Blackfriars ' and Westminster bridges , which , for excellence of materials and structure , for magnificent simplicity and extent , is , perhaps without a parallel in Europe . It consists indeed of only 9 equal elliptic arches ; but each is of 120 feef span ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the length of the bridge 1280 feet , very nearly a quarter of a mile , on the same level line from one end to the other . To enable the reader to form some judgment of the properties of this work , ( called the Strand bridge , because it leads into that street , on the west side of Somerset place , ) the following account of some other remarkable bridges is given . Of the adjoining communications over the Thames , London bridge , consists of 19 arches and is in length 915 feet ; Blackfriar 's bridge consists of 9 arches , and is 995 feet long ; and Westminster bridge , consisting of 15 arches , is in length 1223 feet . The celebrated bridge over the Loire at Tours in France , is horizontal , consisting of 15 elliptic arches , and in length 1335 feet The bridge over the Moldaw at Prague , the capital of Bohemia , is in length 1700 feet . But these are all far surpassed in length by the antique bridge over the rapid Rhone , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , constructed on a multitude of small arches , extends to the length of 3000 feet ; possessing this singularity , that instead of being straight , it consists of two lines of direction , ineet ing in the river at a very obtuse angle , pointed up against the stream , as if the better to resist its violence . In various edifices , ancient and modern , we find columns and arches placed in ranges one above another . In such works , care must be taken that the more massive are made to support the more slender ; placing first the Doric order , next the Ionic , and above all the Corinthian or Composite . In this arrangement , the upper diameter of the superior column is usually made equal to the lower diameter of the inferior column ; giving the succession of columns the air of one tall tapering tree , cut into so many separate portions . The most remarkable edifices of antiquity , which have subsisted with tolerable entireness to our days , are temples of various sorts . The structure of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seldom of great dimensions . Some have a portico of columns at the entrance , and the external walls plain or adorned with pilasters . Older temples , however , are surrounded on all parts by a single , and even by a double range of columns , supporting the architrave , frieze and cornice , together with the roof ; so that the temple itself is in a manner concealed from the view , and receives no light but from the entrance . Such a construction is evidently very ill adapted to the purposes of a Christian , and especially of a Protestant place of worship . It has nevertheless been imitated in many magnificient structures , with some alterations , and the addition of projections in each of the long aides , for the purpose of resembling the cross , the emblem of the Christian faith . According to the system of divine service which , for many centuries , has prevailed in the Roman Catholic worship , the sacred offices may be conducted , without mutual interference , in sundry parts of the church at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutheran , Cal- /z/ Tinistic , or AnglicaD , in which nothing is done as it were in secret , and in which every member of the congregation is to hear , and participate in every part of the service , sacred edifices must , to be useful , be limited in magnitude and form . To be satisfied of the truth of this observation , it will be quite sufficient to enter St. Paul 's church , in London , at a time when service is performing . A comparatively small portion of that grand structure is set apart for the congregation , while the great body of the building presents the appearance of a vast useless void , neither applied , nor indeed applicable to any purpose of the Protestant worship . The same observation belongs to the most ancient Gothic Cathedrals ; but these were constructed with a very different view . The columns of the portico , and pilasters of the body of St. Peter 's , at Rome , reach at once from the ground to the attic ; but in St. Paul 's , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ranges of columns and pilasters : an arrangement , which , by breaking the whole into a repetition of small parts and nembers , counteracts the effect which would be produced by the great dimensions of the edifice , were it adorned with columns , occupying the whole height of the building . On the other hand , the intervals between . the grand columns of the portico of St. Peter 's having been built up into two stories of arcades and balconies , to accommodate the Pope in certain ceremonies , the effect of the portico is destroyed ; and instead of one open range of lofij pillars , the eye is offended to see them half sunk , as it were , into a wall , the use of wliieh is by no means at first sight apparent ; From this material defect , the front of St. although broken into two ranges of pillars , is fortunately free . Columns grouped , or placed two and two together , have always a bad effect ; for they suggest to the observer the idea that single columns have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak for their load , another set of columns had been placed beside them , to take off a part of the burthen . Grouped or double columns are wholly a modern invention ; nothing of the kind being found in any antique work , and although they were employed by the first-rate architects , who constructed the celebrated colonnade of the palace of the Louvre in Paris , the front portico of St. Paul 's , the entrance into Somerset Place in London , d &c,; the grouping of columns is , nevertheless , a departure from the genuine rules of the art . Instead of different ranges of columns , it is usual to throw the ground-floor of an edifice into the form of a basement , on which rise the columns or pilasters to ornament the front . This basement ought never to be less in height than half the length of the order it supports . Basements are generally rusticated ; that is , the stones are cut and placed so as to resemble the rude blocks as they are supposed to rise from the quarry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment and taste of the architect will be displayed . In London we have examples of the judicious employment of rusticated walls , and of the very reverse . The huge ponderous masses , apparently in all their native rudeness , composing the exterior of Newgate prison , admirably indicate and characterize the nature of the edifice . The less rude , it is true , but still rusticated walls of Carlton-house , are , on the contrary , equally incongruous with the delicate , and richly ornamented portico , and with the purposes to which that structure is appropriated . When a building is divided into different floors or stories , it seems proper that each story should have its separate range of columns or pilasters , which then appear each to support the entablature , and the projecting timbers of the superincumbent floors . When , on the contrary , two and even three tiers of windows are all included in the height of one range of columns or pilasters , the want of use , and even of connection , in columns of such a length , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of columns , surmounted with their prober entablature , supports the end of a roof , a triaqoql siace is formed , called the pediment : the two inGJea sides being finished agreeably to the cornice below them , the inclosed triangular space or tympanum is with historic or emblematic sculpture . Pedfinents on a small scale , triangular or as arches of rcles , ire frequently placed alternately over winows in modem buildings ; and instances of the same intermixture are not wanting in vestiges of ancient structures . The most proper proportion of a pediment , whether triangular or circular , is to make its perpendicular height from one fifth to one fourth part of the base . The preceding observations belong to the Grecian and Roman systems of architecture ; but another system , conducted on very different ideas , and of which many specimens of admirable contrivance and execution , still adorn the principal states of Europe , namely the Gothic , remains to be noticed . The term is often improperly employed to express every mode of construction , not reducible to the ancient Grecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Normans , in the northern and middle parts , and by the Saracens or Moors from Africa , in the southern parts of Europe , arc often confounded under the general name of Gothic , with tiiose to which that name properly belongs . This last species of building is supposed to have first appeared in England , after the conquest , in the reign of Henry the 2d , who died in 1189 ; introduced most probably from Normandy , and other parts of France , where splendid monuments of Gothic architecture are very common . /z/ On the origin of the Gothic mode of building , ingenious men have varied much in opinion ; and even on the origin of the name . The Goths were , in early times , the inhabitants of Sweden ; but in the decay of the Roman empire , they , with other northern tribes , invaded , and even over-run all the southern parts of Europe , even to the Straits of Gibraltar . Ignorant of every art but that of war , the science and skill introduced into those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually assumed forms unknown to the Romans and the Greeks . Hence buildings , constructed on principles different from those of antiquity , came to be distinguished as Gothic ; not because the Goths alone were their founders , but because the Goths and their neighbors , the Vandals , having established a regular succession of Kings in Spain , their name became more famous than that of any other northern race . The Saxon , Norman , and Gothic styles of architecture , though nearly related in sundry particulars , have still each its peculiar character . The Saxon and Normap agree in this , that the form of building is in both the same ; the pillars ar round , or polygonal , and very short , massive , and strong ; but the iMc and heads of the doors and windows are semi-circular. % . Jf , in these particulars , any difference be found , it consists in he superior massiveness and large dimensions of the NoriiuuB architecture . The Saxon churches , of which sundry examples , or parts at least , have remained to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but generally of moderate size . Those erected by the Normans , on the other hand , were usually large and magnificent , carried up to a great height , with two , and even three ranges of pillars , one above the other , of various dimensions , but connected by circular arches . In the centre , was a lofty tower , with two others at the west end , where was the principal entrance . In the course of time , however , the Normans introduced pillars of a much more agreeable fotm , tall and slender . In England , the Saxon and Norman styles are generally found mixed in the same building ; the latter , introduced in the twelfth century , being ingrafted on the former , which had been in use for centuries preceding . The principal marks by which the true Gothic architecture is distinguished , are its projecting buttresses around the exterior of the building , its pinnacles and spires , its large branching windows , its niches , its canopies , and sculptured angels , saints , and kings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , the arch always more or less acutely pointed . As plainness and solidity constitute the leading features of the Saxon and Norman buildings , so the Gothic architecture is distinguished by the lightness of the work , the lofty boldness of its elevationthe peculiar slenderness of its pillars , the profuse and delicate richness of its ornaments , and , we must add , the astonishing excellence of the masonry . In inquiries into the origin of the proper Gothic style of building , we meet with no less genius and fancy than in similar inquiries concerning the Greek orders , and much greater variety of sentiment . Some writers imagine the Gothic style was brought into England by the crusaders , on their return from the Holy Land , and other parts of the east ; and think that this style should be called Saracenic . Others woufd call it Moresque , as having been introduced into Spain by the Moors . On the other hand , the pointed arch , which characterizes the Gothic , is by some traced to the intersection of two semi-circles , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch being described from the end of the diameter , and passing through the centre of the other . Such an intersection would form an angle of 60 " , and lines from it to the other extremities of the arches , would , of course , form an equilateral triangle ; a form certainly not unfrequent in Gothic buildings . The scheme , however , which has gained the most general assent , is , that the Gothic is derived from the ancient practice of religious ceremonies being performed in groves of lofty trees . The eye being accustomed to contemplate the arches formed by the branches of trees that shadetitheir altars , and sheltered their assemblies , it was natural , when covered buildings succeeded to the groves as places of worship , that men should endeavor to introduce some similitude between them and those places in which they had been accustomed so long to perform their religious ceremonies . Accordingly we find , not only the intersecting arches , formed by the branches , exactly imitated by the pointed arch , but also the stems of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Gothic cathedral . Indeed , no attentive observer ever viewed a regular avenue of well grown trees , intermixing their branches over head , but it presently put him in mind of the long vista through a Gothic church ; or ever entered one of the larger and more elegant edifices of this kind , but it presented to his imagination an avenue of lofty trees , intermingling their branches over his head .. Under this id ea of so extraordinary a species of architecture , all the irregular transgressions of art , all the monstrous offences against nature , as some men speak , disappear ; everything has its reason , everything is in order , and a harmonious whole arises from the studious application of means proper and proportioned to the end . For , could the arches be otherwise than pointed , where the workmen were to imitate the curve made by two opposite trees , by their mutual insertion into one another ? Could the columns be otherwise than split into distinct shafls , when they to were represent the stems of a clump of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they formed the spreading ramifications of the stonework in the windows , and the stained glass in the open interstices ; the one to represent the branches , and the other , the leaves of an opening grove : both concurring to preserve that gloomy light , which , in the greater number of men , inspires religious awe and veneration . Hence we see the reason of their studied aversion to apparent solidity in these stupendous masses of building , deemed so absurd by men accustomed to the apparent , as well as real strength of Grecian architecture ; for the surprising lightness of the Gothic building , united with real strength , was necessary to complete the execution of their original idea of a sylvan temple . The origin of Gothic architecture here pointed out , has been very happily illustrated and exemplified by Sir James Hall , in a dissertation published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh , and in a subsequent separate publication on the same curious subject , well worthy of attention . In the architecture of the Greeks and Romans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the Gothic , the column is seldom , if ever diminished in diameter ; nor do we find any fixed proportion between the diameter and the height of the column , * nor is the intercolumniation , or space between any two pillars , regulated by the diameter of their height . Examples of the widest difference in the intercolumniations are common ; for instance , in the nave of the cathedral of York , and in the aisles of the conventual church of Newark-upon-Trent ; both edifices deservedly admired , but widely differing in the proportions of their columns , and the intervals between them . The Gothic column not being diminished above , and having no entablature , is the better suited , in point of stability , to support the arch springing immediately from it , as only a continuation of one half of the column . An arch springing from a Greek or Roman column , has always , as was before observed , an unfavorable effect . The striking impression iof a Gothic structure is produced by taking in the whole in all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often arises from contemplating the elegance and fine proportions of its several parts . On viewing a Gothic building , we soon perceive how admirably the parts are constructed for the eye to embrace the whole . The column is generally an assemblage of vertical mouldings , or a bundle of rods , inclosing a tall slender post or trunk of a tree , acting as a conductor to the eye . The capitals present little or no interruption to the sight , which glides up along the pointed arch , and embraces the whole upper portion of the edifice . One of the vertical rods , forming the column , pierces through the capital , and ascends to the roofy and from it spring the ribs of the vaulting . The exterior of a Gothic edifice has an effect similar to that of the interior ; the vertical rods of the columns run up to the top of the pediment and the terminating pinnacle , and the pyramidal buttresses on the outside , produce similar effects on the eye of the beholder . GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE CONSTKtJCTlOIJ OF /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined . For dwellings , the position ought to be sufficiently elevated to be free from damps and noxious vapors ; but at the same time not exposed to the wintry blasts . The neighborhood of fens , marshes , and stagnating waters , should always be avoided ; but water for domestic uses should always be easily and plentifully attainable . When a full southern aspect can not be procured , the next best is a western , for the heat is always greater , at equal distances from noon , in the aflernoon , than in the morning . With respect to the ground to be built upon , it should be carefully examined by boring or sinking pits . Stone or gravel afford the best foundations , but if these be not of considerable thickness , dependence ought not in all cases to be placed upon such soils . If , however , it becomes necessary to found upon sandy , or upon marshy , boggy ground , the foundation mutt be secured by piling , planking , laying large ledges , or other contrivances of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect or builder prepares plans of the intended edifice , general and particular , with elevations of the fronts and ends , not drawn as they would appear to the eye of a spectator , agreeably to the rules of perspective , but according to their several dimensions as measured on a given scale . To the plans of each separate story must be added sections in length and breadth of the whole building , to show the elevation of the internal parts . As , however , no building can ever appear to the eye in the precise form of a geometrical elevation upon paper , and as it requires considerable skill and practice to be able , from such an elevation , to form a judgment of the appearance of the edifice when actually erected , it is most satisfactory , and indeed , but just to the proprietor , to furnish him with views of the intended structure frovi different points of sight , accompanied by its attendant outbuildings , shrubbery , d &c.; such as they may be expected to be when brought to perfection . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor has beheld with disgust or mortification the completion of a residence on which vast sums were expended , and the architect has very unjustly been blamed ; nay , in some cases , ruined in his business , in consequence of such vexations and disappointments , occasioned by his unscientific employer . /z/ INTRODUOnON . In cases of great public buildings , models of timber are often constructed , which , when done upon a properly adapted scale , convey a very perfect conception of the intended structures . The external form , and the internal distribution of houses , are necessarily susceptible of such variety , that it is impossible to lay down any particular rules on these heads . A country seat is , of late years , usually arranged with a centre building for the family , and two wiugs connected by covered passages with the centre , for various other purposes . The proportion that these wings should bear to the centre , has never yet been ascertained : yet every passing spectctor will exclaim against the architect , when the disproportion between the wings and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this nature , we find the length of its wings in front , each only oue-third part of that of the centre ; in others one-half ; but nothing has a worse effect than disproportion between the body and the wings in point of height . The connecting passage , or colonnade , always looks best when it forms exactly a quarter of a circle . The great difficulty in architecture is to combine utility with ornament and magnificence . This can indeed be properly done in structures of a certain extent alone , but even space and expense have not always been sufficient to insure these essential ends . Excess of ornament is always misplaced in small buildings , which have then more the air of models of other great works , than real places of abode . It was observed of Chiswick house , on the banks of the Thames above London , ( built in imitation , but on a small scale , of a noted structure of Palladio near Vicenza , in the north of Italy , ) that it was too large to hang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in. /z/ The size and proportion of doors must be regulated by the purposes of the building to which they belong . The door of a dwelling house , corresponding to the human size , is confined to seven or eight feet in height , and three or four in breadth . In private houses , four feet may be the greatest breadth . In small doors , the breadth or width may be to the height as three to seven , but in large doors as one to two . Doors intended to have but one leaf or close , should never exceed three feet six inches in breadth , otherwise the door becomes too heavy for convenient use . Doors of a wider aperture , especially in the outer wall , are best formed with two folding leaves . As to the modern fashion of opening a wide communication between rooms on the same floor , by means of broad folding doors , the practice sets all rules of proportion completely at defiance . The external lintels of doors and windows should always be on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the windows . When the outward wall is ornamented with half columns , and arches forming blank arcades , the doors and windows should just rise up to the springing of the arches . The most common way of ornamenting the aperture of a door , is by an architrave on the top , and also down the sides . Sometimes a cornice and even a complete entablature may be placed above the lintel . Pilasters , and semi-columns have also a good effect , when applied to outer doors . Porticos of four or more columns are properly adapted to large buildings . /z/ The number and size of the windows of a building , must be regulated by the nature and purposes of that building . The climate , the aspect , the extent , the elevation , even the thickness of the walls must be taken into consideration . When the walls are thick , which is commonly the case in detached stone buildings , the windows may have a considerable opening inwardly , which will admit nearly as much light as if the whole aperture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their situation ; only their width ought to be the same in every story ; those in each , however , being proportioned in height to that of the apartments in each story . In the principal floor , the height of the windows may be two and one-eighth , to two and one-third of the width . In the ground story , where the apartments are lower , the apertures of the windows seldom exceed a double square ; that is , the height is just double the breadth . When the basement is rusticated , the height is generally much less . In the second floor , the height of the windows may be from one and a half , to one and four-fifhs , or rather three fourths of the width . The window in the attics , and mezzanines or entresols may be a perfect square , or even lower . The windows of the principal floor are the most enriched . The simplest ornament of such windows is an architrave carried round the aperture , with a frieze and cornice on the top . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at other times they are surrounded with rustics , or a regular architrave . Those of the second fioor are generally closed with an architrave , crowned at times , with a frieze and cornice : but these last ornaments would be improper in the attics . The breasts of all ihe windows on the same floor , ought to be on the same level , and raised from two feet six inches to three feet above the floor . In warm climates , or in country houses in our own climates , seated amid gardens and pleasure-grounds , the windows of the ground story being cut down to the floor , render the /z/ tptments pleasant and agreeable . In country hoases , indeed , in France , Italy , and other warm parts of Europe , the principal apartments are all on the ground floor ; and the other floors diminish in height as they rise above it . The windows of the ground floor being cut down even with the doors , and thus afibrding a ready communication with the garden or lawn , have a peculiar propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first and other floors , in the streets of large cities , by which the damps and cold of winter must inevitably penetrate into the apartments , ought to be avoided , is a point to be decided by those who prer comfort and health to absurdities , however fashionable . Not contented with adopting usages suited to the genial temperature of the south of Europe , a stranger , on passing along the new quarters of London , might be tempted to imagine himself transported to the burning climates of India , when he beholds the fronts of the houses , whatever be their exposure , adorned , or rather loaded and blocked up with vast projecting galleries , intended , but very unnaturally , to imitate the light , airy , and refreshing varandahs of the East . In so far as these galleries are on the outside of the windows and walls , they are certainly of use to intercept the immediate action of the sun 's rays . On the same account , what we call Venetian blinds ought to be placed on the outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside , they keep off the glare of the sun 's rays , but not the heat , which communicates to the air of the room , warming it just as much as if no blind intervened . On the outside , the blinds reflect and repel the heat as well as the light , and the air within the room preserves a desirable coolness of temperature . The intervals of walls between windows should never be less than the aperture of the windows , nor in dwelling houses greater than twice that aperture , otherwise the light will be deficient Theusual rule for proportioning the quantity of light to a room , is to multiply the length of the room by the breadth , and the product by the height ; the square root of the last product gives the number of square feet of aperture requisite for properly lighting the room . Thus , suppose a room to be in length 32 feet six inches , in breadth 24 feet , and in height 15 feet , the product of these quantities multiplied successively into each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even numbers , 108 , will be the number of square feet of aperture required to lighten the room . This quantity , distributed among three windows , gives 36 square feet for each window , the width of each being four feel , the height must be twice and one-fourth , or 9 feet Had it been proper to open four windows in the same room , each mast have contained only 27 square feet ; and if the breadth of each were 3 feet 6 inches , the height would be 7 feet 8 1-2 inches . It is , however , to be observed , that both internal and external openings in houses , such as windows , doors , dsrC ought always to consist of the uneven numbers , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , d &c.; and never of the even numbers , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , d &c.; This rule can not always , it is true , be observed in the confined spaces allotted to houses in towns ; but in other situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be opened in the centre of the building , and the want of an equal corresponding extent and balance on each side , must strike the most careless spectator . The same rule is to be observed in distributing the arches of a bridge or an arcade , the intercolumniations of a portico or colonnade . The proportions of rooms , in length , breadth , and height , are more the objects of taste and experience , than of geometrical regulation . A circle or a square is a more perfect figure than an oval or a parallelogram ; and a globe , a cylinder , or a cube , than a parallelopiped . A room , however , in the form of a cylinder or a cube , would in general be neither useful nor agreeable . The parallelopiped is therefore the form universally adopted for rooms or chambers of every sort : in which the greatest dimension is the length , the next is the breadth , and the smallest is the height Some architects have made the breadth one half more than the height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , for example , if the height of the room be 16 feet , the breadth will be 24 feet , and length 36 feet ; and on the other hand , if the length be given , 22 feet 6 inches , the breadth will be two-thirds of it , or 15 feet , and the height two-thirds of the breadth , or iO feet . Such a rule , however , must evidently be subject to many modifications . The rooms on the ground or the second floor , may be of the same length and breadth with those on the principal floor : - but if they were of the same height , the impropriety would immediately strike and offend the eye . No defect in proportion , however , is more offensive than that in the height , and none takes more off from the appearance of a room . A low apartment , whatever be its other dimensions , never can possess either dignity or beauty . It is the common remark of every one , who , for the first time enters the matchless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means strikes the eye as so vast as it is known to be . This effect arises from the correct proportions of the whole edifice , in length , breadth and height , and of the various members of which it consists . Had it been narrow , our attention would have been attracted to its great length ; had the ceiling been low , we should have been offended by its disproportionate length and breadth . Such , /z/ on the contrary , is the harmony of the several dimensions of the building , that no excess or defect in either of them leads us to institute a comparison between them . It is only by observing the time necessary merely to walk round , and give a cursory glance to the interior of St. Peter 's , that the stranger can be convinced of its prodigious extent in all directions . Comparisons are seldom pleasing , and not always just : it would therefore be on many accounts , unfair to compare St. Paul 's of London , with St. Peter 's of Rome . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the former has an effect very different from that produced by the latter ; the chief cause of which , is , that the nave of St. Paul 's is really gloomy , and apparently narrow and low for its length ; so that the spacious and lofty dome , instead of being only accessory , becomes the principal part of the edifice . The proportions and dimensions of rooms must be icgulated by their uses . A dining-room and a bed-chamber , require very different proportions . A gallery for exercise in bad weather , especially if to be adorned with paintings and statues , must be of a length in proportion to its height and breadth ; which last must be governed by the necessity of possessing light from windows on one side only , to exhibit with due advantage the paintings and sculpture ranged along the opposite side . A passage should be just wide enough to give a convenient communication between the several parts of the house , and if it be wider , we are offended with the waste of space , which the architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no part of a building in which the taste of a builder can be better displayed than in the position and distribution of stairs . Even in the most spacious buildings , a step may be made too broad , so as to require a sort of effort to move up or down from one to another : In spacious stairs , the steps should vary from 12 to 18 inches in breadth , and from 4 to 7 inches in height ; the length also varies from 6 to 15 feet . Even in small houses , a step over 7 or 8 inches high would be inconvenient ; and the breadth should never be less than 9 inches nor the length shorter than three feet . We have thus given a pretty lengthy account of the theory of Architecture ; and would now invite the attention of the student to the subjoined remarks on the practical branch of the science . A competent knowledge of the methods of drawing on paper , and of working in stone , timber or other materials , the several kinds or orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect to discharge his duty to his employer , and the artisan to execute his commission , . It has been already mentioned , that an order of architecture consists of three principal parts , viz. the column , its pedestal , and its entablature . Each of these parts is again subdivided into 3 parts , thus : the pedestal into its base or lowest member , the cubical body , called from its figure , the die or trunk , and the cornice above all . The column into the base , the shafl and the capital . The entablature into the architrave , the frieze and the cornice . To give a minute , full and perfect explanation of the proportions and manner of constructing these several members , with the various ornaments appertaining to each , would require an extent and a number of engravings totally incompatible with the design of the present work . Nor is this particular explanation deemed essential ; for the number of publications on this head , is already so numerous , that it is probable the student will find it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide . Our observations will , therefore , be general and limited . The simplest problem in mechanical architecture , seems to be to determine the best form for a column . The length and the weight , ( that is , the quantity of materials in the column , ) being given , it is of importance to investigate the form which affords the greatest possible strength ; but it is somewhat difficult to ascertain the precise nature and direction of all the forces to be resisted which act upon the column . If a column were considered only as a beam fixed in the ground and acted upon by a force pressing transversely , or on one side , it ought to be much tapered , and reduced almost to a point at the upper end . But it is seldom that any force of this kind can be so powerful as to do more than overcome the weight of the column . The only thing , therefore , to be considered , is the load which presses on it from above ; hence , whether we regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crush it , the forms commonly employed appear sufficiently eligible . Some mathematicians have erroneously recommended the cylinder as the strongest form to resist bending ; and in this opinion , those who have not considered the subject , are ready to join them ; because a cylinder standing perpendicularly on one end , being of equal thickness , seems also to be of equal strength throughout . From the principles of mechanical philosophy , however , it can be shown , that the strongest form of an upright column approaches , in fact , much more nearly to that of an oblong spheroid or spindle of which the outside is an arch of an ellipsis . But the consideration of the flexure of a column is of the less practical importance in architecture , that , upon a rough estimate of the properties of the materials usually employed , a column of stone , ( in order to be capable of being bent by any weight which will not crush it , ) must be at least forty times as high as it is thick ; although a bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load , if its length exceed about twelve times its thickness . But as even in the Composite order , the tallest and most delicate /z/ of all , the height of the column is only at the most , ten times the thickness at the base , the action of the incumbent weight , in bending the column , ceases to be an object of much consideration . It is only , then , as a crushing force that the weight requires to be estimated , and since the lower parts of the column itself have not only the weight above , but its own upper parts to support , the thickness below ought to be somewhat increased . It appears , by experience of the direction in which the fracture of a column- is made , when crushed by too great a weight , that the outline ought to be made a little convex , or to swell a little on the outside of a straight line , joining the extremities of the shaft , and more curved above than below ; this is the usual , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most eligible outline , or a curve formed by bending a ruler fixed at the summit of the column . It is very natural in forming a column , to copy the working of nature in forming the trunk of a tree , which may be considered in a general sense , as a portion of a tapering cone , enclosed by straight lines joining the top and the bottom . But independent of other considerations , it is to be remembered , that the great load of the boughs , branches , and leaves , act upon the trunk of the tree very differently from the load usually to be borne by a column . A light-house placed upon a rock in the sea , may be considered as a column erected , not to support a weight , but to withstand the action of wind and water . If we calculated what would be the best form for a wooden pillar , intended to remain always immersed to a certain depth in water , . we should find that a cone or a pyramid would possess the greatest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone still more acute than this would be equally capable of resisting the force of the wind , supposing it to be less powerful than that of the water . The part below the surface of the water might , therefore , be widened , so as to become a part of a more obtuse cone , the upper part remaining more slender . And the agitation of the sea being greatest at its surface , the basis of the pillar might be &; little contracted , so as to have the outline of the lower part a little convex outwards , if the depth of water were considerable . But in the case of a building of stone , the strength often depends as much on the weight as on the cohesion of the materials ; and the lateral adhesion , which is materially influenced by the weight , constitutes a very important part of the strength . For resisting a force tending to overset the building , the form in which the weight gifes the greatest strength is that of a conoid ; that is , a solid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cone parallel to its sides , ) concave towards the axis , and convex outwardly . And for procuring , by means of the weight , a lateral adhesion everywhere proportional to the force , the form must be cylindrical . Hence in a building such as this pillar is sup- /z/ posed to be , no reasons appear why either portion of its outp line , taken separately , should be made convex towards the axis , although the joining of the two cones might very properly be rounded off . Of the form adopted for a building exposed to the violence of both water and wind , we have a remarkable example in the light-house erected on the Eddystone rock , situated in the entrance of Plymouth haven , about 14 miles out from the land . The top of the rock on which the light-house is founded is , it is true , constantly above the surface of the water when the sea is calm ; but in stormy weather every part of the building is exposed to the action of the waves , the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the light-house ; so that it may be considered as exposed to the force of a fluid acting more and more forcibly , as it is nearer to the foundation . On this account the architect , the late ingenious Mr. Smeaton , chose for the walls , a slope concave outwards , difiering in form but little from that which the most accurate theory could have pointed out . The building , however , is probably a little weaker nearly as high as the middle of its height , than in any other part . The light-house is wholly composed of cut stone , and about 16 feet in diameter at the bottom . The height of the building is 73 feet inches from the rock to the top of the cornice ; thence to the base of the lantern 7 feet 6 inches , and thence to the summit of the ball on the top , 17 feet 6 inches ; making the whole height 98 feet 6 inches . In diminishing their columns , various rules seem to have been practised by the ancient architects ; sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by straight lines tending to a junction at a point beyond the summit of the column , by which measure the shaft became a frustum or portion of a very acute cone . In other instances we find the column carried up perfectly cylindric , or of the same diameter , for one-fourth , or more commonly for onethird of its height ; at which points the diminution begins , and extends to the capital . This junction , however , of the cylinder and the cone , although the angle formed by their outlines be almost imperceptible to the eye , appearing an imperfection , it was proposed and practised by eminent architects , to form the outline oHhe shaft by a curve running within the cylinder , but without the cone , from the base to the capital , in such a way , that the diameter of the shaft was in every part , less than that at the base , but greater than that at the capital . The observations made on this point by Vitruvius , the great teacher of architectural mechanics , who flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late times been misunderstood , it is no uncommon thing , in different parts of Europe , ( to say nothing of our own country ) to meet with columns , the outlines of which consist of a curve actually swelling outwards , so that at onethird of their height their diameter considerably exceeds that at the base ; a practice so offensive to the eye , as well /z/ as to reason , as to create wonder how it should ever be adopted by men who had ever seen , or even read of the monaments remaining of ancient architecture . The different methods of giving to columns the proper diminution and most elegant sweeping outline , are particularly described in the body of this work . In this place we must content ourselves with giving the following plain instructions , by which every practical artisan may form his model and plan , with accuracy sufficient for ordinary occasions . Take the lower and upper diameter of the shafl of a column to be drawn . On the centre of the lower diameter describe a semicircle , and erect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extremity of the upper diameter , draw a line parallel to the axis of the column , cutting the semi-circle at the base ; now divide the arc of the semi-circle made by the intersection of the last mentioned line and the extremity of the base line , into any number of equal parts , the more the better , as into 4 , by points marked , 2 , 3 , &jC.; In the same way , divide the axis into the same number of equal parts , through each of which draw indefinite right lines , at right angles , to the axis . Through the points of the arc at the base , draw lines parallel to the axis , producing them respectively , until they meet the transverse lines drawn through on the axis , which will thus become points in the surface of the column . To assist in drawing these parallel perpendiculars , it will be convenient , through the points in the arc at the base , to draw lines to the axis , parallel to the diameter , and setting off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line passing through the first line ; another equal to that of the second , the points of the axis will be obtained as before . The setting on the transverses through the first point , a distance equal to the extreme points ; in this mariner the points on the opposite side of the axis may be obtained . If , now , nails or pegs be fixed in the several points in the surface of the column thus ascertained , and along them , and through the two extreme points of the upper and lower diameters , a thin slip of timrber , equally flexible in every part , be applied , it will show the contour or section of the exterior of the column . The curve thus formed being carefully transferred , will mark the edge of the rule , to be used in diminishing the shaft . In this process it is evident , that the more numerous the points of the surface ascertained , the more accurately will the slip of timber assume the proper form , and the diminishing scale be constructed . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ' ornament on its body , yet , at each end , in the base and the capital , various ornamental parts are introduced in the due distribution and proportion of which consists their principal beauty . These are , in general , called mouldings , because they are always of the same shape , as if they all proceeded from the same mould or form . Mouldings are , by some writers , divided into Grecian and Roman , with a reference to the remains of the architecture of those nations still in existence . The difference consists in this , that the Romans generally employed circular arches in their ornaments , while the Greeks often introduced parts of an ellipsis , or of some other section of a cone varying from the circle . The principal parts of mouldings are these , - 1st , the flat part under or above a moulding is a Jillet as resembling a bandage or turban tied round the column . 2d , When the moulding projects in the form of a quadrant , or a smaller portion of a circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likeness to a portion of the shell of a sea-hedge-hog , or of a common egg . 3d , But if the moulding , reversing that flgure , be a hollow of the same shape , it is therefore called a cavctto , 4th , A small projecting semicircular moulding is in general called a bead , as particularly belonging to the astragal or neck ; but 5th , If the moulding be much larger , with a fillet above or below it , it then becomes a torus , as iraitat* inga rope or cable applied to the column . Gib , If the section be a concave semi-circle , or semi- ellipsis , it becomes a scotia , because the interior is dark . 7th , When the projection is not pro3ry a part of a circle , but rather of an ellipsis , or of some other section of a cone , returning in quickly at the upper part , it is called a Grecian ovolo ; and the quick return in it is by workmen called a quirk . Sth , A contour or section , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it imitates the waves of the sea . 9th , If the concave part be uppermost , it is a cyma recta ; but if the convex part be uppermost , it is a cyma reversa , or ogee , /z/ A volute is a kind of spiral scroll , used in the Ionic and Composite capitals , of which it makes the principal characteristic and ornament . It has been called the ram 's horn from its figure , which bears a near resemblance to it . Most architects suppose that the ancients intended the volute to represent the bark of a tree , laid under the abacus , and twisted thus at each extreme , where it is at liberty : others regard it as a sort of pillow or bolster , laid between the abacus and echinus , to prevent the latter from being broken by the weight of the former , and the entablature over it . Accordingly , they call it pulvinus . Others , after Vitruvius , contend that it is designed to represent the curls or tresses of a woman 's hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four : in the Composite , eight . There are also eight angular volutes in the Corinthian capital , accompanied with eight other smaller /z/ ones , called helices . There are several diversities practised ill the volute . In some the list or edge , throughout all the circumvolutions , is in the same line or plane : - such are the antique Ionic volutes , and those of Vignola . In others , the spires , or circumvolutions , fall back ; in others , they project or stand out . Again , in some , the circumvolutions are oval ; in others , the canal or one circumvolution is detached from the list of another , by a vacuity or aperture . In others , the rind is parallel to the abacus , and springs out from behind the flowers of it . In others , it seems to spring out of the vase from behind the ovum , and rises to the abacus , as in most of the fine Composite capitals . The volute is a part of great importance to the beauty of the column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principal are that of Vitruvius , which was long lost , and at last restored by Goldman ; and that of Palladio. /z/ In drawing a column of any particular order , the several dimensions and members are measured by a proportional scale , founded on the diameter of the lower extremity of the shaft , immediately above the projection of the base , where the shaft becomes rectilineal . This diameter is divided into two equal parts , each being the radius of the transverse section of the column , and it is termed a module . The whole diameter is subdivided into sixty equal parts , or minutes , of which , consequenlJy , thirty are contained in a module . These proportional quantities are easily converted into real , when the lower diameter of the column is given in measure . Thus , if the lower diameter of a Doric column be 5 feet , or 60 inches , the module must be 2 1*2 feet , or 30 inches , and each minute will be 1 inch ; and ' the Doric column being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be 40 feet : hence the entablature , being one fourth of the height of the column , its height in this case will be 10 feet , and so on . In the Tuscan order , the height of the column is 7 times the lower diameter , or 14 modules ; the entablature one fourth of the column , and pedestal one fifth of the height of all the parts . Hence , let the whole height of a Tuscan column , with its pedestal and entablature , be fixed at 40 feet , the pedestal , being one fifth of the whole , will be 8 feet high . The remaining 32 feet , divided by 5 , will give nearly 6 feet 5 inches for the entablature , and 25 feet 7 inches for the column , of which the lower diameter being one-seventh , will be nearly 3 feet 8 inches . ' Had the order been Ionic , the whole height , 40 feet , divided as . before by 5 , ( for in all the orders , the pedestal is always one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 feet for the pedestal , and the remaining 32 feet , divided by 6 , would have given 5 feet 4 inches for the entablature , leaving 25 feet 8 inches for the column , of which the ninth part , or 2 feet 11 1-2 inches , is the lower diameter . But in general , when the whole height of the column , with its pedestal and entablature , is given , the several portions are thus found in all the orders . For the Tuscan , divide the entire height by 5 , the quotient is the pedestal , and the remaining height divided by 5 , will give the entablature . The remainder , divided by 7 , gives the lower diameter of the column . In the Doric , divide the whole height by 5 , for the pedestal ; onefifth of the remainder is the entablature ; the rest is the column , of which the eighth partis the diameter . Ionic - Deducting from the entire height , one fifth for the pedes tal , one-sixth of th remaining height is the entablature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the column . /z/ After cutting off the pedestal as before , the entablature is one-sixth of the remainder , as in the Ionic ; and onetenth of the rest is the diameter of the column . For the Composite order , the same proportions are employed . In laying down any order on paper , draw a perdendicular right line , to represent the axis of the column . Near the bottom , draw another line ( horizontally ) at right angles , on which , from the perpendicular , set off , on each side , a distance equal to a module , on one half the diameter . On a separate line , equal to this diameter , form a scale of 60 equal parts , or minutes , by which to measure all the dimensions , reducing them to minutes from the number of feet and inches in which they are usually given . The construction of such scale is , however , generally unnecessary , from the varilty to be found on Gunter 's and tother scales of wood , brass , Sc , sold by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the column produced below it , set off , progressively downwards from the bottom of the column , the heights of the several members composing the base and pedestal ; and through each of those points draw pencil lines at right angles to the axis . Again , from the same bottom Kne of the column , set up along the axis the several heights of the capital , architrave , frieze , and cornice , drawing , as before , lines at right angles through each point thus ascertained . Then from the axis set off on each horizontal line , the proper projection of all the several parts in order ; by which means the true elevation and projection of each will be obtained . The extremities of these horizontal lines are then connected by tho fillet , the ovolo , cynia recta , dc. according to the kind of ornamental profile belonging to each particular order architecture . /z/ The relative proportions of the various parts of the or- ' ders being accurately marked on the plates , any account of them here might be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , singularly rich and beautiful , exists at Rome , in the triumphal arch , erected to commemorate the awful and predicted destruction brought upon the city and temple of Jerusalem by the Romans , in the year 70 , under Titus , during the reign of his father Vespasian. * Under the arch are sculptured the golden candelabrum of seven branches , the tables of showbread , and other spoils , carried away from the temple . It is the ingenious , and not improbable fancy , of some eminent writers on architecture , that the general idea of the Composite order , as it appears in the arch of Titus , was borrowed by some Roman artist in the suite of that General , from the structure of the Temple of Jerusalem itself , after the conquest of the city , but before its final overthrow . Joseplius , it IS true , says , the columns of the temple were Corinthian ; but the diflferences between that order and the Composite , might not attract his attention , nor would they * The remuns ofth'iB ' Triamphal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ancient Forum . They are thus noticed by Theodore Dwight , Esq . in the Journal of his Tour in Italy : " It ( the Arch ) is built with solidity , of large blocks of marble , in the form of a simple gate-way : but the deep channels worn into its surface by time , and the immediate historical connection it has with the overtlirow of Jerusalem , have imparted to it a moral grandeur which even superior antiquity or magnitude alone could never possess . Those who have read the scriptures from infancy , and been taught to mourn with the saints and prophets of Israel , over the desolation of the city of David and the house of Grod , can never approach unaffected and regard this monument of heathen triumph . As we entered the shelter of the arch , we trod the stones of the old Sacred Way , which lay yet undisturbed under our feet : probably the same pavement that Titus passed over in his triumphal march to the Capitol , when they brought the spoils of the Holy Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right are seen , beautifully sculptured in relief , the seven golden candlesticks , th silver trumpet , the table of showbread , and the book of the law , all borne by priests marching in order ; and on the other side is the emperor , in his triumphal car , drawn by four horses , harnessed abreast , and represented with the highest skill of the sculptor , ' i'he chariot is accompanied by the Genius of the Senate and Victory , bearing a crown of a branch of Palm from Palestine . This record of history , containing more details than 1 have enumerated , still speaks to the eye and to the mind in language as clear and impres : i . -e as when it was first erected . But the unyielding spirit of the captives retains to this day all its pride and sternness . There are many Jews now in Rome , the descendants of the prisoners of Titus ; but it is said that not a'son of Israel has ever passed this detested spot , and trodden this part of the Sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still delight to trace back their pedigree to those whose humiliation they have inherited ; while , it is said , not a man in being can establish a clear and undoubted claim to the blood of any ancient Roman family . " have been generally deserving of notice . At any rate , the triumphal and tropheal arch of Titus is the most ancient monument in which the Composite order is discovered . This arch possesses another peculiarity , that it is supposed to be the Jirst structure of the tropheal or triumphal kind erected by the Romans - an example soob afterwards imitated by the abject adulation of the people , or rather by the insulting vanity of their princes - until at last , such trophies , being lavished without discrimination , ceased to be marks of honorable distinction . The feelings and duties of human beings in a social state of existence , naturally spring from that state . To a person brought up from infancy in absolute solitude , such feelings would only produce misery , and such duties would be a nonentity . Let , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that instant feelings of kindness or dislike , of affection or hatred , will arise . Let both be hungry , and let an apple or an orange only be procured ; this each will instinctively desire to appropriate to himself ; for an equal distribution of the object of their desires between them , must be the result of posterior experience and reflection , and not the spontaneous suggestion of the occasion . If the one is a little stronger or more alert than the other , he will avail himself of these advantages over his fellow-being to seize the object of his wishes . By this sole appropriation , the other sustain , not an imaginary , but a real loss . The natural desire for necessary aliment will aggravate his feelings of disappointment and defeat , into aversion , resentment and revenge , against his spoiler ; and should he be frequently thwarted in a similar way by his companion , nothing short of the entire destruction of that companion , will appear sufficient to secure himself from future privations and sufferings . This process will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even although the stronger should not attempt to assume to himself still greater advantages , in consequence of his acknowledged superiority . That the latter will , however , be governed by sentiments so moderate is extremely improbable . The self-gratulation , arising from consciousness of power , will yield a flower too delicious not to induce the desire of again experiencing such delight . He will thus naturally be disposed to exercise his superior faculties , not when the calls of necessity only , but when the suggestions of vanity or caprice , may furnish opportunity . Hence , his feebler neighbor will , by degrees , be reduced to absolute slavery , dependent on the other for even the necessary means of existence ; and of this existence itself , should he long continue refractory , he will probably be at last deprived . Thus may be traced the origin of the worst feelings and actions by which human beings arc distinguished ; and by a similar , but opposite process , may the rise and progress of the best sentiments and conduct be explained . In absolute seques- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but without virtue and vice in society , human beings can have no existence . When this simple and obvious theory of what is called the origin of evil , ( a theory by far too simple and too obvious , to have fixed the attention of presumptuous philosophy in any period of the world , ) is considered , it will excite no surprise , that the history of mankind , under even the most favorable circumstances , should present little else than an endless chain of deplorable wickedness and wretchedness , equally the natural consequences of folly and vice . ' We are a contemptible gang of plunderers , pests of society , meriting , forsooth , punishment the most severe and disgraceful , because we appropriate to ourselves the property of unoffending men , and even , on some occasions , deprive the owners of life , and all this we do , few in number , more frequently by secret stratagem than by open force , and even in some measure authorized by the sanction of necessity . Thou , on the other hand , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme dominion , without even a rival to attempt to obstruct the gratification of thy desires ; - without provocation , without invitation , without necessity , without any motive or reason which a man of genuine courage and truth , a friend to human kind , would avow ; thou destroyest cities , the abode of industry , knowledge and patriotism ; thou layest waste peaceable and flourishing countries , where thou hast received no injury - thou causest to flow torrents of the blood of nations who never even heard of thy name - and all this thou dost at the head of armed myriads , in open defiance of common justice and humanity ; therefore art thou exalted to the rank of a hero , a conqueror of worlds , a demi-god . " In such a strain , we are told , was the mighty Alexander of Macedon , addressed by the chief of a petty band of pirates , who fell into his hands , and whom he conceived himself authorized to punish , in an exemplary manner , for their outrages on society ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all people and of all times . Hence , we find in the most ancieut records of human society , applause and reward lavishly bestowed on the successful warrior , whether just or unjust , the cause in which he was engaged . But beside this and other marks of the real or supposed admiration and gratitude of their armies and people , conquerors were in the habit of constructing some more substantial evidence of their victories , on the scene of their exploits . At one time a rude block of stone , at another a mould or hillock of stones and earth , raised on the field of battle , served at once to point out the spots where the honors of the victor were achieved , and where , rested from their toils the human beiigs thus cut off , in the performance of the /z/ duties he imposed . Of such monuments many examples still survive the long lapse of ages , in Great Britain , in Cornwall , in Wales , and in Scotland . These dumb memorials came at last into disrepute : they recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeding generations when tradition grew feeble , or entirely died away , were left to conjecture the cause of their erection ; and the mighty warrior was thus bereft of half his glory . When the Romans began to establish themselves in the southern parts of Gaul , and to extend the boundaries of their province , now Provence , Languedoc and Dauphiny , in France , they first constructed durable memorials of the success usually accompanying the exertions of united and well-disciplined bands ; although far from numerous , against countless multitudes of irregular , ungovernable barbarians . Two Roman generals , Domitius iEnobarbus and Fabius Maximus , erected on the banks of the Rhone , saxoa turres , towers built of stone , supporting trophies , consisting of arms offensive and defensive , standards , instruments of marUaf music , and other pledges of victory , taken from the ancient Oauls . This conduct on the part of their commanders was highly reproved at Rome ; - for until then the Romans had never allowed themselves , even after their most signal success in war , to erect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever , by which they should be reminded of their subjection , and consequently be excited to endeavor to regain their former independence . ** Never before this , " says the historian , ** did the Roman people upbraid any conquered nation with their own defeat . " This happened about 120 years before England 's era . Some time afterwards , Pompey constructed , on the summit of the Pyrenees , near their eastern extremity , a permanent building , as a memorial of his successes , slight enough , indeed , over the partial but patriotic attempt of the Spaniards to throw off the Romish yoke . This action was severely reprobated at Rome . The same magnanimous sentiment actuated not the free states of Greece only , but even the despotic and military kingdom of Macedon . " States and nations , " said those ancients , " like individuals and families , will differ upon particular points , where their interests , real or supposed , are concerned . These differences will lead to quarrels , and even to the most hostile proceedings and open warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arms , the victors should endeavor to confirm the courage and ardor of their own people , and to depress the spirit of their adversaries , by some public testimony of their superiority . For such a purpose , a few helmets , and breast-plates , and shields , and swords , taken from the vanquished and supported against a spear , or suspended on a tree , on the scene of victory , will be fully suflGicient : - let not , however , /z/ such emblems of superiority be of long duration . The passions of men will cool , their views of interest will change , and the parties which tolay meet with deadly rancor in the field , will be found in a short time united in one common cause , and fighting , as friends and brothers , against an ally of one of the parties on a former occasion , but now become a common foe . It is , besides , to be considered , that success in war is not always attached to one side : no nation was ever always victorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by permanent records of our temporary superiority , labor to cherish and foment among our neighbors , that spirit of hostility which , at no distant day , it may be equally our desire and our interest entirely to extinguish . Injuries men often will and do forgive : insults , perhaps , never . " Such were the wise and magnanimous sentiments and principles of the Greeks and Romans , the two most enlightened nations of antiquity , in their best days . In the degenerate days of Titus and Vespasian however , when Rome reigned paramount over the greater portion of the civilized world , the feeling of national importance and independence , the source and support of every manly , generous and patriotic principle , was next to extinct in the nations of Europe . The example set in the case of Titus , was speedily followed ; and not only Rome itself , but numbers of the principal cities over the empire , were adorned with edifices , triumphal , trophial , and commemoratory , many of which still remain , exhibiting admirable specimens of architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are charged , serving to illustrate and establish the dates of many important historical facts . Wisdom , justice , and moderation are immutable - and , as such , never ( let weak , and consequently narrowminded men , say what they may , ) can be inexpedient , or out of season . Human nature is at this day what it was twenty centuries ago . Let , then , the prudence and humanity , by which states were then governed , and not the overbearing presumption and insolence on the one hand , and the abject , interested adulation on the other , by which later periods have often been characterized , suggest the most commendable models for modern imitation . But to return to the arch of Titus - it may just be added , that the unfortunate branches of the Hebrew nation established in Rome , made an arrangement , many years ago , with the government , agreeably to which , for the payment of a certain sum of money , they were permitted to open a narrow passage by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabited part of the town , is fiituated in the heart of the old city , on a very public thoroughfare , that their minds might not be tortured unnecessarily by the display of the emblems of the final destruction and extinction of their religion and their state , of their name and their nation . This digression the reader will , it is trusted , without difficulty pardon . It arose naturally from the subject , and may , perhaps , suggest certain considerations not entirely unprofitable . With respect to the kind and degree of ornaments to be introduced into a column and its appendages , it is a maxim founded in our natural sentiment of what is decorous and beautiful , that if we are in doubt concerning the proper medium , we should always stop short of the proposed point , and be careful never to go beyond it . The pupil of an ancient painter in Greece , produced a Venus loaded with jewels . ' ' Unable to make the goddess beautiful , " said his master , * you have thought to atone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' The dignified sobriety and gravity becoming an edifice , appropriated to religious purposes , or to the senatorial and legislative assemblies of a great and enlightened people , the massive solidity and strength inherent in our idea of a fortress , the light , airy , exhilarating notion attached to the name of a theatre , or other places of amusement ; all these qualifications of the edifices to be constructed , will , to an architect of genius , suggest the species and the measure of the ornament suitable to each . A slender , delicate , and highly enriched Corinthian portico to Newgate prison , could not be more incongruous , nor indicate a greater want of taste iit the builder , than a massive , heavy , clumsy Doric ( if Doric it be , ) range of pillars , and their pediments corresponding : apparently forbidding , but doubtless , meaning to invite the passing stranger to enter the theatre of Covent Gardens . When we examine the monuments remaining fpm antiquity , we find that the cyma , the cavetto , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , is employed as a finishing only , and never , where strength is required ; that the ovolo and talon are employed to support the essential parts of the entablature , such as the modillions , dentiles , and corona ; that the principal use of the torus and astragal is to secure and strengthen the extremities of the columns ; being also employed for the same purpose in pedestals , carved so as to resemble a rope or cable , agreealy to the original signification of the term torus ; that the scotia serves merely to separate the members of the base , as does also the fillet , not only in the base , but in profiles of all kinds . By the term profile , is here meant the assemblage of parts , mouldings , and ornaments of a cornice , &c.; in which the elevation and projection of each member are exhibited . The most perfect profiles are those consisting of the fewest mouldings , adapted to the order of the column , so disposed that the right lined and the , curved members succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ be predominant to which all others must appear sabordinate ; thus , in a cornice , the corona is the chief member , the cyma of the cavetto covers and defends it from the rain , while the modillions , dentils , ovolo , and talon , serve to support it . In the arrangement of the exterior of a building , whatever does not tend to characterize its destination , however beautiful in itself , is always misplaced . Greatness of character in an edifice , is principally produced by largeness and simplicity of parts ; such parts not only by their own magnitude , by the great masses of light and shade they exhi bit , when fully illuminated , excite the idea of grandeur . An object may be great , and not be grand - but grandeur and smallness of parts are incompatible . One of the most extensive edifices in Europe , is the king of Spain 's palace , at the Escurial , not far from Madrid . It covers a vast extent of ground , enclosing a number of courts , porticos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been constructed as a monastery , rather than as a palace , ( for the royal apart* ments are confined to a very small portion of the structure , ) the building is divided into various floors , and consequently the exterior walls are pierced with various ranges of comparatively small windows , adapted to the cells and halls of monks . The consequence of all this is , that the i ( Iea of grandeur and magnificence raised in the mind of the spec tator , while approaching it from a distance , and observing its prodigious dimensions , entirely vanishes away , when , on a closer view , the whole is discovered to be only an assemblage of small diminutive parts and members , such as might be suitably introduced into a manufactory , a barrack , a hospital , or a convent . Many objections have been made to Blenheim palace , in Oxfordshire England , as clumsy , ponderous , inelegant , and by no means corresponding to the customary notion of a country residence . That magnificent edifice was erected at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1704 , near Blenheim , a village on the north bank of the Danube , by the allied army , under the Duke of Marlborough . That distinguished and modest commander stands next to Julius Caesar , unrivalled in history for perfect coolness and possession of himself in action ; who , so far from ever exposing himself to the possibility of being surprised , whatever might have been the talents of his opponent , never rested until he was so close upon the enemy , as , in many cases , to discover their measures , and prevent their forming any project against himself , for the greater part of the campaign . Like Cssar also , in person a hero , he was scrupulously tender of the lives of his men , and to spare them , would often forego the opportunity of a brilliant , but sanguinary and useless victory , for the more slow , but more secure , and difficult advantages to be obtained by a skilful occupation of ground . On a due consideration of the destination of Blenheim , it will be manifest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing the structure into a variety of large projecting and retiring masses of building , to produce broad and powerful effects of light and shade , - and by that contrivance to fill the spectator with the idea of the vast magnitude of the parts , and of the whole , far beyond what their real magnitude , considered as it is , could be expected to excite . Besides regular columns and pilasters , we sometimes meet , in ancient and modern architecture , entablatures , supported by human figures . These are termed Caryatides , from the following circumstance : Five hundred years before our era , Xerxes , the powerful monarch of Persia , 1 a prodigious army and fleet against the free and independent republics of Greece . Successful at first , more by treachery than by valor , he was at last discomfited at every point , and compelled to return in disgrace and ruin to his own country . Carya , a town of Peloponnessus , had basely formed a league with the invader ; and upon his flight it was beseiged by the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants put to the sword , and the unhappy , perhaps innocent females , reduced to slavery of the severest kind . To perpetuate to future ages the infamy and punishment of the people of Carya , in Athens , and in many other parts of Greece , buildings were erected , in which were introduced , in the place of columns and pilasters , figures of Caryan women , supporting the load of a cornice and entablature . In general , these figures are attached , like pilasters , to the wall ; but in Athens they are also found detached , and performing the duty of columns , Male figures are also employed in the same way in some ancient buildings in Greece and in Rome ; in Greece they are evidently intended to represent Persian prisopers taken from Xerxes . From this account it is evident that human figures , in the place of columns or pilasters , ought , if at all , to be introduced on very particular occasions indeed . They nevertheless are often seen in the palaces of princes , and even in private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions among mankind ought , if anywhere , to disappear , are not free from this absurdity . These poor females , humiliated , borne down with a heavy load , are meant , we are to understand , for the muses and graces , the virtues d the angels themselves . Could the vices which corrupt , . and the furies which torment the human race , be thus chained down , and so rendered in some sort subservient to oux use , such an application of Persians and Caryatides might easily be reconciled to reason . Not only entire human figures , but simple busts , are also employed occasionally , to support the entablatures of monuments , chimney-pieces , &.c.; The head is placed as /z/ a standi smaller below than above ; and the whole is ealled a temif from terminus , a boundary , the Roman name of the land-marks , or march-stones , erected on fields and possessions , to point out the boundaries between the lands of different proprietors . The protecting charge of these landmarks , as of everything else connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the Romans as well as the Greeks , the top of the stone or post was carved in resemblance of his head ; so that to destroy , or remove , or deface such monuments , was regarded , not only as gross injustice to men , but as a voluntary and impious offence against the powers above . now remains to give a few observations on the constructions of Bridges , one of the most important and difficult applications of architectural skill . /z/ By a bridge we mean a structure of stone , brick , timber , or iron , erected over a river , a canal , a valley , or other depression in the ground , * and supported on piers and arches , or on post , for opening a communicatiQn for passengers , cattle and cariages , across from the one side to the other- The perfection of a bridge consists in its having a good foundation , that it may be durable ; of an easy ascent and descent , that it may be convenient ; and of a just proportion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridges should always be placed at right angles to the course of the river , &:.c.; and the piers should never be thicker than is just necessary to support the structure against the force of the current The simplest theory of the arch , supporting itself in equilibrio , ( that is , in such a state t1iat the tendency of every part to fall down or give way is perfectly equal , ) is that of Dr. Hooke , the greatest of all philosophical mechanics , who flourished in the latter part of the seventeenth century . The arch when it has only its own Weight to bear may be considered as the reverse of a chain suspended freely at each end ; for the chain hangs in such a form that the weight in each link is held in equilibrio , by the result of the two forces acting at its extremities . Two forces or tensions arc produced , the one by the weight of the portion of the chain below any particular link , the other by the same weight , increased by that of the link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , supposing the . chain inverted so as to constitute an arch of the same form and weight , the relative situation of all the lines , indicating the direction of the forces , will remain the same , the forces acting only in contrary directions ; so that they are compounded in a similar manner and balance each other on the same conditions , but with this difference , that the equilibrium of the chain is stable , and of the arch is tottering . When the links are supposed to be infinitely small , and the curvature of the chain is greatest in the middle , the chain forms what is called catenarian curve , from cat na , a chain . In common cases , this form of an arch differs but little from a circular arch of about 120 degrees , or one-third of a w hole circle , rising from the abutments , with an inclination of 30 degrees to the perpendcular ; the arch , however , becomes more curved at some distance below the summit , and then again less curved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight , acting only in a vertical direction , is by no means perfectly applicable to cases usually occurring in practice . The pressure of loose stones and earth , moistened as they generally must be by rain , is exerted very nearly in the same manner as the pressure of fruits , which act equally in all directions ; and even if the stones and earth were- united in a solid mass , they would constitute a sort of wedge , and produce a pressure of a similar nature . A bridge must also be so calculated as to support itself without being in danger of falling by the defect of the lateral adhesion of its parts . In order that it may , in this respect , be of equal strength throughout , the depth at each point must be proportional to the weight of the parts beyond it . This property belongs to the logarithmic curve alone , the length being made to correspond with the logarithm of the depth . But in the construction of bridges it is necessary to inquire what is the best Lrmfor supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in particular , on its weakest part , which is ususally the middle of the arch . Supposing the depth at the summit of the arch and at the abutments to be given , it may be considerably reduced in the intermediate parts , without impairing the strength ; and whether the road along the bridge be horizontal or a little inclined , it is agreed that an elliptic arch , not differing much from a circular , is the best calculated for complying , as much as possible , with all necessary conditions . The tier of bricks cut obliquely , which is placed over a door or window , is a real arch , but so flat as to allow the outline to appear horizontal . Little dependence however can be placed on so fiat an arch , since it produces a lateral thrust that might easily overpower the resistance of a side wall . For the horizontal force . required to support each end of an arch , is always equal to the weight of a quantity of the materials supported by its summit , supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the radius of the circle , of which the summit of the arch is a portion . This simple calculation will enable an architect to avoid such accidents as but too often happen to bridges , for want /z/ of sufBcient firmness in the abutments . Very eminent modern architects have sometimes been less successful in constructing arches of bridges and other edifices , than those of former times , whom it is but too common to despise ; and for want of attention to mechanical principles , they have committed such errors in their attempts to procure an equilibrium , as have been followed by the most mischievous consequences . Examples of this mismanagement might be pointed out in the bridges of our own country , and the churches of others ; but if we are masters of the true nature and action of pressure , we shall be able to avoid similar errors , unless some defect in the materials , the foundation , &c.; occur which could not be foreseen . It is desirable that the pie.rs of bridges should be so firm as to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each adjoining arch , but always to sustain the side thrust of one of them , should the other give way . The same condition is necessary for the stability of walls of any kind , employed in supporting an arched or vaulted roof , hence the utility of the external buttresses , which strengthen and adorn Gothic structures . There are two ways in which a pier or a wall may give way ; it may either be overset or caused to slide away horizontally . But since the friction or adhesion which resists the side motion , is usually greater than one third of the pressure , it seldom happens that the whole thrust of the arch is so oblique as not to produce a sufficient vertical pressure , for securing the stability in this respect ; and it is only necessary to make the pier heavy enough to resist the force which tends to overset it . It is not , however , the weight of the pier only , but that of half of the arch which rests on it , that resists every effort to overset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sum of these weights , acting on the end of a lever , equal to half the thickness of the pier , must be more than equivalent to the horizontal thrust , acting on the whole height of the pier . The pier may also be considered simply as forming a continuation of the arch ; and the stability will be pre*rved as long as the curve , indicating the direction of the P ' ure , remains within its substance . The dimensions o - piers must depend on the size and form of the arch , . , also on the force of the current to be opposed . In tide riVbg jjjg current acts twice a day in contrary directions , rtk considerably above the surface of the river itself , and retui jj rpj pressure on the piers is , therefore , V unequal ; and from the circumstance that the stones thus in a continual alteration between wet and dry , Nelection and placing of the materials , becomes a ma r Vj greatest importance . Some persons are P of stone resist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when placed exactly in the same position as when they lay in the quarry . Whether this circumstance , if real , was attended to , or not , in the construction of Black friar 's bridge in London , or whether the stone was of an improper kind , it is certain that such parts of the piers as are exposed to be covered by the tide , are now in a state of manifest decay , while the corresponding parts of Westminster bridge are comparatively but little affected , although it was founded in 1738 , and the former bridge not till 1760 . The new Strand bridge is built of granite , the least subject to decay of all stone , for external causes . The stone employed in constructing the grand quay along the front of the arsenal of Woolwich in Englantf , was drawn from the vicinity of Dundee , in Scotland , and is found to answer much better in such a situation , where it is alternately , with short intervals , wet and dry , than any formerly employed . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks in London , and in constructing the piers to support the iron bridge over the Thames , at Vauxhall . In building a bridge , the most essential part of the enterprise is to secure a good foundation . The most simple method of doing this , and carrying up the piers to the ordinary height of the water , is to tirn the river out of its course , above the position of the bridge , into a new channel opened for it , near the place where it makes an elbow or bend ; or by raising an enclosure round the spot , where the pier is to be built , to keep out the water , by driving a double row of stakes into the bed of the river , very near one another , with their tops above the surface of the water . Hurdles are then put within this double row of stakes , the side of the row which is next the intended pier is closed up , and the hollow between the rows filled with rushes and mud so closely rammed down that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stones , d &c,; within this enclosure , are dug out , until a solid foundation appears : when such a foundation can not be found , one of wooden piles , having . their lower ends well charred , to prevent rotting , and driven into the bottom of the river as close together as possible , must be made . Some architects hve formed a continued foundation the whole length of the bridge , and not merely under the piers . In doing this , first one part of the river is excluded , and then another , until the whole foundation be laid . When a river is but of moderate depth , having such a bed as may serve for a natural foundation , capable of bearing , without subsidence , in whole or in part , a heavy pier , then a strong frame of oak is constrncted and kept upon the surface by boats around it . On this frame is laid a thick stratum or layer of stone , cramped together by iron bars , and united by strong terras mortar ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is suffered gentlj to sink down to the bottom where /z/ ti /z/ the pier is to stand . If it be required to construct a bridge across a fordable ri ? er , or a canal , where the course of the water may be turned off , either by a wooden fence placed obliquely across the river , or by a channel dug one side , then a dam must be formed entirely across the stream , with piles , at a convenient distance above the place of the intended bridge . The ground is then dug out until a proper solid foundation presents itself ; and all the piers may be founded and raised up to the usual height of the river , at the same time ; after which the river is permitted to return to its original channel . When the stream is by far too considerable to be turned aside , coffer dams are formed , of a circular shape , to enclose the spot where each pier is to be built . The dam is made , as before said , by driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stout piles , either charred at the lower end , when the bed is easily penetrable , or shod for several feet with iron , where it is hard . The piles are forced into the ground by repeated blows from the pile engine ; the piles are covered with boarding , without and within , so as to be tolerably water tight , and the water which does make its way through the walls , or which springs out of the enclosed bed , is drawn off by pumps and hand labor , or , if the undertaking be considerable , by means of a steam engine . Besides bridges , other bodies of masonry are also require , if not completely to transverse , at least to advance a considerable way into the water ; such are the moles and piers carried out from the land into the sea , from opposite points of the shore , and mutually bending round towards each other at their extreme points , where they leave an interval sufficient for the passsge of ships out or in . In our seas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea twice a day , at low water such structures can be founded and carried up in general without particular difficulty . In the Mediterranean , however , where the rise and fall of the tide is either very unimportant or wholly insensible , as along the coasts of Spain , France , Italy , 6lc. the construction of a mole becomes an enterprise of vast labor , difficulty and expense . The vpork begins at the shore , by throwing into the sea blocks of rock or stone , the larger the more useful . These find their place in the bottom , and by accumulating block upon block over them , they at last rise above the surface of the water . The work being so far advanced , advantage is taken of the blocks above water , to form a road , by which other blocks are carried out and rolled into the sea , beyond those already placed ; and these again in their turn serve , when they come to the surface , to convey another succession of blocks , until the foundation o ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take into consideration the inequalities of the bottom of the sea , where not covered with hard sand , the incessant internal motion of t produced by currents , to say nothing of the super tation produced by the winds ; that most rocks a lose a great part of their weight , when immerse water , and are consequently more easily moved at place to place by the motion of the waters ; also ' extent in breadth to which rude blocks of stone or i necessarily roll , before they find a bed , either in tht of the sea or on one another : when all these th considered , the structure of moles and piers , in su must appear to be an enterprise of extreme diffici expense . In such seas , however , no other mode structing an artificial harbor can be devised . Wh foundation is supposed to be sufficiently consolidate is raised above the surface of the water , the mole is pleted by a structure of hewn stone , founded in the . stices of the sunk blocks , adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction are old and new models of Gibraltar , of Alicant , Tarragona i Barcelona , in Spain ; of Sette and Toulon , in France ; Genoa , Leghorn , Civita Vecchia , Naples , and Anchona , Italy , &c.; The famous antique mole at Pozzuoli , in th bay of Naples , is constructed with piers and arches foundei in the sea , and is from its appearance called Caligula 's bridge , having been , as is supposed , erected by that imperial monster . On the same principles with the moles just described , is constructed what is called the breakwater , in the entrance of Plymouth haven , in England ; in the view of abating the violence of the waves and currents which have , on many occasions , proved most prejudicial to the fleets resorting to that otherwise admirable station for shipping of every sort . In the report laid before the British Parliament , concerning this prodigious enterprise , which was carried on at the public expense , the engineers , Messrs . Rennie and Whitby , ( the former the engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are , properly speaking , three entrances into Plymouth Sound or Haven , viz. one on the west side of the bay , bounded by a long cluster of small rocks , called Scott 's ground , and the depth is only from ? 4 fathoms , ( from IS to 24 feet ) at low water ; and or east by the Knap and Panther , on which is about depth of water . This channel is about 500 fatho/ and the general depth is from 5 1-2 to 6 fath ' w water . The middle channel is bounded by to_the " P " Panther on the west , and by the Tinker and east ; about 300 fathoms wide , and the gen/ 6 1-2 to 8 fathoms at low water . . From this description it appears P* " " ' the middle of Plymouth Sound is shut r " " and St. Carlos ' rocks ; that is , as a char ' " " yj 'S shjps . Of course , works erected on those ro " " " " " obstruc- /z/ tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a pier or breakwater were constructed on the Shovel rocks and extended westward , so as to shut up in part the channel between them and the Panther , and also to shut up or narrow the spaces between St. Carlos ' rocks and Andurn point , the tide being then confined to a narrow space , the velocity of the current would be increased , and consequently the channels where it passed . It seemed , therefore , proper that a pier or breakwater should be constructed in the Sound , having its eastern end about 60 fathoms east from St. Carlos ' rocks , and its western end about 300 fathoms west from the Shovel , forming in the whole a length of 850 fathoms . Of this pier 500 fathoms in the middle should be straight , and 175 at each end inclined at an angle of 120 degrees . In addition to this breakwater , another should be extended from Andurn point on the shore , towards the former , of about 400 fathoms in length , having also a part inclined at an equal angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a manner as to prevent them from passing violently through the opening between the piers , and to shelter the Sound within , as to permit fifty sail of line of battle ships to ride at anchor in safety , in all winds and weather : and with ample room to work their way out to sea , by one or other of the channels , as their position and the state of the wind might render most convenient . These great works were to be constructed by large blocks of stone thrown at random into the sea , in the line of the intended breakwater , to find their own bed . - Stones from a ton and a half to two tons weight would probably resist the swell of the Sound , in stormy weather . Where the water is 5 fathoms deep , the base of the breakwater should not be less than seven times that depth , or 70 yards in breadth , and 10 yards broad , at a height of 10 feet above the level at low water or ordinary spring tides . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , should be in the proportion of 3 yards horizontal , for one yard perpendicular ; but the slope on the inside next the sound , would require an inclination of only half that quantity , or 1 1-2 yard horizontal for one yard perpendicular . To the project here described , ( and now completed ) various objections were made , particularly by Mr. Bentham , who bad executed some works at Sheerness , at the conflux of the Thames and the Medway , somewhat of the same nature , but in circumstances incomparably more easy to manage , than in the open stormy entrance at Plymouth Sound . He observed that such a work as that proposed by Messrs . Rennie and Whitby , even supposing sufficient precaution to have been taken to prevent any injury to the harbor during its execution , and that the whole were completed in its greatest perfection , would , nevertheless , by opposing throughout its extent a complete interruption to the water , occasion such ed- dies in the wake of the work , and such an increased action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as could not fail of forming shoals , more or less injurious , according to the nature of the soil , and other local circumstances . Mr. Bentham 's plan was to sink in the sea , but in a line of direction different from that of the other engineers , a double row of cylindrical masses of stone work , leaving an interval between each two masses above , equal to their diameter ; placing the masses in one row opposite to , and covering the intervals between , the masses in the other row . By this arrangement , while the two rows in conjunction formed a complete obstacle to the direct course of the waves , the tide or current would be allowed to pass freely between the masses , throughout the whole extent of the breakwater ; boats also and even small vessels might , in moderate weather , pass through the intervals without danger . Notwithstanding these objections and proposals , the scheme of Messrs . Rennie and Whitby , all circumstances duly balanced , was adopted by government , and ordered to be carried into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Benham was begun , in France before the resolution , a project for forming an artificial roadstead , or place of anchorage for ships of war , in front of Cherbourg , on the north coast of Normandy . This place , situated in the bottom of a wide open bay , on a part of the coast projecting considerably into the British Channel , lies only about 60 miles south from the Isle of Wight , and therefore offers a most advantageous position for watching the motions of British fleets , moving up and down the channel , or proceeding from or into the great place of rendezvous at Portsmouth or Spithead . Cherbourg possesses no natural qualfications for a shipping station , being merely a tide harborformed by a small river falling into the sea . Basins have been excavated , and locks constructed in former times , by means of which frigates and smaller vessels could be conveniently protected ; all with uncommon ingenuity , and at a very moderate expense . It was not enough for an engineer in France to give proof of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best method of accomplishing any desired object ; his great merit consisted in inventing how to accomplish that object in the most economical as well as the most ingenious manner . By giving this turn to the public mind , works of the highest importance to the state and to individuals , were carried on , in that country , for sums which , in some other countries , would be regarded as utterly inadequate to the purpose . All persons charged with the execution of public works , even those we call civil engineers , employed in the construction of harbors , bridges , canals , roads , &c.; were military men , regularly bred , and under due but liberal control , enjoying rank asd emolument sufficient for their station in society . An instance of /z/ a superior officer of the French corps of Royal Engineers , suspected , accused , tried , and convicted of recommending works which he well knew to be unnecessary , not to say prejudicial , that he might have an opportunity of enriching himself during their execution ; or of conniving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure , in the management of the public moneys , in order that he might be suffered , by the plunderers under him , quietly to amass his treasures ; that a field-officer of engineers should be proved to have stooped so low as even to make false returns of the quantity of coals and candles necessary for his official business ; an instance of such degrading delinquency is unknown in the history of French military jurisprudence . How far the same remark can be applied to another country , the constant rival and often the enemy of France , the records of the courts which take cognizance of such offences against duty , honor , and even common honesty , will bear ample but humiliating testimony . As Cherbourg possessed no outer harbor or road , such as Portsmouth possesses at Spithead , it became necessary to enclose a portion of the bay answer that purpose . Piers or breakwaters of continued construction were thought of ; but at last it was resolved to sink a long range of wooden truncated cones into the sea at certain distances asunder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would form a succession of solid , immoveable masses , sufficient to break the violence of the external waves , and render the space within incomparatively more quiet and secure than it was in its natural state . The cones were strongly compacted of oak , narrower above than below , and resembling a deep tub standing on its base , without a bottom . By most ingenious contrivances the cones were floated out to their destined situations , by means of empty casks made air tight , which were afterwards detached , and the frame allowed to sink to the bottom . The sides were of suffi cient height to be always above water , and when filled with stone , withstood the action of the tide and waves . This great enterprise , the only thing of the kind in the world , was naturally interrupted by the disorders of the revolution in France , but was afterwards resumed , with great activity ; so that in future wars with France , Cherbourg may become a most troublesome neighbor to Britain . /z/ Besides stone , timber is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in some cases it has greaHly the advantage , as when the current is particu* larly rapid ; for there the posts or piles supporting the road , presenting , either individually or collectively , but a small obstacle to the stream , often effectually resists its violence , when a stone pier , if it could easily be constructed in such a position , would not long keep its ground . ' Hence it is , that not only in England , but more particularly on the continent , stone bridges over great rivers are comparatively rare . Thus , on the Rhone , for instance , which , rising in the highest Alps of Switzerland , makes its way to the sea through the southern parts of France , bridges of stone have often been constructed , and as ofen carried away by the stream , so that at this day , perhaps not more than two remain . The Rhone is , however , the most rapid river of its size in Europe . On the Rhine , which , rising not far from the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and HoMand , into the German ocean , and is so much less rapid as its course is longer , stone bridges are quite unknown . But this is oving not only to the great body of water it caries along , but also to the policy of the different states along its banks , each unwilling that the opposite state should , by a standing bridge of masonry , possess means of making hostile attempts across the river . At Strasburg for instance , a large and prosperous city of Alsace in France , seated on the west bank of the Rhine , commanding by its fortifications a much frequented passage over the river into Germany , the bridge was , and perhaps is , formed by ranges of piles driven into the river , from space to space , to form the piers , supporting rafters and planks for the road , kept in their place by wooden bolts or treenails ; so that with a few strokes of a hammer or hatchet , the planks could be cast loose and removed , and all passage along the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also guarded by works , to prevent the French from penetrating by that communication . This is the bridge of Kehl , celebrated in every history of hostilities between France and Germany . Various are the methods employed in the construction of wooden bridges , governed principally by the extent of water they are to cross . Even in the narrowest , it is improper to trust to the resistance of beams reaching from bank to bank for they ought to be trussed ; that is , to be supported by pieces of timber reaching from each bank , near the water , obliquely towards the middle of the bridge . This contrivance will add greatly to its strength , and prevent its bending under passing loads . One of the most important particulars to be considered , in wooden bridges , is the seasoning of the timber . It is well known , that the decay of fir timber is generally owing to the moist , sappy nature of its exterior surface . This moisture must be completely removed before any paint or priming be applied , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this natural state , this sap would , by INTRODUCyriON. /z/ the actioD of the wind and heat , be gradaally carried off , and the fir beam become internally dry and solid ; bat if the surface be covered with paint , oil , pitch , or other sub stances of this kind , the sap is confined and will soon corrupt the timber , which will give way before its time , and without any external symptom of decay . In order to dissipate the moisture or sap of the surface , it is sometimes the practise to scorch the timbers over a fire turning it round regularly . The heat will attract the moisture to the surface , and evaporate it , and the timber will acquire a hard crust , of great service in resisting the weather ; when this is done , the parts that are to be under water should , be carefully covered with pitch and tar , sprinkled with sand and powdered shells . Those which are in sight , should while the wood is still hot from the fire , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tar , which will then strike deep into the wood , and soon become so hard as to be fit to paint . Fir timber , thus prepared , is found to be nearly equal to oak in durabiUty . At SchafThausen , in the north part of Switzerland , was once to be seen a wooden bridge over the Rhine , there very rapid , so that no stone bridge could resist it , admirable in its construction , and being the production of a plain country carpenter . The builder was directed to avail himself of a part of one of the piers of the stone bridge still remaining in its place , to support the intended structure . With this order he apparently complied , but so contrived matters , that , in the opinion of the best judges , his bridge actually consisted but of one immense arch of near four hundred feet , ( the breadth of the river , ) having a part stooping down , as it were , to rest upon the pier in the water , but not , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long fire beams , prepared for the purpose , extended at an angle of moderate elevation above the horizon , from both sides of the river , and in conjunction with intermediate timbers , meeting over the water , two arches were formed , being segments of large circles , and resembling the circular frame of the centering of a stone bridge . These arches were placed parallel to one another , at a distance sufficient for the breadth of the road , which was formed upon timbers suspended from the arches on each side , so as to be quite horizontal from end to end ; and instead of going over the supporting arches , was in fact let down between them . The whole was roofed over , and enclosed at the sides , with windows at convenient distances , to defend the timber from the weather . This most ingenious and most useful piece of carpentry , which had gained the applause of all men of genius and skill , completely answered its destination , from 1740 , when it was constructed , to 1799 , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the production of British ingenuity , exclusively . Iron being the great staple metal of the country , it has of late been employed in many works where great strength is required in proportion to the weight of the materials . Melted or cast iron , possesses several advantages over stone or wood ; and these , in their turn , possess advantages over cast iron . To stone , iron is superior in tenacity nd elasticity , and thence in strength , in facility of formation in any desired shape , and in extent of the masses in which it may formed ; qualities all conducing to its superior lightness and cheapness . To wood , iron is superior in the same particulars , together with durability ; but in this last respect , stone has greatly the advantage over iron equally exposed to the Weather , or other natural agents . The greater durability of stone arises from its being less liable to decomposition from the atmosphere ; and from its being less elastic , and consequently less subject to friction among its component particles , in yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several ways may , however , be adopted , to remedy in a great degree , these defects of iron . Paint will prevent it from oxydation , or rusting , for many years , and the application may , when necessary ; be repeated without much expense . Cast iron cariages of garrison guns have , by various external applications , been perfectly preserved for upwards of a century . The vibratory motibn of an iron bridge may also be considerably diminished by the manner of placing and connecting the bars of which it consists : so that each bar shall act as nearly as possible at right angles , against another , and be at the same time so short , as not to be in danger of being bent or crushed by the pressure against its length . The greatest objection in this respect to cast iron is this , that on account of the imperceptible differences in the purity and other qualities of the metal , it is impossible to cast two bars or blocks even in the same mould , which shall shrink perfectly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same dimensions when employed in the work . When such pieces come to be joined together , therefore , some empty space must necessarily exist among them , which , is a large work , where many pieces are employed , must produce a very sensible play in the joinings and consequently great vibration or reciprocal motion , in the whole structure . This inaccuracy of the joinings may , it is true , be in some measure corrected , by inserting pieces of sheet lead in the joinings ; but this metal possesses by far too little cohesion of parts , and too little elasticity to be of use for any length of time . In order to prevent the evils arising from these defects of cast iron it has been proposed to fill up the vacant spaces , left between the iron framing , /z/ with some conjpact cheap materials , such as hrick united with the composition called Roman or Parke 's cement , or Pozzolano , or terras , which would readily and intimately combine wilh the iron ; thus defending it from the action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled up by a consolidated substance , the play , friction , and vibratory motion of the bridge , would be greatly diminished . Lightnes being , however , a most desirable property , it has also been proposed to form hollow bricks solely for this purpose , which , being carefully and thoroughly baked or- even semi on the surface , would be proof against the effects of the atmosphere . In many parts , bricks are still seen in remains of Roman buildings , fifteen or sixteen hundred years old in perfect preservation , while the stones , with which the bricks are built up in alternate layers , are often greatly decayed , unless when enveloped in the admirably constituted mortar of those days . Iron may be used for bridges , either on the principle of equilibration , as stone is employed , or on that of connection , by framing , as wood is sometimes employed , in bridges , but generally in roofing houses . For bridges of considerable dimensions , the former is , by many judges , esteemed the best mode ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the cheapest . As iron bars , rods , or blocks , may be firmly connected together by bolts , or other means , an iron arch may be constructed much flatter ; that is , in the segment of a much greater circle , than if it were of stone ; an advantage of very great importance in certain positions , where arches of great span are required . The first iron bridge , of any note constructed in England , was that of Colebrookdale in Shropshire . It consists of five ribs , each of three concentric arches , bound together by pieces in the direction of a radii of the circle . The interior arch forms a semicircle ; but the others reach only to sills under the road way . These arcs pass through an upright frame of iron at each end , serving as a guide ; and the small space in the haunches , between the frames and outer arc , is filled up with a large iron ring . On the ribs are laid cast iron plates to support the road . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 inches , and the height from the base line to the centre is 40 feet . The road along the bridge* is U feet broad , formed on a bed of clay and iron slag , ( the refuse from the furnace where iron ore is smelted , ) a foot in depth . Another bridge of the same material was afterwards erected over the mouth of the river Were , forming the harbor of Sunderland , a great coal port in the county of Durham . The peculiar construction of this bridge , consisted in applying iron , or other metallic substance or compound , to form arphes on the same principle with stone arches , by a subdivision into blocks easily portable an- " swering to the key-stones of a common arch , which , being made to bear on one another will have all the firmness of a stone arch . At the same time , by the great open spaces lefl between the blocks and their respective lateral distances , the arch becomes materially lighter than if it were of solid stone , and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected , that the delicate but indispensable calculation of the size and weight of the stones composing the arch , becomes of but little importance . This bridge is in span 236 feet , and as the stones , from which the arch springs on each side , project 2 feet , the whole opening is 240 feet . The arch is a segment of a circle of 222 feet radius , and the height from the chord to the top of the arch is 34 feet : but the whole height of the middle of the arch , above the surface of the river at low water , is about 100 feet , so that ships can pass under it . A series of 105 blocks from one rib , and six of such ribs compose the width of the bridge . The vacant spaces between the arch and the road are filled up by cast iron circles , which touch the outer circumference of the and also support the road , gradually diminishing from the abutments towards the centre of the bridge . Diagonal iron bars are laid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep the ribs from twisting . The superstructure is a strong frame of timber , planked over to support the carriage road , composed of marble , limestone and gravel , with a cement of tar and chalk laid on the planks in order to preserve them . The whole width of the bridge is 32 feet . The abutments are masses almost of solid masonry , 24 feet in thickness , 42 in breadth at the bottom and 37 at the top . The weight of the iron in the whole work is 260 tons , of which 214 are cast , and 42 wrought iron . The eense of the whole , forty years ago , was 27,000/ , or $119,880 . The Waterloo bridge , over the Thames , will be illustrated by a plate for that purpose . /z/ Some of the most striking objects which attract the notice of strangers on visiting Boston , Mass. are the bridges which lead from its various points . Although we can not boast of so grand superstructures as the ancient city of London , we nevertheless have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and the Warren Bridges , whose carriage ways are covered with earth , the others with plank , they are very similar . The Western Avenue is a splendid mill dam , built of solid materials . Warren Bridge was built in 1828 . All these bridges are well lighted by lamps , when the evenings are dark , and the lights , placed at regular distances , have a splendid and romantic appearance . /z/ This splendid work was projected by Mr. Uriah Cotting , who with others associated , received an act of incorporation , June , 1814 , under th title of ' The Boston and Roxbury Mill Corporation . ' It was commenced in 1818 , under Mr. Cotting 's direction , but he did not live to witness its completion . His place was supplied by Col. Loammi ' Baldwin , and the road was opened for passengers , July 2 , 1821 . This avenue , or Mill Dam , leads from Beacon-street in Boston , to SewalPs Point in Brookline , and is composed of solid materials , water-tight , with a gravelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is one mile and a half in length , and a part of the way 100 feet in width . The water , which is admitted , is rendered subservient and manageable . Very extensive mill privileges are gained by the aid of a cross dam , running from the principal one to a point of land in Roxbury , which divides the reserveir or full basin on the west , from the running or empty basin on the east . There are five pair of flood-gates in the long dam , grooved in massy piers of hewn stone : each pair moves from their opposite pivots towards the centre of the aperture , on a horizontal platform of stone , until they close in an obtuse angle , on a projected line cut on the platform , from the pivots in the piers to the centre of the space , with their angular points towards the open or uninclosed part of the bay , to shut against the flow of tide , and prevent the passage of water into the empty basin . In this manner , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is necessary to pass from the full basin , through the cross dam , to keep the mill works in operation . The reservoir is kept full by means of similar flood-gates , opening into the full basin , ( when the rising of the tide gets ascendancy over the water in the reservoir , ) and fills at every flow , and closes again on the receding of the tide . In this way , at every high tide , the reservoir is filled , and a continual supply of water to pass through sluice-ways in the cross dam , sufficient to keep in motion , at all times , at least 100 mills and factories , is obtained . At low water the flood-gates of the receiving basin open and discharge the water received from the reservoir . /z/ 1828 ; and was completed in November following , under the superintendence of Joshua Bnrr , Esq . of Charlestown , Mass . It is one of the most perfect and elegant works of its kind in the Commonwealth ; perhaps we might , with strict propriety , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any other in point of durability and ease of travel . It opens on the Charlestown side , about ten rods above ( West ) Charles ' River Bridge , and , running in a southerly direction , terminates on the westerly part of the Mill Pond Land , ( so called ) in Boston , just east of the Middlesex Canal . It is the most direct , and the shortest communication between Boston and Charlestown . The Bridge is supported by 75 piers , placed at equal distances of 18 feet . It is 1390 feet in length , and 44 in width : allowing 30 feet for the carriage-way , and on either side , handsomely railed , for foot passengers . The floor of the bridge is composed of hewn hemlock timber about 14 inches deep ; the apertures between which are well chinked with small pieces of stone : the whole covered with 6 inches of tempered clay . On this is spread 8 inches of coarse gravel , covered with 8 inches of McAdamized stone . The sides of the carriage-way are secured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor-timbers are placed lower than those of other Bridges , in order that they may be occasionally wet by the high tides , which , it is thought , will tend to their preservation . That teams pass over this Bridge with great ease , is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that a single yoke of oxen has been known to convey 16 1-2 tons , at one , time from the draw into Charleeitown , without any unusual effort . The draw , in the centre of the Bridge , is of sufficient width to admit vessels of 300 tons . It has wharves on each side , built on piers , which are planked from the capsil to low-water mark , for the more safe and easy passage of vessels . Its conveniences , in this particular , are in strict agreement with the general excellence of the whole structure . /z/ A minute and accurate description of Town 's improvement in the construction of Wooden and Iron Bridges , is given in a succeeding part of this work . We commend the article to the learner as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pa serious and attentive consideration . /z/ If a fifib point or any other number of points are required , tbe process will be the same . /z/ Given three points , ABC , not in a straight line , to draw a circle through them . 1 .

With the radius S E , on the centre S , describe the arc Q , R ; through the centre S , and the points 1 , 2 , 3 , &c.; draw lines , cutting Q R at F , G , H , &c.; and proceed in every other respect , as in the cycloid and you will get the curve . /z/ 1 . A plane is a surface in which a straight line may coincide in all directions . 2 . A straight line is in a plane when it has two points , in common with that plane . 3 . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would intersect , if produced , are in the same plane ; and two lines that are parallel , are also in the same plane . 4 . Three pdnte given in space , and not in a straight line , are necessary and sufficient for determining the position of a plane . Hence two planes which have three points common , coincide with each other . 6 . The intersection of two planes is a straight line . /z/ When two planes ABC D , A B F E , Fig. 1 , intersect , they form between them a certain angle , which is called the inclination of the two planes , and which is measured by the angle contained by two lines ; one drawn in each of the planes , perpendicular to their line of common section . 1 . Thus , if the line A F , in the plane ABE F , be perpendicular to A B , and the line A D , in the plane A B C D , be the perpendicular also to A B , then the angle FAD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B E F , A B D. When the angle FAD , is a right angle , the two planes are perpendicular . 2 . Fig. 2 . A line A B , is perpendicular to a plane P d , when the line A B , is perpendicular to any line B C , in the plane P Q , which passes through the point B , where the Une meets the plane . The point B is called the foot of the perpendicular . 3 . A line A B , Fig. 3 , is parallel to a plane P Q , , when the line A B is parallel to another straight line C B , in the plane P d. 4 . If a straight line have one of its intermediate points in common with a plane , the whole line will be in the plane . 6 . Two planes are parallel to one another when they can not intersect in any direction . 6 . The intersections of two parallel planes with a third , are parallel . Thus in Fig. 4 , the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane P d , R S , are parallel . 7 . Any number of parallel lines , comprised between two parallel planes , are equal . Thus Fig. 5 , the parallel lines A a , B 6 , C c , . . . . , comprised by the parallel planes P d , R S , are all equal . 8 . If two planes C D E F , G H IJ , Fig. 6 , are perpendicular to a third plane P d , their intersection A B , will be perpendicular to the third plane P d. 9 . If two straight lines be cut by several parallel planes , these straight lines will be divided in the same proportion . /z/ Given the inclination and seat of the axis of an oblique cylinder or cylindroid , to find the angle which a tangent makes at any point in the circumference of the base , with the plane of the base . 1 . Figs. 1 , 3 , Plate 14 . Let A E B O be the base of the cyliader or cylindroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let B C D be the angle of inclination , and let O be the point where the tangent plane touches the curved surface of the solid . 2 . Draw O N a tangent line at the point O in the base , and drayr O P paralllel to C B. Make the angle P O R equal to 6 C D , and draw P R perpendicular toPO. 3 . Then , if the triangle P O R be conceived to be revolved round the line P O , as an axis , until its plane becomes perpendicular to the plane of the circle A E B C , the straight line , O R , will , in this position , coincide with the cylindrical surface , and a plane touching the cylinder or cylindroid at O , will pass through the lines N and O R. Here will now be given the two legs P O R , and P O N , of a right-angled trehedral to find the angle which the hypotenuse makes with the base . Draw P d perpendicular to O N , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to P d . Make P S equal to P R , and join m S ; then P m S is the angle required . 4 . The hypotenuse will be easily constructed at the same time , thus - make m Q , equal to m S , and join O d , then N O d will be the hypotenuse required . 6 . In Fig. 1 , the method of finding the angle which the tangent plane makes with the base and the hypotenuse , is exhibited at four different points . In the two first points , O from A , in the first quadrant , the tangent planes make an acute angle at each point O ; but in the second quadrant , they make an obtuse angle at each point O. 6 . Fig. 2 , is the second position of the construction /z/ from the point A , for finding the angle which the tangent plane makes with the base , and for finding the hypotenuse enlarged ; in order to show a more convenient method by not only requiring less space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two given legs P ' O ' R ' and P ' O ' N ' . 7 . Draw P ' m ' perpendicular to O ' N ' , meeting O N in m ' . In P ' O ' , make P ' v ' equal to P ' m ' and draw the straight line v ' K , then P ' v ' R ' will be the inclination of the tangent plane at the point O. 8 . Again , in O ' P ' make O ' t ' equal to O ' m ' and draw t ' W parallel to P ' R ' . From O ' , with the radius O ' R ' , describe an arc meeting i ' u ' in u ' , and draw the straight line O ' u ' ; then V O ' us is the hypotenuse. 9 . For since P ' S ' is equal to F R ' and F v ' equal to P ' m ' , and the angles m ' P ' S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right angles ; therefore the triangle v ' P ' R ' , is equal to the triangle wJ P ' S ' , and the remaining angles of the one , equal to the remaining angles of the other , each to each ; hence the angle P ' v ' R ' is equal to the angle F m ' S ' . 10 . Again , because O ' V is equal to O ' m ' , and O ' d ' is equal to 0 ' R ' , and O ' u ' is also equal to O ' R ' ; therefore O ' u ' is equal to O ' d ' , and since the angles O ' V u ' and O ' m ' d ' are each a right angle , therefore the two right angled triangles , have their hypotenuses equal to each other , and have also one leg in each , equal to each other ; therefore the remaining side of the one triangle is equal to the remaining side of the other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides are equal ; hence the angle P ' O ' u is equal to N ' O ' d ' . 11 . By considering this construction by the transposition of the triangles , the whole of the angles which the tangent planes make at a series of points 0 , in figures 1 and 3 , their hypotenuses may be all found in one diagram , as in Fig. 4. 12J Thus , in Fig. 4 , if the angles AGO , A CO , A C O " , A C O ' " , be respectively equal to A C O , A C O ' , A C 0 " , A C O ' " , Fig. 1 , and in Fig. 4 , the semi-circle A O ' B , be described , and if C D be /z/ drawn perpendicular to A B , and the angles CAD , C B D , be made equal to B C D , Fig. 1 ; then each half of Fig. 4 , being constructed as in Fig. 2 ; the angles at m m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the angles P w S , P ' ml S ' , ft " m " S " , tt " ml " S " , in Fig. 1 . Also , in Fig. 4 , the angles C A E , C A g , C A A , C B i , C B *r , C B F will be the hypotenuses at the points A , O , O ' , 0 " , O ' " , B , in Fig. 1 . /z/ We may here observe , Fig. 1 , that the angles which the tangent planes make with the plane of the base in the first quadrant are acute ; and those in the second quadrant are obtuse ; and those in the second quadrant are the supplements of the angles P m S ; and moreover , that all the angles which constitute the hypotenuses of the trehedral , are all acute , whether in the first quadrant or the second quadrant of the semicircle /z/ ON THE PROJECTION OF A STRAIGHT LINE BENT tJPON A CYLINDRIC SURFACE , AND THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semi-cylinder , and a straight line in the developement , to find the projection of the straight line on a plane passing through the axis of the cylinder , supposing the developement to encase the semi-cylindric surface . Fig. 5 . Let A B C be the developement of the cylindric surface , B C being the developement of the semi-circumference , and let A C be the straight line given . Produce C B to D , making B D equal to the diameter of the cylinder . On B D , as a diameter , describe the semi-circle BED , and divide the semicircular arc BED , into any number of equal parts , at 1 , 2 , 3 , &c.; and its developement B C , into the same number of equal parts , at the points / , g A , &c.; Draw the straight lines f kg lhm , &c.; parallel to B A , meeting A C at the points A : , / , m , S &c.; also parallel to B A , draw the straight lines 1 o ; 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ip , m q , &c.; parallel to C D ; and the points o , p , q , &c.; are the projections or seats of the points k , I , m , &c.; in the developement of the straight line A C. The projection of a screw is found by this method : B D may be considered as the diameter of the cylinder from which the bcrew is formed ; and the angle BAG , the inclination of the thread , with a straight line on the surface ; or B C A the inclination of the thread with the end of the cylinder . The same principle also applies to the delineations of the handrails of stairs , and in the construction of bevel bridges , of which we shall treat in a subsequent part of this work . /z/ Given the entire projection of a helix or screw , in the surface of a semi-cylinder , and the projection of a circle in that surface perpendicular to the axis , upon the plane passing through the axis , to draw a tangent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B P K be the projection of the helix or screw , and B A the projection of the circumference of a circle , and since this circle is in a plane , perpendicular to the plane of projection , it will be projected into a straight line A B , equal to the diameter of the cylinder . On A B as a diameter , describe the semi-circle A r B , and draw P r perpendicular to , and intersecting A. B in q , join the points e , r , and produce e r to/ . Produce A B to C , so that B C may be equal to the semicircular arc B r A. Draw C D perpendicular to B C , and make C D equal to A K , and draw the straight line B D ; then B D will be the developement of the curve line B P K. qwq /z/ Draw P u parallel to A C , meeting B D in ti , and dfaw u t perpendicular to B C. Draw r g perpendicular to e r , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n perpendicular to A C , meeting B C in n , and draw the straight line n P ; then n P will touch the curve at the point P.

Make r g equal to the developement of r B , and draw g n perpendicular to B C , meeting B C in n , and join n P , which is the tangent required . /z/ If from a point A ' , Fio. 1 , in space , a perpendicular A a , be let fall to any plane P d whatever , the foot a of this perpendicular is called the projection of the point A ' upon the plane P Q. If through different points A ' , B ' , C ' , DV-Fios. 2 , 3 , 4 , of any line A ' , B ' , C , D ' , .... whatever in space , perpendiculars A ' a , B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be let fall upon any plane P Q , whatever , and if through a , 6 , c , d , the projections of the points A ' , B ' , C , D ' , in the plane P CI , a line be drawn , the line thus drawn will be the projection of the line A ' B ' C D ' . . . . given in space . If the line A ' B ' C D ' . . . . Fig. 3 , be straight , the projection a &; c c2 .... will also be a straight line ; and if the line A ' B ' C ' D ' . . . . Fig. 2 , be a curve not in plane perpendicular to the plane P Q the curve abed .... which is the projection of the curve A ' B ' C ' D ' , .... in space , will be of the same species with the original curve , of which it is the projection . Hence , in this case , if the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . be an ellipse , a parabola , a hyperbola , &c.; the projection abed .... will be an ellipse , a parabola , an hyperbola , &c.; The circle and the ellipse being of the same species , the projected curve may be a circle or ellipse , whether the original be a circle or ellipse , as in Fig. 4 . The plane in which the projection of any point , line , or plane figure is situated , is called the plane of projection , and the point or line to be projected is called the primative . The projection of a curve will be a straight line when the curve to be projected is in a plane perpendicular to the plane of projection . Hence the projection of a plane curve is a straight line . , If a curve be situated in a plane which is parallel to the plane of projection , the projection of the curve will be another curve equal and similar to the curve of which it is the projection . The projection upon a plane of any curve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to fix the position and form of any line whatever in space , the position of the line is given to each of two planes , which are perpendicular to each other ; the one is called the horizontal plane , and the other the vertical plane ; the projection of the line in question is made on each of these two planes , and the two projections are called the two projections of the line to be projected . Thus we fee in Fig. 6 , where the parallelogram U V VV X , represents the horizontal plane , and the parallelogram U V Y Z , represents the vertical plane , the projection a 6 of the line A A in space upon the horizontal plane U V W X , is called the horizontal projection , and the projection A B , of the same line upon the vertical plane U V Y Z , is called the vertical projection . The two planes , upon which we project any line whatever , are called the planes of projection . The intersection U V , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . When we have two projections a &,; A B of any line A B ' in space , the line A ' B ' will be determined by /z/ erecting to the planes of projection the perpendiculars a A ' , 6 B ' . . . A A ' , B B ' . . . through the projections a , 6 , ; A , B , of the original points A ' , B ' , of the Hne in question . For the perpendiculars a A ' , A A ' erected from the projections a , A of the same point A ' will intersect each other in space in a point A ' , which will be one of these in the line in question . It is clear that the other points must be found in the same manner as this which has now been done . When we have obtained the two projections of a line in space , whether immediately from the line itself , or by any other means whatever , ve must abandon this line in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design a working drawing , we operate only upon the two projections of this line that we have brought together upon one plane , and we no longer see anything in space . However , to conceive that which we design , it is absolutely necessary to carry by thought the operations into space from their projections . This is the most difficult part that a beginner has to surmount , particularly when he has to consider at the same time a great number of lines ii various positions in space . The perpendicular A ' o . Fig. 5 , let fall from any point A whatever in space upon the plane X V of projection , is called the projectant of the point A ' upon this plane . Moreover , the perpendicular distance between the point A ' and the horizontal plane X V , is called the projectant upon the horizontal plane , or simply the horizontal projectant ; and the perpendicular distance A ' A between the original point A ' and the vertical plane U Y , is called the projectant upon the vertical plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to prevent any mistake , that the horizontal projectant A ' a , is the perpendicular let fall from the original point upon the horizontal plane , and that the vertical projectant is the perpendicular let fall from that point upon the vertical plane . Hence the horizontal projectant is parallel to the vertical plane , and is equal to the distance between the original point and the horizontal plane ; and the vertical projectant is parallel to the horizontal plane , and is equal to the distance between the original point and the vertical plane . We may remark , that if through a , Fig. 6 , the horizontal projection of the point A ' , we draw a perpendicular a to U V the ground line , this perpendicular a a will be equal tx ) the measure of the vertical projectant A ' A ; consequently the distance of the point A ' to the vertical plane , is equal to the distance between a , its horizontal projection , and U V , the ground line measured in a perpendicular to U T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projection of the point A ' , we draw a perpendicr ular A a to U y the ground line , this perpendicular A a , will be equal to the measure of the horizontaFprojectant A a ; consequently , the distance of this point A ' to the horizontal plane , is equal to the distance between A its vertical projection , and U V the ground hne measured in a perpendicular to U V. To these very important remarks we shall add one which is not less so . Two perpendiculars , a a , Fig. 6 , A a , being let fall from the projections a , A to the same point A ' upon the ground line U V , will meet each other in the same point a , of the said ground line U V. If we now wished the two projections of a point A ' , Fig. 6 , or of any line A ' B ' whatever to be upon one or the same plane , it is sufficient to imagine the vertical plane U V Y Z , to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner as to be the prolongation of the horizontal plane U V W X ; for it is clear that this plane will carry with it the vertical projection A or A B of the point , or of the line in question . Moreover we see , and it is very important , that the lines A a , B b , perpendicular to the ground line U V , will not cease to be so in the motion of the plane U V Y Z ; and as the corresponding lines a a , &; b , are also perpendiculars , to the ground line U V , it follows that the lines , a a ' , b 6 ' , will be the respective prolongation of the lines a a , &; b . Hence it results , when we consider objects upon a single plane , the projections a , A of a point A in space , are necessarily upon the same perpendicular A a to the ground line U V. It is necessary to call to mind that the distance A a , measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane , ( the point A being the vertical projection of this point , ) and that the line a a , measures the distance from the same point in space to the vertical plane . It follows , that if the point in space be upon the horizontal plane , its distance with regard to this last named plane will be zero or nothing , and the vertical A a will be zero also . Moreover , the vertical projection of this point will be upon the ground line at the foot a , of the perpendicular a a , let fall upon the ground line , from the horizontal projection a of this point . Again , if the point in space be upon the vertical plane , its distance , in respect of this plane , will be zero , the horizontal a a will be zero , and the horizontal projection of the point in question will be the foot a , of the perpen- /z/ dicalar , A a , let fall upon the groand-line from the vertical projection A , of this point . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is above the ground-line , and that the horizontal projection is below ; but from what has been said , it is evident that if the point in space be situated below the horizontal line , its vertical projection will be below the ground-line ; for the distance from this point to the horizontal plane , can not be taken from the base-line to the top , but from the top to the base with respect to its plane . So if the point in space be situated behind the vertical plane , its horizontal projection will be above the groundline ; from which we conclude - 1st . If the point in. question be situated above the horizontal plane , and before the vertical plane , its vertical projection will be above , and its horizontal projection below , the ground-line. 2d . If the point be situated before the vertical plane , and below the horizontal riane , the two projections will be above the ground-line. 3d . If the point be situated above tbe horizontal plane , but behind the vertical plane , the two projections will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point be situated above the horizontal plane , and behind the vertical plane , the vertical projection will be below , and the horizontal projection above , the ground-line . The reciprocals of these propositions are also true . If a line be parallel to one of these planes of projection , its projection upon the other ' plane will be parallel to the ground-line . Thus , for example , if a line be parallel to a horizontal plane , its vertical projection will be parallel to the ground-line ; and if it is parallel to the vertical plane , its horizontal projection will be parallel to the ground-line . Reciprocally , if one of the projections of a line be parallel to the ground-line , this line will be parallel to the plane of the other projection . Thus , for example , if the vertical projection of a line be parallel to the groundline , this line will be parallel to the horizontal plane , and vice versa . If a line be at any time parallel to the two planes of projection , the two projections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reciprocally , if the two pro* jections of a line be parallel to the ground-line , the line itself will be at the same time parallel to the two planes of projection . If a line be perpendicular to one of the planes of projection , its projection upon this plane will only be a point , and its projection upon the other plane will be perpendicular to the ground-line . Thus , for example , if the line in question be perpendicular to tbe horizontal plane , its horizontal projection will be only a point , and its vertical projection will be perpendicular to the ground-line . Reciprocally , if one of the projections of a straight line be a point , and the projection of the other perpendicular to the ground-line , this line will be perpendicular to the plane of projection upon which its projection is a point . Thus the Ijne will be perpendicular to the horizontal plane , if its projection be the given point in the horizontal plane . If a line be perpendicular to the ground-Une , the two projections will also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is to say , that the two projections of a line may be perpendicular to the ground-line , without having the same line perpendicular to the groundline . If a line be situated in one of the planes of projection , its projection upon the other will be upon the ground-line . Thus , if a line be situated upon a horizontal plane , its vertical projection will be upon the ground-line ; and if this line were given upon the vertical plane , its horizontal projection would be upon the ground-line . Reciprocally , if one of the projections of a line be upon the ground-line , this line will be upon the plane of the other projection . Thus , for example , if it be the vertical projection of the line in question , which is upon the ground , this line will be upon the horizontal plane ; if , on the contrary , it were upon the horizontal projection of this line which was upon the ground-line , this line would be upon the vertical plane . If a line be at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this line would be upon the ground-line , and the line in question would coincide with this ground-line . Reciprocally , if the two projections of a line were upon the ground-line , the line itself would be upon the ground-line . If two lines in space are parallel , their projections upon each plane of projection are also parallel . Reciprocally , if the projections of two lines are parallel on each plane of projection , the two lines will be parallel to one another in space . If any two lines whatever in space cut each other , the projections of their point of inrersection , will be upon the same perpendicular line to the ground-line , ind upon the /z/ points of intersection of the projections of these lines . Reciprocally , if the projections of any two lines whatever , cut each other in the two planes of projection , in such a manner that their points of intersection are upon the same perpendicular to the ground-line , these two lines in question will cut each other in space . The position of a plane is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane with the planes of projection . The intersections , A B , A C , of the plane in question , with the planes of projections , are called the traces of this plane . The trace , situated in the horizontal plane , is called the horizontal trace , and the trace , situated in the vertical plane , is called the vertical trace . A very important remark is , that the two traces of a plane intersect each other upon the ground-line . If a plane be parallel to one of the planes of projection , this plane will have only one trace , which will be parallel to the ground-line , and soluated in the other plane of projection . Reciprocally , if a plane has a trace parallel to the ground-line , this plane will be parallel to the plane of projection , which does not contain this trace . Thus : Ist . If a plane be parallel to the horizontal plane , this plane will not have a horizontal trace , and its vertical trace will be parallel to the ground-line . Likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this plane will not have a vertical trace , and its horizontal trace will be parallel to the ground-line. 2d . If a plane has only one trace , and this trjice parallel to the ground-line , let it be in the vertical plane ; then the plane will be parallel to the horizontal plane . So if the trace of the plane be in the horizontal plane , and parallel to the ground - line , the plane will be parallel to the vertical plane . If one of the traces of a plane be perpendicular to the ground-line , and the other trace in any position whatever , this plane will be perpendicular to the plane of projection , in which the second trace is . Thus , if it be a horizontal trace which is perpendicular tothe groundline , the plane will be perpendicular to the vertical plane of projection ; and if , on the contrary , the vertical trace be that which is perpendicular to the ground-line , then the plane will be perpendicular to the horizontal plane . Reciprocally , if a plane be perpendicular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to the other , its trace upon the plane of projection , to which it is perpendicular , will be perpendicular to any position whatever , and the other trace will be perpendicular to the groundline . Thus , for example , if the plane be perpendicular to the vertical plane , the vertical trace will be perpendicular to the ground-line . The reverse will also be true , if the plane be perpendicular to the horizontal plane . If a plane be perpendicular to the two planes of projection , its two traces will be perpendicular to the groundline . Reciprocally , if the two traces of a plane are in the same straight line perpendicular to the ground-line , this plane will be perpendicular to both the planes of projection . If the two traces of a plane are parallel to the groundline , this plane will be also parallel to the ground-line . Reciprocally , if a plane be parallel to the ground-line , its two traces will be parallel to the ground-line . When a plane is not parallel to either of the planes of projection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groundline , the other trace is also necessarily parallel to the ground-line . If two planes are parallel , their traces in each of the planes of projection will also be parallel . Reciprocally , if on each plane of projection the traces of the two planes are parallel , the planes will also be parallel . If a line be perpendicular to a plane , the projections of this hne will be in each plane of projection , perpendicular to the respective traces in this plane . Reciprocally , if the projections of a line are respectively perpendicular to the traces of a plane , the line will be perpendicular to the plane . If a line be situated in a given plane by its traces , this line can only intersect the planes " of projection upon the traces of the plane which contains it .

When straight Unes are drawn , according to a certain law , from the several parts of any figure or object cut by a plane , and by that cutting or intersection describe a figure on that plane , the figure so described is called the projection of the other figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which produce the projection of the figure , are called a system of rays . 3 . When the system of rays are all parallel to each other , and are cut by a plane perpendicular to them , the projection on the plane is called the orthography of the figure proposed . 4 . When the system of parallel rays is perpendicular to the horizon , and projected on a plane parallel to the horizon , the orthographical projection is then called the ichnography , or plan of the figure proposed . 6 . When the rays of the system are parallel to each other and to the horizon , and if the projection be made on a plane perpendicular to those rays and to the horizon , it is called the elevation of the figure proposed . In this kind of projections , the projection of any particular point , or line , is sometimes called the seat of that point or line , on the plane of projection. 6 . If a solid be cut by a plane passing quite through /z/ it , the figure of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane , is called a section . 7 . When any solid is projected orthographically upon a plane , the outline or boundary of the projection is called the contour or profile of the projection . Note . Although the term orthography signifies , in general , the projection of any plane which is perpendicular to the projecting rays , without regarding the position of the plane on which the object is projected ; yet writers on projection substitute it for elevation , as already defined ; by which means it will be impossible to know when we mean that particular position of orthographical projection , which is made on a plane perpendicular to the horizon.1 /z/ If any point , line , or plane of any original figure , or object , touch the plane on which it is to be projected , the place where it touches the projecting plane , is the projection of that point , line , or plane of the original figure or object . /z/ The orthographical projection of a line , which is parallel to the plane of projection , is a Une @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 .

From a knoweldge of it , the architect is enabled to draft his . plans , and to give them their tme effect , or representation of light and shade ; to constmct his wmdows in order to receive light to the best advantage , kc , &c.; The art of keeping a proper gradation of light and shade on objects , actording to their several distances , colors , and other circumstances , is of the utmost consequence to the artisf /z/ The art of giWng a due diminuntioa or degradation to the strength of the light and shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quantity of light which falls on their surfaces , and the medium through which they are seen , is called Keeping . 1 . When objects are removed to a great distance from the eye , the rays of light which they reflect will he less vivid , and the color williiecome more diluted , and tinged with a faint bluish cast , by reason of the great body of air through which they are seen . 2 . In general , the shadows of objects , according as they are more remote from the eye , will be lighter , and the light parts will become darker ; and at a certain distance the light and shadow are not distinguishable from each other ; for both will seem to terminate in a bluish tint , of the color of the atmosphere , and will appear entirely lost in that color . 3 . If the rays of light fall upon any colored substance , the reflected rays will be tinged with the color of that substance . 4 . If the colored rays be reflected upon any object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' color of the reflected rays , and the color of the object ; so that the color of the object which receives the reflection , will be changed into another color . 5 . From the closeness or openness of the place where the object is situated , the light , being much more variously directed , as in objects which are surrounded by buildings , will be more deprived of reflection , and consequently , will be darker than those cbjects which have no other objects in their vicinity ; except the surrounding objects are so disposed , as to reflect the rays of light upon the surrounded objects . 6 . In a room , the light being more variously directed and reflected than abroad in the open air , ( for every aperture gives an inlet to a different stream ) which direction is various , according to the place and position of the aperture , whereby every different side of the room , and even the same side in such a situation , will be variously affected with respect to their light , shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place when exposed to rays coming in the same direction . Some original colors naturally reflect light in a greater proportion than others , though equally exposed to the same degrees of it ; whereby their degradation at different distances will be different from that of other colors which reflect less light . The art of keeping a degradation of light and shade on objects , according to their several distances , colors , and other circumstances , is of the utmost conseqtfence to the artist . In orthographical projections , where equal and similar objects stand in the same position to the plane of projection , they will be represented similar , and of an equal magnitude , at every distance from that plane ; and consequently planes which are parallel to each other would not /z/ appear to have any distance ; so that the representation of any number of objects , at dilSerent distances from each other , would be entirely confused , and no particular object could be distinguished from the others ; but by a proper attention to the art of keeping , every object will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors from each other will be preserved ; but though a proper degradation of light and shade ought to be preserved , according to the respective distances of objects from each other , artists in general take too great liberties with nature ; we frequently see in the drawings of architects , the art of keeping carried to so great an extreme , as to render their performances ridiculous . /z/ 1 . A body which is continually emitting a stream of matter from itself , and thereby rendering objects visible to our sense of seeing , is called a luminary ; such as the sun or any other body producing the same effect . 2 . The stream of matter which is emitted from the luminary , is called light . 3 . A substance or body which light can not penetrate , is called an opaque body . 4 . If a space be deprived of light by an opaque body , it is called a shade . 5 . The whole or part of any surface on which a shade is projected , is called a shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through it , is called a transparent substance . 7 . A line of light emitted from the luminary , is called a ray . /z/ The rays of light , after issuing from the luminary , proceed in straight lines . PROPOSITION n . If the rays of light fall upon a reflating plane , the angle made by any incident ray , and a perpendicular to the reflecting plane , is called the angle of incidence , and will be equal to the angle that its reflected ray will make with the same perpendicular , called the angle of reflection ; these two propositions are known from experiment . PROPOSITION ra /z/ If the rays of light fall upon any curved surfece. whether concave or convex , or mixed of the two , the angle of reflection will still be equal to the angle of incidence . /z/ Any uneven reflecting surface , whose parts lie in various directions , will reflect the rays of the sun in as many diflerent directions . /z/ If any ray fall upon a part of the surface which is perpendicular to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line as the incident ray ; but the more or less any part of the surfuce is inclined to a ray , falling upon that part of the surface , the greater or less angle will the reflected ray make with the incident ray . For , imagine a perpendicular to be erected to that part of the surface where any incident ray impinges on the surface , it is evident that the measure of the angle of incidence is equal to the obtuse angle made by the incident ray , and the reflecting surface at the impinging point , made less by a right angle ; but the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence ; wherefore it follows that the whole angle formed by the incident and reflected rays , is double of the angle of incidence ; and consequently a reflecting surface , whose parts lie in various directions , will reflect the sun 's rays in as many directions . Corollary . Hence appears the reason why object and their parts become visible to our sight when immersed in shade . /z/ ailAiDOW 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight line pass through or cut a given plane , and if an imaginary plane be supposed to pass through any two points in the straight line , perpendicular to the other plane , the angle made by the intersection of the two planes , and the given straight line , is called the inclination or altitude of the given line , on the given plane . 2 . The intersection of the planes , is called the seat of the given line on the given plane . Corollary . The angle made by a ray of light , and the seat of that ray , is the angle of the sun 's inclination . 3 . If , on the surface of any solid , there be any point or points in the surface where the sun 's rays fall perpendicular , this point or points which the sun 's rays fall perdicular to , are called points of light . 4 . If , on the surface of any solid , there be any line drawn upon that surface , and if the line so drawn upon the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the said surface , then the line fijrst drawn is called the line of light . 6 . If the sun 's rays fall upon any solid , and if a line or Unes be drawn on the surface of the solid where the sun 's rays are a tangent , or upon the place or places of the surface which divide the dark side from the light side , then the line , or lines , so described , are called a line or lines of shade . 6 . If the sun 's rays be parallel to any plane , that plane to which they are parallel , is called a plane of shade . /z/ PROlLEM I.

The lines for one quarter of the ring being found , the other quarter , on the other side of the seat A G , may be found from the last quarter , each being in the same order , receding from the line A G , or drawing towards it . One half being now found , the other half will be found by observing that opposite sides of f the ring are parallel to each other ; and consequently if one is fomid , the other will also be found ; for the light will be at the same distance upon the same sides of that which is to be found , as that cylinder which is found .

This problem will be found of great use in finding the shadows upon inclined planes . Note . If the seat and altitude of the sun be given on any other plane , making a given angle with the plane on which the shadow is to be projected , the sun 's altitude and seat may be found by Problem II . PROBLEM Xn . Given the seat and angle of inclination of the sun on the horizon , and the intersection of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a plane of shade , made bj a right line , parallel both to the horizontal and perpendicular planes , will make with each of the planes . Let A 6 be the seat of the sun on the horizon , and A A D as Fig. 1 , the angle of inclination to the seat A B , and let C B be the intersection of a plane perpendicular to the horizon ; take any point C in C B , and from C , draw C A perpendicular to p B , cutting A B at A ; from A , draw A E perpendicular to A C , and A D perpendicular to A B , cutting D B at D ; make A E equal to A D , and join C E , then will the angle B E , be the angle which the plane of shade makes with the perpendicular plane , and the angle ACE the angle which the plane of shade makes with the horizon . This problem will be very useful in shading mouldings which project from planes that stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat being given to the horizon ; as will be shown in the next problem . /z/ PROBLEM Xra . A moulding of any kind being given , and the angle which a plane of shade makes with a perpendicular part of the moulding , either being given or found by the last problem , having the sun 's altitude and seat on the horizon ; to determine the shadow on the moulding . Let the ovolo , fillets , and hollow , Ftg. 1 , be the given moulding ; drawC D parallel to the inclination which the plane of shade makes with the vertical part of the moulding , touching the ovolo at C , and cutting the vertical part below D ; then a line drawn through D perpendicular to the fillet will give the lower edge of the shadow , and an inaginary line supposed to be drawn through C , will give the line of shade ; and if a line is drawn through A , the lower edge of the fillet above the ovolo parallel to C D , cutting the ovolo at C , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fillet , will give the edge of the shadow from the fillet . Much in the same manner may the shadow upon the cima reversa and cima recta be found , as shown by the dotted lines . /z/ The form or shape of mouldings , in most cases , may be ascertained from the various degrees of light and shade upon them , without observing the profiles ; which will appear evident from the following observations . Observations on Surfaces , and their Power to reflect Light . It has already been observed in the second proposition , that if the sun 's rays fall upon a reflecting plane , the angles made by the reflected rays , with perpendiculars at the impinging points , will be equal to the angles made by their corresponding incident rays with the said perpendiculars ; so that the rays in this case will have only one direction after reflection : but by experiment we are shown that there . is no such thing as a perfect plane ; for if a surface is even polished to the greatest degree , yet this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if viewed through a microscope having a great magnifying power , the surface will appear quite irregular , and the different parts of the surface will be /z/ i i ! inclined to any fixed plane , in all manner of directions , and consequently , if the sun 's rays fall upon such a surface , the rays will not be entirely reflected in the same direction , but a great part of them will be reflected in all manner of direaions by the different positions of the surface , by proposition IV . It may be observed , that the higher any surface can be polished , the nearer it approximates to a plane , and consequently the rays will be more and more reflected in the same direction ; but there is no surface which will reflect the sun 's rays entirely in the same direction ; that is , parallel to each other ; but a great part of them will be reflected in all manner of directions : it will be also necessary to observe , that the power of reflection will depend very much on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker any substance is , the more will the rays of light be absorbed in that substance , and consequently will have a less power to reflect . White being the lightest of all colors , will reflect the most rays ; and the more any substance incUnes to a white , the greatest power will that surface have to reflect the rays of light . Observations on Mouldings in Shade . /z/ If the sun 's rays fall upon any building ; also upon the ground or horizon below the building ; and if there are any projectures from the building , such as mouldings or other ornaments , and if any of the parts of those mouldings or ornaments are entirely in shadow by the projecture of something else which prevents the rays of the sun from falling upon them , those parts of the mouldings which are in shade will become visible ; for , besides a reflection from the ground , there will be a strong reflection from the surface of the building , immediately under the mouldings or ornaments . It has already been observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently a part of them will be reflected upwards on the mouldings above , and therefore will show light and shade on the mouldings , according as the reflected rays fall , more or less perpendicular on their surfaces . Hence the reason why all perpendicular sides of fillets will be darker in shade than the horizontal sides . An ovolo , having a projecture over it , so as to prevent the sun 's rays from falling upon it , the reflected rays being more and more inclined from the under edge towards the upper edge , will be lightest below , and will be gradually darker and darker upwards . A cavetio or hollow , immersed in shade , will , for the same reason , be darkest below , and will be continually lighter to the upper edge . A cimareversa , in shade , will be darkest above and below , and lightest in the middle ; for this moulding is composed of an ovolo above and a cavetto below . A cimarecia , in shade , will be lightest above and below , and darkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal mouldings . Observations on vertical Mouldings. /z/ All upright perpendicular mouldings , in shade , or being in part so , will receive a reflection from those surfaces which are next to them ; for they can not receive a reflection from the contrary side , by reason of their projection , which will prevent the ray , reflected from that side , from falling on them . Therefore it is plain , in these cases , the forms of mouldings may be known by reflection . Artists give this rule for shadowing : that is , to shade all mouldings or other ormaments which are in shade , , inverse to those on which the sun 's rays fall , from the contrary side of the reflected rays . But this rule is not only very uncertain , depending much on the situation of other objects which surround these mouldings or ornaments , but in some cases very erroneous , as in the example of mouldings perpendicular to the horizon ; for mouldings in this situation , as has been observed , will receive a reflection from that side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if something else does not project to a great distance from that surface from which the reflection comes . If a cylinder or column is attached to a wall in a vertical position , and if it has any projecture over it , so as to cause that part under the projecture to be in shade quite round the cylinder , there will not only be a reflection from the wall on the contrary side of the cylinder , to the sun upon that side of the cylinder which is next to it , but also from that part of the wall on that side of the cylinder next to the sun , which will make that part of the cylinder which is in shadow , lightest at the two sides and darkest in the middle . Something of the same kind may be seen in Ionic columns attached Co a /z/ wall ; where it may be obeerved , when the sun shines upon one side of them ; suppose that side of the column which is on the right hand , then the right hand volute will throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shade will be lightest on that edge which is next to the wall and to the luminary , and darkest at that edge next to the middle of the column . Observations on Mouldings in Shade , when situate on the side of an Object which is entirely in Shade , and also the ground under that side in Shade , CASE m . In one building where one end or side is entirely in shade , and also a great part of the ground under that end in shade , there will be little or no reflection from the ground upwards , nor from the surface of the building , and consequently little reflection upon the mouldings from below ; the only light which they receive is from a kind of scattered or confused rays in the atmosphere , and small reflections from the horizon ; and threfore horizontal mouldings , or ornaments , in this situation , which have but small projectures o.er them , will have a contrary effect to mouldings in shadow , situate on the light side of an object An ovolo , placed hori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark side of an object , will be lightest above , and continually darker and darker to the under edge . A cavetto , having its greatest prqjecture upwards placed horizontally on the dark side of an object , will be darkest above , and continually lighter and lighter to the under edge . A cimareversa , placed horizontally on the dark side of the object , having its greatest projection upwards , will be darkest in the middle , and lightest above and below . A cimarecta , whose greatest projecture is upwards , and placed horizontally , will be darkest above and below , and lightest in the middle . All horizontal projectures on the dark side of an object will condense the shade under them , and consequently will appear more or less dark , according as the projecture is more or less . These are general rules for shading mouldings on the dark side of an object from scattered light ; however , there are some exceptions to these rules ; that is , when /z/ any of these mouldings have a very great prqjecture over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling upon the mouldings ; but as they will receive a small reflection from the horizon below , the most of the scattered and reflected rays will fall obliquely on the moulding ; thus the lighted place of an ovolo will not be exactly on the under edge , but somewhere between the under and upper edge , and will be nearest to either , according as the shadow on the ground is less or more distant from that side of the object , and according as the projecture over the moulding is more or less , and also according to the position and distance of other surrounding objects ; all these different circumstances combining together , will vary the places of light and shade on horizental mouldings , which are situate on the dark side of an object . An horizontal cavetto on the dark side of an object having a projecture over it as before , the lightest place will be somewhere between the upper and under edge , as in the ovolo , and both mouldings would have actually the same appearance if their profiles could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in a plane , making equal angles with the hor- izon , and with that side of the object in shade : that is , forty-five degrees with each other j and , consequently , mouldings in this situation will be less distinct than mouldings in shade , on that side of the object which the sun snmes on . Further Observations on the Effect that reflected Light wUl have on Cornices , which have Modillions or Mutules , Dentils , c. or any other projecting Ornaments of a nature similar to them . The reflected light from the ground and from the object being scattered in all directions , it will therefore follow , if there are any projecting parts from mouldings , or cornices , which are in shadows , such as mutules , modillions , dentils , &c.; these projecting parts will hinder a great part of the scattered rays from falling in the spaces between them ; and therefore the spaces will be deprived of reflection , and consequently will be much darker than the prominent parts , even if these prominent parts were also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modillions , dentils , &c.; are darker than on their fronts ; for every projecture will condense the shadow on each side of it , if recessed on both sides ; therefore the spaces /z/ will be lightest in the middle , aod darkest nearest to the edges of the routules , modillions , dentils , &c; but to show on which side of the mutules , d &c.; the greatest shade would fall , according to the place of the luminary , would be almost impossible , as it depends so much on the situation of other objects . But suppose all the surrounding objects in the vicinity to be removed , and the grpund and building to be of a light color , and suppose the rays to proceed from the right to the left hand of the object , and parallel to a vertical plane which is inclined at an angle of forty-five degrees with the elevation of the object ; then it is plain , that since the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence , the greatest part of the rays which fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the vertical plane ; and seeing that the vertical plane would be on the right hand of another vertical plane , perpendicular to the face of the object , and to the horizon , it follows , that most of the rays will come frtm the right hand , and be reflected towards the left on the object and consequently , any projectures from cornices , as mutules , fec. which are in shadow , will condense or darken the shade . upon the left hand of the projecture ; and that vertical side of the mutules which is next to the luminary , will be lighter than the other vertical side on the left of the mutule , &c.; As to the direction and effect , which most of the reflected rays would take from the face of the object , imagine a plane parallel to the sun 's rays and perpendicular to the face of the building or object ; then most of the rays will be reflected from the building or object downwards , parallel to this last mentioned plane ; and that part of those rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right or to the left , and therefore would cause no sensible difference upon the vertical sides of the mutules , but would reflect most light upon the horizontal or under sides , &c.; What has now been said of mouldings in shade having projectures from them , or of the recessed parts of any object , will apply to ornaments in shade which are deeply , relieved ; for their recessed parts , according to the foregoing observations , will be deprived of reflection by the more prominent parts of them ; they will therefore be darkest in their receding parts , and lightest as the prominent parts . Observations an the Shades of Projectures from Buildings f or from any other plain Surface which is made of light Materials . If there is any vertical plane , and if a rectangular prism is attached to that plane , having two of its sides parallel to the plane , and ccmsequeutly the other two sides perpendicular to it ; then if the sun-shine on the plane be on either side of the prism , the other opposite side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its edge upon the plane ; and if the shadow upon the plane be of no considerable breadth , and if the plane be extended at any considerable distance beyond the shadow , then the lightest part of the plane on which the rays will reflect a great part of the rays towards the prism : but as these reflected rays will not fall upon the shadow , it will be deprived of reflection : but as the side of the prism which projects the shadow , is opposed to the reflected rays , that side of the prism will receive a strong reflection , which will cause it to appear much lighter than the shadow it throws on the plane ; but if the shadow be projected farther on the plane , it will diminish the reflecting surface behind the prism , and will also cause the reflecting surface to be at a greater distance from the side of the prism , and consequently will receive less reflection from the plane ; and in general the reflection on the prism will be continually diminished , according as the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no difference between the shadow on the plane , and the side of the prism which projects that shadow ; and if the plane be entirely deprived of light , by the extensive breadth of the shadow , the side of the prism will in general be darker than the shadow on the plane : but this will depend very much on the situation of other objects . A building consisting of light colored materials , having a break in the front which projects a shadow on the building , at a small distance from the break , will , for the reason before mentioned , be much lighter on the side of the break , than the shadow projected by it on the building behind it ; also columns which are attached to a wall , will project a darker shadow on the wall than any part of the columns which throw the shadow , provided that the shadow b not any considerable distance from SlJ.ADIJWS. /z/ c skmMId ) - i /z/ i ' 1.24 .

The rays of the sun being reflected from the horizon in all directions , the projecture of the prism will prevent a part of the reflected rays from proceeding to the plane behind the prism , and consequently the dane would be something darker than the face of the prism which is parallel to it ; but the side of the prism adjoining to the plane will throw a reflection upon the plane , and therefore it would be difficult to perceive the difference between the face of the prism , and the plane parallel behind the prism . As to the difference of light between the side of the prism , which is perpendicular to the plane , and the plane , it will very much depend on the situation of the luminary ; for if the luminary is in a plane equally inclined to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each ; for very little difference will arise from the reflection , except the luminary is more inclined to one surface than another ; and then that surface will be darker than the other , according to the obliquity of the rays of the sun on that surface . /z/ Given the ichnography and elevation of a base and capital , and the seat of the sun 's rays on the ichnographj , and on the elevation ; to project the shadows caused by the several parts of itself , and the line of shade upon the baseImagine the object to be sliced , or cut , by as many planes , parallel to the axes of the columns , * and to the sun 's rays , as may be tliought convenient for the purpose : then it is plain , if a ray of light enter any of those planes , that every part of the ray will be in that plane , and that the projecting parts upon the edges of * It 18 not abiolutelj necessary to suppose the plane parallel to the axis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by planes in this position are more easily found than in any other , for which reason I prefer the above position of planes . /z/ these planes will withhold the rays from a part of the edge of the plane ; and the lowest point of that part will give the edge or projection of the shadow of the pari which throws the shadow then if a sufficient number of these points are found , a line drawn through them , with a steady hand , will give the shadow ; the line of shade will be found by dmwing lines to touch the several sections parallel to the seat of the sun 's rays on the elevation ; and a line being drawn through the points of contact of the sections , will give the Une of shade .

The part gfeis the shadow from the abacus , and d c h the shadow from the ovolo ; thus the point g in the elevation is the shadow of p ; /is the shadow of w , and e the shadow of m ; and the shadow of the other part of the abacus would be where the dotted curved line is represented : but as the sun sliines on the ovolo , in the middle of the abacus , it will throw the shadow lower than the dotted lines . This will be found by drawing lines to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , C , D. Note . That the line of shade on the torus might have been found in a very different manner than is shown in this example , may be seen by the circular ring , plate 19 .

Although I have given correct methods for shadow- ing , I have no reason to think that the artist will always be at the trouble to project his shadows , for as drawings , in general , are shadowed to an angle of forty-five degrees , and as I have made choice of that angle , he will still find these examples to be his only guide in practice , as all the forms will be sufficiently near when copied by the eye , and drawn by the hand of a judicious artist . /z/ Both the elements and compoeition of Foliage are here considered , and illustrated by plates .

The learner should , in the first place , draw a great variety of curve and spiral lines of different descriptions , and compare these figures with each other ; by which means he will be able at sight to distinguish each particular species of curve from another : then he ought to endeavor to imitate , with precision , the same things by hand in every variety of position which he can suggest to himself , and hence he will acquire a freedom of hand in every direction . When he proceeds to copying leaves , a general outline ought to be drawn , circumscribing the whole leaf ; he should then form outlines of all the raffles , and round every compartment , circumscribing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed to draw the raffles themselves . The learner having , after sufficient practice in copying , acquired a freedom of hand , he is advised to draw from nature a variety of such things as will be most suitable for the purposes to which they arc to be applied . By so doing , the parts of his compositions will always appear rich and natural ; and hence he will obtain a greater facility of invention . Having had sufficient practice in drawing from nature , he may then apply himself to the designing of ornaments ; for which purpose he will find the first part of the problem , viz. that of drawing curve and spiral lines by hand , to be of the utmost utility in form- /z/ KliK.MK- ' l ) K KDI.IAC .

The Tuscan and Composite were used only in Italy : the one more rude , the other more ornamented than the Greek orders , which occupied a middle rank . To attain , therefore , a proper knowledge of the true principles of architecture , the student should devote most of his attention to the three Greek orders ; not only because in them these principles are the most displayed , but because of all the monuments of antiquity , which have subsisted to modem times , few , or perhaps none , can be pointed out , in which the Roman or Italic mode of construction is certainly to be traced. /z/ 1 .

If the frustrum has no base , then the capital and frustrum together , is called a frustrum column ; but if the frustrum has a base , then the base , frustrum , and capital , taken together , are simply called a column . 5 .

ThEON WAS THE PERFORMER ON THE FLUTE ; LySAOES , AN ATHENIAN , WAS THE TEACHER OF THE CHORUS . EvAENATUS WAS ARCHON . " From this we eonclade that on some solemn festival , which was celebrated with games and plays , Lysicrates , of Kik3ma , a demos or boroughtown of the tribe of Akamantis , exhibited , at his own expense , on behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment , in which the boys of Akamantis obtained the victory ; also , that in commemoration of the victory , this monument was erected to perpetuate the same to posterity , by the name of the archon , or magistrate in whose time this took place . It appears that the building was erected about three hundred and thirty years before the Christian era , in the time of Demosthenes , Apelles , Lysippus , and Alexander the Great The Tripod seems to have been the peculiar reward bestowed by the people of Athens on that choragus , who exhibited the best musical or theatrical entertainment ; and we find this particular custom obtained for these tripods the name of chonigic tripods . It was customary for the victor to dedicate the tripod he had won , to some divinity , and to place it either on one of the temples already built , or on the top of some edifice erected and consecrated by him for the purpose . Thus they participated of the sanctity of the place , and were secured from injury or violence . A tripod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it became a permanent , authentic , and public monnment of the victory , and of the person who had obtained it . Stuart and Revett deduce many circumstances to prove that it was erected for the above purpose , which appears rational and conclusive. /z/ The Choragic MonuiTient of Lysicrates , which we are ahout to describe , is commonly called by the modern Athenians , * to phanari tou Demosthenios , or the lantern of Demosthenes . This monument of antiquity , which is exquisitely wrought , stands near the eastern end of the Acropolis , and is partly enclosed in the hospitium of the Capuchins . It is composed of three distinct parts ; first a quadrangular basement ; secondly a circular colonnade of which the intercolumniations were entirely closed , and thirdly a tholus or cupola with the ornament that is on it . There is no entrance or aperture in the basement , which is entirely closed on every side . The basement supports the circular colonnode , and was constructed in the following manner . Six equal panels of white marble placed contiguous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued cylindrical wall , which was divided from top to bottom into six equal parts by the junction of the panels . On the whole length of each juncture was cut a semi-circular groove , into which a Corinthian column was fitted with great exactness , so as effectually to conceal the junctures of the panels. * These columns projected somewhat more than half their diameters from the surface of the cylindrical wall , and have the attic base . The shaft of the column is fluted in a singular manner ; it contains thirteen flutes ; the lower extremities of these flutings descend below their usual limits , and are cut into the apophyges , or scape of the column , and the upper extremities terminate in the form of leaves ; the annular channel , immediately above them , which divides the shaft of the column from the capital , was probably filled with an astragal or collarino of bronze . Under this ter- /z/ mioated the fluting in the form of an annular tier of leaves , turning outward from the shaft of the column . This capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tier of leaves springing from the neck in form of the palm , the acanthus forms the second tier with the flowers . In the third tier is shown the beautiful branches and the scrolls , terminating under the angular extremity of the abacus , the points of which are cut short ; it in this respect , as well as in the disposition of the foliage differs considerably from any other example of the Grecian Corinthian capitals . The entablature . The architrave is divided into four divisions , the band or ogee and three parallel planes or faceas projecting ne over the other ; the lower edges stand out one or two degrees from a perpendicular line . The frieze of this entablature is ornamented with sculpture representing the story of Bacchus and the Tyrrhenian pirates . The figure of Bacchus himself , the fauns and the satyrs who attended on the manifestation of his divinity , the chastisement of the pirates , their terror and their transformation into dolphins , are expressed in this Bassorelievo with great spirit and elegance . The cornice is very plain , composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cyma or cymatium , having an upright front ; it is ornamented with scrolls and honey-suckle foliage in baaso-relievoiin the Yitruvian style . This cornice is composed of several pieces of white marble , and bound together by a cupola of one entire piece . The cupola is ornamented with elegant workmanship ; its covering imitates that of thatch or of laurel leaves ; the teret standing directly over the wall resembles a Yitruvian scroll next above the laurel leaves , the covering of the dome , spring three scrolls at equal distances from each other , in imitation of those branches in the capital shown in this plate . The flowers that ornament the top , rise from the centre , and are composed of workmanship of foliage , which terminate in three divisions of scrolls , of great richness , on the top of which it is believed was supported the tripod gained as the prize , from the circumstance that cavities are cut on the three principal projections in an equilateral triangle , into which the feet of the tripod were probably fixed , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the largest , was erected a baluster to support the tripod. /z/ This figure represents the elevation of the Grecian Corinthian order , from the choragic monument of Lysicrates , proportioned to modules and minutes .

If a plane , ABCDEFGE , one side of which A B is a straight line , B C and A E , at right angles to A B ; and if C D be an ovolo , D , E , and F , fillets ; F G a hollow , and G E , a straight or conyex curve line ; so that no part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be farther distant from A B than E is from A B ; then if this plane , so constructed , be turned round the line A B , it will generate a round solid , and if a parallelopiped , the two ends of which are equal squares , each side of these squares being a little more than twice B C , and the other four sides /z/ equal rectangles ; then if this parallelopipied be fixed upon the end of the round solid , so that one of its square ends be fixed upon the end generated by B C , and the angles of the square to project equally over the round solid , then a solid so constructed is called a column . 2 . The paraUelopiped fixed on the top , is called an abacus. 3 . The figure , or annulus , generated by the echinus D G , is called also an echinus. 4 . The annuli generated by the fillets D , E , and F , are each of them called an annulet. 6 . That part of the column or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is called the shaft of the cdomn. /z/ 6 . If , through the axis of the shaft , be supposed to pass twenty vertical planes , making equal angles with each other , which will cut the surface of the column in twenty places ; and if the surface of the column be curved or hollowed between each two lines , from the bottom to the top of the shaft , terminating immediately under the lowest annulet ; then the shaft will have twenty curved sides , and as many angles ; and if nearly at the upper end of the shaft be cut one or more grooves of an equal depth , from the surface of the hollowing , each groove being parallel to the annulets under the echinus , then a column so is called Doric . 7 . That part of the column contained between the upper channel and the lower annulets , is called the hypotrachelion , neck , or freize of the capital . 8 . That part of the Doric column , comprehending the abacus , echinus , annulets , and hypotrachelion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the cross beams in the frieze , which lay upon the architrave , be at right angles to the sides of the beams , and parallel to the front or the architrave , and if the two vertical right angles of each beam , form ing by the two vertical sides , and the ends be cut away by vertical planes , making equal angles with the sides and ends , - that is , 135 degrees with each ; and if two other vertical channels are cut on the end , so that the planes ; which are three in number , left on the ends of /z/ each beam , may be equal rectangles , and the two sides of each channel make 135 degrees , with the ends of the joists , and are so disposed that there may be a rectangle next to each semi-channel , and then two whole channels , leaving a rectangle in the middle ; the end of the beam , so formed , is called a triglyph. 10 . If the spaces between the triglyph be filled up with planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of the architrave ; and if these planes be in the same plane with each other , and recessed beyond the ends of the triglyph , so as to show a small part of the vertical sides of the beams ; that is , to be further in than the channels of the triglyph ; then these spaces so filled up , are called metopes. 11 . If the front of the beam , which supports the rafters that lay upon the joists , project at some distance beyond the face of the triglyph , the plane of the front being parallel to the ends of the beam ; and if a recess be cut from this beam directly over the metopes , the plane of the front of the recess being parallel to , and having a small projecture over the metopes , and the ends of the recesses over the metopes , be in the same plane with the vertical sides of the beam ; then that part of the front of the beam over the triglyph , is called the capital of the triglyph. 12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the beam which forms the capital of the triglyphs , and the lower end of the triglyphs and metopes , is called a Doric frieze . 13 .

If to the under side of the mutules be hung three rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those under the regulae of the architrave , so that there may be six in length in each of the rows , and three in width ; then these conical frustrums are also called guttae , or drops , as those in the architrave . 20 .

If over the capitals of the triglyph be laid another beam , whose front is parallel to the metopes , or to the front of the triglyphs in the frieze , having a small projecture from the front of the metopes ; and if over this beam be laid the ends of the rafters which support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to the beam under them ; one rafter over each triglyph , and also one over every metope , placed directly in the middle of each ; that is to say , a vertical plane perpendicular through the middle of every metope , and also through the middle of every triglyph , would pass through the ends of all the rafters , and divide them into two equal rectangles ; and if over the rafters be laid a beam , the front of which , being a plane parallel to the ends of the rafiers , has a projecture ; and if the void spaces between each two rafters , and the under side of the beam above the rafiers and the upper side of the beam below the rafters , be covered in , so that the front of the spaces so covered may be in the same vertical plane with the face of the beam under the rafters ; then those ends of the rafters , projecting over the face of the beam under them , are called mutules. 19 . If to the under side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same size as those under the regular of the architrave , so that there may be six in length in each of the rows , and three in width ; then these conical frustrums are also called guttaj , or drops , as those in the architrave . 20 . The front of the beam lying over the mutules , is called corona , or drip , or larmier. 21 . The under side of the beam , lying over the mutules , if called soffit , or lacunar. 22 . A building , whether of wood or stone , or any other material , having columns supporting an entablature qwq /z/ ovei ibem , as described in the preceding definitions ; Buch a. building , so constructed , is said to be of the Doric Order . Having defined the ' ' principal parts of this order , it may not be improper to observe , that the Doric order baa in general more mouidinga in the cornice ; but as these vary in different buildings , and as the members already described , form its most striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any account of them in the definitions . /z/ To draw the elevation of a Grecian Doric Order . Make the lower diameter of the sbafl of the column one eighth of the entire height of the order ; divide the diameter of the column into two equal parts , then one of these parts is a module ; divide ibe module into thirty equal parts , and each of these parts will be a miunte ; make the height of the column twelve modules , the height of the capital one module ; divide the height of the capital into five equal parts ; give one to the hypotraclielion , and two parts to the annulels and echinus ; make the annulets one quarter of the echinns , and the remaining two parts to the abacus : make the upper diameter of the shaft three quarters of the lower diameter of the shaft ; the kngih of each side of the abacus two modules and one fiflli , ortwo modulesand twelve minutes ; the height of the enlaltlalure will be four modules , of which the height of the cornice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architrave , each forty-five minutes , or one module and a half ; divide the height of the frieze into eight parts : give the upper one ( o the capital of the triglypb , and the three lower for the channels ; make one edge of the triglypb in the columns at the angles of the building , directly over the axis of the column , the breadth of the triglyph twenty-eight minutes , having the olher edge of the triglyph direcily at the angle of the building ; and make the distance between the triglyph , or width of the metopes , equal to the height of the frieze , forty-two minutes ; place all the columns between the two extreme ones , directly under the middle of the triglypha . Wake the height of the tenia one tenth of the height of the epistilium ; and the height of the regula , together with the guttse , equal to the height of the tenia . The height of the cornice being one module , make the hei gh of the small bead on the lower part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the gutlee , four minutes and a half ; the length of the mutules equal to Ihe breadth of the ( riglyphs , and their projection beyond the faces of the triglyphs , two thirds of their length , observing that one should he directly over the middle of every triglyph , and one over the middle of every metope ; make a fillet above the mutules one minute and a half high , to project Ijeyond the mutules half a minute over this fillet ; make ( he height of the corona one third of a module , or ten minutes , having a projecture over the fillet one minute ; make the height of the smaU echinus one minute and a quarter ; over the echinus , make a fillet of the same height ; over the fillet , make another echinus six minutes and a half high , and two minutes will remain fur the height of the fillet above the echinus . In order to establish the proportions and true taste of the original Doric Order , the following examples are taken from the most celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into thirty parts , or minutes ; the measures are all numbered in these parts ; the projections are reckoned from a line representing the asis of the column , and are figured at the extremities of each member . /z/ Thia temple , dedicated to Minerva , the chief goddess of the Athenians , is the most beautiful piece of antiquity remaining . It was built by Pericles , who employed Iclimus and Catlicratea for his architects . The entablature is charged with historical figures of admirable workmanship ; the figures of the pediment , though seen at ao great a height , appear to he as large as fife , being in alto-relievo , and well executed ; the figure in the middle seems to have been made for Jupiter , its right arm being broken off , which probably held the thunder . It is likely that between his legs was placed the eagle ; for the beard , and majesty and expression of his countenance , the figure being naked , as he was usually represented by the Greeks , sufficiently show it to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another figure , covered half way down the legs , coming towards blm ; /z/ which perhaps was a Victory , leading the horses of Minerva 's triumphal chariot , which follows it . The horses are finished with great art ; the vigor and spirit peculiar to those animals seem here to receive addition , as if inspired by the goddess they drew . Minerva , in the chariot , is represented rather as the goddess of learning than of war , without helmet , buckler , or a Medusa 's bead on her breast , as Pausanias describes her image within the temple . Behind her is another figure of a woman sitting . The next two figures in the corner , are the Emperor Hadrian , and bis Empress Sabina . On the left hand of Jupiter are five or six figures , which appear to be an assemUy of the gods , where Jupiter introduces Minerva , and acknowledges her his daughter . The pediment at the other end of the temple was adorned with figures , expressing Minerva 's contest with Neptune , about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only remains a part of a sea-horse . The frieze is charged with basso-relievos , of excellent workmanship , on which are represented the battles of the Athenians with the Centaurs : these appear to be as old as the temple itself . Within the portico on high , and on the outside of the cella of the temple , is another border of basso-relievos around it , at least on the north and south sides of it , which is without doubt as ancient as the temple , and of admirable workmanship , but not in so high a relievo as the other . On it are represented sacrifices , processions , and other ceremonies of the heathen worship . This temple is now turned into a Turkish nfiosque . Fig . I.

The ceiling of the porch is remarkable for its construction : there are great beams of marble , the upper sides of which are level with the bed of the cornice and the ends ccrresponding exactly to the triglyphs in the frieze , which give the idea of the disposition of the timbers which were first used in buildings , and from which the Doric order had its origin . This building is adorned with beautiful sculpture : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which are represented various exploits of Theus ; the battle he had with Sinis , the notorious robber , who dwelt in the Isthmus of Corinth . Theseus is represented making Sinis undergo those torments which he bad inflicted on others . In the basso-relievo is represented a man taking bold of another by his middle , and endeavoring to throw him down ; this is doubtless intended to represent Theseus throwing Sciron from a rock ; the combat of Theseus with the wild sow of Crommyon , which was killed by that hero . In another basso-relievo is represented a man presenting his hand to a woman , perhaps to express the rape of Ariana , or Helen , by Theseus . Some others of the basso-relievos in the metopes are less distinguished . The two mentioned by Pausanius are still to be seen on the front of the temple : one represents the battle of the Athenians with the Amizons ; the other the dispute of the Centaurs and the Lapitbae , in which Theseus kills a Centaur with bis own hand . The first seems to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for ( here the women are represented as silting* The inside of the temple is not ornamented like the outside . /z/ d3 This temple is now a Greek church , dedicated to St. George , and is at present in high esteem among the Athenians .

The ratio of the parts of this elevation , is the same as that on the portico of Philip , King of Macedon , in the island of Delos ; but the profile of the cornice differs as follows : Instead of the ovolo which I have introduced in this example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; and instead of the next ovolo under the fillet in this , there is in the original a cima-reversa . The profile in this plate I conceive to be more beautiful than the original , as it will produce a greater variety of light and shade , and consequently the mouldings will be more clearly defined ; but as the reader may be desirous of a knowledge of the true form and taste of the original mouldings , I have shown them in Fig. 3 .

Fig. 4 . The elevation drawn from the plan , Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Temple on the Ilysms , with a portico at each end . The colomns 6 6 are wanting ; but in the place where they stood , circles are marked on the pavement , which are exactly of the same dimensions with the remaining columns , and were evidently designed as an accorate guide to the workmen , when they erected those columns which are now destroyed ; for which reason it was thought necessary to make these circles likewise on the plan which is here given . The capitals of the antsB , belonging to the posticus or back-front , remain entire , and are of the same form and dimensions with those of the portico , except only that the sides contiguous to the back wall of the cell , are but half so broad as the faces next to the columns ; whereas , in the of the portico , the sides next the pronaos , and the faces next the columns , are equal . The architraves of the back-front project considerably beyond the antse , and there are sufficient remains of them , to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the back wall of the cell . Fig. 2 . The elevation of the south side of the temple . JVbte . The ground plan and elevation are here given as measured by Stuart and Renett , in feet , inches and decimals . The Ionic order derives its name from the lones , a Greek people , on the east coast of the Archipelago , whose capital was Ephesns , celebrated on many accounts , but particularly for the mgniflcent temple of Diana . If the Doric were meant to represent the manly , robust figure of Hercules , the Ionic might properly be the emblem of the dignified simplicity and elegance of Diana . It has been already observed , in the general definitions of the orders , that every order consists of a column and . an entablature ; that every column consists of a base , a shaft , and a capital , except in the Doric , where the base is omitted ; that every entablature consists of an architrave , a frieze , and a cornice ; that the base , shaft , capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of an order ; and that the peculiar mode or form of the members , determines the particular name of the order . But since many of the mouldings are common to all the orders , and are generated in a similar manner , what has been said in the general definition , add also on the Doric order , will render it unnecessary to repeat the same thbgs in the Ionic , as such mouldings can not form any particular feature of any particular order . It is therefore shown , in the subjoined definitions , how these members ought to be modified , so that they may constitute the Ionic order. /z/ 1 . If from the under side of the abacus of an- order there project two or more spirals on each end of the front , in a plane , parallel to the frieze , so that the extremity of each shall be at the same distance from the axis of the column , and also two others upon the opposite side of the abacus , parallel to the former , and projecting the same distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spirals shall have the same number of revolutions , and equal and similar to each other , the projecting part contained between any two spirals is called a volute. /z/ 2 . An order which has volutes and mouldings in the capital of the annular kind , and the ichnography of the abacus square , as in the Doric order , the architrave finishing of plain facise , and mouldings either plain or enriched , the frieze a plain surface , the cornice to consist of a ci ma-recta , then a fillet and an echinus only ; and if to the under side of the corona are hung a row of equal and similar parallelopipeds equi-distant from each other , whose fronts are in a plane parallel to the plane of the frieze , then each of these parallelopipeds is called a den tele. 3 . An order so constructed is similar to that invented by the lonians , and consequently is the Ionic order . /z/ The simplicit ' and greatness of the parts , their judicious arrangement , the beautiful turning on the volutes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders this one of the most beautiful and bold examples of this order . The elegant base of the column , the grand proportion of the entablature , the massy mouldings of the cornice , and the spacious surface of the frieze , well adapted for sculptured ornaments , and the architrave for its strengtli , as it is not broken in two or more facias , are considerations which should recommend this example . Fig. 1 . The elevation of the order and details figured in proportional parts for practice . Fig. 2 . A drawing of the order by dividing the whole height into 21 parts which are di. poscd of in modules and minutes , as shown in the example ; one of the parts makes a module or 30 minutes . Fig. 3 . Sliows how to form the curve of the fluting ; the Grecians used the ellijsis form , while the Romans as uniformly made use of a semicircle as in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 . Explained the same as Fig. 3 , in Plate 43. /z/ Fig. 1 . The capital inverted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . The elevation of the same . /z/ The small projection of the cima- recta , and its great height , is of itself beautiful and well contrived for the ornament , as it is less obscured by the shadow from the concave and convex parts of the moulding . This small projecture is also well adapted for a low corona ; for the greater the projecture of the cima-recta , the more it will predominate over the corona , by the principles of optics ; and , on the contrary , the less the projecture of the cimarecta , the less it will predominate over the corano . It follows , therefore , that a low corona will require a cimarecta , of a small projecture ; but a greater height of the corona will require a greater projecture of the cima-recta , and a less height . The denteles , which are a striking feature in this order , show here to very great advantage , their bold and singular projecture greatly relieving them from each other . The architrave is well proportioned to itself , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirals of the volutes are beautifully drawn . The surprising delicacy of the ornaments , and their bold relief , with the grand ratio of the parts and mouldings to each other , render this one of the most beautiful examples of the Ionic order .

The cymatium , or crown of the architrave , was taken from the designs of Mr. Wood , who visited this temple before Mr. Rivett . The base of the column is true Ionic : it has no plinth ; the upper scotia is inverted , which diversifies and gives the contour a greater beauty than is the Vitruvian base , in which the scotia are one over the other , unin verted . The torus is elliplical and fluted . The eyes of the volutes are bored two inches and a half deep ; the hem , or border , with its fillets resting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirals of the volutes , seeming to keep them secure in their place , adds greatly to the beauty of this capital . /z/ Fig. 1 .
