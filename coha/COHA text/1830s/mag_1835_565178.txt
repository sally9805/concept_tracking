txt WE are so fortunate as to have in our possession the portfolio of a friend , who traveled en foot in search of the picturesque over NewEngland and New-York . It contains many loose scraps and randorn sketches , which appear to have been thrown off at different intervals , as the scenes once observed were recalled to the mind of the writer by recent events or associations . He kept no journal nor set down any notes during his tour ; but his recollection seems to have been faithful , and his powers of description as fresh and effective as if they had been tasked on the very spot which he describes . Some of his quiet delineations deserve rather to be called pictures than sketches , so lively are the colors shed over them . The first which we select , is a reminiscence of a day and night spent . among the White Mountains , and will revive agreeable thoughts in the minds of those tourists who have but just returned from a visit to their sublime scenery . THE NOTCH . iT was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise from Bartlett , passing up through the valley of the Saco , which extends between mountainous walls , sometimes with a steep ascent , but often as level as a church-aisle . All that day and two preceding ones , we had been loitering towards the heart of the White Mountains - those old crystal hills , whose mysterious brilliancy had gleamed upon our distant wanderings before we thought of visiting them . Height after height had risen and towered one above another , till the clouds began to hang below the peaks . Down their slopes , were the red path-ways of the Slides , those avalanches of earth , stones and trees , which descend into the hollows , leaving vestiges of their track , hardly to be effaced by the vegetation of ages . We had mountains behind us and mountains on each side , and a group of mightier ones ahead . Still our road went up along the Saco , right towards the centre of that group , as if to climb above the clouds , in its passage to the farther region . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inroads of the northern Indians , coming down upon them from this mountain rampart , through some defile known only to themselves . It is indeed a wondrous path . A demon , it might be fancied , or one of the Titans , was traveling up the valley , elbowing the heights carelessly aside as he passed , till at length a great mountain took its stand directly across his intended road . He tarries // not for such an obstacle , but rending it asunder , a thousand feet from peak to base , discloses its treasures of bidden minerals , its sunless waters , all the secrets of the mountain 's inmost heart , with a mi*hty fracture of rugged precipices on each side . This is the Notch of the White Hills . Shame on me , that I have attempted to describe it by so mean an image - feeling , as I do , that it is one of those symbolic scenes , which lead the mind to the sentiment , though not to the conception , of Oninipotence. * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the appearance of Wiving been cut by human strength and artifice in the solid rock . There was a wall of granite on each side , high and precipitous , especially on our right , and so smooth that a few evergreens could hardly find foothold enough to grow there . This is the entrance , or , in the direction we were going , the extremity of the romantic defile of the Notch . Before emerging from it , the rattling of wheels approached behind us , and a stage-coach rumbled out of the mountain* with seats on top and trunks behind , and a smart driver , in a drab great-coat , touching the wheel horses with the whip-stock , and reining in the leaders . To my mind , there was a sort of poetry in such an incident , hardly inferior to what would have accompanied the painted array of an Indian war-party , gliding forth from the same wild chasm . All the passengers , except a very fat lady on the back seat , had alighted . One was a mineralogist , a scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with which he did great damage to the precipices , and put the fragments in his pocket . Another was a well-dressed young man , who carried an operaglass set in gold , and seemed to be making a quotation from some of Byron 's rhapsodies on mountain scenery . There was also a trader , returning from Portland to the upper part of Vermont ; and a fair young girl , with a very faint bloom , like one of those pale and delicate flowers , which sometimes occur among Alpine cliffs . They disappeared , and we followed them , passing through a deep pine forest , which , for some miles , allowed us to see nothing but its own dismal shade . Towards night-fall , we reached a level amphitheatre , surrounded by a great rampart of hills , which shut out the sunshine long before it left the external world . It was here that we obtained our first view , except at a distance , of the principal group of mountains . They are majestic , and even awful , when contemplated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the long ridges which support them , give the idea of immense bulk , rather than of towering height . Mount Washington , indeed , looked near to Heaven ; he was white with snow a mile downward , and had caught the only cloud that was sailing through the atmosphere , to veil his head . Lat us forget the // other names of American statesmen , that have been stamped upon these hills , but still call the loftiest - WASHINGTON . Mountains are Earth 's undecaying monuments . They must stand while she endures , and never should be consecrated to the mere great men of their own age and country , but to the mighty ones alone , whose glory is universal , and whom all time will render illustrious . The air , not often sultry in this elevated region , nearly two thousand feet above the sea , was now sharp and cold , like that of a clear November evening in the low-lands . By morning , probably , there would be a frost , if not a snow-fall , on the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . I was glad to perceive a prospect of comfortable quarters , in a house which we were approaching , and of pleasant company in the guests who were assembled at the door . OUR EVENING PARTY AMONG TIlE MOUNTAINS . We stood in front of a good substantial farm-house , of old date in that wild country . A sign over the door denoted it to be the White Mountain Post-Office , an establishment which distributes letters and newspapers to perhaps a score of persons , comprising the population of two or three townships among the hills . The broad and weighty antlers of a deer , a stag of ten , ' were fastened at a corner of the house ; a fox 's bushy tail was nailed beneath them ; and a huge black paw lay on the ground , newly severed and still bleeding - the trophy of a bear-hunt . Among several persons collected about the door-steps , the most remarkable was a sturdy mountaineer , of six feet two and corresponding bulk , with a heavy set of features , such as might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of mother-wit and rough humor . As we appeared , he uplifted a tin trumpet , four or five feet long , and blew a tremendous blast , either in honor of our arrival , or to awaken an echo from the opposite hill . Ethan Crawford 's guests were of such a motley description as to form quite a picturesque group , seldom seen together , except at some place like this , at once the pleasure-house of fashionable tourists , and the homely inn of country travelers . Among the company at the door , were the mineralogist and the owner of the gold opera-glass , whom we had encountered in the Notch ; two Georgian gentlemen , who had chilled their southern blood , that morning , on the top of Mount Washington ; a physician and his wife , from Conway ; a trader , of Burlington , and an old Squire , of the Green Mountains ; and two young married couples , all the way from Massachusetts , on the matrimonial jaunt . Besides these strangers , the rugged county of Coos , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-cutters , who had slain a bear in the forest and smitten off his paw. // I had joined the party , and had a moment 's leisure to examine them , before the echo of Ethan 's blast returned from the hill . Not one , hut many echoes had caught up the harsh and tuneless sound , untwisted its complicated threads , and found a thousand aerial harmonies in one stern trumpet-tone . It was a distinct , yet distant and dreamlike symphony of melodious instruments , as if an airy hand had been hidden on the hill-side , and made faint music at the summons . No subsequent trial produced so clear , delicate , and spiritual a concert as the first . A field-piece was then discharged from the top of a neighboring hill , and gave birth to one long reverberation , which ran round the circle of mountains in an unbroken chain of sound , arid rolled away without a separate echo . A.fter these experiments , the cold atmosphere drove us all into the house , with the keenest appetites for supper . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were kindled in the parlor and bar-room , especially the latter , where the fireplace was built of rough stone , and might have contained the trunk of an old tree for a back-log . A man keeps a comfortable hearth when his own forest is at his very door . In the parlor , when the evening was fairly set in , we held our hands before our eyes , to shield them from the ruddy glow , and began a pleasant variety of conversation . The mineralogist and the physician talked about the invigorating qualities of the mountain air , and its excellent effect on lEthan Crawford 's father , an old man of seventy-five , with the unbroken frame of middle life . The two brides and the doctor 's wife held a whispered discussion , which , by their frequent titterings and a blush or two , seemed to have reference to the trials or enjoyments of the matrimonial state . The bridegrooms sat together in a corner , rigidly silent , like quakers whom the spirit moveth not , being still in the odd predicament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain Squire chose me for his companion , and described the difficulties he had met with , half a century ago , in traveling from the Connecticut river through the Notch to Conway , now a single day 's journey , though it had cost him eighteen . The Georgians held the album between them , and favored us with the few specimens of its contents , which they considered ridiculous enough to be worth hearing . One extract met with deserved applause . It was a Sonnet to the snow on Mount Washington , ' and had been contributed that very afternoon , hearing a signature of great distinction in magazines and annuals . The lines were elegant and full of fancy , but too remote from familiar sentiment , and cold as their subject , resembling those curious specimens of crystallized vapor , which I observed next day on the mountain-top . The poet was understood to be the young gentleman of the gold operaglass , who heard our laudatory remarks with the composure of a veteran . // Such was our party , and such their ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of guests assembled at the hearth , where these summer travelers were now sitting . I once had it in contemplation to spend a month hereabouts , in sleighing-time , for the sake of studying the yeomen of New-England , who then elbow each other through the Notch by hundreds , on their way to Portland . There could be no better school for such a purpose than lEthan Crawford 's inn . Let the student go thither in December , sit down with the teamsters at their meals , share their evening merriment , and repose with them at night , when every bed has its three occupants , and parlor , bar-room and kitchen are strewn with slumberers around the fire . Then let him rise before daylight , button his great-coat , muffle up his ears , and stride with the departing caravan a mile or two , to see how sturdily they make head against the blast . A treasure of characteristic traits will repay all inconveniences , even should a frozen nose be of the number . The conversation of our party soon became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians , who believed that the father and mother of their race were saved from a deluge by ascending the peak of Mount Washington . The children of that pair have been overwhelmed , and found no such refuge . In the mythology of the savage , these mountains were afterwards considered sacred and inaccessible , full of unearthly wonders , illuminated at lofty heights by the blaze of precious stones , and inhabited by deities , who sometimes shrouded them-* selves in the snow-storm , and came down on the lower world . There are few legends more poetical that that of the Great Carbuncle ' of the White Mountains . The belief was communicated to the English settlers , and is hardly yet extinct , that a gem , of such immense size as to be seen shining miles away , hangs from a rock over a clear , deep lake , high up among the hills . They who had once beheld its splendor , were enthralled with an unutterable yearning to possess it . But a spirit guarded that inestimable jewel , and bewildered the adventurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , life was worn away in the vain search for an unearthly treasure , till at length the deluded one went up the mountain , still sanguine as in youth , but returned no more . On this theme , methinks I could frame a tale with a deep moral . The hearts of the pale-faces would not thrill to these superstitions of the red men , though we spoke of them in the centre of their haunted region . The habits and sentiments of that departed people were too distinct from those of their successors to find much real sympathy . It has often been a matter of regret to me , that I was shut out from the most peculiar field of American fiction , by an inability to see any romance , or poetry , or grandeur , or beauty in the Indian character , at least , till such traits // were pointed out by others . I do abhor an Indian story . Yet no writer can be more secure of a permanent place in our literature , than the biographer of the Indian chiefs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished from the earth , gives him a right to be placed on a classic shelf , apart from the merits which xviii sustain him there . I made inquiries whether , in his researches about these parts , our mineralogist had found the three Silver Hills , ' which an Indian sachem sold to an Englishman , nearly two hundred years ago , and the treasure of which the posterity of the purchaser have been lookgin for ever since . But the man of science had ransacked every hill along the Saco , and knew nothing of these prodigious piles of wealth . By this time , as usual with men on the eve of great adventure , we had prolonged our session deep into the night , considering how early we were to set out on our six miles ' ride to the foot of Mount Washington . There was now a general breaking-up . I scrutinized the faces of the two bridegrooms , and saw but little probability of their leaving the bosom of earthly bliss , in the first week of the honey-moon , and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor , when I felt how sharp the wind was , as it rushed through a broken pane , and eddied between the chinks of my unplastered chamber , did I anticipate much alacrity on my own part , though we were to seek for the Great Carbuncle .
