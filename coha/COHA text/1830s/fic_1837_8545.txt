TO EDWIN FORREST Esq. , ( COMEDIAN ) THIS TRAGEDY IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED , BY THE AUTHOR . PREFACE . Before I close this manuscript for publication , I deem it incumbent upon me , to express to my friends , my gratitude for the very liberal support they have afforded me , in my professional career . Some few years back I arrived at New Orleans , a perfect stranger ; and the kindness of the inhabitants of this city fostered my earliest efforts . Presuming upon your former favors , I respectfully place before you , for perusal , the following publication , " with all its imperfections on its head ; " and that , the literary and commercial interests of his country may continue to flourish , is the earnest and fervent prayer , of THE AUTHOR . DRAMATIS PERSON . WILFRED . LORD EDGAR . EARL MONMOUTH . ALASTER . ETHELWOOD . SIR WALTER ARCHBERRY . CASWALLER . GULBERTH . STRANBERG . KING . EDWERTH . Conspirators , Knights , Courtiers , and Ladies . ELGINA . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulberth I tell thee , Stranburg , there never was a Soldier , better mettl 'd than my father ; He fought , and won , in nine goodly battles . Stran . Stranberg Each step thou tak'st , thou dost increase in Number ; some paces back thou did'st count but five . Gul . Gulberth Thou dost mistake ; I have not liv 'd seventy Years , so to forget myself . Stran . Stranberg I am right . Gul . Gulberth Then my memory does me not justice ; For ' t is seldom I err in my reck'ning ; Let me see  --  How many years have pass 'd Since our army return 'd from the crusade ? Stran . Stranberg Scarce one . Gul . Gulberth Right , right , I always make my reck'ning good . Though thou art of Norman blood , I have seen Some sparks of honesty kindle in thee . Lord Edgar , whom I serve , and love not more Than servant should , hath noted thee ; and , if Thou lack'st employ , will give thee place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind ? Gul . Gulberth Truly he 's impetuous and splenetic At times ; but he 's rich , powerful , and great : I lov 'd his father , as my very blood . He had another son , of bastard birth , With qualities a king might boast to own ; He , was his father 's son . Stran . Stranberg Lives he in England now ? Gul . Gulberth When my old master died , Lord Edgar ( whom May the saints forgive ) , thrust him from the door ; Poor Wilfred ! I lov 'd him as my own : He , took his mother by the hand , one morn , And went unto Lord Edgar 's house ; My master , furious that I let them in , Rush 'd at me with his sword ; but , Wilfred 's arm Caught his uplifted weapon ; upon which , In language most opprobrious , he vented Forth his spleen , with " wanton ! " bastard ! " and words Of cruellest nature . Wilfred , still patient , Answering his fury but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage , On the river 's banks ; where , lack of food soon Ended her existence ; and , Wilfred fled , None knew whither . Poor boy ! I lov 'd Him better than myself ; and the recital Of his wrongs , makes my old wither 'd heart bleed afresh . Stran . Stranberg By my troth ! my eyes do ache to hear thee . I choose not Lord Edgar for my master ; I am well suited now . Gul . Gulberth Stranburg , I honor thee : thy hand , I pr'ythee ; I do sometimes vaguely talk , when childish Age comes on : years , seventy , have I counted ; And , do confess to thee , I often feel As tho ' I were again within the cradle , Craving some toy to sport with , to wile away Dull hours . But come , ' t is the beginning time Of labor ; he that will not work , deserveth Not his hire , and wrongs the master that doth Employ him . ( Exit Gulberth and Stranburg . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell thee , Ethelwood , I like him not ; Tho ' young , he 's wise , ay , and ambitious too ; A loyal subject , tho of Saxon blood ; Devoted to his king , and country 's good , He stands a bulwark ' gainst my dearest hopes . Elgina 's love he boasts ; her smile is his ; And once , I saw him quaff the nectar of Her lips ; it made my blood quick ebb and flow , And my whole frame with indignation shook . Alaster is a rock will wreck my hopes , Unless I pilot well . Ethel . Ethelwood What says Earl Monmouth to your suit ? Edgar . Lord Edgar Elgina , long hath been a promis 'd bride ; Yet , I , by cunning art and tales well forg 'd , Have won Earl Monmouth 's favor and his love ; By inuendoes dark , portray 'd this boy , Alaster , in colors black as night ; And , yesterday , I ask 'd the fair Elgina 's Hand ; thereby to bind Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to this ? Edgar . Lord Edgar Promis 'd me an answer on the morrow . Ethel . Ethelwood Should you get England 's throne and crown , He , surely , could not then refuse your suit . Edgar . Lord Edgar Right . By sums of gold , already have I Many secret friends secur 'd within the very Entrails of the palace ; therefore , the path In some degree is smooth , that leads me to The goal I seek , but , thorns will sometimes grow In fairest track , and prick the walker on His way ; but , thou my friend , must root them up , And plant my road with flowers ; see our friends Sow well the seed , and doubt not , but thou shalt Reap a golden harvest . Ethel . Ethelwood Fear not , my lord ; thy many favors In grateful memory , I bear , and to Repay the debt , I set to work with prompt Alacrity ; not doubting of success . ( Exit . ) Edgar . Lord Edgar The Saxon has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ;  --  they thirst for it .  --  A throne ! How proud the seat  --  how lofty is The name ! Once seated there , I dare confront , And mock , the murmurs of the prating world . ( Exit . ) SCENE II . A Garden , ( Alaster and Elgina discovered , seated . ) Ala . Alaster Behold , my love , how bright the jewell 'd sky , Enwrapt in smiles the starry host appears In sportive pleasure round night 's queenly bride . Gemm 'd roof of earth , the great etherial plain That looks o'er sea o'er city , and o'er alpine height , And loud proclaims the power and glory Of that king , who sits in Heaven enthron 'd . My Elgina , ' t was such a night as this , When ' mid the fury of conflicting hosts , My strength exhausted , weary nature Lull 'd me to repose , e'en on the bodies Of those who slept on the cold lap of death ; ' T was then I dreamt of home and thee ; I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee , But waking from my sleep , I felt the Misery of disappointed love . Elg . Elgina Thou art a flatterer still . Ala . Alaster Sweet , thou do'st not think me so . Once , Thy tongue trembl 'd to speak the love thy Heart was fraught with ,  --  Thy blushes answer 'd my appeal ; but , now The times have chang 'd , and change of dearest import , Is to me , the true avowal of thy Dear heart 's love . Elg . Elgina Alaster , I am thine ; for ever , thine ! ( embraces him . ) Ala . Alaster Thrice happy hour , I hail thee with delight ! Be thy hallowed moments ever bless 'd . Elg . Elgina But ' t is a warring time , a bleeding age ; Each blast of wind some evil tidings blow : My heart , foreboding ill , is not at rest . Ala . Alaster What fatal cloud obscures the sunshine of That beauteous face ? That front , where lavish Nature bount'ously hath set her seal Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jealous eye doth view Our nightly meetings : Lord Edgar oft ' comes Here , and with my father frequent council holds ; Often they speak of me ,  --  at times of you ; And , then , I 've noted on Lord Edgar 's brow A chilling frown ,  --  A biting of the lip , anger-shifting eyes , And other marks , that plainly told me Thou had'st no friend in him ; therefore , shun him , He were a dangerous foe . My father , Whom thou know'st prizes honor as his life , Will doubtless question thee ; for , yesterday Lord Edgar told some tale of knightly arms , Tending to thy dishonor ; my father Started , his cheek was pale , but credence gave he none : I saw the fiend lurk in the villian 's eye . Ala . Alaster Were he ten times a potentate or prince . I 'd with his life my reputation mend . Elg . Elgina Be not rash , Alaster , I may be wrong , Hast thou done aught to injure him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ala . Alaster Sav 'd his caitiff life . Elg . Elgina Ha ! Speak , love . Ala . Alaster Thou shalt know , then . Lord Edgar and myself , With the crusading army , battl 'd side by side ; On that proud day , when bodies numberless O'erspread the plain , within a sword 's length we stood ; The last gleam of the red sun sank iu ocean 's lap , And left the crescent warriors and ourselves Upon the field of blood and strife ; Shrieks , groans , and curses were silenc 'd By the loud clarion , and the clash of arms ; Lord Edgar , with his soldiers , hard press 'd By turban 'd warriors , o'er number 'd by the foe , Gave way , wading through very gore , for safety ; Just then , from a covert , by wood enclos 'd , The enemy 's horse sprang forth ; I call 'd for aid , then darted to his rescue ; Before I reach 'd the spot his coward friends , That with him fled , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his conquerer 's feet , Imploring mercy knelt . Above his head , A glittering scymiter was held to strike ; When with a blow , I laid the foeman dead , Then bore Lord Edgar to his tent unhurt . ' Till now I ne'er had spoke of this ; nor , should The tale be utter 'd , save in mine own defence . Elg . Elgina What said Lord Edgar ? Ala . Alaster Thank 'd me with icy coldness . Elg . Elgina Oh , base return ! Oh , cold ingratitude ! A deed well worthy thy great name and blood , My gallant hero . Earth 's loud trumpet tongue , Whose blast exalts to honor and to fame Hath not done justice to thy arms in war ; But ' t is ever thus , Alaster ; the world still Holds him greatest , whose deeds are heard , Not seen ; but , I will be thy world  --  admire , and Reward thee . Ala . Alaster Bless thee , my Elgina ! I have not words To speak the extacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elgina Restrain thy transport . Night wears apace , The dews are falling , and chilling breezes Fill the air . Fare thee well , Alaster ; and , On the morrow , see my father ; his consent Obtain 'd , in weal or woe , I 'll constant ever be . Ala . Alaster Through those pearly drops thine eyes emit , I see a soul of purity and truth , Where virtue , glory , honor sits enthron 'd . Elg . Elgina See not Lord Edgar ; what hath pass 'd Breathe not to mortal . Ala . Alaster Trust me I will not ' till more I hear ; But , Elgina , of this be well assur 'd , A true knight 's sword , can not in its scabbard Rest , when honor claims its service . But , Content thee , love . ( enter Earl Monmouth ) Mon . Earl Monmouth How 's this ; my daughter and Alaster here ? Elg . Elgina Ah , my father ! ( goes to him ) Ala . Alaster My benefactor ! Mon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , Elgina . Alaster , ' t is not well . Meetings by stealth , I never can approve . She was once thy promis 'd bride ; but , now  --  Ala . Alaster Have I offended Mon . Earl Monmouth Boy ; for such I deem thee , still ; thy father Was my friend . At the festal board have we Drain 'd dry the sparkling goblet ; hand in hand In the field , the lists , and on the hunting Track , have we together fought and bled . Alas ! he is no more . Ala . Alaster And , I , of all his sons stand here the last . While life yet hover 'd on his dying lips , He bade me win thy love and friendship , Cost whatsoe'er it might . Mon . Earl Monmouth Well , there 's my hand , and , I defy the voice Of man , speak it truth , To call it other than an honest one ; And , tho ' time has robb 'd it of some strength , Yet is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperious voice of honor bids . My child go in . Elg . Elgina Father , I obey . Good night , Alaster . Ala . Alaster Sweet , good night ; repose go with thee . ( exit Elgina . ) Mon . Earl Monmouth Alaster , you must see my child no more . Be not amaz 'd at what I 've spoken . Ala . Alaster See her no more ! then take my life  --  take all . Without Elgina , life would be one drear , Eternal night ; beamless ; and , Oh ! how bereft Of charm , and all things bright . What is my crime ? Mon . Earl Monmouth Has't mark 'd in me , of late a change ; A colder welcome than I was wont to greet Thee with ? Ala . Alaster I have  --  Fain would I know the cause . Mon . Earl Monmouth Thy honor 's stain 'd ; Thy , once fair name is sullied . Ala . Alaster If , the foul and venom 'd breath of slander , Hath , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the caitiff 's name ; set him here ; Be , he of Herculean strength , my sword shall force Confession from his dastard heart . His tongue did speak a lie . Mon . Earl Monmouth I have heard thee coward call 'd ; Janus-fac 'd ! A treason plotter ; and the Norman 's tool . Ala . Alaster And the villian lives , whose tongue dar 'd utter it ! I could name actions , in my country 's cause That loud would give the lie ;  --  but , let that pass . His name ? That I may send his envenom 'd breath Back to his heart , to breed corruption there . Mon . Earl Monmouth Boy ; there are other cowards , than the man Who quakes and trembles , at a sword unsheath 'd ; Nor , does it test true courage , to brawl , and Draw at every slight offence your weapon ; Bullies in brothels , and other haunts of Crime and vice , who , nothing know of courage But the name , will out with sword , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boast their deeds noble ; Ay , and men will call them brave . Should I reveal to thee , the name of him Who stain 'd thy honor ;  --  thy valor doubted ;  --  Call 'd thee coward  --  How would'st thou act ? Ala . Alaster Make him answer with his blood . Mon . Earl Monmouth Well spoken boy ; thy blood is Saxon still . To-morrow thou shalt know , Farewell ! ( exit abruptly . ) Ala . Alaster Stay !  --  He 's gone ; whom can he mean ? Lord Edgar can not be so vile , so base ; Yet did not Elgina say he spoke me ill ; Be calm my rising heart ; thy struggles check . Coward ! my blood boils in my heated veins ; I do abhor a term so vile , so base . Oh patience ! Beneath the ' nointed banner of the cross I swore , My honor , with my life I would maintain .

Lord Edgar , for our Country much hath done ; lent the state large sums , To fill our sinking coffers ; added , to which , He is of Saxon blood , and worthy By his birth , to sit on England 's throne . A king in him would raise the Saxon Interest , and abridge the Norman power ; Under whose yoke we long have groan 'd Arch . Sir Walter Archberry There is much wisdom in thy words . Cas . Caswaller If , to be a good man , is to be a Rich one , then is Lord Edgar worthy . Full well I know , judgment and wisdom had His father ,  --  Our laws improved , And did more good than any since Ethel . Ethelwood We now in slavery live  --  naught better . An English throne should bear an English monarch . Cas . Caswaller Well , I am with you , gentlemen ; Command my sword . But secret must our meetings still remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Ever on the watch ; they have their spies abroad . Ethel . Ethelwood The keenest spy by gold is silenc 'd . Take , thou , no heed of that , our party 's strong ; Could we but win Earl Monmouth , all were well . I know him wise ; well vers 'd in man ; can Read a subtle plot , ere it be ripe for action ; Could he be bought  --  but this I doubt . Arch . Sir Walter Archberry Lord Edgar seeks his daughter , Elgina 's Hand , that accomplish 'd , ' twill blind the Earl Fast to our cause ; by that achieving , our Securement will be perfect ; for his voice , And birth , would cover our defections . ( enter Lord Edgar . ) Edgar . Lord Edgar Worthy Archberry and Ethelwood , your hands ; We have been soldiers , the cross our standard ; Our object England 's good and fame ; still Let our country 's glory lead us onward . Gentlemen , I 'm well appriz 'd of what you Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions of your loyalty I 've heard , for which I thank you ; and , doubt not But it shall meet a fair return ; when king , If such should be my lot , you all shall share The benefit , power can bestow .

( exit all but Edgar . ) At length the height is compass 'd  --  that proud height , To which on eagle 's wings I 've dar 'd to soar . Elgina never can reject a king  --  Yes , she will be mine ; and , thus I quaff , E'en to the bottom , the ambrosial cup of hope . Be boyant , my proud heart ! Get England 's crown , And fair Elgina 's hand shall soon be mine .  --  Great England 's crown ! I 'd swim in seas of blood , And from the crimson waves would pluck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brow . Earl Monmouth do I fear ; his keen mind May scan my mystery . Away , with fears and doubts ! The crown 's the glorious prize that lures me on , And I 'll not pause while climbing the assent . Away with conscience  --  justice  --  all the checks That lie upon my path ! the way to rise , Is to forego them all ; when once a king , None will enquire the road by which I rose . ( exit . ) END OF ACT I. ACT II . SCENE I. Landscape . Enter Stranger , miserably attired . Stran . Stranberg The goal I 've reach 'd , safe in my native land . Five years a stranger to its soil I 've been : I love the pebbles that I tread upon ; Each thing I see , bears a familiar look . Hail to my birth place ! I am thine again . There the old steepl 'd church , known well by all , It 's roof grown grey with age , and tott'ring with decay ; And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've with delight its glossy waters plough 'd . Boyhood , thou art past ! but , yet how sweet To con thy happy days , and from memory 's store Quaff pleasure 's cup . Ah , joy ! thou'st miss 'd thy place ; Thou can'st not in this mansion dwell .  --  Go hence . This heart , alas ! how sadly tenanted ; Deep in its core , gaunt misery sits enthron 'd , The peerless monarch of a dessert world . Dame Fortune once was kind to me ; my food She did prepare ; forsooth , I now must buy it , And , if the means I lack , whereby to live , In faith , I needs must die a starving death . For an earl 's son , and , one not quite an ass , ' Though peradventure , not o'er bless 'd with brains , My fate , I think , a hard one . They tell me I am bastard born  --  They tell me truth . The fault 's not mine ; so let my father answer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's brows , While spurious offsprings claim a father 's love From those , who ne'er begot them ; but , for those , Alike the victim and the monument Of a frail mother 's shame , e'en to the core They feel that woe , from whence there 's no relief . My life made weary , by my bastard birth , Sent me to foreign climes ; but , even there , Base-born was shouted in mine echoing ear . I have my members well as other men ; Flesh , blood , sinew , nerve , yet , I am not lov 'd , Nor look 'd on with a cloudless sunny face . There stands the palace , near which , my brother dwells . Shall I see him ? Will he own me ? I 'll try . I shall find him in costly , gaudy robes , While I , his outcast brother , live in misery . I 'll try his heart , once more ; time , may have chang 'd It into one , fit for a human bosom . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( retires . ) Enter Gulberth , Stranburg , Edwerth , and Normans . Gul . Gulberth I say , we are not better than the slaves , Save , they can not sell us , as their cattle , And lash our backs , as they , their asses do ; Yet , they deserve the yoke , who bear it , And , lack the soul to shake it from their necks . Edw . Edwerth Thoud'st better not so loudly talk my friend ; Or , from your mouth , thy tongue we 'll pluck . Gul . Gulberth Not speak ! that 's harder still . to bear . Normans , full well I know , you will not shrink From murder  --  or aught else that 's vile and base . All . All Down with the old Saxon fool !

Stranberg ' T is nature . Men become nervous , sour 'd , As age creeps on ; their fretful weakness We should o'erlook , and bear with patience .

A scar upon my forehead  --  my chin o'ergrown With an unseemly beard  --  Beauty it hath none . Therefore , thou can'st not read that index of The mind . Thus in misery 's disguising livery Array 'd appearing now most foul ; if cleans 'd , Perchance , some fairer index might disclose . Yet , know thou this , the face oft'times belies The heart .
