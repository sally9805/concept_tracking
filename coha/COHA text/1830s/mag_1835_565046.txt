txt WE hear much , in our country , of the freedom of the press and comparisons are constanily drawn between our liberty , in this respect , and that of many of the old European governments . Public opinion is represented here , in perfect freedom , through the press ; while , in despotic governments , the opinions of the rulers alone find their way in print to the eyes of the ruled . Both are consistent with the different governments ; here , the people rule - and , upon the subject of politics , as rulers , their doctrines are circulated by the press ; there , individuals rule , and theirs also are sent abroad in the same way . The advantage of comparison remains with us ; inasmuch as a popular is better than a despotic or monarchical government . In other respects , however , our press , unless it becomes licentious , is no better off than theirs ; upon matters disconnected with politics , the press of the greater part of Europe is free , and expresses its sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with here . Their newspapers being fewer , by far , than ours , and less dependent upon the patronage of individuals , they display a boldness and honesty , upon general subjects of a literary and domestic interest , which , we regret to say , is not always exhibited among us . If a subject of popular interest arises in the United States , the newspapers seldom undertake to enlighten the public mind upon it . The editors take their tone from the people ; and if the // prejudices of the great mass of their subscribers , or of those whom they hope to make their subscribers , differ entirely from their own , they are either compelled to be silent altogether , or to espouse the views of those for whom they cater . If they were to come out with an opinion-honestly adopted , too-which was at variance with the persuasions of a large number of those who fill their subscription-list , they would forfeit their claims upon so much of their patronage , and suffer starvation , ( an editor 's martyrdom ) for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore - when a popular question of interest comes up - for the editors , each for himself , to decide which carries , or is likely to carry , the majority ; and , taking into account the ignorance and prejudices of the community , they form their estimate of the loss or gain likely to ensue from one side or the other ; and the side which appears to be the most profitable , they adopt . This is the general rule ; we wish we could say that , there are many honorable exceptions - but we can not . The most , that high- minded editors dare to do , is , when they find that they can not bring their minds to the popular bent , to be silent , and let the question alone - to stand aloof , and permit opinions to grow up and be circulated , which they conscientiously believe to be false , without any attempt , on thier part , to give a right direction to the public sentiment , or to correct its erroneous views and tendencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in an absolute monarchy , the press would not attack the crown , upon any subject , if its judgment were openly expressed ; but , as the government have enough to do , in order to keep its political machinery in operation , private opinions - upon subjects not politieal , as coming from the throne - are declared . Nor is it more unlikely , that the press would act against the crown , that is the people , in the United States ; it is neither more nor less than quarreling with its own means of support . It dare not do it . It is too dependent to do it . Another cause operates to lessen its independence here , which does not act so forcibly in England or on the continent of Europe ; and this is , that here , a great portion of the income to a newspaper establishment is derived from regular subscribers ; whereas , in Europe there are comparatively few persons who read , that subscribe for a newspaper . They purchase one or more , every morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they vary their dish , much in the same manner , as they vary their daily meals . A newspaper , that is beforehand in any interesting news , finds a greater sale than any other ; and the sentiments of its editor are spread abroad by the aid of some stirring incident , political , domestic , or foreign - and not by reason of the peculiar doctrines usually contained in the journal . // In matters of a political nature , we know exactly what to expect from our periodical press . This subject forms an indispensable topic to most newspapers ; and they start with the espousal of the causes of certain men and measures , and exert all their talent , ingenuity and information , to further these alone . Editors know that their subscribers are of the same party with themselves ; and there is a tacit agreement between them , that , on the one side , the newspaper shall support the cause , and that the favorers of the cause shall , by their subscriptions , support their advocate . It is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship ; and we think it will appear , that this agreement of support has extended its conditions still further of late , by adding to the duty of editors , not to express an opinion , upon any subject whatever , which shall conflict with the prejudices of their subscribers . We expect to show that , when we rely upon the judgment of a newspaper , we are leaning upon a very weak and unstable staff ; inasmuch as newspapers , instead of taking the lead and direction of popular sentiment , humbly and sneakingly follow after it . Such a character as an independent editor , would hardly be allowed to exist in New-England ; and we do not think so severe a despotism is exercised , upon general subjects , over the press of any country , as of our own - a despotism , too , of the most illiberal and intolerant nature . Let an editor fearlessly oppose popular madness , upon any subject- and there is such a disease known , at times , as madness , downright phrensy , among the people - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subscribers , and be stript of his support . We have been led to this train of remark , from observing the course of the newspaper press , in relation to our Catholic brethren ; and , more especially , their conduct towards the Ursuline Community , whose affairs have for some time engrossed public attention ; and towards every one , who has dared to express his views in favor of that institution . We do not wish , in this place , to discuss the merits of the controversy , except so far as it may bear upon the topic we are mainly considering ; and we shall endeavor to look upon the controversy , not so much with a view to its merits on the one side and the other , as to point out what we conceive the deplorable state of the press , and its tendency to be instrumental in abusing , in the most unprincipled manner , individual character and reputation - arising , we think , from its degrading subserviency to popular clamor and prejudice . We shall notice only the Boston newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its vicinity ; and we shall speak of the various newspapers , only as xve know them from personal observation , and from some little knowledge we have of their various conductors . // It xviii be recollected that , ever since the destruction of the Convent , this subject has been the most interesting topic of newspaper discussion . From the outset , various pieces have appeared in the newspapers , intended to discredit the Ursulines and their friends ; and if any one will take the pains to revert to the files , they will find one piece after another , in different newspapers , the object of which has been , to throw discredit and mistrust upon the Ursuline Community , and to prepare the public for the subsequent statements of Miss Reed . At length , her book , entitled Six Months in a Convent , ' made its appearance - preceded , however , by notices of the work , and remarks , which should excite a strong curiosity to read the book . After it was published , several of the newspapers contained the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their editors unwilling to betray their consciences by an open approbation - were silent . Thus stood the newspaper press then ; and thus it has stood ever since . No doubts or criticism , upon the genuineness of the book , appeared in some ; praise , overwhelming praise was in the columns of the rest . One single newspaper- the Catholic Sentinel - appeared against the book ; and , by its intemperate zeal and harsh language , added strength to the cause of the anti-Catholics - a fair offset , however , to some of the minor and more vulgar and abusive publications , which especially espoused the cause of Miss Reed . In our remarks , then , we shall notice the conductors of the press as divided into two classes : those who determined , in the face of common sense and common reason and common justice , to lead on the attack upon the characters and reputations of the Ursulines - urged on by the bigotry of their opponents , or the hope of gain ; and those , who believed the whole affair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her friends - actuated by bigotry , a determination to put down Catholicism , by means fair or foul , as they could , and a hope of gain , - those , we say , who discredited her book , but were cowed and afraid to speak out their opinions , because , forsooth , public opinion - that is , their subscribers - were prejudiced against truth and blind to conviction . If we are near the truth - and we mean to keep within its strictest bounds - we ask our readers how much reliance can be placed upon our independent press , upon any subject . We ask them to xveigh well its character for firmness and incorruptibility . We ask them not to place confidence in absurd statements , because they appear in print . But we have , perhaps , jumped to our conclusion too soon ! Let , therefore , what we have asked be borne in mind , while we proceed to descant upon some of the leading journals , that have prominently figured , or that have been notoriously silent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Courier claims attention . // When the Convent was first destroyed , this press came out , with much indignation , against the rioters ; but , from some cause or other , was soon silent . A little time elapsed , and it began to find fault with various friends of the institution ; it quarreled with the Report of the Boston Investigating Committee ; it denied the claim of the Ursulines upon the State for indemnity ; it contained articles , abusive of the Catholics generally ; it received a letter and published it , as Miss Rebecca T. Reed 's , knowing it not to be in her hand-writing , and knowing it not to be her composition ; it lauded the work of Miss Reed , knowing that the causes which led to its publication were not those put forth by the Committee of Publication - and knowing the members of that Committee , and aware of the artifices resorted to give it an undue influence over the public mind . It treated the subject as genuine truth ; the book , as gospel - containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Reed , knowing it to have been wrilten by the author of the Preliminary Remarks , which letter contained statements known to be incorrect , in points too material to be passed over . If that newspaper , or any other , becomes the organ of politics , we know how far to make allowances ; but , upon all other subjects , we hold that they are bound to be strictly honest . That the Courier has not the truth , so much as its subscribers in holy fear and reverence , we can entertain no doubt . As an instance , we will take its criticism of the Review of the Lady Superior 's Answer , being a vindication of INliss Reed ; the title of which rather amused us , telling the secret at starting , viz : that it was no review , but a vindication - thereby falsifying its first page , which declares , that the reviewers come to the work with impartiality , and a desire to know the truth . This review , of all flimsy productions , struck us as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it last month , had it not been beneath criticism . It certainly was not worth a battle between its publishers and another office , who , it seems , also had it in press - its sponsors being many ; and yet , what notice does the Courier bestow upon it ? Is the truth told , that the pamphlet is a catchpenny affair , miserably got up for a miserable purpose ? Where is the usual literary sagacity of the sapient editor ? Where his keen insight ? Could he not see through the loop 'd and window 'd raggedness ' of this production ? No ; his journal lauds the review to the skies ; it is a logical and able production ; a perfect vindication . Let us quote one of its refutations , so as to place the sagacity of the Courier , and the pungency and force of the reviewer , as well as the point reviewed , at one and the same time , before the reader . In the Preliminary Remarks to the Lady Superior 's reply , there is an illustration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Reed 's stories , which struck us , at the time , // The Press amd th' &amp;or&amp;vemt Questio with great force , and which is verifying itself more and more every day . We give the remarks , and the criticism upon them , one after the other ; and , without a single further comment , offer it as a fair specimen of the force and pungency ' of the review , so much admired by the Courier . The sage publishers ( page 28 ) ask-with a triumphant sneer at the Boston Committee and Judge F. , as if the question were unanswerable-how a young girl , in the humble walks of life , could have been the instrument of getting up a mob , to destroy the Ursuline Convent by violence If they had any recollection of the history of mankind , they would see that nothing is more easy . Do they not remember the Popish plot , in Euglish history ? - that , only about one hundred and fifty years ago , ( 1678 ) Titus Gates , a man of infamous character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehood artd lying invention , threw all England into a state of such dreadful alarm , that , for a long time , the x*hole population of London thanked God , as soon as they opened their eyes in the morning , that they had not been murdered or burnt up , by the Catholics , during the night ! Some of the best blood of England was shed , by means of this wretch 's perjuries , aided by a few others , acting perhaps as a ' Committee of Publication , ' and vouchers for his veracity . The government were imposed upon , and Parliament gravely resolved , that the whole kingdom was in imminent danger , from a hellish Popish plot ; and the House of Commons actually expelled a member for venturing to doubt its reality . Innocent men were capitally convicted , by juries , against the strongest circumstantial and positive evidence ; and the death , imprisonment , or exile , of many excellent , pious , and distinguished persons , were the awful conseqimences of the lies of one worthless individual . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the truth of the case , nor until the wretch was convicted of perjury . Even then , such hold had error got on the popular mind , and so fortified by its own ingenuity in finding other circumstances to support it , that probably a rreater part of the whole people of England died in the belief of the plot , which , for a time , destroyed the happiness of millions , and had no foundation whatever , but in the impudent invention of an abandoned individual . It is also worthy of remark , that this wretch was first of the Episcopal church , afterwards a Catholic , and then was re-converted to his first faith . ' - Lady Superior 's . Lqaswer . A.s to the insinuation , respecting the wages of iniquity , ' ( about which , the public were satisfied long ago by the publishers ) and the comparison of Miss R. to Titus Gates , Joanna Southcote , and Matthias the prophet , we only say , that they are excellent specimens of the candor and argument of the learned counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way : Matthias , the prophet , was charged with murder ; therefore , Miss R. is a liar ! Q* . E. D. ' - Vindication , *c . We have spent more time upon the Courier than it deserves perhaps ; hut we are desirous of doing our part , in opening the eves of the public to the little confidence , that is to be placed in a periodical press , liable to he swayed by motives that may he called anything hut honorable . The . Idvocate , we can readily pardon - its editor being the reputed author of the Preliminary Remarks in Miss Reed 's book . We feel no indignation at the abuse of the press in this instance and can only smile at the religious zeal of its editor , who must be acknowledged to possess some wit , and considerable secretiveness , notwithstanding his declared hostility to all secret combinations . He is , undoubtedly , the General Grand High King ' of the anti-Catholic Fraternity . The arneriectrt Traveller , we have reason to believe , is bound // to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally known . The Commercial Gazette has acted , with one exception , for an enemy , a more honorable part than either of those we have mentioned . It has allowed its columns , however , to he open to personal attacks upon individuals , towards whom we have always entertained the highest respect ; and has allowed the publishers of Miss Reed 's hook to make their columns a vehicle for attacking , in the most wanton and shameful manner , a reputahle family , upon the false supposition , that the head of it was the author of a letter published in a New-York nexvspaper , giving an account of Miss Reed . When we read that communication , we felt that our press had truly become a pest and a disgrace . We would not have believed , that a paper in the city , ignorant of the facts of the case , would have heen willing to he instrumental in going into the bosom of any family , and striking a dastardly blow at its character and reputation . We could not realize , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that any person or persons could influence a respectable journal to publish an article - even had it been true - upon a subject of that nature , at least without the signatures of the authors of it It is true , notice was given , that the columns were open to either side ; but , is that any apology ? Is it any palliation to the offence of the assassin , that recourse can he had to the law , and the crime he punished ? Is a family , or an individual , to he compelled to come before the public in this manner ? The attack was made and we waited impatiently to see what would be the result . We felt assured , that the names of the authors of that communication would be exposed . Our astonishment was great - aye , greater than our first surprise - when a card appeared , stating that the article was inserted at the request of the publishers of Miss Reed 's book ; and that it was a mere business transaction to help the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not denied . We then made personal inquiry into the subject ; and we were informed , that the authors of that villainous communication could not be ascertained . This gross and outrageous attack , in the columns of a daily journal , read by thousands of people , is thus permitted to be made , and its real authors lie concealed . We have perused the letters of one of those publishers to one of the injured parties . He says , in excuse , that this was done to prevent the injury , that the publication of the New-York letter would have upon the hook of Miss Reed ; and we have no doubt - from the perusal of that letter , and from the circumstances that it passed through the hands of Russell , Odiorne &amp; Co. , her publishers - that the communication in the Gazette , which first roused our indignation , and put us upon the alert , came from the Committee of Publication . // It xviii now be seen , why we asked , in our last number , for the names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far they act from a prayerful consideration ' of their duty . We have a right to know , when we see this spirit of persecution , this tomahawk and scalping-knife work upon the characters and reputations of individuals going on , who wield the instruments . If they be honest , they will unmask ; if they be dishonest , they will keep concealed . The authenticity of Miss Reed 's narrative is nothing , in point of importance , to the manner which her friends have chosen to make it out . The baseness and wickedness of the Ursuline Community is of trifling importance , compared with the method adopted to force the people into an unsatisfying and persecuting belief of it . There is no necessity for concealment ; it is disgraceful to the intelligence of the community , that it has been so long submitted to . Before this article shall meet the public eye , there will be , in New-England , no such being as an Ursuline . Persecution has driven them away . ' Still , we want to know the names of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain behind . Yes ; to our regret , to the shame of all New-England , the Ursulines are going to another land - compelled to stay , in order to testify - against their will , too - against the destroyers of their home ; denied the aid of the government , to which they resorted for protection ; despoiled of their home and habitation ; insulted daily in their temporary abode , by scoundrels who derive confidence from our daily press - they are about to verify the prediction of their counsel before the Legislature to go to their ruined habitation , shed over it a last , a bitter tear , and depart forever from a spot consecrated by years of residence and of happy usefulness . They must seek some better land , where the strong arm of the law shall unite itself with the mild dictates of tolerance and religion , in shielding them from utter desolation and ruin . ' We have but little room left for any further remarks ; and we are sorry for it . We wished to take some notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the vituperative attacks of the rest were going on . We happen to know and esteem the conductors of the most respectable among the silent journals ; and we know the indignant feelings , which we have expressed in this article , are as strong in their breasts as in ours . They express themselves , in private , as fully and unconditionally as we have done in public ; but the readers of their respective papers are shut out from any knowledge of facts , and * much praise can not be bestowed on the active and noble efforts of the citizens of Roxbury to protect the Ursulines , in their prcseot residence - from which they will bave departed , reader , when you look over this page ! They bave made choice of a temporary harbor of safety , where they may abide for a time , till tbey reach that blessed shore , where the wicked cease from troubling , and the weary are at rest . ' // from the benefit of all opinions as coming from them . Upon this deeply interesting subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus left open to those who are stupid enough or wicked enough to advocate a cause upon the same principle that led Miss Reed 's publishers to sacrifice their sense of honor to the spirit of gain . We should be happy to be aided , in forming our judgment concerning this matter , by the conductors of the Daily . ildvertiser , for instance ; and by our friend of the Boston Jliliorning Post-leading papers on two political sides . We should be glad if the . iltlas - on whose shoulders rests , in a great measure , the cause of the man we honor above all other men , in a political light - would , notwithstanding the plain , downright orthodoxy of its senior editor , have helped us to get at the merits of the controversy ; and - what we conceive to be all-important , in deciding upon its merits - at the names of the authors of the various publications on the subject , more especially the names of the Committee of Publication . We believe he can tell us , if he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bis usual highmindedness , we think be might do so , did he carefully watch the recklessness and hardihood of their xvarfare. * V/e shall not pursue this subject further , for the present . It ofers much food for grave reflection . If followed through , the periodical newspaper press , of whose benefits so much has been said , will appear in a light little calculated to excite confidence or respect . The course of this controversy proves its liability to abuse ; and we *varn the people of this tendency to abuse , not so much from a peculiar interest taken by us , in this controversy , as from its affording a fair illustration of the readiness with which the press may be made an engine of oppression and wrong . Whatever change befalls our government , will be effected through the press , if we are not careful to keep our eyes open to the influences that act upon it . If prejudice can control it , if a fear of the loss of subscribers and patrons can make it silent , or change its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subscription-list , to make it the vehicle of any sentiments , the panderer to any power . Though we have confined ourselves , in this article , to a cursory view of the conduct of the Boston press , we can not con* An honorable exception , to the press in Boston , is afforded by a Baptist journal , in which one of the most respectable clergymen in this city , has published a judicious article , powerfully written , and containing opinions generally entertained by the most respectable portion of our community . The Evening Transcript , ' too - one of the silent journals , whose editor , we know , regards this question in its proper light - deserves some praise for its boldness , in one instance , whereby it lost a batch of subscribers . There is one fact we might as well mention here , in extenuation of the conduct of the editors . Where editors do not own the journal under their supervision , they are instructed , by the publishers , not to mar their pecuniary interest by any unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high gratification we have received , in witnessing the manner in which the leading journals in other cities have treated this Convent question. * Their course has in general heen diametrically opposed to that of our journals ; and though having nothing to lose hy a fair expression of their opinion in this instance , they are not to he lauded for their independence , they afford the fair and striking evidence of the fact - which we have essayed to prove - that , had the newspapers of this city been entirely uninfluenced , they would have expressed themselves fearlessly , in condemnation of the acts of wrong , violence , and persecution , so shamelessly perpetrated on the few members of a Roman Catholic convent.
