txt THIS work , tho ugh by a resident of New England , has , on account of its place of publication and the business connexions of the publishers , gained a much wider circulation in the Middle and Southern States , than in our own neighbourhood . Its intrinsic merit , and the profound interest attached to many of its details , have secured for it a favorable reception and a diligent perusal , wherever it has become known . We hope , by the present brief notice , to introduce it to the acquaintance of those of our readers , in whose way it may not have fallen , while we shall but echo the approving verdict of those who are not strangers to it . Dr. Brown conceived the plan of this work during a professional residence in St. Domingo in the years 1833 and 1834 ; and accordingly gathered all the materials for it , which local tradition and conversation with surviving eye and ear witnesses could furnish . The public archives of the nation contain few documents worthy of the name ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so recent date , as yet to leave many living chroniclers , as well as numerous vouchers in existing circumstances , institutions , and prejudices . For these reasons we should distrust the historian , who had not collected testimony on the spot ; and the graphic vividness , with which our author has portrayed the merits and alternating fortunes of the numerous parties in the long and bloody struggle for supremacy , shows that he has not interrogated his witnesses in vain . For earlier portions of his history , he professes to have followed with but little deviation the best authorities previously extant , carefully collating them on every point of doubt or difficulty . In his sketch of the later times and most'momentotis epochs of Hayti , he found himself compelled , for the most part , to mark out his own path . The work is written with singular clearness and precision . Places , dates , and minute incidents , are marked with punctilious exactness , yet not so as to give the narrative a jejune or unedifying aspect . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of a man , who conceives vividly whatever he writes , // and who regards language as but the transparent vehicle of thought . There is no affectation of fine rhetoric , no dressing up of pictures either to delight or to shock the imagination ; but scenes and characters are painted to the life , and then left to interpret themselves , to forge their own rhetoric and to impress their own moral . Our author writes not as a partisan . He has no political or ethical theory to build up ,  - -  no ulterior end to subserve . He separates the facts of his narrative , alike from the local conflicts , in which they originated , and from more recent and less sanguinary controversies , in which they might be eagerly adduced . He confines himself to the proper province of an impartial historian , claiming only the privilege of praising or censuring , where natural justice must needs give a spontaneous verdict . St. Domingo , discovered by Columbus during his first voyage , and the seat of the first settlement made by civilized man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curiosity of every American . Its fortunes acquire a painful interest , when we reflect that it has been from the very first the fbotball of contending nations , yearly drenched both with native and with foreign blood , wrestled for , whole scores of years together , at an expense of treasure , which , were its soil all silver and its sands all gold , its possession could hardly replace . Its ill-starred inhabitants have always been , in life and fortune , victims to conflicts not their own . Either the torch of European war has set fire to their plantations and warehouses ; or , when the fire and sword of civil discord have been let loose among themselves , the apples of strife have in every instance been cast into their midst by trans-atlantic powers . The torrents of guilt and misery that have deluged this unhappy island have all flowed from European mismanagement and profligacy ; and the student of political economy may here find luculent commentaries on the colonial system in general , and on every form of unsuccessful and malignant colonial legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while , upon the canvass , a brilliant picture of colonial magnificence and luxury ; for , during the most prosperous period of the French regime , the elegances of Parisian life and the splendor of Versailles might have found their most genuine reflection from the western shore of St. Domingo . We have also in this island the novel phenomenon of an independent government established and administered by a race of men , who have there first , at least for many centuries , found space and opportunity to test , on an ample scale , their own l ) ohitical capacities amid tendencies . Add to these considerations the size of the island ( nearly as large as all New England exclusive of // Maine , ) the beauty of its scenery , its vast agricultural capabilities , its commercial advantages , its vicinity to our own shores , and the extensive mercantile connexions already established in its principal ports by our own citizens ; and we surely have the strongest inducements to make ourselves acquainted with its past fortunes and its present condition . The work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first impression is in the process of rapid sale , the plates will doubtless be again put in requisition in the course of a few months . We would suggest to the author the expediency of prefixing to the next edition a full and accurate map of St. Domingo and the neighbouring islands . The lack of such a map is the only deficiency which we have detected . It is a deficiency , which few of Dr. Brown 's readers may be able to supply for themselves , and which he only makes more constantly felt by the accuracy of his topographical indications and sketches . We close our notice by commending the work to the favoring suifrages of the public , and by extracting from it a curious and graphic picture of the manners and mode of life of the outlaws , who constituted the germ of the French colony of St. Domingo . " Just off the northwestern coast of St. Domingo there lies a little wooded island called Tortugas . It is low and fertile , and stretches itself across the entrance of a line harbour on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French name of Port de Paix ; hid by bold headlands and overhung by bald or wood-crowned mountain peaks . That the celebrated freebooters of this century ( the seventeenth ) selected this convenient spot as their refuge from danger , and retreat from toil , but proves the deep forethought of this enterprising race of adventurers . The sea-rovers had now increased in numbers far beyond the supply of booty to be taken , and their profession was overdone to an extent that rendered success in its pursuit too much a problem of chance to satisfy for a long time the activity of their impatient natures ; and many of them abandoned their old employments for new modes of life . " Become attached to the mild regions of the tropics , and incapacitated , by a long life of wild adventure , for the restraints of civilixed society , some went to the bay of Campeachy and became cutters of logwood , while most of them remained at their old retreat , Tortugas , and employed themselves in hunting wild cattle on the coast of St. Domingo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting the wild cattle , that roamed in herds through its solitudes , became profitable from the sale of the hides and tallow to the ships visiting the West Indies for purposes of traffic . The flesh was converted into sustenance by smoking it on hurdles , or , as they were termed , boucans , a word used by the Carib Indians to express that apparatus for curing their meat . From this term , and the business they followed , these hunters were called " Buccaneers . " They called themselves " Brethren of the Coast ; " - an appropriate term when their mode of // living is considered . As they were without wives and children , it was a custom with them to live together , in couples , that the various duties of a family establishment might he performed with more completeness and order . While one was engaged in hunting , the other commonly remained at home , engaged in curing the beef of yesterday 's hunt , or in cooking their meals against the return of his fellow lodger . All property was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in case of death , to the surviving partner . Theft was unknown , though locks were never used for security . What one did not find at home he proceeded immediately and without ceremony to take from the cabin of his nearest neighbour , without other word than to apprize the owner of it if he was at home , or , in case he was absent , to inform him on his return . Disputes were unfrequent , and when they did occur were easily accommodated . If the cause was grave , or the parties not to be reconciled , instead of a lawyer and Jury , they employed the musket to bring about a decision of the question . The ground was chosen , and the whole fraternity were made spectators of the mortal arbitrament . The word was given to fire , and if the ball took either party in the back or side , it was adjudged to be unfair dealing , and the head of the murderer was cleft in two on the spot . The laws of their native country went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been emancipated from all allegiance to them by the baptism of the sea , which they had each undergone in passing the tropics . Even their family name they abandoned , and noms de guerre , chosen to suit each one 's whim or fancy , were the appellations by which they were known , and which in after times descended to their posterity . " Their usual dress was a hunting shirt dipped in the blood of the animals they had slain in the chase ; coarse drawers , yet more foul ; for a girdle , a strip of raw hide , in which were stuck a small sword and several knives ; a cap with a small portion of brim in front for convenience in removing it ; and shoes without stockings . " Thus dressed and equipped , this hybrid race , the product of civilization and the wilderness , limited all their ambition to having a gun that would carry an ounce ball , and a pack of twenty-five or thirty hounds . They had no other occupation than hunting in the woods of St. Domingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with immense herds of wild cattle . They proceeded immediately to skin their game when they had killed it , and then hurried forwards to bring down others , till they were possessed of the requisite number for the day . When fatigued and hungry , they proceeded to cook a portion of the meat they had stripped from the wild carcass , and , with the pepper and orange juice they found plentifully around them , made a meal to satisfy all the wants of their appetite . They had no bread , and drank nothing but water . The description of one day 's mode of living is that of every day , till they were in possession of the number of hides they had contracted to deliver to the vessels of different nations which visited their settlement . They then proceeded with the trophies of their success to the harbour or inlet where the ship was waiting her homeward cargo , and received in exchange such commodities as their wants and situa // tion required . The employment soon became comparatively profitable , and above all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ventured into the seas of the West Indies . "
