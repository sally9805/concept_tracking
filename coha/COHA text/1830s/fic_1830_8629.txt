TO BENJAMIN ABBOT , LL.D . PRECEPTOR OF PHILLIPS EXETER ACADEMY , The following pages are respectfully inscribed , By the Author . PREFACE . In the Autumn of 1724 , the event happened on which this play is founded , and I have endeavored to adhere to historical facts , except in attributing that event to the designs of Ravillac , who is introduced to give , if possible , some variety to the work . In the portrait of Rall , I have followed the French writers , rather than the English ; it being the object of the latter to place him in an unfavorable light , to palliate an act which must ever be a blot on our history . It will be said that the language of my Indians is less figurative than that usually ascribed to them , and that in fact they have but little resemblance to the wild sons of the forest . In answer to the first objection , it may be remarked that figurative language is not the language of passion . To the second , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature were at least softened , if not removed . This change may be attributed in part to their frequent intercourse with the French , but chiefly to the celebrated Jesuit who resided with them as a Missionary nearly forty years . During the whole of this long period , he was indefatigable in his endeavors to civilize and improve them , and even his enemies have admitted that his endeavors were not in vain . Old Point has for some years yielded to the labors of the husbandman , and there is nothing to remind the traveller that it was once occupied by the Aborigines , were it not for the rude implements of war , and , at times , the human bones turned up by the passing plough . The Baron de Castine , whose daughter appears in this drama , resided for some years on the Penobscot , where he had a large grant from the French Crown . He and , afterwards , his son were extremely jeulous of the English , and it was owing to their influence with the natives that hostilities were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to the Penobscot , which burnt their settlement and forced them to leave the country . It may not be uninteresting to the antiquary to state , that about twenty years since , a tree in the vicinity having been uprooted by the storm , there was found beneath it , the bell of the Indian Chapel . This , together with Rall 's cabinet , are now in the Museum of Bowdoin College . N. D. DRAMATIS PERSON . Carabasset , Chief of the Norridgewoks . Rall , Catholic Missionary .

Main text ACT I. Scene I.  --  Night  --  A Forest . In the back ground Old Point on the waters of the Kennebec , with its rustic Church and wigwams . Father Rall Rall solus . Poor children of the forest ! thanks to Heaven , Here ye can rest your weary limbs at last , Nor fear surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble stream that sweeps around Your humble habitations . Oh ! how still And solemn is the hour . So lightly falls The footstep on this moss , ' t would scarce be heard , Were it not strewn with Autumn 's dying leaves : Fit emblems of our fate ! a moment fair , And fresh , and fragrant , and then  --  low in dust , Hark ! ' t is the howling of the famished wolf Snuffing the track of some tall antler 'd moose , As he goes down to bathe him in the waters ; He 's ever on the watch , nor tires of blood , And so is man , when left unto himself , Unciviliz 'd , with passions uncontrolled , Knowing no law but arbitrary will , And render 'd desperate by persecution : And such were these , when first I came among them . Father of mercies ! let no ruthless hand Again disturb the hatchet . Grant my prayer ! Then may my warmest hopes be realiz 'd , And this poor flock , committed to my charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Ah ! Adelaide ! What draws my daughter from her couch of rest To wander here ? the night is far advanc 'd  --  And yet , ' t is such a night I can not blame thee ; The stars , the stillness , and the season too , Do all invite to meditation . Adelaide . Adelaide Father , I can not own the chill of apathy In hours like this ; and were my heart so callous , I trust your precepts and your bright example Have not been wholly lost . I can look up And thank the Giver for the good he sends . That other thoughts have also fill 'd my mind I would confess , and therefore have I sought thee . Rall . Rall Therein you acted wisely . It is mine , Would I discharge the duties of my office , To ease the burthen all are doom 'd to bear . Adelaide . Adelaide Perhaps you 'll deem it but a maiden 's whim : Pray it may prove so ! still will fears assail ; For strange forebodings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rall . Rall Of Ravillac ? he has not dared , I trust , To offer insult  --  has not dared to urge Anew his suit , and that since his return ? Adelaide . Adelaide Oh no ! he has not spoken of his love , And love when unrequited turns to hate . His face now wears a smile of doubtful meaning , And when he speaks , ' t is with averted eye . These and the recollection of your tale Of his offences and unhallow 'd passions , Shake every nerve with terror . Oh ! I long To quit this spot and gain a sire 's protection . Rall . Rall I know it is no fitting residence For Castine 's daughter . Yet the noble baron , Forc 'd from his lov 'd Acadie , deem 'd it safe , Till brighter prospects sanctioned your return To his embrace ; and safe you are , my child ; Safe from your father 's foes and Ravillac . Moved as the latter was , he gave assurance That he would act obedient to my wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaide . Adelaide To what do you allude ? I have indeed Heard of some obligations , but not fully . Rall . Rall ' T is now some twenty years since Bomazeen , Bearing the bloody trophies of his prowess , Return 'd from Casco , capturing in his route An English boy ; that boy was Ravillac . He seem 'd like one deserted by the world , Like one who would with gladness yield his life , Could he but rest with those who gave him birth . For they , alas , fell in the vain attempt To rescue him , their all , from savage fury . I saw him in his loneliness , and felt Moved with such pity that , with much entreaty , I gain 'd his ransom . Not content with this , I from that moment claim 'd him as my own ; Trusting to sow the seeds of virtue in him , That he might prove a shepherd to this flock When I was called away . I need not add My hopes were disappointed . Even then His passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he grew up to manhood . Yet still methought he struggled to subdue them . Oft would he manifest warm proofs of love , Follow my steps , anticipate my wishes ; But he has chang 'd of late , and now he shuns me . Adelaide . Adelaide His debt of gratitude is large indeed ! Yet what a poor return for all your kindness . Now he for days is absent , none know where ; Do they inquire , he makes evasive answers Or else deigns no reply . Rall . Rall It grieves my heart To see him thus , and yet I can not think He means thee harm ; Oh , no ! thy fears are idle . He has imbib 'd , I can not learn the cause , A prejudice most rank against the English . On this he feeds and will , till it destroys him , Unless revenge be glutted . Adelaide . Adelaide ' T is mysterious , And manifests a heart debas 'd and vile . He must be sunk indeed , however wrong 'd , Who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! there 's a step of one approaching : ' T is Ravillac himself  --  I will retire . Rall . Rall Then good night Adelaide , I 'll haste to meet him ; And should your bosom need that holy calm That brings refreshing sleep , kneel at the cross  --  None who have sought it there , have sought in vain . Exeunt . SCENE II . Enter Rall and Ravillac . Rall . Rall No more ! no more ! the thought is horrible . If France , in order to regain her rights , Must have recourse to arms , let her engage In honorable war . Alas ! e'en them Its pathway ever is incarnadin 'd . Oh , why increase its horrors ? why let loose A wild , revengeful race , to fire at night The widow 's humble cot , and steep their hands In the life-blood of helpless innocence ? Too prone are they , already , to engage In scenes like these , too much to answer for Away then , far away , these golden lures , Nor urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Your sympathies methinks obtain the mastery Let not your zeal for making proselytes Be paramount to that you owe your country . Have you forgotten France ? Rall . Rall Forgotten  --  no ! Her sunny fields , o'er which , in boyhood 's days , I lov 'd to roam , are ever present to me ; Her many deeds of valorous achievement , Her learning , her refinement , above all , Her great exertions in the cause of truth , Render me proud of such a noble mother . Well may you charge me with forgetfulness When I consent to sully such a name By this alliance . Ravillac . Ravillac This is woman 's weakness ,  --  Our foes have no such tender visitings . The tribes contiguous to our western bounds , Corrupted by their promises and gold , Already are in arms ; prepared to rush On any point they deem defenceless . Rall . Rall Let them . It is no palliation of the crime That they afford a precedent . Ravillac . Ravillac And what Is their return for all this tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vile hypocrite , a tool of France , Wearing beneath the cowl a villain 's face ;  --  Under the semblance of great sanctity , The instigator of soul midnight murders ! Nay , know'st thou not , so bitter is their hate , That even now , they offer a reward To him who 'll bring thy head ? And canst thou then , Thus hunted and traduced , look calmly on , Nor think of retribution ? Rall . Rall Yes ! and can Forgive them too . They little know my heart . I am a pilgrim of the holy cross , And that enjoins good will to all mankind . No wordly views induc 'd me , else had I Clung to the happy shores that gave me birth . My aim I trust was higher , and for this I dared the dangers of the sea , nay dared Pursue my lonely route through pathless woods , Teeming with savage beasts and man more savage , So I might draw one wandering soul to Heaven . Ravillac . Ravillac And what is the result ? mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart untouch 'd . Hast thou subdued their spirit of revenge , Or brought to light the attribute of mercy ? Oh rest assured , the fires that rage within , Though now pent up , will blazon out , E'en at the slightest breath . Rall . Rall I will confess I have not realiz 'd what fancy painted , And yet have gained enough to check despair . How did I find them ? Desperate and wild , Goaded by frequent wrongs almost to madness , And panting for revenge . Their crops consum 'd , Robb 'd of their heritage , and , worse than all , The robbers ' footsteps on their fathers ' graves . And yet they can shew mercy to the captive ,  --  Thus wrong 'd , yet manifest redeeming virtues , That man more civiliz 'd but slightly values . Forbid it Heaven ! that with such grounds of hope , A race so noble yet , alas , so erring , Should plunge again in blood , and all be lost . Exit . Ravillac . Ravillac Curse on the weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bend him to my purposes . How sweeter my revenge , had he prepar 'd The bitter cup which I intend for him . Fool  --  to suppose that Ravillac could live , Nor dream of vengeance on the meddling priest , Who crushed his warmest hopes  --  filling the ear Of Adelaide with my infirmities ; Making her loathe my wooing . I will touch him E'en to his bosom 's core . The English council , Giving full credence to the tale I fram 'd Of Rall 's machinations , are prepar 'd . Let but the savage move , and they begin The work of desolation . But what way Arouse the war-whoop , if the priest dissuade  --  He whose mere nod controls them ?  --  Ha ! I have it  --  This , ( draws a dagger , ) let me tinge it in an Indian 's vein , Will urge them to redress ,  --  and to their ruin . Then all the injuries our house hath suffer 'd , My parents ' murder , and my own deep wrongs , Will be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.  --  Night . The Fallls of Skowhegan . Broken masses of rock , trees , &c.; A partial view of the river at a distance . Enter Rall and Adelaide . Rall . Rall Well Adelaide , our ride thus far has been One of unmingled pleasure . What can vie With the rich tints that Nature lavishes On forest leaves in Autumn ;  --  with the birds That sang regardless of our near approach , And the deep glens , so wild and shadowy ! No wonder , while our time was thus beguil 'd , That evening should steal on us unawares , Devoted hitherto to holier duties . Yet , though the hour hath warned us to return , I knew , my daughter , thou would'st scarce absolve me , Had I not shown the noble view before us . Adelaide . Adelaide ' T is beautiful indeed ! mark how the cliffs , Darkened with hanging cedars , bravely breast The shock of angry waters rushing by . The roar is almost deafening . See the foam , Dancing and curling in a snowy sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirls Around the rock , and sparkles to the moon . And then the night , how lovely ! If the one We last enjoy 'd could move you to such rapture , O how must this , with all its magic scenes , Affect you . Rall . Rall Adelaide , I feel its charms , And feeling , all my faculties are lost In contemplation of the Power who formed them . Adelaide . Adelaide I thought my own Acadie , and its bay Studded with verdant isles , a sweet retreat For those who lov 'd the beautiful in nature ; And many a tear I shed when forc 'd away . But this to me is dearer . O ! the hours , In such a spot as this , would pass unheeded , Could those we love be near , to share our joys . Rall . Rall Thanks to a kind and gracious Providence ! Nature is fruitful here in such displays , Which have their beauties and their uses too . These circling eddies teem with animation ; For here , in their migrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to leap above the cataract , Thus furnishing to man a rich supply Of food convenient for him . Adelaide . Adelaide Tell me then , When the poor Indians are so highly favor 'd , The cause of their privations , not unfrequent . For I have heard of suffering and of death ; That Famine , ever an unbidden guest , Hath stalked at times beneath their lowly roof , And quench 'd with tears their hospitable fire . Rall . Rall Daughter , the answer is not difficult . What the great Giver of all good design 'd For all his children , man himself withholds . From many a stream that intersects these wilds , And which the natives once could call their own , Their race is now excluded . Avarice , Combin 'd with power , stretch 'd forth its iron hand , And dash 'd them off . Alas ! a few years more , E'en this may be denied them . Even here The white man may set up his claim of right , And these poor wand'rers find their only refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be far distant : Long may the objects of thy anxious care Linger around this spot , and here in peace Collect their needed stores . But look , my father , Saw you that light just flickering beneath ? It moves , and there is one with brandish 'd arm , Now bending o'er the waters . Rall . Rall I observe him , And , from his mien , it must be Carabasset , The best and bravest of the Norridgewoks . This is his favorite haunt ; for here he plays With hook and barbed spear , till winter 's snows Assist him in the chase of nobler game . Adelaide . Adelaide Then we shall meet with Rena ; for she deems There 's no one duty half so sweet as that Which brings her near him . Nay , she looks upon The world as a mere blank , without his presence . Rall . Rall Her little bower is on that crag , and there , Swinging her infant boy , no doubt she sits , And views with many an anxious glance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay ; You know our pathway home is rough and dreary , And , would we take advantage of the moon , We must press onward . See , beneath yon oak , Our restive palfreys do already chide us , And champ the bit , impatient of delay . Exeunt . Enter Ravillac . Ravillac Rena alone , they said , and in her bower ! Accept my thanks for that , much as I hate ye ! She then must be my victim , and her death , Charged to the malice of some English hunter , Will wake a spirit Rall can not quell , And that proud maid shall bear her company ; But hold ! not yet  --  Revenge must sleep awhile ; I 'll first enjoy , then cast her to the worm . Ha ! Carabasset ! no ' t is my own shadow , Fearfully lengthen 'd by that tell-tale moon : Go hide thy head in clouds , I hate thy beam . It is the starless night , which cowards shrink at , That is in sweet accordance with my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit , ever merciful , Retain within the hollow of his hand The innocent , and so the priest informs us , Then are my Rena and her boy secure . O ! could I hear her voice ; ' t is music that Would even tame the wolf that cross 'd her path . Strange that the daughter of our sternest chief , Should be so like the fawn her bounty feeds ; As timid , gentle , and as playful too . Yet such is Rena ; ay , and more than this ; How loving , to prepare her leafy bed On yonder rock , regardless of the cold , To be assured of Carabasset 's safety . But where is she to-night ? it was her custom , When she beheld my torch-light in the stream , To leave her resting place and meet me here . Rena , my love , what art thou sporting now ? Perhaps my infant boy prevents her coming , Nay , needs her constant care  --  I will relieve her . Enter Saugus and Taconet . Saugus and Taconet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour , I fain would ask The purpose of your journey ; if to spear Among the rocks below , ' t is labor lost ; The prey is startled by the drifting trunks , That lay among the eddies . Taconet . Taconet So we deem 'd ; For hither as we urged our light canoe , Full many a sluggish pine we pass 'd , that seem 'd To float upon the wave , like some huge serpent Sleeping . But this to night is not our object . A deputation from the Canadas Renders essential Carabasset 's presence . They hold a talk to-morrow , and we come , Directed by the fathers to inform thee . Carabasset . Carabasset Brothers , my heart is open ; ye can tell How lightly I regard these emissaries . I would withdraw and hold no converse with them . They call us brothers , but ' t is interest prompts . Why do they come among us ? ' t is for gain ; Pale sordid knaves , who hope by paltry sums , And a few gew-gaws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hard earn 'd gains , Taking advantage of our ignorance ; Lolling at ease , while we are either starving , Or else , unworthy of the name we bear , Submitting to a vile dependency . Taconet . Taconet Brother , thy words do find an echo here ; Thy words are truth , and was that now their object , I would not urge thee to the council fire . But they have come on things of graver import ; Come to obtain assistance , as allies , For so they term us , ' gainst their ancient foe , Again in arms . Carabasset . Carabasset The hatchet scarce is dim ; Why draw it from its earthy bed so soon ? Why violate the faith of Norridgeworks , And slaughter those who , for awhile at least , Have wish 'd for peace , nay , smok 'd our calumet . Say , should we tread the shores of the salt lake , Will they collect our maize , pursue our game , Or guard the grey hair 'd warrior and the young ? Brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fill the cup , but ' t is with liquid poison , That turns our love to hate , our strength to weakness ; Makes wisdom , folly  --  prostrates in the dust The warrior 's form , and maddens and consumes . Can Carabasset look on such , as brothers , Or mingle in their quarrels ? Taconet . Taconet Hear my voice . Will they not charge our race as cold in blood ; Our memory as the sand , on which no track Is long retain 'd , though yielding to the slightest . Our fathers slept beneath their shadowy wing , In moons gone by . Carabasset . Carabasset And was it not remember 'd ? Lay hare your bosoms  --  ask them whence those scars . Point to the mound , where rest the red fac 'd chiefs , Who died a warrior 's death in their defence . The debt is paid , and paid so amply too , That we are but the remnant of a race , Few as the leaves of winter , and as wither 'd ; While they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spill each other 's blood  --  When hawks contend , the smaller birds are safe . Brothers ye know their hearts ; they play the fox ; We must pursue the foe , but they the spoil . And , should the pipe be lighted , will they not Forget that there were red men in the battle ? Ay , and then leave us to be hunted down , Like beasts of prey , as they have done before . Taconet . Taconet Thy words are like the words of one in years , Having the stamp of wisdom . We will bear Thy answer to the fathers . Carabasset . Carabasset Rest ye here . In many a hard fought battle , side by side , Encountering the whites , our blood hath mingled . Hath Carabasset chang 'd , that ye should leave His food untasted ? Come , his smoke is near , And Rena too will welcome your appearance . Exeunt . SCENE III . A temporary wigwam formed of boughs Enter Carabasset , Saugus and Taconet Carabasset . Carabasset Here is my humble shelter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepares my food ; Go , rest your weary limbs , while I collect The scatter 'd faggots . ( They advance to the entrance and suddenly retreat with an expression of horror . ) Why start ye back  --  what dreadful sight unmans ye ? Ye who ne'er trembled at the face of man ? Speak , I entreat ye ! Is Rena  --  is my boy  --  My heart is bursting . Let me know the worst ! ( Rushes to the door and falls back into their arms . ) Saugus . Saugus Death to the pale-faced wretch who gave the blow ! Carabasset Carabasset ( wildly . ) Where am I  --  all is dark  --  Hath the Great Spirit veil 'd his face in clouds ? He saw it not .  --  So nigh , and yet no succour !  --  Oh , there 's an ice bolt here-here , where her cheek Did love to rest  --  off , off ! my brain 's on fire ! Again , that dying shriek ! I come , I come ! ( Breaks from them and disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perish in his madness . Pursue him , Saugus , for thy feet are swift ; Bound forward to the cliff , we 'll save him , then Revenge . Exeunt . ACT III . Scene I.  --  A Forest . Rall solus . What monster could have done a deed like this ! To plunge the deadly steel in one so young , So kind , so innocent , so warmly cherish 'd ; Possessing every virtue that could grace And dignify our nature . Oh could none , But hapless Rena , glut thy fell revenge ! None but the mother of a helpless babe ! None but the lov 'd companion of a chief , Humane as brave  --  humane alas ! no more . The infant , too , must writhe beneath his grasp ! Revenge was purchas 'd at a dreadful price . Oh ! what a crimson stream , full soon , must gush From English veins to expiate the crime . My heart is faint within me . Gracious Power , Thy ways are past the feeble ken of man . ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up With my success . Grant me humility . Here will I kneel in dust and kiss the rod  --  Teach me submission , let me sin no more . Enter Adelaide . Adelaide . Adelaide Ah , what a sight is this ! ' t is as I fear 'd ; The mournful fate of Rena bows him down . Dearly he lov 'd her , for a willing ear She gave to his instructions , and was led By him to offer up her heart to Heaven . Good father , Adelaide would share thy grief , For she too knew the worth of her you mourn . Come lean upon my arm , thy feeble frame Can ill sustain so great a shock as this . Rall . Rall Daughter , I thank thee ; ' t was a dreadful blow , So sudden and so unexpected , too , It quite unman 'd me . But ' t is over and I need not your assistance . Oh ! my child , Thus are the hopes of frail humanity Forever blighted when confin 'd to earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate ; It was her gain  --  she went not unprepared . Rall . Rall Ah true ! we have that consolation left , And , therefore , should submit and dry our tears . But who can fill her place ? I vainly thought That Rena 's bright example would allure A crowd around the altar . I had dreamt Of the mild dove of peace , and in its stead , The vulture comes in sad reality . Think you the Norridgewoks will not avenge The bloody deed ? They will have drop for drop , Or perish , till the stain is washed away . Oh , could I see the husband of her love , The injur 'd chief , perhaps I might avert The sad calamity . But where is he ? ' T is said that , phrenzied by despair , he plung 'd Into the dark recesses of the forest , And has not yet been found . Adelaide . Adelaide He must be safe . Saugus and Taconet , his chosen friends , Were with him , when the murder was discovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Carabasset , often have they stood , Like bulwarks , at his side , when dangers threaten 'd And borne him up in the hard press of battle . They will not leave him now , in his despair , When friendship most is needed . But here 's one , Though much reserv 'd of late , who can dispel Your anxious doubts ; do question him , I can not . Oh ! if the face be index of the mind , His must have fearful workings . Enter Ravillac . Ravillac . Ravillac Here , again , Hid from the wary and observing crowd , I can breathe freely ; there each passing glance To me seemed full of meaning . ( Sees Rall ) Ha ! so near ! Good morning , holy Father ; you do well , And that fair lady too , to rise betimes And woo the early breeze . It is refreshing ; Quick'ning our pulses , that were sluggish else , And giving to the cheek , on which it plays . A ruddier hue . Rall . Rall Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedim 'd with tears ; And such are mine . And yet not Rena 's death , Untimely as it was , alone doth move me , But the sad consequences of her fall . Where is her noble warrior ? has he perish 'd In his deep agony ? then all is lost . Who but himself can still that startling cry , The war-whoop which now bursts upon the ear , And which may yet involve his race in ruin ! Ravillac . Ravillac He lives , but lives for vengeance . On a rock They found him ; all his phrenzy then had gone . His eye was tearless , but a calm was there , A fearful calm , like that before the earthquake , Presaging desolation . E'en his friends , When they beheld his countenance , drew back And quit the scene . Rall . Rall Then there I 'll fly to meet him , And bring the balm his wounded bosom needs . He will not cast me off , for he was wont To listen to my council , in times past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Even with tears , to leave the work of vengeance To him whose right it is . Ravillac . Ravillac And perish for thy rashness . Adelaide . Adelaide Oh , forbear ! The red man 's wrath is dreadful ; friend and foe Are now alike to him  --  why rush on death ? Remain till reason hath regain 'd its seat ; If not for me , unfriended and alone , Remain for those who look to thee for guidance . Rall . Rall There duty points , and shall I shrink from duty , Now , when my sands have nearly run their hour ? ' T is mine to strive for peace ; procure me that , And I will die a martyr in the cause . Ravillac . Ravillac Let them have blood for blood . I would look down With scorn and indignation on a race , So abject as to kiss the feet that spurn 'd them . Rall . Rall Hold , Ravillac ! thy bosom pants for vengeance . I know thy bitter hatred of the English ; Know that e'en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect their ruin . Why that start ? Do thy unhallow 'd wishes make thee tremble ? Oh , well they might , no inward voice approves . What injury hast thou suffer 'd  --  what offence Hath filled thy bosom with such deadly rancor , That nought but blood can give thee recompense ? Oh , these were not the lessons I instill 'd Into thy infant mind ; but rather this , However great and unprovok 'd the wrong , ' T was nobler to forgive than to avenge it . Exeunt Rall and Adelaide . Ravillac . Ravillac All is safe . On me suspicion rests not , and the cry For blood is deep and lengthen 'd  --  let it swell . Let them arouse the lion in his lair , And then destruction follows . Exit . SCENE II . Carabasset discovered reclining on a rock . Enter Rall Rall . Rall Ill fated warrior ! doom 'd , alas too soon , To drain that bitter cup which all must drain When the companion , nearest and most lov 'd Lives but in memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose feeble hand Was once retain 'd by thine in friendly pressure , Comes to assuage thy sorrows . Oh , look up , And ease this troubled heart . Carabasset . Carabasset Away and leave me . Who mourns for Carabasset ? Is he not Like the scath 'd pine on which the flame hath fed , Till it is sapless , naked and decaying . Rall . Rall Oh say not thus , for it shall bloom again , Nourish 'd with dew from Heaven . Come , behold me . Carabasset . Carabasset Ha ! of the pale-fac 'd race ! I hate ye all . What , art thou tir 'd of life , to venture thus Beneath my deadly grasp ? Rall . Rall Strike , if thou canst ! My son , my son , hast thou forgotten Ralle ? He on whose knees it was thy joy to climb , In thy young days  --  who gave thee Rana too ? Carabasset . Carabasset Rena !  --  and was it thou ?  --  yes  --  I remember  --  One was the friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , I will not harm thee  --  go in peace . Rall . Rall And leave thee here in wretchedness ! I can not . Come be thyself again , nor waste the hours In brooding o'er thy wrongs . It is in love That the Great Spirit chastens ; come , return . Carabasset . Carabasset Return ! who now will welcome Carabasset ? Where is the hand that bath 'd his aching temples , And spread fresh rushes for his weary limbs ? Where is the eye that lighted at his coming , Where is the form that welcom 'd his embrace ? Oh ! monsters that ye are to leave me thus ! Rall . Rall Again , let me entreat thee to return . Let not the bravest of the Norridgewoks , He who for fortitude hath been so fam 'd , Give way to this excess . Thy warriors wait Impatient to behold thee . Ah the sound That comes upon the breeze , denotes too well How high they prize the noble Carabasset . Would it were less , for now inflam 'd with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carabasset . Carabasset Ha , is it thus ? then they are truly brothers . Rall . Rall Forbear , my son , give up thy cruel purpose . Let not the act of one abandon 'd wretch , Bring ruin on the innocent  --  forbear . We will demand th ' assassin , rest assur 'd They will not dare refuse to give him up . Thus justice can be satisfied , and still The cradles ' sleep be quiet as before . Carabasset . Carabasset As well go ask the fierce and rav'nous bear To yield her young : they 'll mock at your petition . They hold their blood too precious to be shed , For that which flows within a red man 's veins . No , all shall perish . Rall . Rall Hear me Carabasset , Hear me , if not in pity to the whites , In pity to your race . Your foes are mighty . They will not idly sit , and bare their heads To the uplifted tomahawk . Their bands , Well arm 'd and numerous , will seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Against a host ; and , when your warriors fall , Their wives , their children , all that they hold dear Must perish with them . Carabasset . Carabasset Well , then be it so ; Better to perish thus than breathe as slaves . Talk not of mercy  --  they have shown us none ; And should we spare them , they would call it fear . Yet , often have I spared them . Who can say That Carabasset slew except in battle ? Oft , through the snows , for many a weary day , The trembling , helpless captive have I borne Back to its mother 's arms , nor asked for ransom . Oft struck aside the tomahawk 's keen edge , That the red warrior brandish 'd o'er their young ; Ay , plung 'd into their dwellings , wrapt in flames , And drawn them forth to life and liberty .

I too have lov 'd , and those I lov 'd were murder 'd . The voice that plead for others fail 'd to move Their flinty hearts  --  the child too ,  --  none were spar 'd , And yet the coward lives who gave the blow . ( Rushes out . ) Rall . Rall Gone ! deaf to my entreaties ; then ' t is over ! Oh , that a single victim would suffice ! Though few the drops that creep within these veins , They should flow freely , could they flow for all . Exit . ACT IV . Scene I.  --  A Wood . Ravillac Ravillac solus . The Jesuit 's flock at length are in my toils , And , could the promis 'd succor now advance , My heartfelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message from these English drones Hath yet arrived ; delay may baffle all . Oh ! how the business of the public suffers , When those who are its functionaries gloat On costly viands and enjoy fat slumbers . This is no time to waste in dull debate : The Indians , flush 'd with triumph , have return 'd , And , in their dark retreats , thrown off their guard , Hold festival . A single blow now given And the whole nest of adders will be crush 'd . This torturing suspense I can not brook Much longer  --  I will on . E'en now , perhaps , I may confront their snail-pac 'd messenger . Exit . Enter Adelaide . Adelaide One month , one single month scarce half elaps 'd Since Rena 's death , and yet how sad a change . Then all was calm . The rude inhabitants Seemed to have chang 'd their very nature , and , Led by the admonitions of the priest , Gather 'd the fruits their industry had rais 'd . This forest and its dark sequestered glens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the song of birds . A safe retreat For those , who like myself , have felt the loss Of home and its endearments  --  who are cast On the wide world again , and gladly hail Whatever spot can give them rest and shelter . But , what a contrast now ! the painted form Of the wild warrior , shouting in the dance  --  The war-whoop , mingled with the clash of arms , Still reeking with the blood of innocence , All fill the soul with horror . Thanks to Heav'n ! Hither the holy father bends his way ; With him there 's hope of safety . O ! most welcome . Enter Rall . Rall . Rall My child , I long have sought thee , well aware ; Of the great shock thy feelings must sustain , At scenes like these  --  they make e'en manhood tremble . Adelaide . Adelaide Is there no way to check this violence ? Methought , good father , they were wont to yield To your authority . Exert it now ; The fate of these poor captives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quaffing deep Th ' inebriating bowl , my voice they heed not . Scarce would they yield obedience to the word Of Carabasset , much as they regard him , In these fell orgies . He and Taconet Still prowl around the dwellings of the English , Unsated , unappeas 'd . How this will end I tremble to conjecture ; but I feel That we are doom 'd to part . The embassy , Sent to involve us in their cruel war , Finding their object gain 'd by Rena 's death , That otherwise had fail 'd , are now preparing To visit the St. Lawrence . They will guide My child in safety . ' T is a weary route Through flooded fens and dark and tangled forests ; But easier far to be encounter 'd than The dangers here impending . Adelaide . Adelaide Ah ! what dangers ? The English surely would not dare invade These forest shades . Rall . Rall No , this is not my fear . With none to guide them through each secret pass , The movement would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his fury ! Then he is like the tiger who hath drank Of human blood  --  nought else can satisfy ; And in his burning thirst for more , may fasten , We know not where . Adelaide . Adelaide Then why talk thus of parting ? Why needlessly expose a life so valued ? ' T is rashness to remain , if such the peril . With thee for my companion , I should feel As if the greater portion of our journey Was even now accomplish 'd . Rall . Rall What ? to gain A few short years , for few they are at most , Should I relinquish that , to which a life Hath been devoted ? No ,  --  it can not be . The slender fabric , that with so much care And labor was erected , still requires My feeble aid ; and , should I leave it now , Who would prevent its tottering to its fall ? To me this blind , deluded race are precious . ' T was for their benefit I sought these wilds , And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my child , each moment is important ; The sick and wounded captives need our care , And you , too , must prepare for your departure . Three days , at farthest , was the time assign 'd , It may be on the morrow . Exeunt . Enter Ravillac , Ravillac reading a letter . " Relying on your valor and discretion , And in accordance with your last advice , We have despatch 'd our forces ; at the head Of the tide waters , they ' ll await your orders . "  --  " Your valor and discretion "  --  well devis 'd . How many , flatter 'd by these honied sounds , Have rush 'd into the hottest of the battle , And died like fools . They tickle not mine ear With words like these , however smooth and gentle . " Should victory crown your efforts , a reward , Comporting with the service , will be given . " Now this is lying by authority . The service once perform 'd , the gold remains Securely in their coffers . Knaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gold . " But chiefly , and let this increase thy zeal , By plucking up this root of heresy , The worse for mingling with the tares of Rome , The plant of godliness will thrive . " What bigots ! ' T is well my thirst for vengeance is unsated , Or , by the saints , I 'd furnish on demand Scalps that should glut the market . As it is , I must protect awhile the tools they 've sent me ; Their safety is essential to effect The work , which now engrosses all my soul , And renders life a curse , till well accomplish 'd . That done , they may be gather 'd to their fathers , How , when , or where , I care not . Exit . SCENE II . A wood .

It was not always thus . Our fathers needed not the mists of night To walk in safety . They could proudly stand Upon the mountain top , and hail the light That the Great Spirit sent them . Undisturb 'd Could hunt the moose , or , on the great salt lake , Float their canoes , and no one cried " forbear . " But now we move in darkness  --  then , alone , Are we permitted to pursue our course , Unvex 'd by those whom once we warm 'd and welcom 'd . Must it be always thus ? No  --  let us turn At once . If we must perish , let us die Like men . ( A gun fired . ) He comes at last ; it is his rifle 's voice , Familiar to the ear in dangers past . Doubtless another of the cold in blood Hath ceas 'd from troubling . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy , And should it prove a den of English wolves , He too must slumber . Enter Taconet . Brother , thy return Is to this heart , as water is to him , Whose lip is parch 'd . Say , hath thine eye beheld Their numbers  --  hath thine ear drank in their words ? The rifle should have slept , if those we hate , Have marked thy path . Taconet . Taconet The English are abroad , Their numerous scouts I met at every pass , So eager in pursuit , escape was difficult . For days I lay concealed in the rank grass , Till hunger drew me forth . Encountering more , I sought the stream , or fasten 'd on the cliffs That hung o'er yawning chasms . Once , exhausted , A hollow trunk , uprooted by the storm , Receiv 'd my weary limbs . My sleep was short . The foe came there and rested . One , in wrath , Forc 'd through the sapless wood his dagger 's point And drew forth blood , for which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you heard , Stretch 'd on the earth another of their race , Just issuing from that wigwam .

' t is no time To let the hatchet sleep , and foes so near . Carabasset . Carabasset Since thy departure , wearied with the weight Of plunder , and the care of lagging captives , They homeward turn 'd . Taconet . Taconet Then why should we remain ? Brother , thine arm is strong , thy feet are swift , And Taconet attends thee , like a shadow . But , listen , thou wilt hear the white wolves ' howl ; They look for those whose eyes are heavy . Brother , Even the stars do sometimes tire with watching , And sleep in clouds . The red man too should rest , When he hath hung , full long , upon the track Of those who thirst for blood . Our brothers ' path Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the pale face sleeps , nor dreams of danger , Our knives shall reach him , and with surer aim . Carabasset . Carabasset Thy word is wise and I would follow it , But that a bloody hand doth hold me back . A voice is sounding in mine ear , " remain ; " " Thy work is yet unfinish 'd , while a drop flows In a white man 's veins : " it should be so . Whose smoke now curls and rises o'er the spot Where once we held our council-fires ?  --  whose hand , Lays bare the warrior 's narrow bed , and flings His bones around , to whiten in the sun ? Who forc 'd our fathers from their hunting grounds , And banish 'd slumber from their weary eye-lids ? Who would deny us e'en the air we breathe , And make our wigwams desolate ? The white man . All , all that the Great Spirit hath bestow 'd Upon his children , he would take away . Then let us to the work , and speedily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For soon , escape will be impossible . But hark ! the air is still , and yet I hear The rustling leaf . With slow and cautious step , Some one approaches  --  one , perhaps , in search Of him , who fell beneath my faithful weapon . Let us retire , awhile , this thicket 's shade No eye can penetrate . Exeunt . Enter Agnes and her child . Agnes . Agnes Yes ! he will soon return , and yet that sound Did seem so like a long and last farewell , It fills me with strange fears . Why rashly go , When murder hides its head in every brake , Watching its victims . Husband of my love ! Oh ! if alive , in pity speak , and ease This breaking heart . Alas , he hears me not ; No voice , but mine , returns in mournful echo . Where shall I turn ? This is a fearful spot ,  --  So dark and wild .

Say , have ye human hearts ? then stay your hands ! Oh ! if his father 's life would not suffice , Then here is mine  --  but spare my child . Dread warrior ! I know thou wilt not harm his cherub face , Oh what would be thy feelings should thy wife , Thy child , thus have to plead for mercy . Carabasset drops the tomahawk , turns from her in agony , and motions her away as the curtain falls . ACT V. Scene I.  --  The interior of the Chapel . Rall at the altar  --  Adelaide , Females of the Norridgewok Tribe , &c.; kneeling around . Rall . Rall It is a work acceptable and pleasing , To gather thus , around the holy shrine , And make confession of our sins . The saints , In pity , lend a gracious ear to prayer , Thus offer 'd up in lowliness of heart , And make unceasing intercession for us . Here the immortal spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break From its vile prison house of clay , and soars Above the things of time ; and man becomes A purer and more elevated being . Here is a place of refuge , when the heart Hath felt the chill of this world 's charity  --  That pitiless blast that drives us to and fro , Yet wafts us to no fair haven . Need there is That ye should seek it now ; in prayer for those Who , waken 'd by the war-whoop , have gone out To murder in cold blood  --  misguided race ! That Heav'n would soften their obdurate hearts , And bring them back in safety and in peace . Hark ! hark ! that shout announces the return Of Carabasset and his faithful friend . The cry of victory , and the captive 's moan , Are mingled fearfully . Oh ! Gracious Power , Enough of blood is shed already . Enter Saugus , hastily . Saugus . Saugus Fly ! Fly , all who would avoid the fate of slaves . The pale-fac 'd cowards , by a secret pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are bursting from its height , and overwhelm us .

Fly to the banks ! unmoor each light canoe  --  Gain but the other side , ye may be safe . Adelaide . Adelaide And leave you here ? impossible . My venerable guardian and my friend ! Why throw thy life away ? come , join our flight . Rall . Rall They will not touch the minister of Heav'n . They will not violate the holy altar , By the foul murder of its priest  --  they dare not . I may be yet the instrument of good , And rescue some who , otherwise , might perish . Here I am safe .

Ha ! the vile priest , the author of my wrongs ! Secure the miscreant , but guard him well , Lest we should rob the gibbet of its due . Rall . Rall What , Ravillac ! my senses are bewilder 'd ! It can not be the one whose life I sav 'd , Whom I have cherish 'd from his infancy ? It is another with his form and mien  --  It is not he ! Ravillac . Ravillac Yes ! it is Ravillac ; That Ravillac whom thou hast basely injur 'd , And thus he makes requital . Rall . Rall Wretched man ! A serpent have I warm 'd to life , indeed ! What act have I committed , that could make Thee so ungrateful , and a traitor too ? Ravillac . Ravillac What act ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the object of my love , and made her Turn from me in disgust ? Was it not thou , With thy most foul and damning calumny ? Rall . Rall I did but warn her of thy fearful passions , And time hath shown that I was not mistaken . If this demanded blood to make atonement , Then mine was ready ; why destroy a race Who never injur 'd thee ? Ravillac . Ravillac I 'll tell thee why ; You priz 'd them more than life . The only aim Of thy ambition , it was nothing else , Was this ; that Fame should trumpet to the world , How Rall gather 'd a benighted race Into the fold of holy mother church . It was to gain a name , not love for souls ; And knowing this , my purpose of revenge Had been but half accomplish 'd by thy death , If these were spared . Rall . Rall Alas ! was it for this that my poor flock Are summon 'd to the dread tribunal unprepar 'd ! Thanks be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cause of all this suffering , hath escap 'd . Thanks , that excess of passion blinded thee , When thy unhallowed step intruded here : Ere now the maiden is beyond thy power . Ravillac .

Rall Oh ! fiend in human shape , I can not call thee man , let not these walls Be witnesses against thee . Close those lips , Lest the avenging bolt should strike thee down . Ravillac . Ravillac Then let them witness more ; ' t was Ravillac , Who led the English to believe thee false ; T was he , who sent thy Rena to the grave , And now he speeds thee on the same dark path .

Enter Carabasset , followed by Saugus and Taconet Carabasset . Carabasset Yes , the Great Spirit frowns upon his children . It must be so , or else that bitter cry , Which they sent up for vengeance , had been answer 'd From the dark thunder cloud . But one escap 'd To bear the dreadful tidings to mine ear . Even the grey hair 'd priest was not allow 'd The remnant of his days ; he , too , fell down In his own sanctuary , he , a white ; The only one of that detested race That I deem 'd fit to live . No wonder , then , These wolves did riot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains Of all the Norridgewoks ? it can not be ! Say , Saugus , was there no one but thyself , Who shun 'd pursuit and gain 'd the wood in safety ? Saugus . Saugus None but ourselves can call thee brother now . Our warriors fell in their own blood ; they fell Like children , with no weapons in their hands . Our foes in numerous bands , came unawares . One guarded the canoes , one fir 'd the wigwams ; A third commenc 'd the work of butchery . Our brothers , tho ' unarm 'd , disdain 'd to yield ; And , that the helpless might have time for flight , They grappled man to man . But all in vain ; Like leaves they fell around me , till not one Was left to give thee warning , but myself . Where lay the bleeding Rall I have told . The women who were with him sought the stream ; I overtook them , as with outstretch 'd arms , They struggl 'd in the waters ; but they fell , With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carabasset . Carabasset Oh , horrible ! yet better so than live , The white man 's slave , to feel the tyrant 's lash , And bear his yoke , like a wild beast of burden . Brothers , our shadows lengthen in the sun , And we have much to do before it rolls Again upon the summit of that hill  --  Yes , the great work of vengeance ! Saugus , how Were all these murd'rers posted ? One at least , Our tomahawks must reach , that heartless white , Who would betray and murder those who fed him . Saugus . Saugus Last night their forces were divided ; half Held watch amid the slacken 'd fires ; the rest Were near the hill . Carabasset . Carabasset We , too , will separate , And thus be doubly certain of our victim . Yourself and Taconet shall fall on one , I 'll answer for the other . Even now The dews are fast descending  --  this is well . ' Twill aid our purpose , mingling with the smoke That in dark clouds still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Spirit 's view . Taconet . Taconet Then , brother , let us part , as warriors part , As they should part , who may not meet again . Where can we meet , no home is left us here ? Carabasset . Carabasset Where meet the brave ! for there the red man rests , When he hath sung his death-song , and goes down To the dark valley . There we shall renew Our song of joy and triumph ; there rejoin Our brothers , who have perish 'd in the battle . Yes , there we 'll meet again ! for who would live , When all he lov 'd were torn from his embrace ; And he was deem 'd so vile , that ' t was denied him Even to guard the sod , that wrapt their bones ! Exeunt . SCENE III .  --  Night . A Wood . Carabasset Carabassetsolus . The night is on the wane , and man now sinks Into forgetfulness . It is the hour When e'en the pale-face ceases to molest ; And , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fitting time To blot out , with their blood , all memory Of wrong ,  --  if to blot out were possible . How many now lay down to dream of prey , That never can be theirs  --  of valued furs , And of the scalps of red men , the reward Of perfidy , to be exchang 'd for gold : Soon must ye pass into a dreamless sleep . Yes ! it is time they rais 'd the tomahawk . ( Distant alarum . ) Ha ! that sound ! the work is then begun  --  A signal light now flashes ' mid the gloom  --  The death shots rattle ! then the brave have fall'n , And I still linger here . Brothers , farewell , We soon shall meet again ! Exit . Enter Ravillac forcing along Adelaide Adelaide . Adelaide Have mercy ! Ravillac . If , as you boast , Your hands are reeking with the blood of Rall , Their very touch is horror to my soul , Oh , are there none to succour me ! Ravillac . Ravillac Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trembling emissaries , to whose care That dotard of a priest confided thee , Fled on the first alarm , like startled deer . They had , in truth , but little time for gallantry , Tho ' they evinc 'd hilarity of heel , That would have render 'd them successful wooers . No ! thou art in my power , and there must rest , Till I have cast thee off for fresher flow'rs . Adelaide . Adelaide In pity hear me ; here , e'en at thy feet , I ask for mercy . Add not crime to crime , Nor ruin one , who seems by all deserted . Ravillac . Ravillac And dost thou ask for pity from that heart , Which once was held in scorn ? ' t is idle all . I had none for the priest , who rear 'd me up , E'en with a father 's love  --  for once he wrong 'd me . I had none for that dark-eyed one , tho ' she Held out her infant boy to soften me ; Ay , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought in vain . Carabasset Carabasset ( as he suddenly advances . ) Behold him here ! Prepar 'd to fasten on that famish 'd wolf , That has lap 'd up the blood of all his kindred . Adelaide Adelaide ( rushing out . ) O , Heav'n accept my thanks ! Ravillac . Ravillac Vile Indian dog ! And hast thou ventur 'd thus across my path , To rob me of the prize within my grasp ? Thy rashness dooms thee to a viler death Than that of all thy race . For , rest assur 'd , To grace our triumph thou shalt be reserv 'd , Then hang in chains for the rude winds to sport with . Ho , there ! guards ! Carabasset . Carabasset I , too , had doom 'd thee to a ling'ring death , A death by torture ; but that coward call Hath sav 'd thee from thy due . This to that brain , That wrought such desolation . ( Fight and Ravillac falls . ) Ravillac . Ravillac Yes , thou hast clove me down ; my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Would he had fallen by some other hand . ( Guards enter . ) Curse , on ye , sluggish knaves ! why this delay ? Take him alive  --  give him a felon 's death ; If he escape , your lives shall answer it . ( Carabasset retreats , fighting , to the back of the stage and suddenly ascends to the summit of a high crag . ) Ravillac . Ravillac Oh , what a thirst consumes :  --  a river near , And yet no hand one single drop to offer . ( Dies . ) Carabasset . Carabasset Advance , and I will hurl ye from this cliff Into the gulph that yawns beneath . Behold The last of all the Norridgewoks  --  a race Who die in battle . Cowards , do ye think That Carabasset , he who led them on , In many a bloody conflict , would submit To the vile cords that ye would bind him with ? Return , return and tell your masters this  --  Tell them he scorn 'd to be the sport of slaves ; Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whom he had drag 'd as captives  --  ay , of those , Whose lips do quiver when they mention him . Go , tell them this . Tell them that thus a Norridgewok hath liv 'd , And thus  --  can die .
