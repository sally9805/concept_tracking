txt THERE are moments in life , in which serious thoughts sue for admittance into the mind , with an energy which will take no denial ; in which the giddy slaves of impulse entertain for a while that strange guest , contemplation , and in which , the reflections of the naturally meditative assume an unusually grave and pensive character . Such are the anniversaries of our birth and of any striking event in our lives , of great epochs in the history of mankind or of individual nations , and such too are those days in which the year changes its masters and the empire of a new season begins . The luxuriant promise of Spring , the ample fulfilment of Summer , the golden prodigality of Autumn and the deathlike repose of Winter , suggest , each itspeculiar trains of reflection , *and each addresses itself to mankind , with a degree of pow*er varied and modified by the age , circumstances and temperaments of individuals . We are now entering upon that sombre period of the year , during which exhausted Nature seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie down to a long sleep , from which she may arise invigorated , to begin anew her benevolent and vast energies of production and increase . We have been standing for the last two months , as it were , by the bedside of the " dying year , " and have been able to mark each successive step in the progress of decay . Day after day , we have seen the sun wheeling through a smaller arc of the heavens , and , day after day , darkness has been extending its conquests into the empire of light . We have seen the leaves of the trees exchange the glossy brightness of summer , for deepening shades of brown , and finally detach themselves from the twigs on which they nodded and danced , and lie in unsightly masses in the fields and by the roadside . The wind has lost that fragrant and spiritual character which it had in the seasons of blossoms and of fruits , and either howls through the air in angry gusts , or sighs along in that cold and melancholy under tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trims his studious lamp , and through the watches of the night beholds the cheerful blaze of his hearth reflected from the faces of those he loves . He , who can view with an untouched spirit the great and solemn changes which have been going on in the world around him , must be as insensible as the inanimate forms in which these transformations are displayed . There 65 // is a vividness in the teachings of Nature , which long familiarity can not diminish , nor continued repetition wear out . That the lines of decay are written upon all things human , is a truth so obvious , that the mind assents to it at once , without the trouble of reflecting ; and it requires no common genius , at this age of the world , to set it forth in such a manner as that we shall not regard it with the most listless indifference . We have read of it in so many books and heard it in so many sermons , it has rounded the perio*jls of so many essayists and strung the lyres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most gifted mind , and lips that are wet with the dew of inspiration , that can treat the subject in such a way as to make our bosoms throb to any new emotion . But it is not so with Nature . The instructions gathered from her broad page have the fresh and enduring beauty of flowers . There is an eloquence in her exhortations , constant as they are , which always arrests our attention , and a music in her voice , which familiarity renders but more sweet . The ocean is the same sublime object to him who has from childhood listened to the solemn and ceaseless dash of its billows . When we stand upon the mountain 's top we can not help feeling that we are nearer heaven , though our youthful feet may have wandered over every green nook and leafy dell upon its sides . And so it is with the changes that are ever going on upon the face of the earth . Each year renews the same vast and beautiful drama , and each year awakens the same reflections and teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autumn effects in our scenery , are as obvious and common as any thing can well be ; yet who can look at the forests , clad in the gorgeous and many-colored drapery with which that season invests them , or stand beneath their branches when their sere leaves are falling around him like snow-flakes , without having his heart touched , his pride checked , and his climbing thoughts brought down to that chastened and subdued strain of feeling , which the sight of decay , in any shape , so naturally awakens ? No matter how many times we may have contemplated the same scenes before ; they have lost no more of their old influence than of their old beauty . We may have watched the hues of three score and ten Autumns , and yet we can not turn in weariness from them as from a stale jest or an oft-repeated story . There is a striking and philosophical passage in the poems of one , who deserves to be called the high-priest of Nature , which is not inappropriate to the subject of our reflections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we need hardly make an apology for inserting it . " In youth we love the darksome lawn Brushed by the owlet 's wing , Then twilight is preferred to dawn , And Autumn to the Spring . Sad fancies do we then affect , In luxury of disrespect , To our own prodigal excess Of too familiar happiness . " WoRDswORTH 's ODE TO LycoRis . These lines seem to us as true as they are beautiful , though that might not be the impression left by their first perusal . Youth is , in its own essence , a prompter of vernal thoughts . It is itself a perpetual spring . It is full of light , and bloom , and promise . The season of Spring // affects a young man less , because he sees , in its hues and forms , the reflected images of his own thoughts . The tone of the outward world chords so exactly with the strain of his own buoyant emotions , that he hardly heeds it . He requires an external influence , which shall throw him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural offspring of his mind . This he finds in the melancholy repose of Autumn . The old man , on the contrary , is " fallen into the sere and yellow leaf , " and his thoughts are tinged with an autumnal soberness and gloom , and the brightness and activity of Spring are dear to him , because it gives them an impulse , and sheds upon them a gleam of sunshine . Old age , too , lives in memory , as youth in anticipation . It delights to be carried back to the time when its energies were new and unexhausted , when life , was in its blossom , and the world wore the beauty of promise . An illustration of the contrary taste of the two different periods of life , may be found in that law of magnetism , whereby the similar poles of two magnets repel each other while the opposite ones attract . But this is wandering somewhat from the direct track of our subject . There are various causes which operate to give a sober coloring to the thoughts which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us are calculated to inspire them ; the brown earth , the leafless trees and the mournful wind that sighs through them , and that peculiar bright and cold look of the sky , especially during the few moments of evening twilight . The effect of these impressions of the senses is aided by other considerations . The close of the year is a time when we pause and look back at the events which have marked its progress , and especially those in which we ourselves are most directly interested . There are few men , over whose heads a period of twelve months passes without bringing some affliction ; and now memory will call up the ghosts of buried enjoyments , and bid the wounds of sorrow bleed afresh ; and if we ourselves have been so favored as to have had an unbroken flow of prosperity and happiness , it can not be the case with many who are dear to us , and we make their sufferings our own ; for he , who thinks at all , thinks for others as well as himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us or our friends , any unexpected piece of good fortune , or unhoped deliverance from great danger , will be , or ought to be , characterized by awe of the power which has been displayed , and gratitude for the direction in which it has been exerted . This , too , is the season of self-examination ; and a man will seriously ask himself the question , whether he have not wandered farther from God and truth , than he was a year ago ; whether he have not often yielded to temptation when a little more resistance would have vanquished the tempter , and whether he have not often sinned when there was no temptation at all , but only the impulse of his own lawless and uncontrolled desires . It will not be enough for him to ascertain that he is no worse than he was before ; it should fill him with shame and compunction , if he be not perceptibly better ; and if his moral nature be not improved , he may be sure that it has deteriorated , for there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with a human soul as with a boat propelled against a stream ; if the progressive effort be relaxed a moment , it will go backward ; and no man of any enlargement of mind , or philanthropy of feeling , will // think merely of himself or of his own immediate friends . In accordance with the noble sentiment of Terence , he will feel himself a man , and be interested in whatever relates to humanity . He will reflect upon the great discoveries in science and the arts which have been made ; upon the new light which has been shed upon moral and religious truth ; upon the more extended diffusion of the means of happiness and comfort , and the progress which the world has made in sound thinking and good conduct . He , who takes this wide view , will perceive much to make him sober ; for states and empires have likewise their alternations of prosperity and adversity . Nations may be sitting around us in sackcloth and ashes , cities may have fallen into the jaws of earthquakes , pestilence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless millions may be running to waste for want of the fresh air and genial sunshine of Liberty . He will find in such reflections a source of consolation for his own sorrows ; for how poor and trifling must they seem , in comparison with the afflictions which throw whole realms into mourning. * One of the Greek pastoral poets , in lamenting the death of his friend , complains of the peculiarly hard lot of mankind . The flowers , he says , that wither and die beneath the chilling breath of Winter , we know will appear again in the ensuing Spring and gladden the earth anew with the same beauty of hue and form ; but when we have consigned to the earth the bodies of our friends , it is to a long , endless sleep . There is no spring to the winter of the tomb . We shall no more again see the face that was dear to us , nor hear the voice that we loved . To the natural mind , without the light of revelation , such would be the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural law of association , would be those , which the present season would awaken . How melancholy must have been the winter reflections of an ancient Greek or Roman , who had elevation of soul and superiority of mind enough to feel the " longing after immortality , " but whose intellect was not of that colossal order , as to be able to catch a faint and twilight glimmering of that " day-spring from on high , " with which our eyes have been blessed . The external universe , though the theatre of continual changes , yet seemed stamped with the impress of endless duration . The bending sky appeared a broad page , on which eternity was written in letters of light . To him that looked upon the floor of ocean , the very first thought was one of boundless extent and unceasing motion . The natural mind could conceive of no power , which could make the mountains melt like wax , and hush the awful voice of the cataract . Even the most delicate flower or fragile shrub , contained within itself an indestructible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead , was in fact only sleeping . But as for man , he was as the shadow of smoke , and vanished away like morning dew . Disappointment and sorrow attended upon his steps during his short life , and soon , weary and faint , he sunk down upon the lap of Earth , and his strong and graceful limbs were resolved into the ele * Ex Asia rediens , cum ab Egina Megaram versus navigarem , cspi regiones circumcirca conspicere . Post me erat Egina , ante Megara , dextra Pirstus , sinistra Corinthus ; qusi oppida quodam tempore florentissima fuerunt , mine prostrata ac diruta , ante oculos jacent . Osipi egomet sic cogitare .

Ep . 5. // ments , and became like the senseless clods . That which gave light to the eye , bloom to the cheek , and motion to the form , had gone ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourner 's voice ; the spirit 's home was not in the depths of ocean , nor in the caves of the earth ; and the wind brought no tidings of its flight . They mocked themselves with fables of Elysian fields and islands of the blest , but these were but the dreams of poets , and were the abodes only of heroes , and statesmen , and princes . But for the husband , the father , the child , the friend , whose names had never been blown about the world , and who lived only in the hearts of a few survivers , as humble as they themselves had been , for them there was no home . The body and the soul had alike departed . We , who have walked in the cheering and invigorating light of revelation , can hardly have any idea of the heart-sickening desolation which must have been occasioned by such thoughts as these , whether called forth by affliction , or suggested by external objects . But it may be doubted whether a deeper study of the laws of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have proved to them that the one was necessarily liable to dissolution and decay , and the other as necessarily exempted from them , though the direct evidence of the senses would have established entirely opposite conclusions . Indeed , that doubt is at an end , by the fact , that more than one of the leading minds of antiquity believed firmly in the immortality of the soul , though they were unable to give a satisfactory " reason for the faith that was in them . " * There is no diversity between what is commonly called Nature , and Revelation , but , on the contrary , the most beautiful and perfect analogy . Nature is the vestihule to the temple of Revelation , and each is the work of the same Divine Builder . As we can look up and behold the sky and the stars " face to face , " and look down and see their image in a clear fountain at our feet , so in the workings of our own minds , in the laws of the material world and the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows , more or less distinct , of the great truths which our Savior was sent to teach . But be this as it may , it does not diminish , one jot , the unspeakable value of that conviction of the immortality of the soul , which we derive from revelation . The opinion was confined to a few of the most distinguished philosophers , and even with them , the strength of their belief arose from the strength of their hope and the ardor of their aspirations ; and the arguments , by which they supported the doctrine , would not have convinced themselves on any other subject . But with us it is no longer a conjecture or a hope , but a life-giving truth ; it does not feebly glimmer upon a few lofty minds , but it is as universal as air and light , and as blessed in its operation . It illuminates the humblest mind ; it breathes peace into the lowliest heart . For us there is a voice breaking the marble silence of the tomb , which tells us that " death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and that the cold and senseless * The New Testament contains the certain proof of the immortality of the soul . He who believes in the genuineness and authenticity of the books , must , as a necessary consequence , believe also the doctrine to be true . But there can be no doubt that it was firmly believed by more than one of the leading minds of antiquity . In the celebrated dialogue of Plato , entitled Ph*edo , nothing is more remarkable than the contrast between the strong and deep conviction of the truth of the soul 's immortality in the author 's mind , and the insufficiency , and almost absurdity of the arguments by which he attempts to prove it . // form , which we consign to its embrace , is not the being that we loved , but the perishing tabernacle in which he dwelt , and that he himself has entered upon a new state of existence , in which his enlarged and purified faculties are presented with more abundant materials for intellectual and moral growth . Death has indeed lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A ray from heaven turns into beauty the gloomy ruins of earthly expectations , and there the celestial flower of hope blooms brightest , and wafts an undying perfume . How infinitely more to be desired is the condition of the poorest and humblest human being in Christendom , to that of the most gifted and learned of the philosophers of antiquity . The leading principle of all religions of human origin , is a deification of strength and power . To the unlettered heathen , the divinity of Jupiter was in his thunderbolts , and that of Apollo in his arrows . The sage , who was too enlightened to be the slave of such gross delusions , worshiped a vague abstraction , which he called the soul of the universe , an all-pervading , intellectual essence , which bore the same relation to the outward world , that the mind of man does to his body , and which was the ocean , from which the stream of each human soul derived its origin , and to which it again returned . But the glory of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions , and one of the most convincing proofs of its divine origin , is , that it is eminently a religion of the affections . It is , throughout , consistent with the character of its founder , who wept at the tomb of Lazarus , and " suffered little children to come unto him , and forbade them not . " The mourner goes to it for consolation , and he that rejoices , finds in its promises and assurances an additional motive for cheerfulness and contentment . It points us to a light , which shines brighter and brighter , as the scene grows darker around us . It exalts the unobtrusive qualities of character , the virtues of charity , patience and humility , and teaches that " he that ruleth his own spirit is greater than he that taketh a city . " And , above all , it gives an elevating self-respect to every member of the human family ; it bids the obscurest man lift up his brow with a noble confidence , and take his proper stand among God 's works , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And that the lowliness of his station will be no more of a bar to his obtaining the rewards of well-doing , than the greatness of the great will serve him for a screen against the punishment of guilt . Take all the eloquence , the poetry and the philosophy of antiquity , and multiply their sum a thousand fold , and what a heap of rubbish do they seem , when compared with the short and simple declaration , " I am the resurrection and the life ; he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live . " Thus the mind of the Christian will not shrink from the gloom and cheerlessness of winter , nor will he be utterly cast down with the thoughts which it calls forth . Nor will he recoil in horror from the Autumn of life , and the wintry repose of the tomb . He will feel that the purposes , for which he was created , can be no more completed without the one , than the functions of the natural year can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though linked for a time to a perishing body , he is , by his immortal nature , immeasurably superior to the grandest and most majestic forms of Nature . Whatever is seen and material , must die at last , though it live for countless centuries ; whatever // is unseen and spiritual , must live forever . Neither the bulk of the mountain , nor the compactness of the diamond , secures them against the operation of the universal laws of matter , while not only the mind is immortal , but each of its acts may be said to be also , since they influence its nature and character of that which lives forever . Every progress , which each mind makes in virtue , knowledge and religion , every instance of self-denial and of suffering for the sake of principle , every victory which , on the field of a human heart , the hosts of heaven gain over the armies of earth ,  --  they are each and all recorded in the book of God 's remembrance , and the angels in heaven take cognizance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirge-like sound through the naked arms of the forests , and the objects around us speak of a beauty that has departed , yet the thoughts , which they call forth , though tinged with something of a natural sadness , will be as far removed from the bitterness of despair , as from the exhilaration of joy.
