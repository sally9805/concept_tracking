txt IT is hard to describe such a character ; I had given it up in despair , not because the waters are not clear , but because they are too deep . Yet I have been a frequent hearer of Jr . Taylor , and if without advantage it is the fault of the soil , not of the seed . Mr. Taylor is a prodigy - but he is a work of nature only ; art can claim no credit in him . The senses supply him with the most rapid and definite perceptions , and his affections embrace all mankind ; his imagination is easily moved by the beautiful or sublime , and his heart is even more accessible to what is good and true ; his sense of natural law is above all treatises of sages , and his spirit is devout to martyrdom . Fortune , however , has favored him less than nature . But he has had one vast advantage , which none receive at school . His mind grew up , not among words , but things : no vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary signs : his idea of the ocean came not from the shaded portion of a map , - nor did he acquire his conception of a mountain or a river from characters or carved lines upon paper , - but the mountain as God created it , rivers and seas , in all their sublimity and beauty , are pictured fresh in the gallery of his imagination . This is to him a source of moral as well as intellectual activity , and excites continual love and gratitude to the Creator . This peculiar education explains one class of his eloquent passages . If , in the way of illustration , he introduces some aspect of nature , a finished picture begins to rise to his imagination , and he sweeps down the river , lost in the beauty of the banks , for this Homeric spirit sometimes leads him , as it did Homer , from the subject illustrated . Then , an object in the landscape that is before his imagination , may remind him of some other mental fact or moral truth - and this rushes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may fail to perceive the chain , though it has been unbroken in his own mind . When , therefore , he seems incoherent , it is only because we have been inattentive . His thoughts are not broken into fragments , though they are not strung artificially like pearls . His mind is strong enough to obey the highest laws of thought ; but it is unconscious of the minor rules invented to regulate limited discourses . His is a better form of intellect for acquiring truth than for communicating it - though lie has qualifications for instructing higher than his power of imagination and illustration . In many cases , his discourses will bear the test of all the rules of art , - but on these occasions he must have a // great subject , with a few minutes to feel and arrange it .. He surveys such a subject , from zenith to nadir , with a proportionate attention to the various parts , which are disposed in a striking light and shade , and with an aerial perspective that leaves on the mind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's church has heard many sermons , which , if written out , would amount to all the writings of some celebrated names . This indicates a genius of a very high order , for it is all his own - he derives nothing from books , nothing from the thoughts of others . All comes forth finished and well-proportioned , as it rises for the first time in his own mind . How many men could write a first draught more perfect than Mr. Taylor 's improvisations ? His productions have not the revision and polish of after-thought , nor are they dug out of the quarry of a perfect language , like the Greek , or even of a simple one , which is so favorable to the uneducated improvisatori of other nations . ri*he English language , with heterogeneous elements , is complicated by the terms of many arts and sciences , and by still greater adulterations made by affectation , pedantry , ranks , and coteries . No mortal man , whose library of education did not include grammar and dictionary , can of himself classify and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be a miracle for Mr. Taylor to use language with the perfection of Milton or Shakspeare . But the language , as presented to Mr. Taylor 's mind , is words only in their naked values as expressive of things sensible and spiritual , without the stamp of any standard author to direct him in his choice , - and great is his power over it . His rare and powerful combinations of new words , his very mistakes , which are generally founded on a principle of philosophy , his evidence of a musical ear , reveal the very operations of a mind creating language out of a chaos of words . In an earlier era in the history of our language , instead of smiling at his mistakes in grammar and logic , we should admire his creation of a standard dialect , - his clear perception of things , his intuition of the analogies of sound and sense , his combination of the forms and colors of creation with spiritual subjects , ( or , as Brown would say , his natural associations of relative suggestion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressiveness , picturesqueness , and force . But he has a deeper fountain of eloquence than clearness of perception or splendor of imagination , in his natural sentiments . He has loved , rejoiced , and sorrowed in the various relations of social life , in his own person and hardly less in the persons of others . He has not contemplated men through other men 's perceptions and imaginations , spread out in a book , but he has studied them as they actually love , hate , sin , sorrow , and repent . The pageant of human life passes directly before his eyes , and the actors are near to his heart . He studies metaphysics , in // sympathy , which is as good a school-master as experience , for he feels for others quite as much as for himself . An excellent part of his discourses is that in which he paints the workings of a mind under the influence of the passions , and the variety and accuracy of these pictures show his universal sympathy . If these delineations are of the simple and humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is in contact with him . But he has occasional pictures of high spiritual exercises , which show the noble capacity and fine expression of his own soul , and I have seen him following with the most intelligent sympathy the thoughts of one of the most advanced minds of our age . If he pictures human beings in the coarseness of their actual state , he never leaves them there ; he discloses the nobleness of his own soul by seeming to feel it so easy , for the mind he describes , to attain good , and by showing the whole 1 ) rocess by which it rises to it from moral degradation . On the unwearied and strong wing of his own generous spirit , he seems to lift up a discouraged and despairing soul into the empyrean of its final destiny , until it catches the inspiration of his own native atmosphere . He then shows the revived mind and heart the road by which it mounted , and shows too , that it is not magic , but a moral process , which all can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness , if not of his power as a preacher . Birth , and marriage , and death , touch every chord of his soul . No one that has seen him baptize and kiss a child , or heard him pray with the afflicted , may fear that he will ever be destitute of human sympathy , while in human circumstances , during the life of Mr. Taylor . I never saw or felt such an effect produced by one man , as when he rose to perform the funeral service over the body of a sailor , whose wife and children were sitting under the pulpit . He seemed to command at once an identification of his whole audience , with the words-* ' Let us all pray - Father ! we are a widow - wilt thou comfort us . ' Not only the confined social sentiments are strong within him , but he has , in great strength , justice , general benevolence , and all the feelings that bind men to men in every conceivable relation . These general sentiments balance each other in a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force and expression of a passion . Mr. Taylor is a reasoner - if to feel the proportion of things to each other , to have a quick perception of the contradictory working , of incompatible principles of action in practice , - is the result of reasoning powers . He especially excels in that sensing of a subject , which seems to be the combined and proportional action of every faculty . // But to reason abstractedly , perhaps he is not able . It is not his habit to think out patiently what specific propositions are involved in general ones , and he looks at words too much as pictures , to be an accurate logician . Then we must not forget that his religious creed came into his mind with all the authority of revelation ; that it was never balanced on his reasoning powers . The Methodist association , with its sympathetic habits of intercourse , its professed moral inquisition into the conduct of its members , its informal style of preaching , its indulgence of emotion , has a thousand charms for his warm hearted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfulness of heart and constancy of mind , moreover , bind him more strongly to a community , of which he is the pride , and which he loves all the better , because he thinks it has no worldly fame or glory . No man has more charity and liberality . He believes that the same ideas can take different forms in the mind ; he does not define error as impiety , or indifference to religion . But this is a matter of the heart , not of the head . The truth is , that the character of his soul makes up for an intellect not developed on some particular subjects ; and though we may , in analyzing him , find some imperfections , yet the result of his character of heart and intellect , in their reciprocal influence , has seldom been surpassed . His manners are courteous and cordial , with a due self-respect . He is playful and full of wit , and has a remarkable adaptation of himself to circumstances and society . It was related to me by a lady , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after knowing of his power over the sons of the sea , that she was forcibly and repeatedly struck with his grace . The first time that I myself saw him , I was struck with the softness and sweetness of his voice - which was tuned just to the pitch of the nervous ear of the present invalid . His conversation was , to a remarkable degree , characterised by beauty . It was upon perfection of character , which he defined to be that state in which the inspiration of goodness did the work of self-government . Perhaps , indeed , he does not sufficiently estimate that moral discipline , which is so necessary for perfection . His piety is great , but with some earthly admixture . It is , however , noble in its character , for he loves God chiefly because he is good . But he regards Him rather too much as his own personal friend , and the personal friend of a certain class of individuals - for here his sectarian association casts a vapor on the mirror of his mind . Yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not so much above it as he is in other traits of character . At his love-feasts , in his psalm-singing , and prayer-meetings , he comes down through sympathy far below that sphere to which his spirit tends . // It is this which sometimes shocks us in his prayers . He does not estimate the spirit of the Lord 's Prayer , in the depth and comprehensiveness of instruction - the formula of the Saviour Himself . If there is ever a time when self-government deserts iMr . Taylor , it is when he lifts up his voice to pray . He utters indeed such strains of poetry , music , love , sympathy , heavenlymindedness , as usust needs come up , when a spirit , that is overflowing with these things , spreads itself out without a veil in the unhounded confidence of filial affection ; hut they are crossed hy every floating dream , every image , however grotesque , every idea that may he brought hy the laws of association . They are always interesting as psychological studies , but they would not satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attended his church , have heard him ask a blessing in his prayer for the Commonwealth , the Governor , the Lieutenant Governor , the City of Boston , the Mayor , Aldermen , and Common Council . The note of a ship-master , departing on a voyage , sometimes ocasions similar invocations on the officers , crew , passengers , owners , and consignees . In doing this , he is impelled hy the current of his thoughts - the whole voyage rises before him and he follows the impulse . Though I have attempted to analyze this gifted mind , it is to he remembered that his regular audience is composed of persons who make no such attempts . They are seamen , orderly in their demeanor , and J ) roperly dressed . Their browned and weatherheaten faces are ever turned to their pastor , arid many a change comes over their features at his appeals . He omits no opportunity to inculcate a practical lesson , - if an idle boy , or an intoxicated man , occasions a momentary disturbance , he diverges instantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his resistless testimony against intemperance . Though there may sometimes he a mistake as to what word he intended to use , there is never any as to his meaning : he transfuses compLtely , both his thoughts and his sentiments , into the minds and hearts of his hearers . His language is ever strong and picturesque . In speaking of conscience , he said -* if we do not sin , why then are these hounds of self-comidemnation eternally yelping after us ? Many of his most felicitous illustrations are drawn from nautical affairs . He represents his hearers as being under a press of sail for eternity . There is a hond against you that will soon run out - but your creditor is easy if you will let him he so - here is the leger , ( holding up his bible ) come to the counting-room and settle . ' The bihle , which he has ever before him , and which he often holds up , he never touches hut with an apparent feeling of reverence . // I have been the most delighted when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated and felicitous - he seems to breathe an atmosphere of love and innocence . He apostrophised them as the little innocents , before a lie had stained their lips , or their hearts cogitated abominations . They wait for instruction , good or bad , like the flowers just opening to receive whatever breeze shall bloxv over them . If properly cultured , every day expands a leaf of heaven . In them heaven and earth meet - the communication is ever open , if you close it not . Few adults are worthy , but from these lambs is God 's harvest - here he gathers his songsters . The little cherubs when I see them I seem to hear the hells of heaven . ' Suffer little children to come unto me , and hinder them not . ' But you hinder them by your example , and by not encouraging them . There is their course , ( pointing to heaven ) do not HINDER them . If you do not , they are angels the moment the fluttering soul is released from its little cage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the little inquirer , thinks it can not be an important matter , which mother and father both neglect . ' There have never been more impressive warnings uttered against intemperance than by Mr. Taylor ; and he frequently recurs to these all-important admonitions . On one occasion he called upon all to oppose the destroyer , to crush it by united force , to bury it nearer hell , and roll against the door a rock as big as a planet . ' It is common to read in epitaphs , that the deceased has left in society a void which nothing can fill . Long may it be before this may be said of Mr. Taylor . It can be truly only of him , and the few who resemble him . There are no means of estimating the good performed by such a man - there is no moral census to show the number that be has reclaimed , or prevented from falling . He dreads nothing but moral evil - this is to him the complex of everything that is formidable . Sickness and death are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to perform the duties of life . These allow him little rest ; he is wearing himself out for others . And when his seat is vacant , where shall we find another so eloquent , pure , just , vigilant , and faithful . It will add to our sorrow to reflect , that such a mind , when it has quitted the body , should have left no monument , by which after-ages can estimate its capacity and goodness.
