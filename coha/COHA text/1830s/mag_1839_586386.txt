txt No subject possesses a higher practical importance to every individual of whatever pursuit or condition , than the public measure of value . The security of those wl*p have property , and the livelihood of those who have none , i*ain1y depend upon its stability . Though the people may enjoy theoretic power of self-government , yet by surrendering the control of the actual measure of value to irresponsible individuals , associations , or corporations , they in fact enslave themselves . For whoever possesses the power of taking the property or means of subsistence of any portion of the community without their consent , become in fact their absolute masters . The leading article of the London Quarterly Review for January of the preseet year  --  the great organ of the Conservative party which is now struggling for the political control of the British Empire-emphatically asserts that the experiment of self-government by the people , has totally failed in this country . When we find ourselves taunted before the world by the satellites of the corrupt aristocracy of England with the perversion of the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every American citizen who is worthy of the name , to ask himself , whether any ground in fact exists for this reproach , which is intended to bring odium upon the great cause of liberty . At the outset of our government , a deep laid plan was devised for counteracting the principles of the Constitution of the United States , by the false and fraudulent policy by which the people , the industrious producers , of so many nations have been impoverished , and practically enslaved , for the purpose of gratifying the luxury , and of promoting the personal aggrandizement of the few , through the control over the property and subsistence of the people which the paper system gives to its managers . Our first President felt himself most reluctantly obliged to sanction the charter of the first Bank of the United States . But the secret devices of the enemies of equal rights were exposed to the view of our citizens with surpassing ability by Jefferson , Madison , and John Taylor , of Caroline-that trio of great men , whose abilities and public services were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid of whom Virginia has so much reason to be proud . These apostles of rational liberty exposed the flimsy pretexts under which the *Report of the Committee of Finance upon the answer of the Secretary of the Treasury to a resolution of the Senate of the 4th of January , 1839 , requiring him to communicate any authentic information he may have recently received in respect to the modes of collecting , keeping , and disbursing public moneys in foreign countries .

The subtle machinery of the paper system could not be made sufficiently mysterious to conceal the snares which had been contrived for the subjugation of the people . The Democracy appreciated the designs of the papermoney speculators , and the p*litical ascendancy they had at first ebtained quniled before the light of truth . Subsequently to that eventful period , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public finances during the war , afforded another opportunity for grasping the control of the productive industry of the country . Under a similar pressure of necessity which had compelled Washington to grant his reluctant assent to the charter of the first Bank of the United States , Madison was induced to sanction that of the second . The previous departure from the principles of the Constitution , by authorizing the receipt of paper currency into the public treasury , had so generally expelled specie from circulation , that this great statesman was most unwillingly compelled to bow to the circumstances in which the country had become entangled , in order to carry on the Government . The security of property , which the operations of the paper system have so repeatedly and ruinously invaded , was the ground of the Revolutionary contest . The tax of two pence per pound upon tea was not a consideration in itself worthy the notice of our sagacious fathers . had it been acquiesced in , not an old lady throughout the continent would have been compelled to forego its indulgence upon any possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in amount , involved the whole question whether the people of the colonies possessed the control of their own property , or whether it belonged to the British Government . It was therefore a question of liberty or slavery . Currency involves the same question in a more complicated form . A false and fraudulent measure of value imposes burdens upon the community quite as substantial as , and , when carried to the extent it frequently has been in this country within the last twenty years , tenfold more destructive to the security of property than any sys-. tem of direct extortion which would be tolerated among an intelligent people . An individual may protect himself from being robbed on the highway by his personal prowess-he can not secure himself from plunder through the means of a false and fraudulent measure of value of which the use is recognized by law , but by contending against all the rest of the community . Any person who will calmly consider the immediate effects of the simultaneous suspension of specie payments by the banks in 1837 , and the los. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contracts previously entered into , which were paid in currency depreciated from ten to forty per cent . in different sections of the country , wi ! I judge whether , under the relative plentifulness and scarcity of currency produced in the same manner , these consequences have been over-stated . Many compliments have been from time to time bestowed upon the patience and forbearanc6* of the people under the sufferings caused by this infliction , and the measures adopted to bring it about . Those who profited by this gigantic fraud can well afford to bestow a few cheap flatteries upon their victims by way of soothing and preparing them for the next revulsion . On this occasion we can not refrain from alluding to a fact connected with the late suspension of specie payments , to which the attention of the public has never been sufficiently drawn , and which throws a flood of light upon the measures which produced it . The charter obtained by the Bank of the United States from the Legislature of Pennsylvania , at the commmencement of 1836 , contains a provision which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were admitted into the secret , had the strongest grounds for believing would inevitably cause the forfeiture of the charter in case the bank should for three months refuse to redeem its currency in specie . When the occasion called for its application , it was found that so far from affording the slightest protection for the interests of the community , this provision had been carefully drawn up in evident contemplation of the suspension which took place more than a year afterwards , and instead of insuring the payment of the currency of the bank , under the expected penalty , effectually secured the bank against the legal consequences of its violation of the most sacred of obligations . It was accordingly empowered to trample upon the rights of property with impunity for more than a year arid an half  --  and its final reluctant resumption was not occasiened by this penal provision , but by the overpowering force of public indignation . We do not propose to state the judicial decisions of the courts of Pennsylvania on this most important Question . They are however worthy of the seriotts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community against frauds are under consideration . Among the greatest improvements which the general use of paper currency has introduced among us , must be reckoned the entire reversal of the position of borrowers and lenders . Those who borrow the fruits of labor by the issue of paper currency , assume the guise of actual capitalists , upon whom the industry of the country is made dependent for support . The fallacy of the arguinents which impose upon hustling , unthinking men , and lead them to uphold a false and fraudulent measure of value by which they // are exposed to so many losses and inconveniences , would be at once perceived , were it not for the complexity of the operations performed by paper currency , which enables it manufacturers to practice the grossest impositions upon the community without de tection . An amusing illustration of this recently appeared in one of the daily papers , drawn up in law French , which probably added little to the facility of perceiving the ingenuity manifested in this report of a case , the like of which might , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of numerous transactions , somewhat similar , on a larger scale . We give its substance because it deserves to be more widely known as a familiar and striking specimen of the mode of reasoning upon currency , which perplexes and misleads so many well-meaning individuals . A person called at a bootseller 's shop , purchased a pair of boots at the price of seven dollars , and offered a bank note of fifty dollars in payment . Not having sufficient money on hand to refund the balance ( lue the purchaser , the seller stepped into a neighbouring establishment , and got the fifty-dollar note exchanged for an equal amount in small notes . After receiving his forty-three dollars , the purchaser welt away , and was not afterwards heard of . The next day the fifty-dollar note was ascertained to be a forgery . The individual who had exchanged it required the sum advanced upon it to be refunded , which was accordingly done by the bootseller . Lamenting his loss to one of his customers , the latter agreed to indemnify him for a certain stipulated sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree upon the amount of this loss , an action was brought upon this promise of indemnity , the bootseller claiming to have lost a hundred dollars . His first counsel insisted that he was entitled to the fifty dollars which he had repaid to his neighbour , to the forty-three dollars which he had given the purchaser in change , and the price of the boots , seven dollars , for which he was paid only by the forged note-making the hundred dollars which he demanded . The first counsel of the defendant , on the other hand , insisted that the loss was but fifty dollars , being the price of the boots , and the sum paid to the purchaser in change ; while the second counsel of the defendant maintained that the actual loss was but seven dollars , which he undertook to prove by an ingenious process of reasoning , too long for our limits . The remaining coi .. nsel for the plaintiff contended that he had lost the fifty dollars refunded , and the forty-three dollars paid to the purchaser , making ninoty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did not claim their price . The question proving too difficult to be readily settled by the tribunal before which it was depending , the opinions of the members of the bar present , not employed in the case , were asked . The first was of // opinion that the true sum lost was fifty-seven dollars , being the price of the boots , which he considered to be unpaid , together with the amount refunded by the seller to his neighbour . The second , that the actual loss was forty-three dollars , payment having been made for the boots , and the sum lost was merely the amount carried off by the purchaser ; while the third maintained with great earnestness that the amount lost was , first , fifty dollars , being the amount of the counterfeit noPt* secondly , the sum the bootseller refunded to his neighbor , fifty dollars more ; and lastly , the price of the boots , seven dollars , having never been paid for , but by the counterfeit note without value-making one hundred and seven dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elucidations  --  and the question appears to have been postponed. * We have met with several individuals whose pursuits led them to believe themselves fully acquainted with the subject of currency in its practical bearings , whose notions upon the office performed by bank notes led to quite as absurd consequences as those of some of the lawyers on this occasion . Sensitive as the established order of society has always shown itself to be , in all countries , in relation to paper currency , few persons , even of those who have attempted to enlighten the public on the subject , appear to have been disposed to form clear and accurate views upon it , and the mass of most communities have , in consequences been subject to the grossest impositions . The document which has led to these remarks upon paper currency contains the most satisfactory and authentic account of the practical operation of an exclusively metallic currency , on a large scale , that we have ever met with . It seems that the Secretary of the Treasury , soon after the adjournment of the last session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most important ports abroad , requesting answers to a set of queries upon the mode of collection , custody , and disbursement of public money which prevailed in their respective neighbourhoods . When the call upon him for this information was made by the Senate , replies appear to have been received from the consuls at London , Liverpool , Glasgow , Dublin , Paris , Hamburg , Bremen , Carthagen* , Kingston , in Jamaica , and Havana , which fufly explain the checks and facilities under which the revenues of the three great nations are collected , which , at different periods during the last two centuries , have * In addition to the anonymous instances of " members of the bar " here alluded to , as so completely bewildered upon any subject involving the manifold mystifica .. tions of paper-money , we could name an individual of deservedly distinguished professional character , who has long occupied a highly respectable place on the bench of the United States ' judiciary , whose opinion on the case here described was , that the loss sustained was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in illustration of the real and important truth shadowed forth ! ; nder the parable of this supposed fictitious casc of the pair of boots . // controlled the policy and commerce of the world-England , France , and Spain . The principle is found universally to prevail in every part of the commercial world excepting this country-that nothing but gold and silver is received for public dues . England , which has been so often cited as an exception , turns out otherwise . The Banks of England and Ireland , of which the whole capitals have been loaned to the Government , are the public b*kers of these two kingdoms . If payment is made to them in any other currency than their own notes , which they are bound to redeem in specie , the Treasury receives no credit for the payment until it has been realized in gold . The consul at Dublin , who is also the governor of the Bank of Ireland , states that the revenues of that kingdom are almost exclusively paid in Bank of Ireland notes , and does not therefore specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of England , Timothy A. Curtis , Esq. , in his evidence before the select committee on Joint Stock Banks in June last , as may be seen by his reply to the 137th interrogatory , expressly asserts that whenever the currency issued by the other banks is received from the collecting officers on public account , it is held by the Bank at their risk until it is converted into gold ; and not till this conversion takes place , are the amounts carried to the credit of the Treasury on the books of the Bank . It may therefore be distinctly asserted as an incontrovertible fact , that payments are made into the treasury of no other commercial country but our own , in any measure of value excepting gold and silver , and the obligations of the Government . By far the most able and interesting of these papers is the exposition of the monetary system of the island of Cuba , by the consul at Havana , N. P. Trist , Esq. , with the accompanying statements of eight of the principal merchants with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that great emporium of the tropical regions of the new world . The memoir is every way worthy of that distinguished member of the family of Jefferson . The same kind of talent  --  the eloquence , perspicacity , searching power of analysis , and true democratic philanthropy , for which the immortal author of the Declaration of Independence was so remarkable-is manifested throughout . The large number of the document , where it may be found entire , which was ordered to be printed by the Senate , renders it accessible to every individual who may feel curious to ascertain the prosperity and stability of agricultural and commercial operations upon the largest scale , under a system of exclusive metallic currency . In comihon with most of the citizens of the United States , we have been accustomed to regard paper currency , circulating under such restrictions as to make it convertible into specie at the will of // the holder , as possessing many conveniences . The facts set forth in this document have led us to a reconsideration of the subject , which has gone far to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mercantile classes , have been greatly overrated . Reflecting that the greatest money-marts of Europe  --  the centres of its vast commerce 4uring many ages-enjoying that political and personal indepenA*ence so essential to the prosperity of trade-had never resorted to the use of paper currency , we became convinced that its importance had been exaggerated . Amsterdam , Venice and Hamburg , until the recent ascendency of the paper system among the monarchies of Europe , were the republican managers of nearly its whole commerce . They had banks enjoying the highest credit , and effecting important benefits  --  but they were not banks issuing paper currency . No man of sound judgment who investigates the mode in which business was transacte&amp; in those great emporiums , but must become satisfied-if the experience of the last twenty years in this country has not already convii*ced him-that commercial enterprize is on the whole more injured than promoted by the false stimulus of paper currency , in consequence of the fluctuations of price and the instability of property which it always produces . At this moment in our western hemisphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . At about the same period of the sixteenth century , two commercial cities were founded by Spain , in distant parts of her American dominions , Buenos Ayres and Havana . The former was placed near the mouth of one of the largest rivers in the world , watering an extensive territory , which comprehends a vast portion of the best climate and most fertile soil of the South American continent . The city itself derived its name from its salubrity . For a long series of years it carried on an extensive and increasing commerce . But the colony of which it was the capital having become an independent republic , in an evil hour it was unfortunately determined to realize the great advantages which superficial thinkers are apt to believe may be derived from the use of paper currency . The results at this time are familiar to all well informed and intelligent men . Not only is the wealth of its merchants almost wholly destroyed , but its commerce , before the recent blockade by the French , which was occasioned by the profligate public policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere trifle , compared to what it must have been under its unparallelled local advantages , but for the practical destruction of the commercial standard of value . Its paper currency , before the blockade , was worth from eight to ten to one compared with specie  --  and the whole country from this cause has long been in a condition bordering // upon anarchy . How the existing difficulties , arising wholly from its paper currency , are to be longer borne  --  or how they are tn be remedied without encountering new suffering and privationsappears , by the most recent accounts , to be a problem equally perplexing to its riders . rvlley will probably be soon relieved from further responsibilities on account of the public interests , if the recent advices of the internal conditiQn of that country prove correct . Havana was founded upon an adl*iirable harbour , from which it derives its name , in the island of Cuba . This island is about eight hundred miles long , and at the broadest part perhaps a hundred miles wide , but generally much narrower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it capable of improvement . Under a system of metallic currency , Havana has become the second commercial city of this hemisphere . In no other city , perhaps , in the world is commercial credit so uniform and unquestionable . Commodities are sold , and local improvements effected on the most liberal terms  --  but the practice of surety-ship among its commercial men , by which so many are ruined under the paper system , is wholig unknown in Havana , because there are no mercantile failures . By a rigid adherence to the standard of value , its great and increasing commerce is freed from those ruinous fluctuations which false and fictitious credits have produced among us , and consequently commercial paper at long dates is negociated with great ease , in. variably without endorsement or guarantee . No region of country of equal extent , probably in the world , has improved with equal rapidity and security as the island of Cuba within the last thirty years . Its revenues now exceed in amount those of several European kingdoms . Commerce and agriculture are equally prosperous and advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to control the subsistence of the people by arbitrary contractions and expansions , as under the Republic of La Plata . Hence in a great degree , if not entirely , the difference of their condition , though possessing the same habits and origin . We can not close our reference to this valuable production of Mr. Trist , for which we tender him the sincere tribute of our thanks , and of our opinion that he has in a signal degree " deserved well of the Republic , " without making one quotation from it which will serve to whet the appetite of our readers to procure the entire document itself , of which we only regret that , instead ( if ten thousand copies , the Senate did not print , for universal distribution throughout all classes of our citizens , merchants and manufacturers as well as farmers , ten times ten thousand : " Here , then , are the facts . Here is flourishing industry , flourishing credit , above all , flourishing commerce , if such a thing exists under the sun . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only thing that admits of it is , as to // the inferences that arc deducible from them . One of these is , that here there can not possibly exist any one other thing , in its nature absolutely incompatible with a flourishing commerce , or with any one of the elements requisite to its high prosperity . The utmost that , in this respect , comes within the range of possibility , is , that there may exist here two other things , one of which is essentially inimical to a flourishing commerce , but the influences of which admit of being neutralized by those of the other . Another equally plain inference deducible from them is , that if any such inimical cause exists here , there must also exist some other cause of an opposite character , of sufficient efficacy *p at least neutralize whatever injurious indoences may belong to the former . * " Now , then , for two other facts , regarding the two most prominent and controlling , if they be not the only , causes that are of a nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , is a metallic currency , an exclusive metallic currency ; and here , also , on the other hand , exists an ae5solute mo rehy , maintained by the gleam of the bayonet , as constantly in the eye of every individual as the rays of the sun or the moon ; and the leading , all-comprehensive , characteristic of which is , that it regulates eve* thing and every man , to an extent that is literally inconceivable to an American citizen . These are two things which exist here , in company with the flourishing commerce . Is either of them essentially inimical to it ? Is this the anture of the metallic currency ? If yea , then must its prosperity be due to the counteracting efficacy of the despotism . On the other hand , is the latter essentially inimical to industry , to enterprise , to credit , to commerce ? If yea , then must their prosperous state be owing to the influences of the metallic currency ; and these , so far from being essentially inimical to it , can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , in so eminent a degree as , after expending upon the counteraction of the evil influences of despotic government a portion of its efficacy commonsurate with their scope and intensity , to have enough remaining to afford them all the positive aid which it is in the nature of currency to afford . " Such is the alternative presented by the facts of the case , considered solely in itself and with regard to one point ,  --  the essential compatibility or incompatibility between a metallic currency and a flourishing state of industry , credit , and commerce . In this alternative , the judgment of the most pondering American citizen can experience but little hesitation . We may now compare the facts of this case with those of another , with a view to another point . " In the one case we see a flourishing commerce , and that flourishing commerce , accompanied with an absolute exemption from monetary convulsions or disturbances of any kind or degree whatsoever , great or little , general or partial . In connexion with these two facts , we have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government with its countless influences , direct and indirect-tropical productions ,  - -  tropical indolence of mind and of body , harmonizing with and augmenting the efficacy of all those influences of the government which have power deleteriously to affect industry , enterprise , or credit ,  --  roads which , during a considerable portion of the year , are literally impassable , and , at their best , such that the most valuable products of the soil , after being manufactured , will scarcely bear the cost of a land carriage of fifty miles ,  --  the plough in universal use , all over the country , from its resnotest settlement to the fields under the very walls of the capital , such , that if a wagonload of them were emptied out at the door of any backwoods settler in our country , they would not be deemed by him of any possible value , unless it were as firewood and old iron . These are a few of the particulars , whereof a much longer catalogue might be presented . " lathe other case we see a flourishing commerce also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is steady , and is withal accompanied with a monetary disquiet , so constant that its hourly manifestations attract no more notice than the smoking of Vesuvius excites among the people of Naples ; and which , every few years , displays itself in an appalling explosion that leaves no corner in the country unshaken . In connexion with these two facts , we have also a paper currency ,  --  a democratic government , // with its countless influences , direct and indirect ,  --  productions of the temperate zone ,  --  northern activity of mind and body , harmonizing with and augmenting the efficacy of all those influences of the government which have power favorably to affect industry , or enterprise , or credit ,  --  roads , canals , railways , already covering the whole country like one vast net-work , reducing the fatigue of travelling to nothing , and the cost of transportation from one extremity of the Union to another to a mere song ,  --  the plough every month adds some new perfection to , although it has long since done its work with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , are two cases which presept themselves for comparison . In each we see a flourishing commerce , which , in the*ne case , although it exhibits fits and starts* jerks and pauses , which are unseen in the other , may be said , in its average rate , to he about equal to the steady movement of the other . With the single exception of this one particular , however , the two cases present , in every respect , the moet perfect contrast . The first point of contrast is the absolute exemption of the one from all monetary convulsions , disturbance , disorder , or disquiet ; while , in the other , this evil never for an instant ceases to prevail , in a greater or a less degree , and periodically displays an intensity , the horrors of which can be likened to nothing but those suffered by a plague-stricken city . This difference must have a cause ; and this cause can not be looked for elsewhere than in some of the particulars , directly and intimately connected with industry and trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference exists between the two cases . " Some of these points of difference I have just enumerated , each of which either comprehends , or belongs to , a class embracing an infinite number of others that must partake of the same nature : so that the enumeration , although not long , leaves little room for addition to its comprehensiveness . " Can , then , the difference in regard to the entire absence of monetary disturbance from the one , and its eternal presence in the other , be traced to any of these as its cause ? " To begin at the bottom of the catalogue , can the cause be found in the difference which exists between the make of the plough in the two countries , or in any difference of which it affords an indication ? If not there , can the cause be found in the difference between the means of transportation ? Is there in impassable roads , or in aught resulting from them , or in aught of which they afford an indication , any virtue to secure a country against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind and body , as compared with northern activity of both ? Or if not in that difference , can it be traced to sugar , coffee , and cigars , as compared with cotton , rice , flour , lumber , cod-fish , and che*ving tobacco ? If in none of these , perhaps it may exist in the superior excellence of a despotism , as compared with a free government ? But this is a point , the discussion of which would be a hopeless matter with any American ; and if it is irreverently passed over , nothing is left to rest upon except the conclusion , that the difference in question arises solely upon that which , in the nature of things , does and must exist between a metallic currency , which affords to every man the real use of money , thus inseparably attaching to every transaction all the safeguards naturally belonging to it ; and a paper currency , which compels every man to content himself with the verbal use of money , and strips all the transactions of the community of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harmony amongst all . Considered in itself , therefore , the case presented by the Island of Cuba affords conclusive proof , that an exclusively metallic currency is not only compatible with an eminently prosperous state of industry , credit , and commerce , but that it must necessarily exercise over them active influences of a prefiminently salutary character . " Compared with the case presented by our country , the two afford proof of another truth of no small moment , to wit : that even when counteracted by influences the most adverse , the salutary efficacy of a metallic currency is still so potent as t ' ford a perfect and absolute security against monetary convulsions or disorders : ren // 321 dering their spontaneous occurrence at home , or their introduction from abroad equally impossible . " Nor is it undeserving of mention , that the metallic currency which here affords such manifestations of the influences inseparable from its nature is far from being a perfect one . It consists of the gold ounce and its fractions , half ; quarter , and eighth , - at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation consists altogether of the two lowest silver fractions of the dollar , the eighth and the sixteenth in the small quantities requisite for making change : and beyond this , of the peseta of Seville , at the arbitrary value of fout* , o the dollar , while their real value is of five ; so that in the purchases , which occur at every instant , to the amount of the lowest coin in circulation , the purchasei* , if he has not that coin about him , gives a peseta and receives his purchase , together with chance to the same identical amount , almost , as that of the peseta . Disadvantages of the same nature attend every exchange of a gold piece for pesetas ; and others of a more serious character are silently but more surely working their appropriate effects . " But , notwithstanding these imperfections , it has sufficed to exercise the influences above described ; and with regard to it merely as a circulating medium ) for the hourly purposes of society , I have never , in a single instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor have I ever heard any inconvenience of any kind mentioned in connexion with it , by resident , or by traveller from any part of the globe . On the other hand , I do not recollect to have met with one who had visited our country , who , however agreeable all his other recollections might be , did not speak with the deepest disgust of our shocking* currency . ' For the purpose of throwing additional light upon the subject we subjoin an extract from a recent letter from the most unquestionable mercantile authority , relative to the currency of Brazil , upon which some remarks were made in our third Article on the production and manufacture of cotton , in our Number of last June . " The wretched state of the finances of our country has been for many years a source of great anxiety to people engaged in the Brazil trade , and unless speedy measures are adopted by the Legislature I see no chance of immediate improvement. - It is true the country possesses immense resources , if properly called forth , and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too much competition for power , to admit of much unity of purpose on the part of the representatives of the people , and hence it is that hitherto so little has been done in Brazil to improve the circulating medium . Our currency consists entirely of paper and copper , and its amount , in round numbers , is about 40,000,000 milreas , or , at the exchange of 40d. the milrea , to ? 6,666,666 sterling . This sum is not by any means too much for the necessities of business , but jt wants the desirable attribute of being convertible into precious metels at the will of the holder , which is the only sure foundation for a paper currency. ** The artifice has often been repeated by those who have determined to destroy the successful exercise of the great principle of self-government , to push its doctrines to the extreme of licentiousness in order to create the necessity for placing political power in arbitrary and irresponsible hands . This was done with great effect in France during the disorders brought upon that nation by mistaken policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Louis XVI . was on the throne , which led to his decapitation-ait ( l again during the Republic , which led to the despotism of Napoleon . In our own country we have lately seen a class of politicians whose principles and practice , whenever they have been able // to employ either , have invariably led to the regulation by the General Government of the paper currency-all at once denouncing any restraints upon the issue and universal receipt of paper , by whomsoever manufactured , in payment for public taxes , and accusing those who , like oursclves , have advocated a fixed and settled measure of value , of being favorable to the interference of the Government with paper currency . We are wholly opposed to such interference . We think , however , that the *Theans of protection to the community through the judicial tribunals should be afforded against the excess of paper currency becoming an engine of fraud , like false weights and measures . An efficient bankrupt law for the manufacturers of paper currency would soon put a stop to the profligate expansions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community in unexpected embarrassment . Individuals , before entering into contracts , to be performed at future periods , might be able , were such a law in operation , to calculate with some precision the amount of property which would be required to fulfil them . For want of this regulation of the system , the power of individuals to meet their obligations wholly depends upon the erratic movements of the makers of paper currency . If it suits their purposes to make currency plentiful , property is sold at enormous nominal prices , and debts are paid at half their intrinsic values , compared with the value of property when they were contracted . But , on the other hand , should the paper coiners determine to create a panic , for the purpose of raising excitement against the Government , or for increasing their own profits , they have only to suddenly restrict their issues , require their customers to pay up their notes , and the whole community is at once convulsed with distress , from the sacrifices of property which become compulsory upon those who wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This mode of preventing these evils has the authority of the most distinguished financiers this country has ever produced in its favor . In view of the manifold evils in which the commerce and industry of the country were involved by the profligacy of banks , Mr. Dallas in 1815 , and Mr. Crawford in 1821 , while respectively at the head of the public finances , explicitly recommended to Congress to subject the banks to the penalties of an efficient bankrupt law , as the only adequate restraint upon issues of paper . which had at those pcriods involved the whole country in embarrassment . Neither of these distinguished statesmen was inimical to banks acting within their proper sphere . They regarded this mea*ure as essential to pro* tect the well managed banks from the profligacy of those conducted by gamblers and speculators . From the combinations clearly manifested in various quarters , at this time , the necessity for this check is daily becoming more urgent . // One of the greatest lights of the present age-who is generally *admitted both in Europe and in this country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America has ever produced*** .. within a few years past has published an essay upon the injurious effects , upon the welfare of society , of the universal rage for associations which has lately developed itself . He appears to regard the Temperance Societies , Anti-Slavery Societies , Missionary Societies , and all Vhat infinite catalogite of machinery put into operation for the ostensible purpose of improving the condition of mankind , as threatening greater danger to the freedom of our political institutions than standing armies . A system of self-government can only be maintained among a people accustomed to independence of thought and action , and deeply impressed with the responsibilities of in ( Iividual decision . Societies , whose ramifications extend from a great centre into every village , and which are wholly controlled by a fe*v individuals , become in effect but so many seminaries for systematically teaching multitudes to submit themselves to the implicit management of designing leaders . If such be the operation of societies formed for benevolent purposes , what must be the consequence of associations entered into for the express design of concentrating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently ardent in most men . They require no additional stimulus to increase their intensity . Their means of gratification may indeed be extended by machinery for obtaining the control over the opinions and conduct of those who are intended to be made victims . This effect has been *vitnessed on a vast organized scale in this country , within the last two or three years . We have seen the industrial and commercial interests excited to a degree little short of absolute delirium , and then paralyzed at once . We have also seen the individual at the head of the institution by the management of which these results of combined action were produced , publicly declare to an outraged community his determination to keep the productive interests in a state of depression until the people should be compelled by their sufferings to change their political agents . Whatever invidious appeals are made to the cupidity of unreflecting men , it is impossible that such management should be long sustained by the intellig'nt part of the community . Those who sup* pose that its aggravations in a tenfold ( legree-tilrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal substitution of a measure of value which costs nothing , and which by its abundance loses its quality of a measure-will be sanctioned , have greatly underrated the discernment as well as the sense of justice which prevails among our citizens . Luxury and corruption mny have debased some of them ; hut the great mass of the people are too Dr. Clianning. // well apprised of their true and permanent interests , and of the value of their hard-earned property to suffer them to be sported with by gamblers . The welfare of posterity is too dear to our citizens to suffer the overthrow of our political institutions and the moral fee1. * ings which are their main support , merely for the sake of aggran ' - dizing a fe*v speculators by the unlimited issue of paper-currency freed from all efficient obligations for its redemption . As the most appropriate *Tose to these suggestions , we propose to insert an elucidation which will satisfy every impartial mind how little of originality or ingenuity have been manifested in the management of the banks of this country . Much has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency . It will be seen that the author of the 5Y5TE*f from which the " credit system " derived its name , was as fully aware of these advantages as any of his present disciples . We take the ac ? count which forms the succeeding Article to the present paper , from a work of deservedly high European reputation which is but little known in this country , Storch 's " Exposition des principes qui d6terminent lit prospcrit* des nations , " which was prepared for the instruction of the present Emperor of Russia and his brothers . It is translated from the fourth volume of the Paris edition of 1823 , beginning at the 130th page.
