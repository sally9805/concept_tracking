Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : THE SHIPWRECKED SAILOR BOY RELATING HIS STORY . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1837 ) Child of the Ocean ! thou comest to tell Of the dangers that thee and thy bark befel : Of the wild tornado 's awful sweep , Whose rude voice wailed o'er the shadowy deep . Thou comest to speak of the turbulent wave  --  Of thy joyful escape from a yawning grave : Thy lip is parched , and thy cheek is pale  --  Sailor boy , sailor boy ! tell us thy tale ! " I come , with the sea-foam yet salt on my brow , From the desolate deck , and the broken prow : In my ear is the creak of the shivered mast , And the sail 's shrill quiver , when torn by the blast : The shrieks of the dying my heart impress , Sent up through the midnight loneliness :  --  I feel the rush of the mountain surge , Whence the hands of the sinking in vain emerge . " I come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , of despair , and pain ; I have seen true hearts in the wave go down , Richer than jewels of high renown ; Richer , in love , than the sea-washed gold , Where the coral shines over wealth untold : Where the pearl and the ruby unvalued lie , Shut , by the deep , from the glorious sky . " One evening , the sun , in the ominous West , Sank in blood-red clouds to his place of rest : His pavilion around him was crimson and black , Where the lightnings ran in their fiery track ; There were lurid shadows along the deep , Where the winds had folded their wings to sleep  --  And the calm which engenders the storm was there , Heavy and thick in the motionless air . " Then came the tempest !  --  and piping loud , The hurricane howled in the ragged shroud  --  The mast like a reed by its force was bent , As through gloom and darkness we onward went  --  The dash of the billows , the shrieks of fear , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they passed away , like a zephyr 's breath , To the still and remorseless caves of death . " Morn came at last  --  and ye see the wreck , In the hazy distance a desolate speck ; There the sign of distress has been hung and lost , And hands toward Heaven imploringly toss 'd ; And the God who heareth and answereth prayer , Hushed the angry waters that bounded there ; Yet destruction to all but me befel  --  I alone am left , the sad tale to tell ! " Philadelphia . Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : ELEGIAC STANZAS ON THE DEATH OF BISHOP WHITE . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1837 ) From the watch-tower of Zion a Soldier is gone , Whose shield in the sunbeams of righteousness shone ; Whose mild , warning voice among multitudes fell  --  Who loved of the glories of Heaven to tell . He has gone to enjoy them !  --  where age is unknown , Where Sin has no dwelling , and Pain has no throne ; Rewarded with recompense rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in a mansion of rest . He has fought the good fight  --  he has finished the faith  --  He has burst from the thraldom of sorrow and death ; From sickness , from weeping , from funeral hours , He hath soared to the region of sunshine and flowers ; And his eyes , unbeclouded , are gazing abroad On the river of life , and the city of God ; On scenes which no pencil or pen can portray  --  Where the splendours of Heaven unceasingly play . Shall we mourn for the Patriarch who feared not the tomb , That his spirit is blest with the absence of gloom ? That he totters no more on the verge of the grave  --  That he leans upon One who is mighty to save ? Whose smile cheered the pathway he tremblingly trod , To the beautiful gates of the palace of God , Whose arm was his stay , as triumphant he rose , To rejoice in the realms of eternal repose . Ah , no ! could we see the bright waters that shine , Neath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hear the sweet anthems that gladden the air , And tell that the Ransomed are glorified there , We should sorrow no more ; but for those that remain , Whose garments are washed in the blood of the slain , We should hail the loved promise of God , in his word  --  Thrice blest are the dying , who die in the Lord ! Philadelphia . Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : THE TRIBUNAL OF THE INQUISITION . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1837 ) Thou hast stern judges , maiden ! yet thine eye , In sweet solicitude , is heavenward cast , Whence help alone can come . So , to the hills , The everlasting hills , where Zion 's throne Arose in majesty , the Tried of old Sought for their sole deliverer . Thus do thou ! Thou , on whose anxious forehead lines of care Pass like the cloud-shade o'er a wreath of snow . Trust thou in God , distressed one ! and thy heart , Filled with a holy courage , shall be blest With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God ! and if thy soul hath felt His presence ever , and thy heart his love , Thou shalt be ransomed !  --  though unnumbered walls Of brass and adamant should hem thee round . The just by faith shall live . If thou art pure , Repose thy soul upon a Saviour 's word , Nor fear what man can do . So , when the hours Of thy dark thraldom end , a child of light , To bliss translated , thou mayst join the throng Of sainted spirits robed in shining white , Who walk in beauty with the sinless Lamb .
