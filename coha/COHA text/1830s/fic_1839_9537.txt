PREFACE . The following Drama was produced last year at the National Theatre , New York , by James H. Wallack  --  himself playing Tortesa . To his most admirable personation of this character , and the care and skill with which it was brought out under his management , the Author feels that he is indebted for its flattering and signal success in his own country . At the moment of publication , Mr. Wallack is about to appear in it at the Surrey Theatre ; and for its success , as far as the Actor can insure it , the Author has no fears . To the later tribunal , of the Reader 's judgment , he commits it tremblingly . London , 12th July , 1839 . TO Miss Mary Russell Mitford , WITH THE HIGHEST ADMIRATION FOR HER DRAMATIC GENIUS , THIS PLAY IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR . DRAMATIS PERSON . Duke of Florence . Count Falcone . Tortesa  --  an Usurer . Angelo  --  a young Painter . Tomaso  --  his Servant . Isabella de Falcone .

A drawing-room in Tortesa 's house . Enter Tortesa , followed by Count Falcone . TORTESA . TORTESA . Come in , Count . FALCONE . FALCONE . You 're well lodged . TORTESA . TORTESA . The Duke waits for you To get to horse . So , briefly , there 's the deed ! You have your lands back , and your daughter 's mine  --  So ran the bargain ! FALCONE , FALCONE , ( coldly . ) She 's betroth 'd , sir , to you ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Not a half hour since , and you hold the parchment ! A free transaction , see you !  --  for you 're paid , And I 'm but promised ! FALCONE , FALCONE , ( aside . ) ( What a slave is this , To give my daughter to ! My daughter ! Psha ! I 'll think but of my lands , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  TORTESA . TORTESA . Use no ceremony ! Yet stay ! A word ! Our nuptials follow quick On your return ? FALCONE . FALCONE . That hour , if it so please you ! TORTESA . TORTESA . And what 's the bargain if her humor change ? FALCONE . FALCONE . The lands are your 's again  --  ' t is understood so . TORTESA . TORTESA . Yet , still a word ! You leave her with her maids . I have a right in her by this betrothal . Seal your door up till you come back again ! I 'd have no foplings tampering with my wife ! None of your painted jackdaws from the court , Sneering and pitying her ! My lord Falcone ! Shall she be private ? FALCONE , FALCONE , ( aside . ) ( Patience ! for my lands ! ) You shall control my door , sir , and my daughter ! Farewell now ! Exit Falcone . TORTESA . TORTESA . Oh , omnipotence of money ! Ha ! ha ! Why , there 's the haughtiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have bearded  --  Checked  --  made conditions to  --  shut up his daughter  --  And all with money ! They should pull down churches And worship it ! Had I been poor , that man Would see me rot ere give his hand to me . I  --  as I stand here  --  dress 'd thus  --  looking thus  --  The same in all  --  save money in my purse  --  He would have scorn 'd to let me come so near That I could breathe on him ! Yet , that were little  --  For pride sometimes outdoes humility ; And your great man will please to be familiar , To show how he can stoop . But halt you there ! He has a jewel that you may not name ! His wife 's above you ! You 're no company For his most noble daughter ! You are brave  --  T is nothing ! comely  --  nothing ! honorable  --  You are a phoenix of all human virtues  --  But , while your blood 's mean , there 's a frozen bar Betwixt you and a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the grave  --  But like a mist , with money ! Enter a Servant . SERVANT . SERVANT . Please you , sir ! A tradesman waits to see you ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Let him in ! Exit Servant . What need have I of forty generations To build my name up ? I have bought with money The fairest daughter of their haughtiest line ! Bought her ! Falcone 's daughter for so much ! No wooing i n't ! Ha ! ha ! I harp 'd on that Till my lord winced ! " My bargain ! " still " my bargain ! " Nought of my bride ! Ha ! ha ! ' T was excellent ! Enter Tradesman . What 's thy demand ? TRADESMAN . TRADESMAN . Ten ducats , please your lordship ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Out on " your lordship ! " There are twelve for ten ? Does a lord pay like that ? Learn some name sweeter To my ears than " Your lordship ! " I 'm no lord ! Give me thy quittance ! Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glover 's daughter , please you , sir ! Enter Zippa . TORTESA . TORTESA . Come in , My pretty neighbor ! What ! my bridal gloves ! Are they brought home ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . The signor pays so well , He 's well served . TORTESA . TORTESA . Um ! why , pertinently answered ! And yet , my pretty one , the words were sweeter In any mouth than yours ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . That 's easy true ! TORTESA . TORTESA . I would ' t were liking that had spurr 'd your service  --  Not money , Zippa , sweet ! ( She presents her parcel to him , with a meaning air . ) ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Your bridal gloves , sir ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( aside . ) ( What a fair shrew it is ! ) My gloves are paid for ! And will be thrown aside when worn a little . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . What then , sir ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Why , the bride is paid for , too ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZIPPA . ZIPPA . You mock me now ! TORTESA . TORTESA . You know Falcone 's palace , And lands , here , by Fiesol ? I bought them For so much money of his creditors , And gave them to him , in a plain , round bargain , For his proud daughter ! What think you of that ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . What else but that you loved her ! TORTESA . TORTESA . As I love The thing I give my money for  --  no more ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . You mean to love her ? TORTESA . TORTESA . ' T was not in the bargain ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Why , what a monster do you make yourself ! Have you no heart ? TORTESA . TORTESA . A loving one , for you ! Nay , never frown ! I marry this lord 's daughter To please a devil that inhabits me ! But there 's an angel in me  --  not so strong  --  And this last loves you ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Thanks for your weak ' angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil ' ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Both were yours ! But for the burning fever that I have To pluck at their proud blood . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Why , this poor lady Can not have harm 'd you ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Forty thousand times ! She 's noble-born  --  there 's one wrong in her cradle ! She 's proud  --  why , that makes every pulse an insult  --  Sixty a minute ! She 's profuse in smiles On those who are , to me , as stars to glow-worms  --  So I 'm disparaged ! I have pass 'd her by , Summer and winter , and she ne'er looked on me ! Her youth has been one tissue of contempt ! Her lovers , and her tutors , and her heart , Taught her to scorn the low-born  --  that am I ! Would you have more ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Why , this is moon-struck madness . TORTESA . TORTESA . I 'd have her mine , for all this  --  jewell 'd , perfumed  --  Just as they 've worshipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breath up in their silken beds  --  Blanch 'd her with baths  --  fed her on delicate food  --  Guarded the unsunn 'd dew upon her skin  --  For some lord 's pleasure ! If I could not get her ; There 's a contempt in that , would make my forehead Hot in my grave ! ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( aside . ) ( Now Heaven forbid my fingers Should make your bridal gloves ! ) Forgive me , Signor ! I 'll take these back , so please you ! ( Takes up the parcel again . ) TORTESA , TORTESA , ( not listening to her . ) But for this  --  This devil at my heart , thou should'st have wedded The richest commoner in Florence , Zippa ! Tell me thou wouldst ! ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( aside . ) ( Stay ! stay ! A thought ! If I Could feign to love him , and so work on him To put this match off , and at last to break it  --  ' T is possible  --  and so befriend this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Nay , I will ! ) Signor Tortesa ! TORTESA . TORTESA . You 've been dreaming now , How you would brave it it in your lady-gear ; Was't not so ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . No ! TORTESA . TORTESA . What then ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . I had a thought , If I dare speak it . TORTESA . TORTESA . Nay , nay , speak it out ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . I had forgot your riches , and I thought How lost you were ! TORTESA . TORTESA . How lost ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Your qualities , Which far outweigh your treasure , thrown away On one who does not love you ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Thrown away ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Is it not so to have a gallant shape , And no eye to be proud o n't  --  to be full Of all that makes men dangerous to women , And marry where you 're scorned ? TORTESA . TORTESA . There 's reason there ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . You 're wise in meaner riches ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  lands , palaces , They bring in rent . The gifts of nature only , Worth to you , Signor , more than all your gold , Lie profitless and idle . Your fine stature  --  TORTESA . TORTESA . Why  --  so , so ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Speaking eyes  --  TORTESA . TORTESA . Ay  --  passable . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Your voice , uncommon musical  --  TORTESA . TORTESA . Nay , there , I think you may be honest ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . And your look , In all points lofty , like a gentleman ! ( Aside ) ( That last must choke him ! ) TORTESA . TORTESA . Youv'e a judgment , Zippa , That makes me wonder at you ! We are both Above our breeding  --  I have often thought so  --  And lov 'd you  --  but to-day so more than ever , That my revenge must have drunk up my life , To still sweep over it . But when I think Upon that proud lord and his scornful daughter  --  I say not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory with me ! I must go And visit her ! I 'll see you to the door  --  Come , Zippa , come ! ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( aside . ) ( I , too , will visit her ! You 're a brave Signor , but against two women You 'll find your wits all wanted ! ) TORTESA . TORTESA . Come away ! I must look on my bargain ! my good bargain ! Ha ! ha ! my bargain ! Exeunt . SCENE II . The Painter 's Studio . Angelo painting . Tomaso in the fore-ground , arranging a meagre repast . TOMASO .

Look on this touch , good Tomaso , if it be not life itself  --  ( Draws him before his easel . ) Now , what think'st thou ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Um  --  fair ! fair enough ! ANGELO . ANGELO . No more ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Fill me up that outline , Master Angelo ! ( Takes up the naked bone . ) Color me that water ; To what end dost thou dabble there ? ANGELO . ANGELO . I am weary of telling thee to what end . Have patience , Tomaso ! TOMASO , TOMASO , ( coaxingly . ) Would'st thou but paint the goldsmith a sign , now , in good fair letters ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Have I no genius for the art think'st thou ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Thou ! ha ! ha ! ANGELO . ANGELO . By thy laughing , thou would'st say no ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Thou a genius ! Look ! Master Angelo ! Have I not seen thee every day since thou wert no bigger than thy pencil ? ANGELO . ANGELO . And if thou hast ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Do I not know thee from crown to heel ? Dost thou not come in at that door as I do ?  --  sit down in that chair as I do ?  --  eat , drink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Tomaso , and I thee Angelo ? ANGELO . ANGELO . Well ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Then how canst thou have genius ? Are there no marks ! Would I clap thee on the back , and say good morrow ? Nay , look thee ! would I stand here telling thee in my wisdom what thou art , if thou wert a genius ? Go to , Master Angelo ! I love thee well , but thou art comprehensible ! ANGELO . ANGELO . But think'st thou never of my works , Tomaso ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Thy works ! Do I not grind thy paints ? Do I not see thee take up thy pallette , place thy foot thus , and dab here , dab there ? I tell thee thou hast never done stroke yet , I could not take the same brush and do after thee . Thy works , truly ! ANGELO . ANGELO . How think'st thou would Donatello paint , if he were here ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Donatello ? I will endeavour to show thee ! ( Takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture should be there ! His pencil  --  ( throws down Angelo 's pencil and seizes a broom ) , his pencil should be as long as this broom ! He should raise it thus  --  with his eyes rolling thus  --  and with his body thrown back thus ! ANGELO . ANGELO . What then ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Then he should see something in the air  --  a sort of a hm  --  ha  --  r  --  r  --  rrrr  --  ( you understand . ) And he first strides off here and looks at it  --  then he strides off there and looks at it  --  then he looks at his long brush  --  then he makes a dab ! dash ! flash ! ( Makes three strokes across Angelo 's picture . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . Villain , my picture ! Tomaso ! ( Seizes his sword . ) With thy accursed broom thou hast spoiled a picture Donatello could ne'er have painted ! Say thy prayers , for , by the Virgin !  --  TOMASO . TOMASO.  --  Murder ! murder ! help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Wilt say thy prayers , or die a sinner ? Quick ! or thou'rt dead ere ' t is thought on ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Help ! help ! mercy ! oh mercy ! Enter the Duke hastily , followed by Falcone and attendants . DUKE . DUKE . Who calls so loudly ? What ! drawn swords at mid-day ! Disarm him ! Now , what mad-cap youth art thou ? ( To Angelo , ) To fright this peaceful artist from his toil ? Rise up , sir ! ( To Tomaso . ) ANGELO , ANGELO , ( aside . ) ( Could my luckless star have brought The Duke here at no other time ! ) DUKE , DUKE , ( looking round on the pictures . ) Why , here 's Matter worth stumbling on ! By Jove , a picture Of admirable work ! Look here , Falcone ! Dids't think there was a hand unknown in Florence Could lay on color with a skill like this ? TOMASO , TOMASO , ( aside to Angelo . ) Did'st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures in dumb show . ) ANGELO , ANGELO , ( aside to Tomaso . ) ( The pallette 's on thy thumb  --  Swear ' t is thy work ! ) TOMASO . TOMASO . Mine , master ? ANGELO . ANGELO . Seest thou not The shadow of my fault will fall upon it While I stand here a culprit ? The Duke loves thee As one whom he has chanc 'd to serve at need , And kindness mends the light upon a picture , I know that well ! FALCONE , FALCONE , ( to Tomaso . ) The Duke would know your name , Sir ! TOMASO , TOMASO , ( as Angelo pulls him by the sleeve . ) Tom  --  Angelo , my lord ! DUKE , DUKE , ( to Falcone . ) We 've fallen here Upon a treasure ! FALCONE . FALCONE . ' T was a lucky chance That led you in , my lord ! DUKE . DUKE . I blush to think That I might ne'er have found such excellence But for a chance cry , thus ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believe me . FALCONE . FALCONE . ' T is a duty Your Grace is never slow to . DUKE . DUKE . I 've a thought  --  If you 'll consent to it ? FALCONE . FALCONE . Before ' t is spoken , My gracious liege ! DUKE . DUKE . You know how well my Duchess Loves your fair daughter . Not as maid of honor Lost to our service , but as parting child , We grieve to lose her . FALCONE . FALCONE . My good lord ! DUKE . DUKE . Nay , nay  --  She is betroth 'd now , and you needs must wed her ! My thought was , to surprise my grieving duchess With a resemblance of your daughter , done By this rare hand , here . ' T is a thought well found , You 'll say it is ? FALCONE , FALCONE , ( hesitating . ) Your Grace is bound away On a brief journey . Wer't not best put off Till our return ? DUKE , DUKE , ( laughing . ) I see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till she bloom Fairly in wedlock . But this painter , see you , Is an old man , of a poor , timid bearing , And may be trusted to look close upon her . Come , come ! I 'll have my way ! Good Angelo , ( To Tomaso . ) A pen and ink ! And you , my lord Falcone ! Write a brief missive to your gentle daughter T ' admit him privately . FALCONE . FALCONE . I will , Duke . Writes . ANGELO , ANGELO , ( aside . ) ( Now Shall I go back or forwards ? If he writes Admit this Angelo , why , I am he , And that rare phoenix , hidden from the world , Sits to my burning pencil . She 's a beauty Without a parallel , they say , in Florence . Her picture 'll be remembered ! Let the Duke Rend me with horses , it shall ne'er be said I dared not pluck at Fortune ! ) TOMASO , TOMASO , ( aside to Angelo . ) Signor ! ANGELO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll kill thee ! ) DUKE . DUKE . Angelo ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( aside to Tomaso . ) Speak , or thou diest ! TOMASO , TOMASO , ( to the Duke . ) My lord ! DUKE . DUKE . Thou hast grown old In the attainment of an excellence Well worth thy time and study . The clear touch , Won only by the patient toil of years , Is on your fair works yonder . TOMASO , TOMASO , ( astonished . ) Those , my lord ! DUKE . DUKE . I shame I never saw them until now , But here 's a new beginning . Take this missive From Count Falcone to his peerless daughter . I 'd have a picture of her for my palace . Paint me her beauty as I know you can , And as you do it well , my favour to you Shall make up for the past . TOMASO , TOMASO , ( as Angelo pulls his sleeve . ) Your Grace is kind ! DUKE . DUKE . For this rude youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) His sword was drawn upon an unarm 'd man . He shall be fined , or , as you please , imprisoned . Speak ! TOMASO . TOMASO . If your Grace would bid him pay  --  DUKE . DUKE . What sum ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Some twenty flasks of wine , my gracious liege , If it so please you . ' T is a thriftless servant I keep for love I bore to his dead father . But all his faults are nothing to a thirst That sucks my cellar dry ! DUKE . DUKE . He 's well let off ! Write out a bond to pay of your first gains The twenty flasks ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Most willingly , my liege . Writes . DUKE , DUKE , ( to Tomaso . ) Are you content ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Your Grace , I am ! DUKE . DUKE . Come then ! Once more to horse ! Nay , nay , man , look not black ! Unless your daughter were a wine flask , trust me There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , And you shall rule me . ' T is the roughest shell Hides the good pearl . Adieu , Sir ! ( to Tomaso . ) Exeunt Duke and Falcone . ( Angelo seizes the missive from Tomaso , and strides up and down the stage , reading it exultingly . After looking at him a moment , Tomaso does the same with the bond for the twenty flasks . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . Give the letter ! Oh , here is golden opportunity  --  The ladder at my foot , the prize above , And angels beckoning upwards . I will paint A picture now , that in the eyes of men Shall live like loving daylight . They shall cease To praise it for the constant glory of it . There 's not a stone built in the palace wall But shall let thro ' the light of it , and Florence Shall be a place of pilgrimage for ever To see the work of low-born Angelo . Oh that the world were made without a night , That I could toil while in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll out , and muse how I shall paint this beauty , So , wile the night away . Exit . TOMASO , TOMASO , ( coming forward with his bond . ) Prejudice aside , that is a pleasant-looking piece of paper ! ( Holds it off , and regards it with a pleased air . ) Your bond to pay , now , is an ill-visaged rascal  --  you would know him across a church  --  nay  --  with the wind fair , smell him a good league ! But this has , in some sort , a smile . It is not like other paper . It reads mellifluously . Your name is in the right end of it for music . Let me dwell upon it ! ( Unfolds it , and reads ) " I , Tomaso , promise to pay "  --  stay ! " I , Tomaso  --  I Tomaso promise to pay to Angelo my master twenty flasks of wine ! " ( Rubs his eyes , and turns the note over and over . ) There 's a damnable twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , that 's I. And " I promise to pay "  --  Now , I promise no such thing ! ( Turns it upside down , and , after trying in vain to alter the reading , tears it in two . ) There are some men that can not write ten words in their own language without a blunder . Out , filthy scraps . If the Glover 's daughter have not compassion upon me , I die of thirst ! I 'll seek her out ! A pest on ignorance ! ( Pulls his hat sulkily over his eyes , and walks off . ) SCENE III . An Apartment in the Falcone Palace . Angelo discovered listening . ANGELO . ANGELO . Did I hear footsteps ? ( He listens . ) Fancy plays me tricks In my impatience for this lovely wonder ! That window 's to the north ! The light falls cool . I 'll set my easel here , and sketch her  --  Stay ! How shall I do that ? Is she proud or sweet ? Will she sit silent , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a stranger Pry through her beauty for the soul that 's in it ? Nay , then I heard a footstep  --  she is here ! ( Enter Isabella , reading her father 's missive . ) ISABELLA . ISABELLA . " The duke would have your picture for the duchess Done by this rude man , Angelo ! Receive him With modest privacy , and let your kindness Be measured by his merit , not his garb . " ANGELO . ANGELO . Fair lady ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Who speaks ? ANGELO . ANGELO . Angelo ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . You 've come , sir , To paint a dull face , trust me ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( aside . ) ( Beautiful , Beyond all dreaming ! ) ISABELLA . ISABELLA . I 've no smiles to show you , Not ev'n a mock one ! Shall I sit ? ANGELO . ANGELO . No , lady ! I 'll steal your beauty while you move , as well ! So you but breathe , the air still brings to me That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking apart . ) His voice Is not a rude one . What a fate is mine , When ev'n the chance words on a poor youth 's tongue , Contrasted with the voice which I should love , Seems rich and musical ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( to himself , as he draws . ) How like a swan , Drooping his small head to a lily-cup , She curves that neck of pliant ivory ! I 'll paint her thus ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( aside . ) Forgetful where he is , He thinks aloud . This is , perhaps , the rudeness My father fear 'd might anger me . ANGELO . ANGELO . What color Can match the clear red of those glorious lips ? Say it were possible to trace the arches , Shaped like the drawn bow of the god of love  --  How tint them , after ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Still , he thinks not of me , But murmurs to his picture . ' T were sweet praise , Were it a lover whispering it . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANGELO . They say , a cloudy veil Hangs ever at the crystal-gate of heaven , To bar the issue of its blinding glory . So droop those silken lashes to an eye Mortal could never paint ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . There 's flattery , Would draw down angels ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Now , what alchymy Can mock the rose and lily of her cheek ! I must look closer o n't ! ( Advancing . ) Fair lady , please you , I 'll venture to your side . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Sir ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( examining her cheek ) . There 's a mixture Of white and red here , that defeats my skill . If you 'll forgive me , I 'll observe an instant , How the bright blood and the transparent pearl Melt to each other ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( receding from him . ) You 're too free , Sir ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( with surprise . ) Madam ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( aside . ) And yet , I think not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it well . ANGELO . ANGELO . Lady ! the daylight 's precious ! Pray you , turn to me ! In my study , here , I 've tried to fancy how that ivory shoulder Leads the white light off from your arching neck , But can not , for the envious sleeve that hides it . Please you , displace it ! ( Raises his hand to the sleeve . ) ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Sir , you are too bold ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Pardon me , lady ! Nature 's masterpiece Should be beyond your hiding , or my praise ! Were you less marvellous , I were too bold ; But there 's a pure divinity in beauty , Which the true eye of art looks on with reverence , Though , like angels , it were all unclad ! You have no right to hide it ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . How ? No right ? ANGELO . ANGELO . ' T is the religion of our art , fair madam ! That , by oft looking on the type divine In which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born to ! You 've an errand here , To show how look the angels . But , as Vestals Cherish the sacred fire , yet let the priest Light his lamp at it for a thousand altars , So is your beauty unassoiled , though I Ravish a copy for the shut-out world ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( aside . ) Here is the wooing that should win a maid ! Bold , yet respectful  --  free yet full of honor ! I never saw a youth with gentler eyes ; I never heard a voice that pleas 'd me more ; Let me look on him ! ( Enter Tortesa , unperceived . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . In a form like yours , All parts are perfect , madam ! yet , unseen , Impossible to fancy . With your leave I 'll see your hand unglov 'd . ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( removing her glove ) I have no heart To keep it from you , signor ! There it is ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( taking it in his own . ) Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect ! Let me look Close on the tracery of these azure veins ! With what a delicate and fragile thread They weave their subtle mesh beneath the skin , And meet , all blushing , in these rosy nails ! How soft the texture of these tapering fingers ! How exquisite the wrist ! How perfect all ! ( Tortesa rushes forward . ) TORTESA . TORTESA . Now have I heard enough ! Why , what are you , To palm the hand of my betrothed bride With this licentious freedom ? ( Angelo turns composedly to his work . ) And you , madam ! With a first troth scarce cold upon your lips  --  Is this your chastity ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . My father 's roof Is over me ! I 'm not your wife ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Bought ! paid for ! The wedding toward  --  have I no right in you ? Your father , at my wish , bade you be private ; Is this obedience ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Count Falcone 's will , Has , to his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and now , when chance Frowns on his broken fortunes , I were dead To love and pity , were not soul and body Spent for his smallest need ! I did consent To wed his ruthless creditor for this ! I would have sprung into the sea , the grave , As questionless and soon ! My troth is yours ! But I 'm not wedded yet , and till I am , The hallow 'd honour that protects a maid Is round me , like a circle of bright fire ! A savage would not cross it  --  nor shall you ! I 'm mistress of my presence . Leave me , sir ! TORTESA . TORTESA . There 's a possession of some lordly acres Sold to Falcone for that lily hand ! The deed 's delivered , and the hand ' s my own ! I 'll see that no man looks o n't . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Shall a lady Bid you begone twice ? TORTESA . TORTESA . Twenty times , if't please you ! ( She looks at Angelo , who continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wear a sword ? Is he a coward , That he can hear this man heap insult on me , And ne'er fall on him ? TORTESA . TORTESA . Lady ! to your chamber ! I have a touch to give this picture , here , But want no model for't . Come , come . ( Offers to take her by the arm . ) ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Stand back ! Now , will he see this wretch lay hands on me , And never speak ? He can not be a coward ! No , no , some other reason  --  not a coward ! I could not love a coward ! TORTESA . TORTESA . If you will Stay where you 're better miss 'd  --  ' t is at your pleasure ; I 'll hew your kisses from the saucy lips Of this bold painter  --  look o n't , if you will ! And first , to mar his picture ! ( He strikes at the canvass , when Angelo suddenly draws , attacks and disarms him . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog ! What wouldst thou with my picture ? Speak !  --  But thy life would not bring back a ray Of precious daylight , and I can not waste it ! Begone ! begone ! ( Throws Tortesa 's sword from the window , and returns to his picture . ) I 'll back to paradise ! ' T was this touch that he marr 'd ! So ! fair again ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( going out . ) I 'll find you , sir , when I 'm in cooler blood ! And , madam , you ! or Count Falcone for you , Shall rue this scorn ! Exit . ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( looking at Angelo . ) Lost in his work once more ! I shall be jealous of my very picture ! Yet one who can forget his passions so  --  Peril his life , and , losing scarce a breath , Turn to his high , ambitious toil again  --  Must have a heart for whose belated waking Queens might keep vigil ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Twilight falls , fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downy wing Of its most loving angel guard your beauty ! Good night ! ( Goes out with a low reverence . ) ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Good night ! ( She looks after him a moment , and then walks thoughtfully off the stage . ) END OF THE FIRST ACT . ACT THE SECOND . SCENE I. Tomaso discovered sitting at his supper , with a bottle of water before him . TOMASO . TOMASO . Water ! ( Sips a little with a grimace . ) I think , since the world was drowned in it , it has tasted of sinners . The pious throat refuses it . Other habits grow pleasant with use  --  but the drinking of water lessens the liking of it . Now , why should not some rivers run wine ? There are varieties in the eatables  --  will any wise man tell me why there should be but one drinkable in nature  --  and that water ? My mind 's made up  --  it 's the curse of transgression . ( A rap at the door . ) Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Good even , Tomaso ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Zippa , I had a presentiment.  --  ZIPPA . ZIPPA . What ! of my coming ? TOMASO . TOMASO . No  --  of thy bottle ! Look ! I was stinting myself in water to leave room ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . The reason is superfluous . There would be room in thee for wine , if thou wert drowned in the sea . TOMASO . TOMASO . God forbid ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . What  --  that thou should'st be drowned ? TOMASO . TOMASO . No  --  but that being drowned , I should have room for wine . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Why , now ?  --  why ? TOMASO . TOMASO . If I had room for wine , I should want it  --  and to want wine in the bottom of the sea , were a plague unspeakable . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Where 's Angelo ? TOMASO . TOMASO . What 's in thy bottle ? Show ! Show ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Tell me where he is  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what said  --  how he has looked , and if he still loves me ; and when thou art thirsty with truth-telling  --  ( dry work for such a liar as thou art , )  --  thou shalt learn what is in my bottle !

TOMASO . TOMASO . Then he lost Paradise by too much learning . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Ha ! ha ! Hadst thou been consulted , we should still be there ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Snug ! I would have had my inheritance in a small vineyard ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Tell me what I ask of thee . TOMASO . TOMASO .

TOMASO . TOMASO . What wilt thou wager it 's a lie , that Angelo is painting a court lady for the Duchess ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Oh Lord ! Take the bottle ! They say there 's truth in wine  --  but as truth is impossible to thee , drink thyself at least , down to probabilities ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Look you there ! When was virtue encouraged ?

TOMASO . TOMASO . Very ! ( Seizes the children , as Angelo claps him on the shoulder . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . Will thy tricks never end ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Ehem ! ehem ! ( Thrusts the chicken into his pocket . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . How art thou , Zippa ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Well , dear Angelo ! ( Giving him her hand . ) And thou wert not ill , indeed ? ANGELO . ANGELO . Never better by the test of a true hand ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Is it true it 's a fair lady ? ANGELO . ANGELO . A lady with a face so angelical , Zippa , that  --  ZIPPA .

Pardon me , lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To find my face a wonder . Speak ! Who are you ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Zippa , the Glover 's daughter , and your friend ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . My friend ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . I said so . You 're a noble lady And I a low-born maid  --  yet I have come To offer you my friendship . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . This seems strange ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . I 'll make it less so , if you 'll give me leave . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . You 'll please me ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Briefly  --  for the time is precious To me as well as you  --  I have a lover , A true one , as I think , who yet finds boldness To seek your hand in marriage . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . How ? We 're rivals ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Tortesa loves me , and for that I 'd wed him . Yet I 'm not sure I love him more than you  --  And you must hate him . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . To mar your match with him , and so make mine ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Why , free again ! Yet , as you love him not ' T is strange you seek to wed him ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Oh no , madam ! Woman loves once unthinkingly . The heart Is born with her first love , and , new to joy , Breathes to the first wind its delicious sweetness , But gets none back ! So comes its bitter wisdom ! When next we think of love , ' t is who loves us ! I said Tortesa loved me ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . You shall have him With all my heart ! See  --  I 'm your friend already ! And friends are equals . So approach , and tell me , What was this first love like , that you discourse So prettily upon ? ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( aside . ) ( Dear Angelo ! ' Twill be a happiness to talk of him ! ) I loved a youth , kind madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . A handsome youth ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Indeed , I thought him so ! But you would not . I loved him out of pity ; No one cared for him . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Was he so forlorn ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . He was our neighbor , and I knew his toil Was almost profitless ; and ' t was a pleasure To fill my basket from our wasteful table , And steal , at eve , to sup with him . ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( smiling . ) Why , that Was charity , indeed ! He loved you for it  --  Was't not so ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . He was like a brother to me  --  The kindest brother sister ever had . I built my hopes upon his gentleness : He had no other quality to love . Th'ambitious change  --  so do the fiery-hearted : The lowly are more constant . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . And yet , he Was , after all , a false one ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T would end in anger , Perhaps in tears . If I am not too bold , Tell me , in turn , of all your worshippers  --  Was there ne'er one that pleased you ? ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( aside . ) ( Now could I Prate to this humble maid of Angelo , Till matins rang again ! ) My gentle Zippa ! I have found all men prompt to talk of love , Save only one . I will confess to you , For that one could I die ! Yet , so unlike Your faithless lover must I draw his picture , That you will wonder how such opposites Could both be loved of women . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Was he fair , Or brown ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . In truth , I marked not his complexion . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Tall ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . That I know not . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Well  --  robust , or slight ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . I can not tell , indeed ! I heard him speak  --  Looked in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him now , in fancy , standing there  --  Yet know not limb or feature ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . You but saw A shadow , lady ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Nay  --  I saw a soul ! His eyes were light with it . The forehead lay Above their fires in calm tranquillity , As the sky sleeps o'er thunder-clouds . His look Was mixed of these  --  earnest , and yet subdued  --  Gentle , yet passionate  --  sometimes half god-like In its command , then mild and sweet again , Like a stern angel taught humility ! Oh ! when he spoke , my heart stole out to him ! There was a spirit-echo in his voice  --  A sound of thought  --  of under-playing music  --  As if , before it ceased in human ears , The echo was caught up in fairy-land ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Was he a courtier , madam ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . He 's as lowly In birth and fortunes , as your false one , Zippa ! Yet rich in genius , and of that ambition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen such a man ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Alas ! sweet lady ! My life is humble , and such wondrous men Are far above my knowing . I could wish To see one ere I died ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . You shall , believe me ! But while we talk of lovers , we forget In how brief time you are to win a husband . Come to my chamber , Zippa , and I 'll see How with your little net you 'll snare a bird Fierce as this rude Tortesa ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . We will find A way , dear lady , if we die for it ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Shall we ? Come with me , then ! Exeunt . SCENE III . An Apartment in the Falcone Palace . Tortesa alone waiting the return of the Count .

END OF THE SECOND ACT . ACT THE THIRD . SCENE I. Angelo discovered in his studio , painting upon the picture of Isabella . ANGELO . ANGELO . My soul is drunk with gazing on this face . I reel and faint with it . In what sweet world Have I traced all its lineaments before ? I know them . Like a troop of long-lost friends , My pencil wakes them with its eager touch , And they spring up , rejoicing . Oh , I 'll gem The heaven of Fame with my irradiate pictures , Like kindling planets  --  but this glorious one Shall be their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending of its fire to all . The day fades  --  but the lamp burns on within me . My bosom has no dark , no sleep , no change To dream or calm oblivion . I work on When my hand stops . The light tints fade . Good night , Fair image of the fairest thing on earth , Bright Isabella ! ( Leans on the rod with which he guides his hand , and remains looking at his picture . ) Enter Tomaso , with two bags of money . TOMASO . TOMASO . For the most excellent painter , Angelo , two hundred ducats ! The genius of my master flashes upon me . The Duke 's greeting and two hundred ducats ! If I should not have died in my blindness but for this eye-water , may I be hanged . ( Looks at Angelo . ) He is studying his picture . What an air there is about him  --  lofty , unlike the vulgar ! Two hundred ducats ! ( Observes Angelo 's hat on the table . ) It strikes me now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like a common hat . Not like a bought hat . The rim turns to the crown with an intelligence . ( Weighs the ducats in his hand . ) Good heavy ducats . What it is to refresh the vision ! I have looked round , ere now , in this very chamber , and fancied that the furniture expressed a melancholy dulness . When he hath talked to me of his pictures , I have seen the chairs smile . Nay , as if shamed to listen , the very table has looked foolish . Now , all about me expresseth a choice peculiarity  --  as you would say , how like a genius to have such chairs ! What a painter-like table ! Two hundred ducats ! ANGELO . ANGELO . What hast thou for supper ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Two hundred ducats , my great master ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( absently . ) A cup of wine ! Wine , Tomaso ! Sits down . TOMASO . TOMASO . ( So would the great Donatello have sat upon his chair !

TOMASO . I saw the duke in the market-place , who called me Angelo , ( we shall rue that trick yet , ) and with a gracious smile asked me if thou hadst paid the twenty flasks . ANGELO , ANGELO , ( not listening . ) Is there no wine ? TOMASO . TOMASO . I said to his grace , no ! Pray mark the sequel : In pity of my thirst , the duke sends me two  --  ahem !  --  one hundred ducats . Here they are ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Didst thou say the wine was on the lees ? TOMASO . TOMASO . With these fifty ducats we shall buy nothing but wine ( He will be rich with fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOMASO . TOMASO . I spoke of twenty ducats sent thee by the duke . Wilt thou finger them ere one is spent ? ANGELO . ANGELO . I asked thee for wine  --  I am parched . TOMASO . TOMASO . Of these ten ducats , think'st thou we might spend one for a flask of better quality ? ANGELO . ANGELO . Lend me a ducat , if thou hast one , and buy wine presently . Go ! TOMASO . TOMASO . I 'll lend it thee , willingly , my illustrious master . It is my last , but as much thine as mine . ANGELO . ANGELO . Go ! Go ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Yet wait ! There 's a scrap of news ? Falcone 's daughter marries Tortesa , the usurer ? To morrow is the bridal . ANGELO . ANGELO . How ? TOMASO . TOMASO . I learned it in the market-place ! There will be rare doings ! ANGELO . ANGELO .

ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Your soul 's low-born ! Forget your anger and come near me , Zippa , For ere I 'm done you 'll wonder !

Have you walk 'd with him When he has turn 'd his head , as if to list To music in the air  --  but you heard none  --  And presently a smile stole through his lips , And some low words , inaudible to you , Fell from him brokenly . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Ay  --  many times ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Tell me once more !

Farther to flee to than the stars in heaven , Which Angelo can walk as we do this  --  And does  --  while you look on him ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Angelo ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . He 's never at your side one constant minute Without a thousand messengers from thence ! ( O block ! to live with him , and never dream o n't ! ) He plucks the sun 's rays open like a thread , And knows what stains the rose and not the lily  --  He never sees a flower but he can tell Its errand on the earth  --  ( they all have errands  --  You knew not that , oh dulness ! ) He sees shapes Flush 'd with immortal beauty in the clouds  --  ( You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wonder 'd ! ) Yet you talk of love !

You may talk of him till my brain is giddy  --  But oh , you can not praise him out of reach Of my true heart .  --  He 's here , as low as I !  --  Shall he not wed a woman , flesh and blood ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . See here ! There was a small , earth-creeping mole , Born by the low nest of an unfledged lark . They lived an April youth amid the grass  --  The soft mole happy , and the lark no less , And thought the bent sky leaned upon the flowers . By early May the fledgling got his wings ; And , eager for the light , one breezy dawn , Sprang from his nest , and , buoyantly , away Fled forth to meet the morning . Newly born Seem 'd the young lark , as in another world Of light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd and dropp 'd , and sang unto the sun , And pitied every thing that had not wings  --  But most the mole , that wanted even eyes To see the light he floated in ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Yet still She watch 'd his nest , and fed him when he came  --  Would it were Angelo and I indeed ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Nay , mark ! The bird grew lonely in the sky . There was no echo at the height he flew ! And when the mist lay heavy on his wings His song broke , and his flights were brief and low  --  And the dull mole , that should have sorrowed with him , Joy 'd that he sang at last where she could hear ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Why , happy mole again ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Not long !  --  for soon He found a mate that loved him for his wings ? One who with feebler flight , but eyes still on him , Caught up his dropp 'd song in the middle air , And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( aside . ) ( I see ! I see ! His soul was never mine ! I was the blind mole of her hateful story ! No , no ! he never loved me ! True , we ate , And laugh 'd , and danced together  --  but no love  --  He never told his thought when he was sad ! His folly and his idleness were mine  --  No more ! The rest was lock 'd up in his soul ! I feel my heart grow black ! ) Fair madam , thank you ! You 've told me news ! ( She shall not have him neither , If there 's a plot in hate to keep him from her ! I must have room to think , and air to breathe  --  I choke here ! ) Madam , the blind mole takes leave !

Pardon me , Signor , but  --  TORTESA . TORTESA . Who sent you hither ! SECRETARY . SECRETARY . My lord the Count . TORTESA , TORTESA , ( turning quickly aside . ) He put it in the bond , That if by any humour of my own , Or accident that sprang not from himself , Or from his daughter 's will , the match were marr 'd , His tenure stood intact .

To keep you here till you have got your story Pat to the tongue  --  the truth o n't , and no more ! LADY . LADY . Have you a doubt the bride is dead , good Signor ? TORTESA . TORTESA . A palace , see you , has a tricky air ! When I am told a tradesman 's daughter 's dead , I know the coffin holds an honest corse , Sped , in sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets to-day , And heard that an ambitious usurer , With lands and money having bought a lady High-born and fair , she died before the bridal , I would lay odds with him that told me of it She 'd rise again  --  before the resurrection . So stand back all ! If I 'm to fill to-day The pricking ears of Florence with a lie , The bridal guests shall tell the tale so truly , And mournfully , from eyesight of the corse , That ev'n the shrewdest listener shall believe , And I myself have no misgiving of it . Look ! where they come ! ( Door opens to funereal music , and the body of Isabella is borne in , preceded by a Monk , and followed by Falcone and mourners . Tortesa confronts the Monk . ) What 's this you bear away ? MONK . MONK . Follow the funeral , but stay it not . TORTESA . TORTESA . If thereon lie the lady Isabella , I ask to see her face before she pass ! MONK . MONK . Stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ! TORTESA . TORTESA . What right have you to take me for a stone ? See what you do ! I stand a bridegroom here . A moment since the joyous music playing Which promised me a fair and blushing bride . The flowers are fragrant , and the guests made welcome ; And while my heart beats at the opening door , And eagerly I look to see her come ,  --  There enters in her stead a covered corse ! And when I ask to look upon her face  --  One look , before my bride is gone for ever ,  --  You find it in your hearts to say me nay !  --  Shame ! Shame ! FALCONE , FALCONE , ( fiercely . ) Lead on ! TORTESA . TORTESA . My lord , by covenant  --  By contract writ and seal 'd  --  by value rendered  --  By her own promise  --  nay , by all , save taking , This body 's mine ! I 'll have it set down here And wait my pleasure ! See it done , my lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( to the bearers . ) Set the body down ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( takes the veil from the face . ) Come hither all ! Nay , father , look not black ! If o'er the azure temper of this blade There come no mist , when laid upon her lips , I 'll do a penance for irreverence , And fill your sack with penitential gold ! Look well ! ( Puts his sword blade to Isabella 's lips , and after watching it with intense interest a moment , drops on his knees beside the bier . ) She 's dead indeed ! Lead on ! ( The procession starts again to funereal music , and Tortesa follows last . ) SCENE II . A Street in Florence . The funereal music dying away in the distance . Enter Zippa , straining her eyes to look after it . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . ' T is Angelo that follows close behind , Laying his forehead almost on her bier ! His heart goes with her to the grave ! Oh Heaven ! Will not Tortesa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( She hears a footstep . ) Stay , stay , he 's here ! ( Enter Tortesa , musing . Zippa stands aside . ) TORTESA . TORTESA . I 've learned to-day a lord may be a Jew , I 've learned to-day that grief may kill a lady ; Which touches me the most I can not say , For I could fight Falcone for my loss , Or weep , with all my soul , for Isabella . ( Zippa touches him on the shoulder . ) ZIPPA . ZIPPA . How is't the Signor follows not his bride ? TORTESA . TORTESA . I did  --  but with their melancholy step I fell to musing , and so dropp 'd behind  --  But here 's a sight I have not seen to-day ! ( Takes her hand smilingly . ) ZIPPA . ZIPPA . What 's that ? TORTESA . TORTESA . A friendly face , my honest Zippa ! Art well ? What errand brings thee forth ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . None , Signor ! But passing by the funeral , I stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give his sacred station next the corse To an obtrusive stranger . TORTESA . TORTESA . Which is he ? ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( points after Angelo . ) Look there ! TORTESA . TORTESA . His face is buried in his cloak . Who is't ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Not know him ? Had I half the cause That you have , to see through that mumming cloak , The shadow of it would speak out his name ! TORTESA . TORTESA . What mean you ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Angelo ! What right has he To weep in public at her funeral ? TORTESA . TORTESA . The painter ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Ay  --  the peasant Angelo ! Was't not enough to dare to love her living , But he must fling the insult of his tears Betwixt her corse and you ? Are you not mov 'd ? Will you not go and pluck him from your place ? TORTESA . TORTESA . No , Zippa ! for my spirits are more apt To grief than anger . I 've in this half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  For , had I known her heart was capable Of breaking for the love of one so low , I would have done as much to make her his As I have done , in hate , to make her mine . She lov 'd him , Zippa ! ( Walks back in thought . ) ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( aside . ) Oh to find a way To pluck that fatal beauty from his eyes ! ' T is twilight , and the lamp is lit above her , And Angelo will watch the night out there , Gazing with passionate worship on her face . But no ! he shall not ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( advancing . ) Come ! what busy thought Vexes your brain now ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Were your pride as quick As other men 's to see an insult , Signor ! I had been spared the telling of my thought . TORTESA . TORTESA . You put it sharply ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Listen ! you are willing That there should follow , in your place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion of his grief Shews to the world he 's more bereaved than you ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Humph ! well ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Still follows he without rebuke ; And in the chapel where she lies to-night , Her features bared to the funereal lamp , He 'll , like a mourning bridegroom , keep his vigil , As if all Florence knew she was his own . TORTESA . TORTESA . Nay , nay ! he may keep vigil if he will ! The door is never lock 'd upon the dead Till bell and mass consign them to the tomb ; And custom gives the privilege to all To enter in and pray  --  and so may he . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Then learn a secret which I fain had spared My lips the telling . Question me not how , But I have chanced to learn , that Angelo , To-night , will steal the body from its bier ! TORTESA . TORTESA . To-night ! What ! Angelo ! Nay , nay , good Zippa ! If he 's enamoured of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch it till its shape decay , And holy church will call it piety . But he who steals from consecrated ground , Dies , by the law of Florence . There 's no end To answer i n't . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . You know not Angelo ! You think not with what wild , delirious passion A painter thirsts to tear the veil from beauty . He painted Isabella as a maid , Coy as a lily turning from the sun . Now she is dead , and , like a star that flew Flashing and hiding thro ' some fleecy rack , But suddenly sits still in cloudless heavens , She slumbers fearless in his steadfast gaze , Peerless and unforbidding . O , to him She is no more your bride ! A statue fairer Than ever rose enchanted from the stone , Lies in that dim-lit chapel , clad like life . Are you too slow to take my meaning yet ? He can not loose the silken boddice there ! He can not , there , upon the marble breast Shower the dark locks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Are you mov 'd ? Has he no end to compass In stealing her away from holy ground ? Will you not lock your bride up from his touch ? TORTESA . TORTESA . No more ! no more ! I thought not of all this ! Perchance it is not true . But twilight falls , And I will home to doff this bridal gear , And , after , set a guard upon the corse . We 'll walk together . Come ! ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( aside . ) ( He shall not see her ! ) Exeunt . SCENE III . A Street in front of the Falcone Palace . Night . Enter Isabella in her white bridal dress . She falters to her father 's door , and drops exhausted . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . My brain swims round ! I 'll rest a little here ! The night 's cold , chilly cold . Would I could reach The house of Angelo ! Alas ! I thought He would have kept one night of vigil near me , Thinking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I faint ! Where am I ? ( Looks around . ) ' T is my father 's door . My undirected feet have brought me home  --  And I must in , or die ! ( Knocks with a painful effort . ) So ends my dream ! FALCONE , FALCONE , ( from above . ) Who 's that would enter to a mourning house ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Your daughter ! FALCONE . FALCONE . Ha ! what voice is that I hear ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Poor Isabella 's . FALCONE . FALCONE . Art thou come to tell me , That with unnatural heart I killed my daughter ? Just Heaven ! thy retribution follows fast ! But oh , if holy and unnumbered masses Can give thee rest , perturb 'd and restless spirit ! Haunt thou a weeping penitent no more ! Depart ! I 'll in , and pass the night in prayer ! So shalt thou rest ! Depart ! ( He closes the window , and Isabella drops with her forehead to the marble stair . ) ( Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOMASO . TOMASO . It 's like the day after the deluge . Few stirring and nobody dry . I 've been since twilight looking for somebody that would drink . Not a beggar athirst in all Florence ! I thought that , with a bottle in my hand , I should be scented like a wild boar . I expected drunkards would have come up out of the ground  --  like worms in a shower . When was I ever Page 112 so difficult to find by a moist friend ? Two hundred ducats in good wine , and no companion ! I 'll look me up a dry dog . I 'll teach him to tipple , and give up the fellowship of mankind . ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( faintly . ) Signor ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Hey ! What ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Help , Signor ! TOMASO . TOMASO . A woman ! Ehem ! ( approaching her . ) Would you take something to drink by any chance ? ( Offers her the bottle . ) No ? Perhaps you do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I perish of cold ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Stay Here 's a cloak ! My master 's out for the night , and you shall home with me . Come ! Perhaps when you get warmer , you 'd like to drink a little . The wine 's good ! ( Assists her in rising , ) By St. Genevieve , a soft hand ! Come ! I 'll bring you where there 's fire and a clean flagon . ISABELLA . ISABELLA . To any shelter , Signor . TOMASO . TOMASO . Shelter ! nay , a good house , and two hundred ducats in ripe wine . Steady now ! ( This shall pass for a good action ! If my master smell a rat , I 'll face him out the woman 's honest ! ) This way , now ! Softly ! That 's well stepp 'd ! Come ! ( Goes out , assisting her to walk . ) END OF THE FOURTH ACT . ACT THE FIFTH . SCENE I. Angelo 's Studio . A full-length picture , in a large frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly in the centre of the room . Two curtains are so arranged as to cover the picture when drawn together . Angelo stands in an imploring attitude near the picture , his pencil and pallette in his hands , appealing to Isabella , who is partly turned from him in an attitude of refusal . The back wall of the room such as to form a natural ground for a picture . ANGELO . ANGELO . Hear me , sweet ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . No , we 'll keep a holiday , And waste the hours in love and idleness . You shall not paint to-day , dear Angelo ! ANGELO . ANGELO . But listen ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Nay , I 'm jealous of my picture ; For all you give to that is stol'n from me . I like not half a look that turns away Without an answer from the eyes it met ! I care not you should see my lips ' bright color Yet wait not for the breath that floats between ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Wilt listen ? ISABELLA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's a pencil in those restless fingers , Which you 've a trick of touching to your lips  --  And while you talk , my hand would do as well ! And if it 's the same tale you told before Of certain vigils you forgot to keep , Look deep into my eyes till it is done  --  For , like the children 's Lady-in-the well , I only hark because you 're looking in ! Will you talk thus to me ? ANGELO . ANGELO . Come night I will ! But close upon thy voice , sweet Isabella ! A boding whisper sinks into mine ear Which tells of sudden parting ! If ' t is false ,  --  We shall have still a lifetime for our love , But if ' t is true , oh think that , in my picture , Will lie the footprint of an angel gone ! Let me but make it clearer ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . Now , by heaven ! I think thou lov'st the picture , and not me ! So different am I , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death or parting , For thy least word , or look , or slightest motion  --  Nay , for so little breath as makes a sigh , I would not take , to have it pass untreasured , The empire of a star ! ( While she was uttering this reproach , Angelo has looked at her with delight , and touched his portrait with a few rapid strokes . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . My picture 's done ! ( Throws his pencil to the ground . ) Break , oh enchanted pencil ! thou wilt never On earth , again , do miracle so fair ! Oh Isabella ! as the dusky ore Waits for the lightning 's flash to turn to gold  --  As the dull vapour waits for Hesperus , Then falls in dew-drops and reflects a star  --  So waited I that fire upon thy lips , To make my master-piece complete in beauty ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . This is ambition where I look 'd for love ; The fancy flattering where the heart should murmur . I think you have no heart ! ANGELO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart is ever lowly with the fortunes , Tho ' the proud mind sits level with a king ! I gave you long ago both heart and soul , But only one has dared to speak to you ! Yet , if astonishment will cure the dumb , Give it a kiss  --  ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( smiling . ) Lo ! Where it speaks at last ! ( A loud knock is heard . ) Hark , Angelo ! ( He flies to the window , and looks out . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . Tortesa with a guard ! Alas ! that warning voice ! They 've traced thee hither ! Lost ! Lost ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( Hastily drawing the curtain , and disappearing behind it . ) No ! no ! defend thy picture only , And all is well yet ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Thee and it with life ! ( Draws his sword , and stands before the curtain in an attitude of defiance . Enter Tortesa with officers and guard . ) What is your errand ? TORTESA . TORTESA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by your drawn sword and defying air , Your conscious thought foretells it . ANGELO . ANGELO . Why ,  --  a blow  --  ( You took one , Signor , when you last were here  --  If you 've forgot it , well ! )  --  but , commonly , The giver of a blow needs have his sword Promptly in hand . You 'll pardon me ! TORTESA . TORTESA . I do ! For , if my fears are just , good Signor painter ! You 've not a life to spare upon a quarrel ! In brief , the corse of a most noble lady Was stol'n last night from holy sanctuary . I have a warrant here to search your house ; And , should the body not be found therein , I 'm bid to see the picture of the lady  --  Whereon , ( pray mark me ! ) if I find a trace Of charms fresh copied , more than may beseem The modest beauty of a living maid , I may arrest you on such evidence For instant trial ! ANGELO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for my picture , tho ' a moment 's glance Upon its pure and hallowed loveliness Would give the lie to your foul thought of me , It is the unseen virgin of my brain ! And as th ' inviolate person of a maid Is sacred ev'n in presence of the law , My picture is my own  --  to bare or cover ! Look on it at your peril ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( to the guard . ) Take his sword . ( The guards attack and disarm him . ) ANGELO . ANGELO . Coward and villain ! ( Tortesa parts the curtains with his sword , and Angelo starts amazed to see Isabella , with her hands crossed on her breast , and her eyes fixed on the ground , standing motionless in the frame which had contained his picture . The tableau deceives Tortesa , who steps back to contemplate what he supposes to be the portrait of his bride . ) TORTESA . TORTESA . Admirable work ! ' T is Isabella 's self ! Why , this is wondrous ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I would have sworn that gloss upon the hair , That shadow from the lash , were nature 's own  --  Impossible to copy ! ( Looks at it a moment in silence . ) Yet methinks The color on the cheek is something faint ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( hurriedly . ) Step this way farther ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( changing his position . ) Ay  --  ' t is better here ! The hand is not as white as Isabella 's  --  But painted to the life ! If there 's a feature That I would touch again , the lip , to me , Seems wanting in a certain scornfulness Native to her ! It scarcely marr 'd her beauty . Perhaps ' t is well slurr 'd over in a picture ! Yet stay ! I see it , now I look again ! How excellently well ! ( Guards return from searching the house . ) What ! found you nothing ? SOLDIER , SOLDIER , ( holding up Isabella 's veil . ) This bridal veil  --  no more . ANGELO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Signor ! you 'll trust me when I say I 'm sorry With all my soul ! This veil , I know it well  --  Was o'er the face of that unhappy lady When laid in sanctuary . You are silent ! Perhaps you scorn to satisfy me here ! I trust you can  --  in your extremity ! But I must bring you to the Duke ! Lead on ! ANGELO . ANGELO . An instant ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( courteously ) . At your pleasure ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( to Isabella , as he passes close to her . ) I conjure you , By all our love , stir not ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( still motionless . ) Farewell ! ( Tortesa motions for Angelo to precede him with the guard , looks once more at the picture , and with a gesture expressive of admiration , follows . As the door closes , Isabella steps from the frame . ) ISABELLA . ISABELLA . I 'll follow Close on thy steps , beloved Angelo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My heart is light , and hope speaks cheerily ! And lo ! bright augury !  --  a friar 's hood For my disguise ! Was ever omen fairer ! Thanks ! my propitious star ! ( Envelopes herself in the hood , and goes out hastily . ) SCENE II . A Street . Enter Tomaso , with his hat crushed and pulled sulkily over his eyes , his clothes dirty on one side , and other marks of having slept in the street . Enter Zippa from the other side , meeting him . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Tomaso ! Is't thou ? Where 's Angelo ? TOMASO . TOMASO . It is I , and I do n't know ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Did he come home last night ? TOMASO . TOMASO . " Did he come home ! " Look there ! ( Pulls off his hat and shows his dirty side . ) ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Then thou hast slept in the street ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Ay ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . And what has that to do with the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy father to do with thy having such a nose as his ? ( Zippa holds up a ducat to him . ) What ! gave thy mother a ducat ?  --  cheap as dirt ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Blockhead , no ! I 'll give thee the ducat if thou wilt tell me , straight on , what thou know'st of Angelo ! TOMASO . TOMASO . I will  --  and thou shalt see how charity is rewarded . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Begin !  --  begin ! TOMASO TOMASO Last night , having pray 'd later than usual at vespers  --  ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Ehem ! TOMASO . TOMASO . I was coming home in a pious frame of mind  --  ZIPPA . ZIPPA.  --  And a bottle in thy pocket . TOMASO . TOMASO . No !  --  in my hand . What should I stumble over  --  ZIPPA . ZIPPA.  --  But a stone . TOMASO . TOMASO . A woman ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Fie ! what 's this you 're going to tell me ? TOMASO . TOMASO . She was dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZIPPA.  --  And new wine . TOMASO . TOMASO . Old wine , Zippa ! The wine was old ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Well ! TOMASO . TOMASO . I took her home . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Shame !  --  at thy years ? TOMASO . TOMASO . And Angelo being out for the night  --  ZIPPA . ZIPPA . There ! there ! you may skip the particulars . TOMASO . TOMASO . I say my own bed being in the garret  --  ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Well , well ! TOMASO . TOMASO . I put her into Angelo 's . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Oh , unspeakable impudence ! Didst thou do that ? TOMASO . TOMASO . I had just left her to make a wine posset , ( for she was well nigh dead ) , when in popped my master ,  --  finds her there  --  asks no questions ,  --  kicks me into the street , and locks the door ! There 's the reward of virtue ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Did he not turn out the woman , too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ZIPPA . Oh worse and worse ! And thou hast not seen him since ? TOMASO . TOMASO . I found me a soft stone , said my prayers , and went to sleep . ZIPPA . ZIPPA . And hast thou not seen him to day ? TOMASO . TOMASO . Partly , I have ! ZIPPA . ZIPPA . Where ? Tell me quickly ! TOMASO . TOMASO . Give me the ducat . ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( gives it him . ) Quick ! say on ! TOMASO . TOMASO . I have a loose recollection , that , lying on that stone , Angelo called me by name . Looking up , I saw two Angelos , and two Tortesas , and soldiers with two spears each . ( He figures in the air with his finger as if trying to remember . ) ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( aside . ) ( Ha ! he is apprehended for the murder of Isabella . Say that my evidence might save his life ! Not unless he love me ! ) Which way went he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Then has he gone to be tried before the Duke . ) Come with me , Tomaso ! Come . TOMASO . TOMASO . Where ? ZIPPA . ZIPPA . To the Duke 's palace ! Come ! ( Takes his arm . ) TOMASO . TOMASO . To the Duke 's palace ? There 'll be kicking of heels in the ante-chamber !  --  dry work ! I 'll spend thy ducat as we go along . Shall it be old wine , or new ? Exeunt . SCENE III . Hall of Judgment in the Ducal Palace . The Duke . upon a raised throne on the left . Falcone near his chair , and Angelo on the opposite side of the stage with a guard . Isabella behind the guard , disguised as a monk . Tortesa stands near the centre of the stage , and Zippa and Tomaso in the left corner , listening eagerly . Counsellors at a table , and crowd of spectators at the sides and rear . DUKE . DUKE . Are there more witnesses ? COUNSELLOR . COUNSELLOR . No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner ? COUNSELLOR . COUNSELLOR . He makes no defence Beyond a firm denial . FALCONE . FALCONE . Is there wanting Another proof , my liege , that he is guilty ? DUKE . DUKE . I fear he stands in deadly peril , Count . ( To the Counsellor . ) Sum up the evidence . ( He reads . ) COUNSELLOR . COUNSELLOR . ' T is proved , my liege , That for no honest or sufficient end , The pris'ner practised on your noble Grace And Count Falcone a contrived deceit , Whereby he gained admittance to the lady . ( Tomaso exhibits signs of alarm . ) DUKE . DUKE . Most true ! COUNSELLOR . COUNSELLOR . That , till the eve before her death , He had continual access to the palace ; And , having grown enamoured of the bride , Essay 'd by plots that never were matured , And quarrels often forced on her betrothed , To stay the bridal . That , against the will Of her most noble father and the Duke , The bride was resolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceremony , Upon her bridal morning was found dead . ' T is proved again  --  that , while she lay in state , The guard , at several periods of the night , Did force the pris'ner from the chapel door ; And when the corse was stol'n from sanctuary All search was vain , till , in the pris'ner 's hands Was found the veil that shrouded her . To these , And lighter proofs of sacrilege and murder , The prisoner has opposed his firm denial  --  No more ! DUKE . DUKE . Does no one speak in his behalf ? TORTESA . TORTESA . My liege ! so far as turns the evidence Upon the prisoner 's quarrels with myself , I 'm free to say that they had such occasion As any day may rise ' twixt men of honor . As one of those aggriev 'd by his offences , You 'll wonder I 'm a suitor for his pardon  --  But so I am ! Besides that there is room To hope him innocent , your Grace 's realm Holds not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed the lady Isabella , ' T is some amends that in his glorious picture She 's made immortal ! If he stole her corse , He can return , for that disfigured dust , An Isabella fresh in changeless beauty ! Were it not well to pardon him , my Lord ? ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( aside . ) Oh brave Tortesa ! DUKE . DUKE . You have pleaded kindly And eloquently , Signor ! but the law Can recognize no gift as plea for pardon . For his rare picture he will have his fame ; But if the Isabella he has painted Find not a voice to tell his innocence , He dies at sunset ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( despairingly . ) He is dead to me ! Yet he shall live ! ( She drops the cowl from her shoulders , and with her arms folded , walks slowly to the feet of the Duke . ) FALCONE , FALCONE , ( rushing forward . ) My daughter ! ANGELO , ANGELO , ( with a gesture of agony . ) Lost ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( energetically . ) Tortesa 'll have her ! ( Isabella retires to the back of the stage with her father and kneels to him , imploring in dumb show ; the Duke and others watching . ) TORTESA , TORTESA , So ! all 's right again ? Now for my lands or Isabella ?  --  Stay ! ' T is a brave girl by Heaven ! ( Reflects a moment . ) A sleeping draught , And so to Angelo ! Her love for me A counterfeit to take suspicion off ! It was well done ! I feel my heart warm to her ! ( Reflects again . ) Where could he hide her from our search to-day ? ( Looks round at Isabella . ) No ? Yet the dress is like ! It was the picture ! Herself  --  and not a picture ! Now , by Heaven , A girl like that should be the wife of Csar ! ( Presses his hand upon his heart . ) I 've a new feeling here ! ( Falcone comes forward , followed by Isabella with gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear you ! My liege , I pray you keep the prisoner In durance till my daughter 's fairly wed . He has contriv 'd against our peace and honor , And howsoe'er this marvel be made clear , She stands betroth 'd , if he is in the mind , To the brave Signor yonder ! DUKE . DUKE . This were well  --  What says Tortesa ? TORTESA . TORTESA . If my liege permit , I will address my answer to this lady . ( Turns to Isabella . ) For reasons which I need not give you now , Fair Isabella ! I became your suitor . My motives were unworthy you and me  --  Yet I was true  --  I never said I lov 'd you ! Your father sold you me for lands and money  --  ( Pardon me Duke ! And you , fair Isabella ! You will  --  ere I am done ! ) I push 'd my suit ! The bridal day came on , and clos 'd in mourning ; For the fair bride it dawn 'd upon was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in my heart sat sorrow uppermost , And pity  --  for I thought your heart was broken . ( Isabella begins to discover interest in his story , and Angelo watches her with jealous eagerness . ) I see you here again ! You are my bride ! Your father holds me to my bargain for you ! The lights are burning on the nuptial altar  --  The bridal chamber and the feast , all ready ! What stays the marriage now ?  --  my new-born love ! That nuptial feast were fruit from Paradise  --  I can not touch it till you bid me welcome ! That nuptial chamber were the lap of Heaven  --  I can not enter till you call me in ! ( Takes a ring from his bosom . ) Here is the golden ring you should have worn . Tell me to give it to my rival there  --  I 'll break my heart to do so ! ( Holds it towards Angelo . ) ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( looking at her father . ) Would I might ! TORTESA . TORTESA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I command thee , never ! My liege , permit me to take home my daughter ! And , Signor , you  --  if you would keep your troth  --  To-morrow come , and end this halting bridal ! Home ! Isabella ! ( Takes his daughter 's hand . ) TORTESA , TORTESA , ( taking it from him ) . Stay ! she is not your 's ! ( Turns to the Duke . ) My gracious liege , there is a law in Florence , That if a father , for no guilt or shame , Disown , and shut his door upon his daughter , She is the child of him who succors her ; Who , by the shelter of a single night , Becomes endowed with the authority Lost by the other . Is't not so ? DUKE . DUKE . So runs The law of Florence , and I see your drift  --  For , look my lord ! ( to Falcone , ) if that dread apparition You saw last night , was this your living daughter , You stand within the peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( looking admiringly at Tortesa . ) Oh noble Signor ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( to Isabella . ) Was't well done ? Shall I give Angelo the ring ? ( As she is about to take it from him , Tomaso steps in behind , and pulls Isabella by the sleeve . ) TOMASO . TOMASO . Stay there ! What wilt thou do for dowry ? I 'm thy father ? But  --  save some flasks of wine  --  ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( sorrowfully . ) Would I were richer For thy sake , Angelo ! ( Tortesa looks at her an instant , and then steps to the table and writes . ) ANGELO , ANGELO , ( coming forward with an effort . ) Look , Isabella ! I stand between thee and a life of sunshine . Thou wert both rich and honor 'd , but for me ! That thou couldst wed me , beggar as I am , Is bliss to think on  --  but see how I rob thee ! I have a loving heart  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Points to Tortesa. )  --  with wealth and honor ! ( Tortesa steps between them , and hands a paper to Angelo . ) TORTESA , TORTESA , ( to Isabella . ) Say thou wilt wed the poorer ? ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( offers her hand to Angelo . ) So I will ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Then am I blest , for he 's as rich as I  --  Yet , in his genius , has one jewel more ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . What sayst thou ? ( Angelo reads earnestly . ) TORTESA . TORTESA . In a mortal quarrel , lady ! ' T is thought ill-luck to have the better sword ; For the good angels , who look sorrowing on , In heavenly pity take the weaker side ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . What is it , Angelo ? ANGELO . ANGELO . A deed to me Of the Falcone palaces and lands , And all the moneys forfeit by your father !  --  By Heaven , I 'll not be mock 'd ! TORTESA . TORTESA . The deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISABELLA , ( tenderly to Tortesa ) . It is not kind To make a refusal of your love a pain ! TORTESA . TORTESA . I would ' t would kill you to refuse me lady ! So should the blood plead for me at your heart ! Shall I give up the ring ? ( offers it . ) ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( hesitatingly . ) Let me look on it ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( withdrawing it . ) A moment yet ! You 'll give it ere you think ! Oh is it fair that Angelo had days , To tell his love , and I have not one hour ? How know you that I can not love as well ? ISABELLA . ISABELLA . ' T is possible ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Ah ! thanks ! ISABELLA . ISABELLA . But I have given My heart to him ! TORTESA . TORTESA . You gave your troth to me ! If , of these two gifts you must take back one , Rob not the poorer ! Shall I keep the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hesitates ! I 've waited here too long ! ( Tears the deed in two . ) Perish your gift , and farewell Isabella ! ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( advancing a step with clasp 'd hands . ) You 'll kill me , Angelo ! Come back ! TORTESA , TORTESA , ( seizing him by the hand as he hesitates and flinging him back with a strong effort . ) He shall ! ANGELO . ANGELO . Stand from my path ! Or , if you care to try Some other weapon than a glozing tongue , Follow me forth where we may find the room ! TORTESA . TORTESA . You shall not go . ANGELO , ANGELO , ( draws . ) Have at thee then ! ( Attacks Tortesa , who disarms him , and holds his sword-point to his breast . Duke and others come forward . ) TORTESA . TORTESA . The bar ' Twixt me and heaven , boy ! is the life I hold Now at my mercy ! Take it , Isabella ! And with it the poor gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere you 've time to marry . So take your troth back with your bridal ring , And thus I join you ! ( Takes Isabella 's hand , but Angelo refuses his . ) ANGELO , ANGELO , ( proudly . ) Never ! But for me , The hand you hold were joyfully your own ! Shall I receive a life and fortune from you , Yet stand ' twixt you and that ? ISABELLA , ISABELLA , ( turning from Angelo . ) Thou dost not love me ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Believe it not ! He does ! An instant more I 'll brush this new spun cobweb from his eyes . ( Approaches Zippa . ) Fair Zippa ! in this cross 'd and tangled world Few wed the one they could have lov 'd the best , And fewer still wed well for happiness ! We each have lost to-day what best we love . But as the drops , that mingled in the sky Are torn apart in the tempestuous sea , Yet with a new drop tremble into one , We two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What say you ? ZIPPA , ZIPPA , ( giving her hand . ) I have thought on it before , When I believed you cold and treacherous , ' T is easy when I know you kind and noble . TORTESA . TORTESA . To-morrow , then , we 'll wed ; and now , fair Signor , ( To Angelo . ) Take you her hand , nor fear to rob Tortesa ! ( Turns to the Duke . ) Shall it be so , my liege ? DUKE . DUKE . You please me well . And if you 'll join your marriage feasts together I 'll play my part and give the brides away ! TORTESA . TORTESA . Not so , my liege ! I could not see her wed him . To give her to him has been all I could ; For I have sought her with the dearest pulses That quicken in my heart , my love and scorn . She 's taught me that the high-born may be true . I thank her for it  --  but , too close on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brightens , but straight is dark again ! My liege ! The poor who leap up to the stars for duty Must drop to earth again ! and here , if't please you , I take my feet for ever from your palace , And , match 'd as best beseems me , say farewell . ( Takes Zippa 's hand , and the curtain drops . ) THE END
