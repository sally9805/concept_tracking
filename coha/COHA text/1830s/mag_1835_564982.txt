txt THIS iS true liberty , where free-born men , Having to advise the people , may speak free ; Which he who can and will should have just praise , - He , who nor can nor will , may hold his peace , - What can be juster in a State than this ! EuRIPIn*s . THE nomination of Mr. Webster will one day prove an epoch in history . The selection of any candidate for the highest office in the republic must generally involve important results . But the nomination of this distinguished individual , at this particular crisis , can not but be full of great and extraordinary consequences . We have dared to anticipate the fiat of posterity , but we have done so in no vain-glorious or presumptuous spirit . If Mr. Webster could be elected to the highest trust in this government , it needs no uncommon insight into futurity , - indeed , needs only the most ordinary acquaintance with the life and character of the man , - to foresee , that his administration would be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free people . On the other hand , it is not success alone , that can impart to this nomination its most momentous interest . The principles , upon which he must be elected , if elected at all , are so necessarily the very fabric and foundation of the State ) - they have already sustained a shock so severe , and almost fatal , bearing down , everywhere in its progress , the constitutional landmarks which our fathers planted in toil and blood , - the speedy re-instatement of these principles in the national councils is so clearly essential to the public safety and the public freedom , - the election of some great champion and defender of them , against the desperate and abandoned men , who are gambling away everything which ought to be dear to the people , to gratify their own selfish and sordid lusts , has become , at length , a matter of such pressing and intense importance , that the chances of a failure can not be contemplated without horror and dismay . Success would , indeed , renew our strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fears and despondency of men , who shall venture to predict the whole awful , and perhaps forever , irreparable consequence of defeat ! Another administration , based upon the same principles ,  --  if principles they are , - which have distinguished the present ; another cabinet , constructed of the same , or similarly pliant and corrupt materials ; another executive , irresolute for good , and strong only in error ; another distribution of the spoils of victory , ' to gratify the cupidity and to secure the services of greedy partizans , instead of providing for the public service such as would be safeguards of the public weal ; another eight years ' system of perverse , // reckless , intriguing and profligate mismanagement , - and what remains to us of all we have hitherto honored ? What , - but the fulfilment of our fears . What , but the abyss of our degradation . What , - but that polluted page of history , which records us in the mournful catalogue of broken and lost republics . It is not enough , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , that the barren sceptre ' is wrested from his grasp , who is said to contemplate another resumption of that golden sorrow with such republican complacency . No lineal heir of his virtues can assume it , with safety to the State . The reign of evil must cease . The career of grasping ambition must be checked . The corrupted sources of legislation must be cleansed and purified . The minds and the hearts of the people must be disabused of the fatal delusions , which they have clasped to their bosoms , until the poison has gone far to insinuate itself into the very sluices of life . The candidates for public office should be selected upon some better ground than servile adherence to the worst tactics of a party . They should execute their trusts upon higher considerations than mere personal aggrandizement . They should discharge their consciences of the delirious dream of selfish ambition . They should tear from their hearts that unholy veil , which shuts out the common welfare , and every noble object of human action , and leaves them to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workings of their own corrupt desires . They should give to office something of its dignity . They should derive from it something better than its stains . The fountains of public spirit and public honor should be unsealed , and their generous streams let loose to refresh and fertilize the land . There must be some return to the plain virtues of the old republic , ( and would to God , it might be speedy and thorough ) or , even that name of Freedom , that all , which presumptuous ignorance , or something worse , has now left us , shall sound as a bitter mockery upon our lips ; and her voice , ( sweetest of all human melodies ) broken and dying , as it has lately been , shall at length sink into the utter silence of eternal death . If it should , indeed , come to this , - and the tendency of things points to no consequences more likely , - if we should , indeed , forfeit this great thing , called Liberty , - a possession so precious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without which , indeed , there is no real good , - if we , whose hearts may yet throb without degrading fears , - whose eyes may yet glance from the broad earth to the unbounded heaven , and draw in something from every sympathy and association , that ever inspired the energies of the generous and the brave , - if we , endoxved with the capacities of freemen , should wantonly or negligently tamper with this invaluable blessing , this right of honest thought , this privilege of honorable action ; this charmed cup , which infuses all that is most // graceful and beautiful into life ; this burning thirst of the world 's prilgrims for an unbroken soul , and an unfettered conscience ; this vantage ground , so hardly xvon and so easily lost , by them that do the work negligently ; if this high gift of God should become to us a bauble and a name ; if we should lose the understanding to appreciate , and the spirit to defend it , - shall we not he held to strict account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , on every hill-top and in every green field , have left their blood as a memorial that the oppressor had ceased ? How shall we answer it to posterity , who will demand the sacred inheritance at our hands ? It would not be possible to speak of the course of the present administration in too strong language . Its vices and its follies are beyond the flight of ordinary exaggeration . The downward tendency of all things under its auspices , is its truest and severest commentary . The madness of trusting the direction of affairs in such hands has long been manifest to men of clear minds and sound hearts . Its ignorance , or its contempt of the plainest principles of free institutions , has long been but too apparent . The difference between a despotism and a republican government is told in a single sentence . In the one , the public good is secured by the enlightened action of the people 's representatives , whose first responsibilities are to their country , their consciences , and to God ; in the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dominant party , leagued to their chief and to each other by motives of mutual and selfish interest . Under which system , this government has been lately administered , and under which it is preferable to live , are questions which it will soon become this people very deeply to consider . They can not long continue ignorant of the true character of the party-leaders who have hitherto so strangely maintained the power which they so strangely acquired . They will not alxvay* submit to an administration , which evidently has no more honest purpose than the indulgence of its own blind and headlong will . We are not willing to believe that the present administration is formed upon any definite and settled purpose of subverting the institutions of the country . True , it would be no unjust suspicion . True , the whole course of its measures , if it does not absolutely indicate such a design , does directly and inevitably tend to no other possible result . But , there is one thing which we do most firmly believe ; that , in the pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in this country valuable enough to weigh a feather in the comparisen . And is it not equally momentous to the people , is it not equally fatal to all that makes life worth possessing , if , for the gratification of such purposes , it would sacrifice the dearest privileges , the highest imrnunities , the purest institutions , the rights won with toil , the // charters sealed with blood ,  --  would pervert the Constitution , trample upon the laws , insult earth and dare Heaven Let it not be said , that we urge this subject in too vehement terms . We are well aware that some of the language which we employ , may sound strangely in the ears of a few honest but cool and cautious men . We are well aware that anything , but the calmest statement of the subject , might be deemed inexpedient , and perhaps impolitic , by those whose convenient rule of conduct is- ' to beguile the time , look like the time . ' But , it is not for such men that we write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is not thus , that the victory is to be won . The great enterprise which the constitutional party of this Commonwealth has undertaken , and for which we need and seek the co-operation of the friends of the Constitution and the laws everywhere , should have a rallying-call , to thrill upon the hearts of men like the echoes of battle . And , we thank God , there are those , everywhere throughout the broad land , who are , themselves , the strength and honor and glory of the state ; whose hearts have long been stirred by the same impulses that beat strong and xvarrn in the homes of New-England ; men , who have felt that a crisis was rapidly approaching - terrible in its character , tremendous in its consequences , fatal to all good , unless it was met and resisted , - not by cold and indecisive calculations , but boldly , firmly , heartily , - with their best powers and their noblest energies , by all such as love the sacred name of COUNTRY . It is upon such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the safety of the nation depends . It is through them , and by their exertions , that appeals and warnings must be reiterated in the ears of the people ; until they fully awake from the delusive security , in which they have been already too long reposing . There can not be a doubt , that the people , - that great mass , so full of real strength , and so unconscious of its uses , - are friendly to the institutions of the country . But they have been most grossly deceived and misled . Their hearts are right , but their understandings have been clouded . Every passion , every prejudice , every interest , which they have , or which they imagine themselves to possess , have been played upon , and brought to bear against those who have become the opponents of the administration , by the force of irresistible events . They have been taught to consider those their worst enemies who have been uniformly contending for popular rights . They have been made to believe , that support of government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just jealousy of rulers is the best security of the ruled . They have been cajoled by the watchwords of liberty , into mistaking the shadow for the substance - the false image for the true divinity . They have listened to the // flattering protestations of hollow friends , until the worst measures of the administration have seemed to them but honest errors ; and they were ready to believe that , whether sober or beside itself ' , it was equally for their cause . Thus has freedom always been destroyed . Slowly and imperceptibly , strength steals from the people to the government . Every day there is some new invasion of popular rights ; every day , some valuable privilege melts from the grasp of those who will not exert themselves for its security ; until , at length , the power becomes firmly established in the hands of the corrupt and unprincipled few , and the institutions of the country are miserably subverted . No matter how many centuries it may have required to build the State . No matter what thought , what solicitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sufferings , what deaths , or finally , what glorious hopes , may have consecrated its establishment , - an hour may lay it in the dust - in spite of the prayers of martyrs offered upon the scaffold , and the blood of patriots shed upon the field , - in spite of reason and eloquence and prophet-voices , that , Cassandra-like , predicted , in vain , the ten-fold ruin which befalls those who believe not until sudden destruction cometh as a whirlwind . It is in this view of the subject , that good men have become too despondent respecting the preservation of popular rights . The course of history presents so melancholy a picture ; and their own experience , to a certain extent , so sadly justifies it , that it would he a wonder if the minds of reflecting men were not somewhat shaken . But we are of that number who entertain better hopes . The history of nations affords no just parallel to the character and condition of the people of these United States . We do not believe they will tamely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they must strike anew for liberty , the struggle will be fearful . It will be written in another and a bloodier page of the world 's annals . But let us not anticipate a contingency so terrible . This life is not a condition of unmixed excellence . It is too much to expect , that evil principles will not always be actively engaged , demanding the constant and steadfast Opposition of the friends of human goodness . Heaven affords its aid to those who are resolute for the truth . The combined forces of freedom , true to themselves , are irresistible to others . The time has , indeed , arrived for them to collect their moral energies ; to come to the rescue of the national honor and the national institutions ; to stand together and unbroken around their country 's altars , and imploring the blessing of God upon a good cause , to live or die free amidst the memorials of their fathers ' glory . The nomination of MR . WEBsTER by the Legislative Convention of Massachusetts , and the cheerful echoes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shew , too plainly for mistake , the current and complexion of men 's thoughts . The next canvass for the presidency will assume more of a national character than any which has yet occurred . It will involve the decision of the most momentous political question , which could be presented to the consideration of a free people : - Whether that Constitution shall he maintained , which has proved the safeguard of the public liberty ! The decision of this question is in the hands of the people . They are beginning to awake to the dangers which encompass them ; and it is high time that the friends of the republic should call together and concentrate all their faculties upon the thorough enlightenment of the public mind . Not by despondency , not by doubts and fears , can the noble undertaking he accomplished ; not by deploring the follies and vices of the times ; not hy lamenting over the evils which are inseparably connected with popular forms of government ; but by giving , to the great work set before them , their best powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoting themselves and their 's to the service of their country , in the hour of her utmost need . It is , indeed , a great stake which demands their skill ; infinitely beyond every party feeling or local predilection . That man must have but slightly considered the current of events , who regards this nomination in any other light than as a high national enterprise . For ourselves , we care not where Mr. Webster may have displayed the first dawnings of his brilliant and honorable career . It matters nothing , in view of this question , whether he drew his first breath in a homely mansion of New-England , or amidst the untrampled forest-solitudes of the West . It is not the great man , but the great citizen , in whom we confide , - the American in heart , in soul , and in life ; the honest and undeviating republican ; above the ordinary interests , that weigh down the faculties of ordinary men ; beyond the fears or the enticements of party influences ; the wise and good statesman the pilot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and darkness , has kept his eye steadfastly fixed upon the light of the Constitution , and contended with the storms of faction for his country 's honor , and her chartered rights . The claims of Mr. Webster , upon the people of these United States , are of a very uncommon character . His services have been of such a nature as to be very readily understood . Friends and foes alike have acknowledged the splendor of his wonderful abilities , and the great and unbending character of the man . Whenever danger , real or supposed , was abroad , he has been always at his post . According to his views of the public good , he has followed , throughout life , a dircct , a noble and a manly course . If the question of his election could he left to the unbiassed decision of his countrymen , there could not remain a // doubt of his success . The American people are not , in our opim ' ion , disposed to depreciate the talents and services of eminent citizens . On the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of reward to every description of merit . If they could determine this question , uninfluenced by the miserable intrigues , which are corrupting the purity of elections , - that only sotirce and security of popular rights , - we might hope everything from the justice of their judgment . As it is , we anticipate the best possible result . There will be a sense of security in electing Lr . Webster , which the people can not but feel . The illustrious talents , the firm integrity , the ardent patriotism , which have distinguished his career , would render him the pride and glory of the nation . His elevated views of the dignity and value of republican institutions , afford the surest pledge of his devotion to our best interests . On the brightest page of his country 's jurisprudence , in the proudest annals of our national legislation , will be found the record of his fame . Wherever the voice of eloquence has captivated the affections , or the name of Freedom has stirred the hearts of men , his name has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have formed of a republican Chief Magistrate be not falser than the falsest of all theories , we know of no man better suited than Mr. Webster to constitute the original of the picture . He should possess a mind capable of appreciating the principles upon which the government was established ; a clear view of the meaning of the Constitution ; a solemn veneration for the laws of the land . He should bring to his high responsibilities the most fervent wishes for the welfare of the people committed to his charge . He should feel that , in comparison with their good , his own interests and his own wishes were but as the smallest dust of the balance . He should examine into the deepest recesses of his heart , and free himself from every impulse of selfish passion . The deliberate decision of the Legislature should , in general , constitute his only will . He should shrink from the least imagination of legislative interference . He should be above the reach of party prejudice and party management , and party influence ; above the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the base , low , groveling things , which fester in the hearts of ignoble men . It should be his chief concern to secure the perpetuity of our institutions . He should bring to his great office a deep sense of its duties . He should bring to it a clear mind and an upright heart . He should determine to discharge the highest trust upon earth with a conscience void of offence towards God and towards man . We believe Mr. Webster to be second to no man living in all the qualities which constitute a great and honest statesman . It is no part of our design to enter , in this place , into an examination of his eminent public services . Posterity will appreciate them . // honor him most as the 6reat champion of the Constitution ; freeing day by day , from the misty sophistries , with which i norance it , b and wickedness would envelope its noble features ; but distant nations have heard of him as the friend of freedom and of man , and have caught courage and hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Mr. Webster should be elected , what glorious anticipations might we not realize His strong and manly character would at once impart an elevated tone to the administration of the government . The institutions of the country , under his friendly and intelligent auspices , would become re-established upon a still firmer basis , which the corruptions of many years would be unable to destroy . Liberal opinions , throughout the world , might count upon more encour* aging and permanent prospects . The friends of freedom , who have long regarded this land as their only refuge , would hail his election to office , like the orient gladness of a newer and a brighter day . God forbid we should intimate that his failure would deprive them of hope . The good and the brave are beyond the reach of events . An unseen power sustains their courage . Let then ) never despair . But , the better fortunes of this country are connected so indissolubly with the principles of the party which has nominated ? vlr . Webster ; the success of these principles is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count most valuable , that we hardly dare to anticipate the consequences of defeat . In such an event , it is not likely that any sudden or immediately observable changes would take place in the direction of affairs . But the leading partizans who would become fixed in power , are those who , excepting a solemn regard for their own private and peculiar interests , have as yet exhibited no other rule of conduct than blind devotion to the will of one man . The false notions of policy and government , lately introduced , would become still more deeply rooted . Still falser opinions would be sedulously propagated . All respect for the manners , the sentiments and the principles of the republic , would gradually give way before the steady march of corruption . Old thrones , which shook for fear of our infancy , would bitterly laugh in derision of our manhood . Some strong hand would finally shake over us an iron sceptre , and we should go down to after times in the list of nations xveak enough to trifle away those possessions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For ourselves , we confess that we venerate the republican virtues and institutions of our fathers . We still value that great Instrument , for the sake of whose principles those good men hazarded their lives and fortunes and sacred honor . ' And the still greater instrument , - the fountain of every privilege ; the charter of our liberty , to whose construction the sages of another day // brought the deliberate wisdom and experience of all ages of the world ; the solemn testament to their children of all that their own blood purchased , - in our eyes it has lost nothing whatever of its venerable and consecrated character . However its honest meaning may confound the sagacity and perplex the councils of evil-disposed men ; however its plain provisions may refuse to be accommodated to the present purposes or the future designs of the administration , - we can not help thinking it is worth preserving ; and , if need be , still worth fighting for , before it shall be trampled in the dust . It were too late to say that the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How wantonly , openly , deliberately violated ! If there be an enemy of usurpation , let him hasten to the rescue ! It can not be , that we shall tamely submit . If we are anxious to save our country from that terrible train of evils , which wait upon anarchy and despotism , we must nerve our hearts now to do battle for the good cause . It is our own cause - the cause of our children , of freedom , of the world , of posterity . The struggle will not be in vain . Providence does not altogether desert a nation , which is not thoroughly and utterly debased . Let us trust , that the GOD of our fathers will also be with us . Let us believe that , as in times past , He has raised up one who will be his servant to succor us in the evil days upon which we have fallen . Let us faithfully discharge our duty . Let not treason to our country weigh upon our hearts . Let us never submit to be slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
