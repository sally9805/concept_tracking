Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : YAMOYDEN , A TALE OF THE WARS OF KING PHILIP . IN SIX CANTOS. from The writings ( 1835 ) " All kinds , all creatures stand or fall By strength of prowess or of wit : ' T is God 's appointment , who shall sway , And who is to submit .  --  Say then that he was wise as brave , As wise in thought as bold in deed ; For in the principles of things He sought his moral creed . And thou , altho ' with some wild thoughts , Wild chieftain of a savage clan ! Hadst this to boast , that thou didst love The liberty of man . "  --  Wordsworth . ADVERTISEMENT . Before submitting this poem to the judgment of the public , it is necessary that the editor should give a brief account of the manner in which it was composed . He hopes that will prove , to the candid and intelligent , a sufficient apology for the defects with which he is well aware this juvenile production abounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Rev. James Wallis Eastburn , and himself , during the winter of 1817-18 , and the following spring . Mr. Eastburn , in 1816 , went to Bristol , Rhode-Island , to pursue the study of divinity under the direction of the Rt . Rev. A. V. Griswold , Bishop of the Eastern diocess . He was constantly in the habit of amusing his hours of relaxation with poetical composition ; and the local traditions connected with the scenery , in his immediate vicinity , suggested to him a fit subject for his favourite employment . He often mentioned in the course of his correspondence with the editor , his intention of making some of the adventures of King Philip , the well known Sachem of Pokanoket , the theme of a poetical romance . In the year following , when he visited New-York , the plan of the proposed story was drawn up in conjunction . We had then read nothing on the subject ; and our plot was formed from a hasty glance into a few pages of Hubbard 's Narrative . To quote a simile from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meddle with the charge before we had blazoned the field ; and , though the action of our fable only occupied the space of forty-eight hours , we were led into several inconsistencies , in the general outline first proposed ; from which no departure was afterward made . After Mr. Eastburn 's return to Bristol , the poem was written , according to the parts severally assigned ; and transmitted , reciprocally , in the course of correspondence . It was commenced in November , 1817 , and finished before the summer of 1818 ; except the concluding stanzas of the sixth canto , which were added after Mr. Eastburn left Bristol . As the fable was defective , from our ignorance of the subject , the execution was also , from the same cause , and the hasty mode of composition , in every respect imperfect . Mr. Eastburn was then preparing to take orders ; and his studies , with that view , engrossed his attention . He was ordained in October , 1818 . Between that time and the period of his going to Accomack county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take charge of a congregation , he transcribed the first two cantos of this poem , with but few material variations , from the first collating copy . The labours of his ministry left him no time , even for his most delightful amusement . He had made no further progress in the correction of the work , when he returned to this city , in July , 1819 . His health was then so much impaired , that writing of any kind was too great a labour . He had packed up the manuscripts , intending to finish his second copy in Santa Cruz , whither it was recommended to him to go , as the last resource , to recruit his exhausted constitution . He died on the fourth day of his passage , December 2d , 1819 . He left among his prayers a great quantity of poetry , of which his part of " Yamoyden " forms but small proportion . His friends may think proper , at some future period , to make selections from his miscellaneous remains , and arrange them for publication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be first published , and they were determined in that wish by the approbation of a gentleman whose talents and learning are universally respected in this community . The editor was therefore induced to comply with their request , and undertake the correction of the manuscript . His labour , in so doing , has not been trifling . He had no right to make any alterations in the original plot ; or to destroy his deceased friend 's poetical identity . He has endeavoured to remove as many errors , in point of matter or expression , as was consistent with these necessary restraints . From looking over several books , whose subjects were connected with that of the poem , he has been led to make some additions to the original matter . The principal of these , in point of bulk , are ,  --  the verses in the commencement , relating to the previous history of the Indian wars ;  --  the Sermon introduced in the third canto ;  --  the Ode to the Manitto of Dreams , in the fourth ; and the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last alteration was always contemplated by Mr. Eastburn , who had made the heroine perform the journey alone . The editor mentions these portions as his own , because they were hastily added in the course of transcription , and printed as soon as written ; and if they are defective , the discredit should attach to himself alone . The particular property in the rest of the poem , belonging to each author , it would be endless to particularize . Notice is taken in the notes of many errors , the principal of which is the subject of the fourth canto . The few notes marked E. , were found among Mr. Eastburn 's papers . The rest have been added by the editor . Plura , quidem , mandare tibi , si quris habebam ; Sed vereor tard causa fuisse mor . Quod si , qu subeunt , tecum , liber , omnia ferres , Sarcina laturo magna futurus eras . The poem , in the main , is still to be considered as having been written three years ago ; when the age of Mr. Eastburn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter had scarce attempted versification , of any kind , from the time when the draught of " Yamoyden " was finished : and nothing but the circumstances he has stated , could have induced him to resume the practice , or appear as the author of a poem . As to his individual reputation , on that score , he believes , he is sincerely and perfectly indifferent : but it would be folly to deny , that he could not , without pain , see this joint production , now consecrated in his memory by the death of his friend , meet with unfair criticism or sullen neglect . November 20th , 1820 . PROEM . Go FORTH , sad fragments of a broken strain , The last that either bard shall e'er essay ! The hand can ne'er attempt the chords again , That first awoke them , in a happier day : Where sweeps the ocean breeze its desert way , His requiem murmurs o'er the moaning wave ; And he who feebly now prolongs the lay , Shall ne'er the minstrel 's hallowed honours crave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave ! Friend of my youth , with thee began the love Of sacred song ; the wont , in golden dreams , Mid classic realms of splendours past to rove , O'er haunted steep , and by immortal streams ; Where the blue wave , with sparkling bosom gleams Round shores , the mind 's eternal heritage , For ever lit by memory 's twilight beams ; Where the proud dead , that live in storied page , Beckon , with awful port , to glory 's earlier age . There would we linger oft , entranc 'd , to hear , O'er battle fields , the epic thunders roll ; Or list , where tragic wail upon the ear , Through Argive palaces shrill echoing , stole ; There would we mark , uncurbed by all control , In central heaven , the Theban eagle 's flight ; Or hold communion with the musing soul Of sage or bard , who sought , mid pagan night , In lov 'd Athenian groves , for truth 's eternal light . Homeward we turned , to that fair land , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Where mystery , brooding o'er the waters , sate And kept the key , till three millenniums past ; When , as creation 's noblest work was last , Latest , to man it was vouchsafed , to see Nature 's great wonder , long by clouds o'ercast , And veiled in sacred awe , that it might be An empire and a home , most worthy for the free . And here , forerunners strange and meet were found , Of that bless 'd freedom , only dreamed before ;  --  Dark were the morning mists , that lingered round Their birth and story , as the hue they bore . " Earth was their mother ; "  --  or they knew no more , Or would not that their secret should be told ; For they were grave and silent ; and such lore , To stranger ears , they loved not to unfold , The long-transmitted tales their sires were taught of old . Kind nature 's commoners , from her they drew Their needful wants , and learn 'd not how to hoard ; And him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no servile reverence , as their lord . And on their mountain summits they adored One great , good Spirit , in his high abode , And thence their incense and orisons poured To his pervading presence , that abroad They felt through all his works ,  --  their Father , King , and God . And in the mountain mist , the torrent 's spray , The quivering forest , or the glassy flood , Soft falling showers , or hues of orient day , They imaged spirits beautiful and good ; But when the tempest roared , with voices rude , Or fierce , red lightning fired the forest pine , Or withering heats untimely seared the wood , The angry forms they saw of powers malign ; These they besought to spare , those blest for aid divine . As the fresh sense of life , through every vein , With the pure air they drank , inspiring came , Comely they grew , patient of toil and pain , And as the fleet deer 's agile was their frame ; Of meaner vices scarce they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to son ,  --  To reverence age ,  --  the sluggish hunter 's shame , And craven warrior 's infamy to shun ,  --  And still avenge each wrong , to friends or kindred done . From forest shades they peered , with awful dread , When , uttering flame and thunder from its side , The ocean-monster , with broad wings outspread , Came ploughing gallantly the virgin tide . Few years have pass 'd , and all their forests ' pride From shores and hills has vanished , with the race , Their tenants erst , from memory who have died , Like airy shapes , which eld was wont to trace , In each green thicket 's depths , and lone , sequestered place . And many a gloomy tale , tradition yet Saves from oblivion , of their struggles vain , Their prowess and their wrongs , for rhymer meet , To people scenes , where still their names remain ; And so began our young , delighted strain , That would evoke the plumed chieftains brave , And bid their martial hosts arise again , Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's romantic steeps are piled above the wave . Friend of my youth ! with thee began my song , And o'er thy bier its latest accents die ; Misled in phantom-peopled realms too long ,  --  Though not to me the muse averse deny , Sometimes , perhaps , her visions to descry , Such thriftless pastime should with youth be o'er ; And he who loved with thee his notes to try , But for thy sake , such idlesse would deplore , And swears to meditate the thankless muse no more . But , no ! the freshness of the past shall still Sacred to memory 's holiest musings be ; When through the ideal fields of song , at will , He roved and gathered chaplets wild with thee ; When , reckless of the world , alone and free , Like two proud barks , we kept our careless way , That sail by moonlight o'er the tranquil sea ; Their white apparel and their streamers gay , Bright gleaming o'er the main , beneath the ghostly ray ;  --  And downward , far , reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackling sees ; So buoyant , they do seem to float in air , And silently obey the noiseless breeze ; Till , all too soon , as the rude winds may please , They part for distant ports : the gales benign Swift wafting , bore , by Heaven 's all-wise decrees , To its own harbour sure , where each divine And joyous vision , seen before in dreams , is thine . Muses of Helicon ! melodious race Of Jove and golden-haired Mnemosyn ; Whose art from memory blots each sadder trace , And drives each scowling form of grief away ! Who , round the violet fount , your measures gay Once trod , and round the altar of great Jove ; Whence , wrapt in silvery clouds , your nightly way Ye held , and ravishing strains of music wove , That soothed the Thunderer 's soul , and filled his courts above . Bright choir ! with lips untempted , and with zone Sparkling , and unapproached by touch profane ; Ye , to whose gladsome bosoms ne'er was known The blight of sorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if right the elected swain , On your own mountain 's side ye taught of yore , Whose honoured hand took not your gift in vain , Worthy the budding laurel-bough it bore ,  --  Footnote : 1Kb Farewell ! a long farewell ! I worship you no more . INTRODUCTION . Stat vetus et multos incdua sylva per annos . Credibile est illi numen inesse loco . Hark to that shriek upon the summer blast ! Wildly it swells the fitful gusts between , And as its dying echoes faint have pass 'd , Sad moans the night-wind o'er the troubled scene . Sunk is the day , obscured the valleys green ; Nor moon nor stars are glimmering in the sky , Thick veiled behind their tempest-gathered screen ; Lost in deep shades the hills and waters lie ; Whence rose that boding scream , that agonizing cry ? Spirit of Eld ! who , on thy moss-clad throne , Record'st the actions of the mighty dead ; By whom the secrets of the past are known , And all oblivion 's spell-bound volume read ;  --  Sleep wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but idle fancy 's mockery vain , Who loves the mists of wonder round to spread ? No ! ' t is a sound of sadder , sterner strain , Spirit of by-gone years , that haunts thine ancient reign ! ' T is the death wail of a departed race ,  --  Long vanished hence , unhonoured in their grave ; Their story lost to memory , like the trace That to the greensward erst their sandals gave ;  --  Wail for the feather-cinctured warriors brave , Who , battling for their fathers ' empire well , Perished , when valour could no longer save From soulless bigotry , and avarice fell , That tracked them to the death , with mad , infuriate yell . Spirit of Eld ! inspire one generous verse , The unpractised minstrel 's tributary song ; Mid these thine ancient groves he would rehearse The closing story of their sachem 's wrong .

CANTO FIRST . I. The morning air was freshly breathing , The morning mists were wildly wreathing ; Day 's earliest beams were kindling o'er The wood-crowned hills and murmuring shore . ' T was summer ; and the forests threw Their checkered shapes of varying hue , In mingling , changeful shadows seen , O'er hill and bank , and headland green . Blithe birds were carolling on high Their matin music to the sky , As glanced their brilliant hues along , Filling the groves with life and song ; All innocent and wild and free Their sweet , ethereal minstrelsy . The dew-drop sparkled on the spray , Danced on the wave the inconstant ray ; And moody grief , with dark control , There only swayed the human soul ! II .

Left to the troublous thoughts that rose To bar her wearied frame 's repose , Sad Nora , in her guardian 's care , Had pass 'd , in penitence and prayer , The hours , till evening round descended , And forests , shores , and waters blended , In her pale , misty light : The tenants of the wigwam slept , And silently their prisoner crept Forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wistful eye , As now the moon , through clouds on high , Climbed near her central height ; The wind , careering o'er the sky , Scattered the rack confusedly ; One moment all was bright , The next with shadows overspread ; And dark the forests waved their head ; And dark each scene that lay beneath The inconstant heaven 's uncertain wreath , Arose upon her sight . II . And now the hour was near , she knew , When , to his love and promise true , Yamoyden from the mount would speed , To seek his desolated cot ; It was in vain she mused , and sought The morning 's dark events to read , That tore her thence away From all she loved , in danger 's hour , And to the gloomy ruffian 's power Consigned her child a prey . She only saw her husband , reft Of all that fate unkind had left , Roam through the forest , lost and wild , Calling on Nora and her child ;  --  And then she thought upon the brave , Doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning voice might save . III . Unconscious where her footsteps strayed , She roved through many a darksome glade , Till , far from the forsaken glen , She knew her morning 's road agen . She marked it by a lonely mound , Raised by the traveller 's pious hand , That told , in its deserted ground , Slept the dead heroes of the land ; Dead , ere upon the verdant strand The invader 's hostile feet were found ; Now sleeping , nameless , and alone , Beneath that heap of rugged stone . Onward through thick embowering wood , Her lonely journey sped ; Deep was the tangled solitude That round the wanderer spread . Onward she went , till wild and rude , The tempest burst in wrathful mood , Careering o'er her head . Withdrawn was now the silver ray ; The lightning 's momentary play A ruddier splendour shed ; Then midnight blackness round was cast ; Nor longer could the path be traced , And roving wild she fled . IV . Yamoyden rushed in that same hour Forth from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should struggle with the severing tide , So near , yet so remote ! Like sailors of some perished bark , Struggling mid billows vexed and dark ; While howls so loud the storm 's career , Each other 's screams they can not hear , Nor catch one dying note ; While but a single wave disparts Those gallant , lost , and faithful hearts ! V. Soon reason left her mind again ; There seemed a gulf of thoughts and pain Roaring around her harassed brain , Where nought distinct arose ; She knew not why she wandered there , Nor heard the sound that rent the air , Nor felt the tempest 's throes . It seemed as if , in murmurs nigh , Throbbed on her ear some melody , She once had loved and sung ; And well-known voices whispered near , Even to her darkling memory dear ; And then a moment thundered by The elemental revelry , And deafening round her rung . But when to consciousness once more She waked , she marked the billows roar , With troubled hue and sullen dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ceased its maddening rage , And on her clouded pilgrimage The moon was slowly riding ; High , mid the fringings of the storm , She showed , half hid , her lucid form , The scene of tumult chiding . VI . New terror blanched her pallid brow , When o'er her path a stranger cross 'd , With wildered air , and footsteps slow , As one in moody musings lost . It was a red man she espied , And , on her nearer view , Her kind deliverer and her guide The trembling lady knew . The bold Mohegan shrunk to see So wan , so fair a form as she ; In white was robed her slender frame , And needs , he thought , a spirit came ; A spirit more beautiful than e'er Had visited this gloomy sphere . Her tremulous voice dissolved his spell ; " Mysterious friend ? " she cried , " O tell , Since life thou gavest me , where are those , My husband and my infant where ,  --  Without whom life is hard to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn from home away ? At whose command ,  --  and wherefore  --  say . " " Such oft thy question , " said the chief , " Amid the darkness of thy grief . Then vain my words to reach thine ear ; For it was closed ; and I could hear Thy converse with the spirits near . Christian , than this I know no more ,  --  ' T was Metacom 's command that bore Thy child to Pawkanawkut 's shore . And thou with him hadst gone ; but I Sought from his feeble cause to fly , And thought that through thyself , for me , Peace with thy brethren there might be : Nor other aim had then , to save Thy form from bondage or the grave . Of Uncas ' race am I , who ne'er Aught heeded woman 's idle tear .

" " I saw him , as his swift canoe , Hours since , towards the mountain flew . I marked him , through the mists and gloom : I knew him by his eagle plume , And by his woven mantle red ; " " And thou wilt serve me ,  --  thou hast said ? O then conduct me there ! And I will call on heaven to shed Its choicest blessings o'er thy head , Even with my dying prayer .

His boat was nigh ; its fragile side Boldly the venturous wanderer tried ; Along they shot o'er the murmuring bay , As they bore for the adverse bank away . I guess it was a full strange sight , To see in the track of the ghostly light , The swarthy chief and the lady bright , O'er the heaving waves borne on ; While her white wan cheek and robe of white The pale ray played upon ; And above his dusky plumage shook ; Backward was flung his feathery cloak , As his brawny arms were stretched to ply The oars that made their shallop fly :  --  I ween that he who had seen them ride , As they rose in turn o'er the bellying tide , Had deemed it a vision of olden time , Of Afric wizard in fary clime ; In durance dread , by sorceries dark , Who wafted a lady in magic bark . And all above , and around them , save Where the quivering beam was on the wave , Was dubious light , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The snowy foam on the billow lay , Then sunk in the black abyss away ; The rack went scudding before the blast , And its gloom o'er the bay came swift and pass 'd ; Flittingly gleamed the silvery streak , On the waving hills and mountain peak ; But the star of love looked out in the west , As if that lone lady 's path she bless 'd . VIII . Swift , where the midway current swept , His pirogue 's course Ahauton kept ; And soon , upon the opposing shore , They saw their skiff securely moor ; And Nora knelt upon the sand , And bless 'd her God 's directing hand ; Then on their course they bent ; Tall rocks in rude disorder piled , Frowned o'er the bank sublimely wild ; Where fancy 's eye , at dusky hour , Might image citadel and tower . And o'er the margin where they hung , The fir from frequent fissure sprung ; Here , bending as it strove to lave Its branches in the passing wave ; There , perched on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy pride , alone . IX . She marked them not ; nor , farther still , Succeeding to that broken hill , Where wide the landscape lay ; Nor paused they where an ancient wood , In dark repose , and silent , stood ; Beyond its awful solitude , The twain pursued their way . Now , by the margin of the cove , In rugged , winding path they rove . She only looked , where , broad and high , Mount Haup arose in majesty ; Lifting , through forests brown , its head , Where the gray cliffs their rampart spread ; Their moss-clad brows the chroniclers Of time , for many a thousand years , That here , unstoried , came and went ; Aloft they stood , like battlement Of Spirit 's castle ; as if there , The wandering hosts of upper air , In fleecy vapour oft revealed , Nightly their spectral wassail held . X. And now , through wet and tangled ground , Their pathway to the mountain wound . The moon 's last rays were trembling o'er The hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faintly bright , they rest Upon the summit 's naked breast ; Checker the thickets on its side , Shed filmy lines along the tide ; On distant bank and rock and isle , Gleam with their melancholy smile ; They tip the farthest hills that bound The fading landscape glimmering round ; Fringe the deep clouds with parting light , Then fail , and all is lost in night . XI . In darkness and in doubt , they tried The rising mountain 's rugged side ; Rude and uneasy its ascent , To one with toil and grief o'erspent . She heard the startled fox 's cry , Pass with its sudden wailing nigh ; The wolf 's sad howl came frequent by ; But human voice was heard not there ; ' T was lone and mournful as despair ;  --  No watchfire shot its gleams afar , Nor woke the red man 's song of war ;  --  If warriors in these shades reposed , All was in utter silence closed . XII . Pass 'd is the long and rocky slope ; She stands upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flings O'er the bleak height its humid wings , Freshening across the eastern bay , The signal of approaching day . And faintly , in the distant sky , A gray beam stole on Nora 's eye ; Dimly morn 's struggling herald kiss 'd The foldings of the billowy mist , And fell upon the waves below , With soft and melancholy glow . XIII . Here the Mohegan paused ; he bent Northward , awhile , his gaze intent ; As if he marked , mid glooms below , The haunts where lay ensnared his foe . Troubled he seemed , as one who doth A task , to which his will is loath , But feels some fatal power control , As with resistless whirl , the soul . " Christian , " he cried , " I leave thee here , Where danger 's course thou needst not fear . He , who my brother slew , lies there ! As it were shame beyond repair , If any but my father 's son , The murderer 's scalp in battle won ! I would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guilty head ; But the red bolt , once launched , must fall In wrath and ruin upon all . I go ; but when the strife is past , And the proud king lies cold at last , When the foul birds shall downward sweep , And forth the wolves on carnage peep , Then mayst thou hence descend , to save With thy sweet prayers the captive brave ; Bid the stained hand of slaughter stay The axe impending o'er its prey ; Perchance Yamoyden rescue ,  --  nay ! Now , vain thy farther journeying were . Farewell ! I leave thee thus alone , But when my destined work is done , His life shall be my dearest care . " XIV . Silent and swift the chief departed ; Dark o'er the bosom of the hill , Along the rocks she marked him steal , Then in the thicket 's depths he darted ; And she was left , alone to feel The sad impatience that would see The measure of its misery ; That hath , in man , nor hope nor friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervently the lone one prayed , In this her trying hour for aid .

Sad rose the morning ; not in bloom Awakening radiant from the gloom ; All nature gladdening as it spread , And light , and life , and glory shed ; Not sporting on the gentle gale , That floats o'er stream and dewy vale ; Not bursting mid the kindling heaven , Its hues in gold and purple given ;  --  For now , in dreary twilight lay The scene beneath its mantle gray : Mute was the melody of morn , And hushed was nature 's harp forlorn . Alone , above the vaporous clouds , That hung , with mournful hue , like shrouds , O'er every distant peak , Rose a faint line , as morning here Thro ' the dark hosts her flag would rear , The coming day to speak . Purple it seemed , yet lost and blending , With the dull hues around ascending ; And a soft roseate tint was seen , At intervals , the shades between ; As changeful , as unfixed it spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the light of day uprose , Those transient tints of beauty close ; In volumes dense , o'er earth and main , Descend the wreathing mists again ; Pocasset 's long and verdant coast In that unwelcome veil was lost , With sweep of hills and forests wide , And sparkling waves between that glide ; Where , glancing o'er the sunny isles , That stud the water 's dimpling smiles , The eye might ocean 's breast explore , Or scan the western streams that pour Their tides on Narraganset 's shore ; Or upward , to Patuxet 's side , Extend the tribute of their pride . But now the scene had narrow bound , And scarce the mountain 's base beyond , Was aught distinctly seen : Strange were the shapes that seemed to rise Imperfectly upon the eyes ; And wildered fancy here might form The awful Spirit of the storm , In all his terrors dress 'd ; Stretching his giant arms abroad , And throned where footsteps never trod ; Or high in gloomy car upborne , Rushing to combat with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End note : 8Kb Still as she gazed with anxious eye , The expected battle to descry , The breeze with murmurs low that sighed , Came freshening from the eastern tide , And swept the brooding mists away , That o'er the northern prospect lay . Rocks , woods , and swamps arose to view , Though yet o'erhung with vapoury hue And eastward , dimly mid the trees , The English forms and arms she sees ; Low couched beneath the forest shade , Round lay their silent ambuscade . Prostrate the moveless band she spied ; An Indian by a white man 's side , Alternate placed , was crouching seen , Skirting the borders of the fen . XVII . Intently as she gazed , agen , Elsewhere , she marked where armd men Westward were hid , in ambush close , From where a swelling upland rose . That knoll a practised eye alone The haunt of savages had known ; For the rude sconce , around it reared , Like thicket 's tangled growth appeared .

XVIII . As Nora marked them , from the knoll , With wary steps an Indian stole ; And seemed it , that the thicket 's screen Kept from his glance the foe unseen . For forth he gazed ; and though in sad And dusky livery morn was clad , Nature 's free kingdom seemed to yield A transport through his heart that thrilled . He leap 'd for joyance ; when a flame Bright from the ambushed thicket came ; The death-ball whizzed , with angry knell , And from the rampart wild he fell . XIX . Then , as that signal 's echoes rung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon their shot the ambush sent ; Innocuous o'er the foe it went . But the dun smoke that upward flew , The fortress veiled from Nora 's view , Till , as the breezes slowly bear Its volumes through the drizzly air , She marked the assaulted Indians glide Forth from their bulwark 's eastward side ,  --  Unclosed , that timely they might gain The marsh ; disordered ran the train ; The dark morass they hurried through , Ever low-bending as they flew , Where sinking soil , and bush and tree , Might best their screen and shelter be . And issuing from the forest 's verge , Swift on their track the foemen urge ; As beagles to the death-scent true , They rushed , and as remorseless too ;  --  The English , for their brethren 's blood ,  --  Mohegans , for their ancient feud ,  --  Seaconets , too , by treachery base , Who hoped to win the conquerors ' grace ;  --  How weak the web that treason wove , When ruin followed if it throve ! XX . Then rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians ' rout : And their mad yell of fear and wrath , As the shot whistled o'er their path ; And flame and smoke , far scattering , met The lady 's glance , who lingered yet Above ;  --  but then a film came o'er Her sight , and she beheld no more . A husband 's death-cry in her ear Came sadly , wildly ringing near ; And from the mountain steep she sped , Unknowing where her pathway led . XXI . With that abrupt and steep descent , Her senses reeled , her breath was spent ; But she was borne , in her giddy way , To where the eastern ambush lay . They marked her not , though near she came ; Fixed was their gaze , intent their aim , Where , lost in their uncertain dread , A band confused of Indians fled , Toward the forest bound ; Quick paused they in their progress rash , The thicket kindled with the flash , And rung the musket sound . Staggered , dismayed , the wildered band ; Some idly drew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through The arrowy shower in mockery flew ; A few their deadlier arms employ , But now as powerless to destroy ; Then scattering , as the allied force Uprose and urged upon their course . Swift o'er the fen they fly ; Yet Nora heard , above the rout , The vollying shot and scream and shout , Old Annawan 's war-cry . He strove , with cheer , reproach , and threat , His naked band to rally yet , And yet the unequal conflict wage ; But vain , stout heart ! thy gallant rage , That well , on this sad field , became The trophies of thine ancient fame ! XXII . Thus from the covert where she stood , Vanished the motley multitude ; One only here erect remained , And moveless ; one alone disdained To gnaw the toils his hunters spread , But reared at bay his monarch head . A white man and an Indian near , Fronted and stayed his bold career ; And scarce their muskets ' length apart , Stood , levelling at the warrior 's heart . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the twain he fixed his eye , Fierce as the pouncing falcon 's glance ; His battle-axe he brandished high ; Else all unarmed . An instant there Paused in their purposed work the pair ; So proud , in his defenceless state , And terrible , he seemed to wait , Himself to death to dedicate ! Trembling , the white man first gave fire , But saw in faithless flash expire The engine 's fatal store ; " Thine is the chance the prize to gain , "  --  He said , but spoke no more , Ere , hurled with dexterous hand amain , Sunk the fell tomahawk in his brain , And down , a ghastly corse , he fell ! Then straight a loud and joyous yell His Indian comrade gave : " A ghost had been incensed , " he cried , " If thou by other arm had'st died ! This , from his gory grave , Sends Agamoun ! " he said , and true , On their swift wings , the death balls flew . A moment yet the Sachem stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward gushed the vital blood And his attempted words suppress 'd . Ahauton marked his dying look , Speaking its stern and sad rebuke ; Then in the moor 's dank , miry bed , Deep fell the indignant chieftain , dead ! XXIII .

Amid a roving band , alone , Her father in the fen was thrown , Now feeble waxed with age and toil ; And scarce upon the slippery soil He kept his footing ; while he held , With strength surpassing that of eld , The ruffian host at bay ; A well-known voice salutes her ear , E'en in that hurried scene most dear ; A well-known form she marked among That haggard , fierce , and desperate throng , Round , howling for their prey ; And , o'er her father 's white hairs swung , As high a murderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm ; alas ! too late To break the blow , impelled by fate ! Averted from the old man 's head , On his own faithful breast it fell ! A rescue comes ,  --  the Indians fled ,  --  Far off the sounds of conflict swell ;  --  But never more , on battle field , That valiant arm shall weapon wield ; Nor , mid the combat 's voices blending , His cheering cry be heard ascending ! XXIV . Dying he lay ; and o'er him bent Fitzgerald , now with kind intent . As ebbed the living current fleet , He whispered soothing comfort sweet , Fraught with such heavenly nourishment , Such chrism to the departing soul , As amber gum to feverish vein ; End note : 1Kb Deep in the mental wound it stole , Forgotten then his mortal pain .

Hearts , long in grief and danger tried , Relenting death will ne'er divide ! " XXV . Thus faintly murmuring , by his side Exhausted sunk his faithful bride . She strove , with her long locks unbound , To stanch the grim and ghastly wound ; Her husband 's arms , with dying grasp , Her lovely , wasted form enclasp ; Her constant bosom to his breast Closer and closer still he press 'd ; Her gaze met his , where every ray Of earthly passion pass 'd away ; The glance of love , that conquers time , Was blent with confidence sublime ; As if on their departing view , With heaven , that love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed Aside the tears that freely gushed . " Farewell , misguided one ! " he said ,  --  " Dim light along thy path was shed ; There may be mercy , even for thee ! Thy child ; may heaven to me Be kind as I to him shall be ! May this thy parting hour be sweet ; Thy wounded conscience healed ; With unction of the Paraclete , Thy soul 's salvation sealed ; And may thy parted spirit meet Thy Saviour 's form revealed . " XXVI . The old man 's glance was heavenward cast , As breathed that wish , the best , the last , And strong and fervent was his prayer , Communing with his Father there . He viewed them as they lay reclined , Their lips conjoint , their forms entwined . They moved not , heaved not , breathed not , yet It seemed the lovers ' glances met . He knelt , he strove his child to raise , But vain the task the sire essays ; He felt no struggle ; caught no sound ; But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain were all endeavour , With aught that sacred clasp to sever , Save sacrilegious knife ; The father gazed in anguish wild ,  --  He press 'd the bosom of his child ,  --  There beat no pulse of life ! CONCLUSION . Sad was the theme , which yet to try we chose , In pleasant moments of communion sweet ; When least we thought of earth 's unvarnished woes , And least we dreamed , in fancy 's fond deceit , That either the cold grasp of death should meet , Till after many years , in ripe old age ; Three little summers flew on pinions fleet , And thou art living but in memory 's page , And earth seems all to me a worthless pilgrimage . Sad was our theme ; but well the wise man sung , " Better than festal halls , the house of wo ; " ' T is good to stand destruction 's spoils among , And muse on that sad bourne to which we go . The heart grows better when tears freely flow ; And , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves we know , Our weakness and our vanity ,  --  is worth Years of unmeaning smiles , and lewd , obstreperous mirth . ' T is good to muse on nations passed away , For ever , from the land we call our own ; Nations , as proud and mighty in their day , Who deemed that everlasting was their throne . An age went by , and they no more were known ! Sublimer sadness will the mind control , Listening time 's deep and melancholy moan ; And meaner griefs will less disturb the soul ; And human pride falls low , at human grandeur 's goal . Philip ! farewell ! thee King , in idle jest , Thy persecutors named ; and if in deed , The jewelled diadem thy front had press 'd , It had become thee better , than the breed Of palaces , to sceptres that succeed , To be of courtier or of priest the tool , Satiate dull sense , or count the frequent bead , Or pamper gormand hunger ; thou wouldst rule Better than the worn rake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wrong thy warrior shade , could I Aught in my verse or make or mar thy fame ; As the light carol of a bird flown by , Will pass the youthful strain that breathed thy name : But in that land whence thy destroyers came , A sacred bard thy champion shall be found ; He of the laureate wreath for thee shall claim The hero 's honours , to earth 's farthest bound , Where Albion 's tongue is heard , or Albion 's songs resound .

Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : DREAM OF THE PRINCESS PAPANTZIN. from The writings ( 1835 ) Mexitlis ' power was at its topmost pride ; The name was terrible from sea to sea ; From mountains , where the tameless Ottomite Maintained his savage freedom , to the shores Of wild Higueras . Through the nations passed , As stalks the angel of the pestilence , The great king 's messengers . They marked the young , The brave and beautiful , and bore them on For their foul sacrifices . Terror went Before the tyrant 's heralds . Grief and wrath Remained behind their steps ; but they were dumb . He was as God . Yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trembling with fear of dangers long foretold In ancient prophecies , and now announced By signs in heaven and portents upon earth ; By the reluctant voices of pale priests ; By the grave looks of solemn counsellors ; But chief , by sickening heaviness of heart That told of evil , dimly understood , But evil which must come . With face obscured , And robed in night the giant phantom rose , Of his great empire 's ruin , and his own . Happier , though guiltier , he , before whose glance Of reckless triumph , moved the spectral Hand , That traced the unearthly characters of fate . ' T was then , one eve , when o'er the imperial lake And all its cities , glittering in their pomp , The lord of glory threw his parting smiles , In Tlatelolco 's palace , in her bower , Papantzin lay reclined ; sister of him At whose name monarchs trembled . Yielding there To musings various , o'er her senses crept Or sleep , or kindred death . It seemed she stood In an illimitable plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'erwearied sight ; in contrast strange With that rich vale , where only she had dwelt , Whose everlasting mountains , girdling it , As in a chalice held a kingdom 's wealth ; Their summits freezing , where the eagle tired , But found no resting-place . Papantzin looked On endless barrenness , and walked perplexed Through the dull haze , along the boundless heath , Like some lone ghost in Mictlan 's cheerless gloom Debarred from light and glory . Wandering thus She came where a great sullen river poured Its turbid waters with a rushing sound Of painful moans ; as if the inky waves Were hastening still on their complaining course To escape the horrid solitudes . Beyond What seemed a highway ran , with branching paths Innumerous . This to gain , she sought to plunge Straight in the troubled stream . For well she knew To shun with agile limbs the current 's force , Nor feared the noise of waters . She had played From infancy in her fair native lake , Amid the gay plumed creatures floating round , Wheeling or diving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they . A vision stayed her purpose . By her side Stood a bright youth ; and startling , as she gazed On his effulgence , every sense was bound In pleasing awe and in fond reverence . For not Tezcatlipoca , as he shone Upon her priest-led fancy , when from heaven By filmy thread sustained he came to earth , In his resplendent mail reflecting all Its images , with dazzling portraiture , Was , in his radiance and immortal youth A peer to this new god .  --  His stature was Like that of men ; but matched with his , the port Of kings all dreaded was the crouching mien Of suppliants at their feet . Serene the light That floated round him , as the lineaments It cased with its mild glory . Gravely sweet The impression of his features , which to scan Their lofty loveliness forbade : His eyes She felt , but saw not : only , on his brow  --  From over which , encircled by what seemed A ring of liquid diamond , in pure light Revolving ever , backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brow She marked a Cross described ; and lowly bent She knew not wherefore , to the sacred sign . From either shoulder mantled o'er his front Wings dropping feathery silver ; and his robe Snow-white in the still air was motionless , As that of chiselled god , or the pale shroud Of some fear-conjured ghost . Her hand he took And led her passive o'er the naked banks Of that black stream , still murmuring angrily . But , as he spoke , she heard its moans no more ; His voice seemed sweeter than the hymnings raised By brave and gentle souls in Paradise , To celebrate the outgoing of the sun , On his majestic progress over heaven . " Stay , princess , " thus he spoke , " thou mayest not yet O'erpass these waters . Though thou knowest it not , Nor Him , God loves thee . " So he led her on , Unfainting , amid hideous sights and sounds ; For now , o'er scattered sculls and grisly bones They walked ; while underneath , before , behind , Rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish , screams of agony , And melancholy sighs , and the fierce yell Of hopeless and intolerable pain . Shuddering , as , in the gloomy whirlwind 's pause , Through the malign , distempered atmosphere , The second circle 's purple blackness , passed The pitying Florentine , who saw the shades Of poor Francesca and her paramour ,  --  The princess o'er the ghastly relics stepped , Listening the frightful clamour ; till a gleam , Whose sickly and phosphoric lustre seemed Kindled from these decaying bones , lit up The sable river . Then a pageant came Over its obscure tides , of stately barks , Gigantic , with their prows of quaint device , Tall masts , and ghostly canvass , huge and high , Hung in the unnatural light and lifeless air . Grim bearded men , with stern and angry looks Strange robes , and uncouth armour , stood behind Their galleries and bulwarks . One ship bore A broad sheet pendant , where inwrought with gold She marked the symbol that adorned the brow Of her mysterious guide . Down the dark stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flickering and fading . Louder then uprose The roar of voices from the accursed strand , Until in tones , solemn and sweet , again Her angel-leader spoke . " Princess , God wills That thou shouldst live , to testify on earth What changes are to come ; and in the world Where change comes never , live , when earth and all Its changes shall have passed like earth away . " The cries that pierced thy soul and chilled thy veins Are those of thy tormented ancestors . Nor shall their torment cease ; for God is just . Foredoomed ,  --  since first from Atzlan led to rove , Following in quest of change , their kindred tribes ,  --  Where'er they rested , with foul sacrifice They stained the shuddering earth . Their monuments By blood cemented , after ages passed With idle wonder or fantastic guess , The traveller shall behold . For broken , then , Like their own ugly idols , buried , burnt , Their fragments spurned for every servile use , Trampled and scattered to the reckless winds , The records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and untamed pride , They lived and died condemned ; whether they dwelt Outcasts , upon a soil that was not theirs , All steril as it was , and won by stealth Food from the slimy margent of the lake , And digged the earth for roots and unclean worms ; Or served in bondage to another race , Who loved them not . Driven forth , they wandered then In miserable want , until they came Where from the thriftless rock the nopal grew , On which the hungry eagle perched and screamed , And founded Tenochtitlan ; rearing first With impious care , a cabin for their god Huitzilopochtli , and with murderous rites Devoting to his guardianship themselves And all their issue . Quick the nopal climbed , Its harsh and bristly growth towering o'er all The vale of Anahuac . Far for his prey , And farther still the ravenous eagle flew ; And still with dripping beak but thirst unslaked With savage cries wheeled home . Nine kings have reigned , Their records blotted and besmeared with blood So thick that none may read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridors Of their abominable piles , upreared In the face of heaven , and naked to the sun , More blood has flowed than would have filled the lakes O'er which , enthroned midst carnage , they have sat , Heaping their treasures for the stranger 's spoil . Prodigious cruelty and waste of life , Unnatural riot and blaspheming pride ,  --  All that God hates ,  --  and all that tumbles down Great kingdoms and luxurious commonwealths After long centuries waxing all corrupt ,  --  In their brief annals aggregated , forced , And monstrous , are compressed . And now the cup Of wrath is full ; and now the hour has come . Nor yet unwarned shall judgment overtake The tribes of Aztlan , and in chief their lords Mexitlis ' blind adorers . As to one Who feels his inward malady remain , Howe'er health 's seeming mocks his destiny , In gay or serious mood the thought of death Still comes obtrusive ; so old prophecy From age to age preserved , has told thy race How strangers , from beyond the rising sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to possess their lands , and hold Them and their children in long servitude . " Thou shalt bear record that the hour is nigh . The white and bearded men whose grim array Swept o'er thy sight , are those who are to come , And with strong arms and wisdom stronger far , Strange beasts obedient to their masters ' touch , And engines hurling death , with Fate to aid , Shall wrest the sceptre from the Azteques ' line , And lay their temples flat . Horrible war , Rapine and murder and destruction wild Shall hurry like the whirlwind o'er the land . Yet with the avengers come the word of peace ; With the destroyers comes the bread of life ; And , as the wind-god in thine idle creed , Opens a passage with his boisterous breath Through which the genial waters over earth Shed their reviving showers ; so , when the storm Of war has pass 'd , rich dews of heavenly grace Shall fall on flinty hearts . And thou , the flower , Which , when huge cedars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hurricane shall leave unharmed , thou , then , Shalt be the first to lift thy drooping head Renewed , and cleansed from every former stain . " The fables of thy people teach , that when The deluge drowned mankind , and one sole pair In fragile bark preserved , escaped and climbed The steeps of Colhuacan , daughters and sons Were born to them , who knew not how to frame Their simplest thoughts in speech ; till from the grove A dove poured forth , in regulated sounds , Each varied form of language . Then they spake , Though neither by another understood . But thou shalt then hear of that Holiest Dove , Which is the Spirit of the Eternal God . When all was void and dark , he moved above Infinity ; and from beneath his wings Earth and the waters and the islands rose ; The air was quickened , and the world had life . Then all the lamps of heaven began to shine , And man was made to gaze upon their fires . " Among thy fathers ' visionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelt A woman , holy and devout , who kept The temple pure , and to its platform saw A globe of emerald plumes descend from heaven . Placing it in her bosom to adorn Her idol 's sanctuary ( so the tale Runs ) , she conceived , and bore Mexitli . He , When other children had assailed her life , Sprang into being , all equipped for war ; His green plumes dancing in their circlet bright , Like sheaf of sun-lit spray cresting the bed Of angry torrents . Round , as Tonatiuh Flames in mid-heaven , his golden buckler shone ; Like nimble lightning flashed his dreadful lance ; And unrelenting vengeance in his eyes Blazed with its swarthy lustre . He , they tell , Led on their ancestors ; and him the god Of wrath and terror , with the quivering hearts And mangled limbs of myriads , and the stench Of blood-washed shrines and altars they appease . But then shall be revealed to thee the name And vision of a virgin undefiled , Embalmed in holy beauty , in whose eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none might gaze in their pure spheres and feel One earth-born longing . Over her the Dove Hung , and th ' Almighty power came down . She bore In lowliness , and as a helpless babe , Heir to man 's sorrows and calamities , His great Deliverer , Conqueror of Death ; And thou shalt learn , how when in years he grew Perfect , and fairer than the sons of men , And in that purifying rite partook Which thou shalt share , as from his sacred locks The glittering waters dropped , high over head The azure vault was opened , and that Dove Swiftly , serenely floating downwards , stretched His silvery pinions o'er the anointed Lord , Sprinkling celestial dews . And thou shalt hear How , when the Sacrifice for man had gone In glory home , as his chief messengers Were met in council , on a mighty wind The Dove was borne among them ; on each brow A forked tongue of fire unquenchable lit ; And , as the lambent points shot up and waved , Strange speech came to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , with untiring steps , Bore the glad tidings of a world redeemed . " Much more , which now it suits not to rehearse , The princess heard . The historic prophet told Past , Present , Future ,  --  things that since have been , And things that are to come . And , as he ceased , O'er the black river , and the desert plain , As o'er the close of counterfeited scenes , Shown by the buskined muse , a veil came down , Impervious ; and his figure faded swift In the dense gloom . But then , in starlike light , That awful symbol which adorned his brow In size dilating showed : and up , still up , In its clear splendour still the same , though still Lessening , it mounted ; and Papantzin woke . She woke in darkness and in solitude . Slow passed her lethargy away , and long To her half dreaming eye that brilliant sign Distinct appeared . Then damp and close she felt The air around , and knew the poignant smell Of spicy herbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trance Are wont , she would have learned by touch if yet The spirit to the body was allied . Strange hindrances prevented . O'er her face A mask thick-plated lay : and round her swathed Was many a costly and encumbering robe , Such as she wore on some high festival , O'erspread with precious gems , rayless and cold , That now pressed hard and sharp against her touch . The cumbrous collar round her slender neck , Of gold thick studded with each valued stone Earth and the sea-depths yield for human pride  --  The bracelets and the many-twisted rings That girt her taper limbs , coil upon coil  --  What were they in this dungeon 's solitude ? The plumy coronal that would have sprung Light from her fillet in the purer air , Waving in mockery of the rainbow tints , Now drooping low , and steeped in clogging dews , Oppressive hung . Groping in dubious search , She found the household goods , the spindle , broom , Gicalli quaintly sculptured , and the jar That held the useless beverage for the dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attached , the emerald symbol of the soul , In its green life immortal , soon she knew Her dwelling was a sepulchre . She loosed The mask , and from her feathery bier uprose , Casting away the robe , which like long alb Wrapped her ; and with it many an aloe leaf , Inscribed with Azteck characters and signs , To guide the spirit where the Serpent hissed , Hills towered , and deserts spread , and keen winds blew , And many a " Flower of Death ; " though their frail leaves Were yet unwithered . For the living warmth Which in her dwelt , their freshness had preserved ; Else , if corruption had begun its work , The emblems of quick change would have survived Her beauty 's semblance . What is beauty worth , If the cropt flower retains its tender bloom When foul decay has stolen the latest lines Of loveliness in death ? Yet even now Papantzin knew that her exuberant locks  --  Which , unconfined , had round her flowed to earth , Like a stream rushing down some rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of half their waving length ,  --  and liked it not . But through a crevice soon she marked a gleam Of rays uncertain ; and , with staggering steps , But strong in reckless dreaminess , while still Presided o'er the chaos of her thoughts The revelation that upon her soul Dwelt with its power , she gained the cavern 's throat And pushed the quarried stone aside , and stood In the free air , and in her own domain . But now obscurely o'er her vision swam The beauteous landscape , with its thousand tints And changeful views ; long alleys of bright trees Bending beneath their fruits ; espaliers gay With tropic flowers and shrubs that filled the breeze With odorous incense , basins vast , where birds With shining plumage sported , smooth canals Leading the glassy wave , or towering grove Of forest veterans . On a rising bank , Her seat accustomed , near a well hewn out From ancient rocks into which waters gushed From living springs , where she was wont to bathe , She threw herself to muse . Dim on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the broad lake and all its floating isles And glancing shallops , and the gilded pomp Of princely barges , canopied with plumes Spread fanlike , or with tufted pageantry Waving magnificent . Unmarked around The frequent huitzilin , with murmuring hum Of ever-restless wing , and shrill sweet note , Shot twinkling , with the ruby star that glowed Over his tiny bosom , and all hues That loveliest seem in heaven , with ceaseless change , Flashing from his fine films . And all in vain Untiring , from the rustling branches near , Poured the Centzontli all his hundred strains Of imitative melody . Not now She heeded them . Yet pleasant was the shade Of palms and cedars ; and through twining boughs And fluttering leaves , the subtle god of air , The serpent armed with plumes , most welcome crept , And fanned her cheek with kindest ministry . A dull and dismal sound came booming on ; A solemn prolonged , Torturing the unwilling ear , rang dissonant . Again the unnatural thunder rolled along , Again the crash and clamour followed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the dread gong , announced a victim 's heart Torn from his breast , and each triumphant clang , A mangled corse , down the great temple 's stairs Hurled headlong ; and she knew , as lately taught , How vengeance was ordained for cruelty ; How pride would end ; and uncouth soldiers tread Through bloody furrows o'er her pleasant groves And gardens ; and would make themselves a road Over the dead , choking the silver lake , And cast the battered idols down the steps That climbed their execrable towers , and raze Sheer from the ground Ahuitzol 's mighty pile . There had been wail for her in Mexico , And with due rites and royal obsequies , Not without blood at devilish altars shed , She had been numbered with her ancestry . Here when beheld , revisiting the light , Great marvel rose , and greater terror grew , Until the kings came trembling , to receive The fore-shown tidings . To his house of wo Silent and mournful , Moteuczoma went . Few years had passed , when by the rabble hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and on a hasty gibbet reared By the road-side , with scorn and obloquy The brave and gracious Guatemotzin hung ; While to Honduras , thirsting for revenge , And gloomier after all his victories , Stern Cortes stalked . Such was the will of God . And then with holier rites and sacred pomp , Again committed to the peaceful grave , Papantzin slept in consecrated earth .

Thee the old poets , in immortal lays , Adored as universal nature 's rest  --  Peace of the soul , whose influence care obeys , Sore care who listens to no other best ; As still restoring , after anxious days , The limbs and faculties with toil oppress 'd  --  Refitting man his daily race to run Of toil , beneath the ever-travelling sun , Thy charm the skilful as supreme confess Above all alchymy and magic spells ; Of different modes to win thy bland caress , The antique leech in lore black-lettered tells .

Ah ! shouldst thou swerve from truth , all else must part , That yet can feed with life this withered heart ! Whate'er its doubts , its hopes , its fears may be , ' T were , even in madness , faithful still to thee ; And shouldst thou snap that silver chord in twain , The golden bowl no other links sustain ; Crushed in the dust , its fragments then must sink , And the cold earth its latest life-drops drink .

And man himself , in selfish sorrows bound , Heeds not the melancholy ruin round . The crowd 's vain roar still fills the passing breeze , That bends above the tomb the cypress-trees . One only heart , still true in joy or wo , Is all the kindest fates can e'er bestow . If frowning Heaven that heart refuse to give , O , who would ask the ungracious boon  --  to live ?

If e'er I sigh to win the wreaths of fame And write on memory 's scroll a deathless name , ' T is but thy loved , approving smile to meet , And lay the budding laurels at thy feet . If e'er for worldly wealth I heave a sigh , And glittering visions float on fancy 's eye , ' T is but with rosy wreaths thy path to spread , And place the diadem on beauty 's head .

Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : A MONODY MADE ON THE LATE MR . SAMUEL PATCH , BY AN ADMIRER OF THE BATHOS. from The writings ( 1835 ) By water shall he die , and take his end .  --  Shakspeare . Toll for Sam Patch ! Sam Patch , who jumps no more , This or the world to come . Sam Patch is dead ! The vulgar pathway to the unknown shore Of dark futurity , he would not tread . No friends stood sorrowing round his dying bed ; Nor with decorous wo , sedately stepp 'd Behind his corpse , and tears by retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept , In one great wholesale sob , his body drowned and kept . Toll for Sam Patch ! he scorned the common way That leads to fame , up heights of rough ascent , And having heard Pope and Longinus say , That some great men had risen to falls , he went And jumped , where wild Passaic 's waves had rent The antique rocks ;  --  the air free passage gave ,  --  And graciously the liquid element Upbore him , like some sea-god on its wave ; And all the people said that Sam was very brave . Fame , the clear spirit that doth to heaven upraise Led Sam to dive into what Byron calls The hell of waters . For the sake of praise , He wooed the bathos down great water-falls ; The dizzy precipice , which the eye appals Of travellers for pleasure , Samuel found Pleasant , as are to women lighted halls , Crammed full of fools and fiddles ; to the sound Of the eternal roar , he timed his desperate bound . Sam was a fool . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alike absurd , And less sublime . Of fame he soon got much , Where distant cataracts spout , of him men heard . Alas for Sam ! Had he aright preferred The kindly element , to which he gave Himself so fearlessly , we had not heard That it was now his winding-sheet and grave , Nor sung , ' twixt tears and smiles , our requiem for the brave . He soon got drunk , with rum and with renown , As many others in high places do ;  --  Whose fall is like Sam 's last  --  for down and down , By one mad impulse driven , they flounder through The gulf that keeps the future from our view , And then are found not . May they rest in peace ! We heave the sigh to human frailty due  --  And shall not Sam have his ? The muse shall cease To keep the heroic roll , which she began in Greece  --  With demigods , who went to the Black Sea For wool ( and if the best accounts be straight , Came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his pate ) , In which she chronicled the deathless fate Of him who jumped into the perilous ditch Left by Rome 's street commissioners , in a state Which made it dangerous , and by jumping which He made himself renowned , and the contractors rich  --  I say , the muse shall quite forget to sound The chord whose music is undying , if She do not strike it when Sam Patch is drowned . Leander dived for love . Leucadia 's cliff The Lesbian Sappho leapt from in a miff , To punish Phaon ; Icarus went dead , Because the wax did not continue stiff ; And , had he minded what his father said , He had not given a name unto his watery bed . And Helle 's case was all an accident , As everybody knows . Why sing of these ? Nor would I rank with Sam that man who went Down into tna 's womb  --  Empedocles , I think he called himself . Themselves to please , Or else unwillingly , they made their springs ; For glory in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , commons , lords , and kings , That " some things may be done , as well as other things .

Yet they grew divine By their long tumbles ; and if we can match Their hierarchy , shall we not entwine One wreath ? Who ever came " up to the scratch , " And for so little , jumped so bravely as Sam Patch ? To long conclusions many men have jumped In logic , and the safer course they took ; By any other , they would have been stumped , Unable to argue , or to quote a book , And quite dumb-founded , which they can not brook ; They break no bones , and suffer no contusion , Hiding their woful fall , by hook and crook , In slang and gibberish , sputtering and confusion ; But that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped in person . Death or Victory Was his device , " and there was no mistake , " Except his last ; and then he did but die , A blunder which the wisest men will make . Aloft , where mighty floods the mountains break , To stand , the target of ten thousand eyes , And down into the coil and water-quake , To leap , like Maia 's offspring , from the skies  --  For this all vulgar flights he ventured to despise . And while Niagara prolongs its thunder , Though still the rock primval disappears , And nations change their bounds  --  the theme of wonder Shall Sam go down the cataract of long years ; And if there be sublimity in tears , Those shall be precious which the adventurer shed When his frail star gave way , and waked his fears Lest , by the ungenerous crowd it might be said , That he was all a hoax , or that his pluck had fled . Who would compare the maudlin Alexander , Blubbering , because he had no job in hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam , whose grief we all can understand ? His crying was not womanish , nor plann 'd For exhibition ; but his heart o'erswelled With its own agony , when he the grand Natural arrangements for a jump beheld , And measuring the cascade , found not his courage quelled . His last great failure set the final seal Unto the record Time shall never tear , While bravery has its honour ,  --  while men feel The holy natural sympathies which are First , last , and mightiest in the bosom . Where The tortured tides of Genessee descend , He came  --  his only intimate a bear ,  --  ( We know not that he had another friend ) , The martyr of renown , his wayward course to end . The fiend that from the infernal rivers stole Hell-draughts for man , too much tormented him , With nerves unstrung , but steadfast in his soul , He stood upon the salient current 's brim ; His head was giddy , and his sight was dim ; And then he knew this leap would be his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly swim , With eyes of many multitudes , dense and vast , That stared in mockery ; none a look of kindness cast .

Sir , The three last numbers of Blackwood 's Edinburgh Magazine contain three cantos of an epic poem , called Daniel O'Rourke . The story , of which this is a new version , is very old , and probably familiar to a great many people . In an old Manchester Almanac , I find the version which I send you . It may have been from the pen of Mr. Words-worth , as it has much of the characteristic simplicity of Betty Foy , Goody Blake , and Harry Gill . Would you hear of Daniel Rook , How a journey long he took ? How he travelled to the moon , And got back again quite soon ? Daniel Rook , beside a lake , Saw the dimples breezes make ; Saw the skies reflected shine , And Daniel thought it very fine . Then an eagle came along , Very large and very strong ; Said the eagle , Daniel Rook , Pray what is't at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous eagle spoke ;  --  I am looking at the lake , Seeing how the waters shake . Said the eagle , no more slack , Footnote : 1Kb Daniel get upon my back ! So the monstrous eagle took On his shoulders Daniel Rook . Up he flew , like sin and death , Never stopping to take breath ; Daniel thought he 'd ne'er have done , When above he spied the moon ; Like a cheese without a rind , O how gloriously it shined ! Like a cheese that 's cut in two , Aha ! said Daniel , how d'ye do ? Said the eagle , Daniel bold , Of that there horn you must take hold ; So the simple Daniel did Just as the monstrous eagle bid . Then away the eagle flew , Leaving Daniel looking blue ; Now I 'm sure , said Daniel bold , Hanging here I shall take cold . Then the man in the moon came out , Picked his teeth , and looked about ; Mr. Daniel Rook , said he , Good morning , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife to-day ? She is in a family way ; I fear we sha n't have room enough , So I beg , Daniel , you 'd be off . I ca n't , said Daniel  --  You must , said he  --  I wo n't , said Daniel , it ca n't be  --  Very well , said the man in the moon , We shall see that very soon . In he went , and out he strode , With a crowbar died with blood ; Sure and certain aim he took , Knocked off the horn and Daniel Rook . Fall'n from his high estate , Daniel went at no small rate ; Nor can he tell , so queer he feels , Which is his head , and which his heels . He saw a flock of wild geese nigh , And long and loud he heard them cry  --  Daniel Rook , where will you go ? Indeed , said Daniel , I do n't know ; But by the course which now I take , I guess I 'm falling in the lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And fall on dry land , Daniel Rook ? Hiatus . Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : THE SUN LOOKS ON NAUGHT IN HIS CIRCUIT AS GREAT . from The writings ( 1835 ) The sun looks on naught , in his circuit , as great As the mind whose fixed purpose is stubborn as fate ; That in storm or in sunshine , with foe or with friend , Unchanged and unchanging , endures to the end . Attractions unnumbered the needle control , And it trembles unfaithful , forsaking the pole ; But the resolute will moves sublime in its pride , Nor will turn for affection or flattery aside . The old oaks may writhe where the hurricane sweeps , And the firm bedded rocks may be torn from the steeps  --  The pine of the forest may bend to the blast , But the strong will of man stands erect to the last . As the Titan , by demons in Caucasus bound , While the war of mad elements thundered around , Braved Jove , though the vulture had fastened his fangs , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pangs . When her last sob convulsive great nature shall heave , And the world its foundations in ruin shall leave , The end the last stoic shall calmly expect , And sink proud on the bier of a universe wreck 'd .

Would I could say good night to pain , Good night to conscience and her train , To cheerless poverty , and shame That I am yet unknown to fame ! Would I could say good night to dreams That haunt me with delusive gleams , That through the sable future 's veil Like meteors glimmer , but to fail . Would I could say a long good night To halting between wrong and right , And , like a giant with new force , Awake prepared to run my course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when few years have come and gone , The past will be to me as naught , Whether remembered or forgot .

Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : PSALM CXXXVII. from The writings ( 1835 ) Where mid Babel 's proud gardens and palaces glide The waves of Euphrates , we sat by the tide ; Our harps on the willows hung mournful above , And we wept as we thought on the land of our love ! For our masters came by , and a song they desired , And mirth from the exile the spoiler required ; With mockery they bade us awake at their nod , To please his blasphemers , the hymns of our God . Say , how in the land of the heathen , his foe , Can the songs of his temple in melody flow . O Salem , though torn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thy mem'ry should stray , Then for ever be withered my hand , nor again May it win from the harp that I cherish a strain ; Be rigid my tongue , and be voiceless my breath , Fast locked , for the crime , in the silence of death ! O God of our fathers ! remember the day When the heathen exulting made Salem their prey , While our kindred stood by , nor our altars revered , But the spoiler to havoc unpitying cheered . Yet tremble , thou city of pride and of power ! The avenger shall come , and the terrible hour ; In the blood of thy children his blade shall be died , For the God of our fathers shall fight on his side ! November 15th , 1821 .

What mingling scenes , in distant years , Will these recall to memory 's eye ! Of gloom and radiance , smiles and tears , Shifting like April 's changeful sky ; Of loves and feuds , of hopes and fears , Of rapturous hours so quick that fled , And some , like stones that grief endears , Will stand , memorials of the dead . Would that , with prophet 's ken , I might A glad and peaceful course assure , To thy young star , whose lustre bright Now sheds on earth its influence pure ; And say that when Time 's hurrying flight Shall steal thy cheek 's vermilion glow ; Of those blue orbs obscure the light And check that spirit 's sparkling flow , Still memory , when of buried days The forms and scenes she shall restore , Though weeping , haply she surveys The loved and lovely then no more , Shall shrink not with averted gaze From troublous ghosts of wo or pain , Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed in vain ! Fair be thy course , as thou art fair ! Serene thy life , as thou art good ! No harrowing thoughts of days that were , To mar thy bosom 's peace obtrude ! And when thy glance , in joy or care Cast on these lines , perchance , shall be , Still think on one , whose constant prayer Shall ask all heaven 's best gifts for thee . May 5th , 1827 . Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : PROLOGUE TO WALDIMAR , A TRAGEDY . from The writings ( 1835 ) The Tragic Muse , since first her power began , To rouse to generous warmth the soul of man , Her scenes and actors everywhere has found ,  --  In savage wilds , or fable-haunted ground . For Art may tame or mould , but can not change The master-passions in their varying range . Wonder and Awe awoke , when first the eyes Of the first patriarch saw the earth and skies ; Love , next in power and order , lit his flame , And Fear and Grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revenge , as Murder 's heralds scowled , Remorse and mad Despair behind him howled ; While Pity bent above the wreck deplored , And Hope , with rapturous wing , triumphant soared . These , the mind 's taskers with their kindred train , In every age and clime hold equal reign . Our author 's scene is in an ancient day , When stormy passions had their wildest play ; When Rome 's enormous mass of power , o'ergrown , Crumbled and quaked beneath a severed throne : Each giant fragment , parting from the pile , Shook all the world , and left an empire 's spoil : Each soldier-chieftain , with a monarch 's power , Usurped the transient homage of the hour ; And oft , insane with delegated might , Perished , like him whose fate we show to-night . Bold is each effort now to please the age With dramas worthy of the classic stage , In Fame 's high dome the masters sit enthroned , Whose spells resistless every passion owned ; Who gave to each conception prosperous birth , And with immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , While still their numbers linger on the ear , But cold attention waits the modern bard , Who risks the crowded theatre 's award . Yet , our New World the muse 's pencil needs ! What wild adventures , what heroic deeds , Remain unsung ! what forms , that in the gloom Of the long Past magnificently loom , Might re-enact the stories of their time , Arouse to virtue , or affright from crime ! Would ye behold the native drama rise ? To kill the pioneers were most unwise ! All is not gained at once . The Genoese , Who first explored our now familiar seas , Bursting all barriers in his firm intent , Found but the isles , and not the continent ! A hundred stars had shed prophetic rays , Ere Shakspeare 's sun obscured them in its blaze ! Try , then , our Author 's argument and cause , By patriot feeling , not by tyrant laws ; And let not Justice hold the balance , blind , But poise the scales , determined  --  TO BE KIND ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLENDER . from The writings ( 1835 ) And thou art dead ! as thin and spare As mortal form could be ; And frame so lean , and bones so bare We never more shall see . Though finished are thine earthly days , And o'er thy tomb the cow may graze In rude simplicity  --  Still busy memory lingers yet , Thy well-loved face she ca n't forget . I will not ask where thou liest low , Because I know full well  --  I saw thee to the churchyard go , I heard thy funeral knell . They brought thee in thine own wheelbarrow , And laid thee in thy grave so narrow , Without a stone to tell Thy name , thy birth-place , or thy station , Thy virtues , or thy occupation . I will not ask of what thou died , Of dropsy or of fever ; Whether thy leg was mortified , Or out of place thy liver . It was enough for me to know , That thou hast gone where all must go , Must go , alas ! for ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wherefore , I never knew , nor do I care for . And life 's short day of joy and sorrow , Shall never more be thine , Its stormy nights , its cloudy morrow , Its darkness or sunshine  --  But yet thy name abroad shall ring , And far and wide shall poets sing Thy praise in strains divine ; And matrons old , and maidens tender , Long sigh for thee , young Harry Slender .

The mountain 's mirror 'd outline fades Amid the fast extending shades ; Its shaggy bulk , in sterner pride , Towers , as the gloom steals o'er the tide ; For the great stream a bulwark meet That leaves its rock-encumbered feet . River and Mountain ! though to song Not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved your evening hues , Will ask not the recording Muse , What antique tales she can relate , Your banks and steeps to consecrate .

O'er yon rough heights and moss-clad sod Oft hath the stalworth warrior trod ; Or peered , with hunter 's gaze , to mark The progress of the glancing bark . Spoils , strangely won on distant waves , Have lurked in yon obstructed caves . When the great strife for Freedom rose Here scouted oft her friends and foes , Alternate , through the changeful war , And beacon-fires flashed bright and far ; And here , when Freedom 's strife was won , Fell , in sad feud , her favoured son ;  --  Her son ,  --  the second of the band , The Romans of the rescued land . Where round yon cape the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , mirthful hearts shall pause to sigh , There , tears shall dim the patriot 's eye . There last he stood .

Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : PREFACE TO AN ALBUM . from The writings ( 1835 ) An Album , while an Album , is a thing ( If clean the paper , and the binding fair ) , Pretty to look at ; and the poets sing Of many similes that appropriate are ; And which ' t is easy to our mind to bring As none of them are new , or strange , or rare ; Such as  --  a maiden 's heart  --  a baby 's mind  --  Or the first state of those two parents of mankind . But ah ! upon the simple maiden 's heart , Will Love , too soon , some guileful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their part , And alter much the helpless infant 's case . Adam and Eve were soon seduced to start From Paradise , awhile their resting place ; And so , an Album , in the course of time , Is soiled by hands and feet , fingers and rhyme . Oh ! and alas ! while on this volume 's brink , Still a white sea , I stand , and meditate Upon the many coloured kinds of ink , Whose tortuous currents here must permeate ,  --  When on the torture of those brains I think , Whose oozings here must be incorporate ,  --  Upon the geese that must the quills supply , And those that must commit the poetry ,  --  I sorrow , that all fair things must decay , While time , and accident , and mischief last ; That the red rose so soon must fade away , The white be sullied by the ruthless blast ; The pure snow turned to mud , in half a day ; Even heaven 's own glorious azure be o'ercast ; Imperial ermine be with dust defiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou snow-white altar ! which to friendship rear 'd , With freshest garlands should alone be hung , And with no dull and smoky incense smear 'd , But such as perfume-laden Zephyr flung ; Strange hieroglyphics , soon , I am afeard , Thy graceful sculpture will appear among ; The vulgar love their names to cut or write On every post that 's new , or tablet that is white ! Of what an Album 's like , before ' t is used , I thus have chanted in my homely phrase ; But what it 's like , by fate when long abused , To tell , perplexes me in various ways ; Fancy invoked assistance has refused To yield resemblances ; because , she says , It were to Love and Friendship treason vile , To comment coarsely on their honest toil . Then , without thee , O Nymph ! so often pray 'd , So rarely won , to listen to our cry ! Whose image floats in heavenly tints portray 'd , Of roseate morn , or eve 's empurpled sky ;  --  In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tattered in thy drapery ;  --  Without the Fancy ! I must strive to find Such similes as suit the common mind . ' T is like a trunk , with ancient clothes replete , Of every colour , fashion , age , and shape ; ' T is like a virtuoso 's cabinet , Thro ' which with listless eye we talk and gape ; Where beauty and deformity we meet , Birds of bright plumes and bats , the deer and ape : ' T is like the legislature ,  --  whereunto Few swans , some hawks , and many goslings go . ' T is like an ancient single lady 's chest , Where rummaging , the curious heir discovers Old patterns , worn-out thimbles , and the rest Of antique trumpery ; fans , and flowers , and covers Of pincushions ; a petrified wasp 's nest ; Letters from long defunct or married lovers ; Work-boxes , ten-pences that once were new , And murder 'd metre , if she was a blue . ' T is like a doomsday-book , wherein is writ Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and breadth , and boundaries of his wit , And value of his intellectual treasure :  --  ' T is like a party , when you ask to it Clowns , who derive from such soires no pleasure , But are compelled in company to go , Their awkwardness and ignorance to show . ' T is like a churchyard  --  where , in crooked rows , Tomb-stones , and urns , and crosses are arrayed , Memorials of the persons that repose Beneath , whose virtues are thereon displayed ; Where every kind and colour , friends and foes , Together sleep , beneath the cypress shade ; I wish I had let this simile alone  --  It is a sad , though an important one . For , as those pale memorials to the eye Of unforgetful friendship , can restore The loved and lovely in the days gone by , The forms once dear , that we behold no more , So can these pages bring the absent nigh , And summon back the ghost from Lethe 's shore : Therefore , they are sacred ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed . ' T is like a Talisman , by magic hands Framed with quaint spells , and graved with figures strange , That , by the instructed finger touched , commands All images that float in nature 's range ; Recalls each well-known form from distant lands , And shows the shrouded dead without a change : And long-forgotten scenes , a shadowy train , And long-forgotten faces smile again .

O ! for an hour , let me forget How much of life is left me yet ; Recall the visions of the past , Fair as these tints that can not last , That all the heavens and waters o'er Their gorgeous , transient glories pour . Ye pastoral scenes by fancy wrought ! Ye pageants of the loftier thought ! Creations proud ! majestic things ! Heroes , and demigods , and kings ! Return , with all of shepherds ' lore , Or old romance that pleased before ! Ye forms that are not of the earth , Of grace , of valour , and of worth ! Ye bright abstractions , by the thought Like the great master 's pictures , wrought To the ideal 's shadowy mien , From beauties fancied , dreamt or seen ! Ye speaking sounds , that poet 's ear Alone in nature 's voice can hear ! Thou full conception , vast and wide , Hour of the lonely minstrel 's pride , As when projection gave of old Alchymy 's visionary gold ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thoughts that sting ! The hour of gloom is o'er my soul ; Disperse the shades , the fiends control , As David 's harp had power to do , If sacred chronicles be true . Oh come ! by every classic spell , By old Pieria 's haunted well ; By revels on the Olmeian height Held in the moon 's religious light ; By virgin forms that wont to lave Permessus ! in thy lucid wave ! In vain ! in vain ! the strain has pass 'd ; The laurel leaves upon the blast Float , withered , ne'er again to bloom , The cup is drained  --  the song is dumb  --  And spell and rhyme alike in vain Would woo the genial muse again . Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : TO A LADY , ON THE DEATH OF HER DAUGHTER WHO HAD JUST TAKEN THE VEIL . from The writings ( 1835 ) Footnote : 1Kb Shall grief perverse , with midnight gloom , Thy fairest days o'ercast , While prostrate by a daughter 's tomb , Thy ceaseless sorrows last ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee with a sigh , And evening 's pensive shade beholds Tears dim thy lucid eye .

The earlier hours of passionate wo A secret joy mysterious know , To jealous sorrow dear ; I did not then forbid their flow , But gave thee tear for tear . But short the term that nature gives To unavailing sighs ; The constant grief that longer lives , Seems morbid to the wise . Thy dear remains , oh shade beloved ! In their dark prison pent , Sleep on by all our moans unmoved , Nor hear our sad lament . Nor funeral dirge , nor anguish wild Relentless fate can stay ; The mother mourns in vain her child , For death retains his prey . Still , still , the heartless monster calls For victims , still he waves The sickly torch that man appals Still howls around our frighted walls , And covers earth with graves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath , Sees parents with their children laid , Who followed them in death . Down to that grave , by anguish worn , Despairing should'st thou go , Friendship a double loss must mourn , Our tears anew must flow . Or dost thou , with enforced sighs , Mourn like the common train , Who in their solemn liveries Decorous sadness feign ? That it was sweet to weep , a school Of yore maintained ; but false their rule , And false their poets sing ; From grief so lingering and so dull , No joy can ever spring . Deep in the glooms of savage wood , The turtle wails her mate , But reconciled to widowhood , Forgets at length her state . So faithful grief will strive in vain Its cherished misery to retain Nor lift its funeral pall ; Time will at last a triumph gain , Who triumphs over all . See by the smoking altar , where Her Iphignia bled , The mother stand in wild despair , And ask to join the dead . But other cares her bosom knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the parent 's tears ; Our Iphignia 's memory , too , Must yield to fleeting years . Since then those pinions , broad and strong , Must bear , perforce , away Thy melancholy , nurs 'd so long , Why wail the dull delay ? Chase the black poison from thy soul , And time anticipate , Thine altered mood let use control , And reason vindicate . Not so complained the Grecian dame , But armed her noble breast ; Her nature 's weakness she o'ercame , Her natural sighs repress 'd . " For why should I consume , " she said , With vain regrets my heart ? When smiling in its infant bed , I knew one day its fragile thread The fatal shears must part . " Ah no ! your rules , ye stoics cold , In vain would I enforce  --  Great God ! thy temple 's gates unfold , And show our sole resource . A hand divine alone can heal The wounds the bleeding heart must feel , Vain human counsels were ; Beside the sacred altar kneel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shrine , And wing thy griefs above , Submissive to the power divine , That chastens in its love . Tho ' rankles yet thy recent smart , Eternal wisdom own , That breaks the tenderest ties apart , To fix the undivided heart Upon itself alone . Ere the decree of fate went forth , Already she had died ; Snatched from the dangerous snares of earth , Heaven claimed her as its bride . From that vain world its votaries paint With each delusive die , Shut out by every firm restraint , Lived , for her God alone , the saint , And knew no other tie . Self-dedicated to the rite Behold the victim move , When stands prepared the altar bright Of everlasting love . The incense mounts , the wreaths are hung ; Attends the sacrifice ; But whence those shrieks the crowd among ! Her bridal hymn I should have sung ,  --  I chant her obsequies . So fades a rose untimely strown , Of all its petals shorn ; Plucked , with its budding charms half blown , An altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Through all the fane it shed ; Eve came , and dark descending night Saw all its glories fled . Just Heaven ! we mourn her young career Cut short by sudden blight ; But own thy wisdom ; every year Was numbered in thy sight . We should not mete by length of days The term the saintly spirit stays , Its trials to endure ; Death to the wretch whom none can praise , Alone is premature . VOL . II .  --  D D D Sands , Robert Charles , 1799-1832 : THE OCEAN OF NONSENSE . from The writings ( 1835 ) A misty dream  --  and a flashy maze  --  Of a sunshiny flush  --  and a moonshiny haze ! I lay asleep with my eyes open wide , When a donkey came to my bedside , And bade me forth to take a ride . It was not a donkey of vulgar breed , But a cloudy vision  --  a night-mare steed ! His ears were abroad like a warrior 's plume ,  --  From the bosom of darkness was borrowed the gloom Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , But his eyes like no earthly eyes they were ! Like the fields of heaven where none can see The depths of their blue eternity ! Like the crest of a helmet taught proudly to nod And wave like a meteor 's train abroad , Was the long , long tail , that glorified The glorious donkey 's hinder side ! And his gait description 's power surpasses  --  ' T was the beau ideal of all jack asses . I strode o'er his back , and he took in his wind  --  And he pranced before  --  and he kicked behind  --  And he gave a snort , as when mutterings roll Abroad from pole to answering pole  --  While the storm-king sits on the hail-cloud 's back  --  And amuses himself with the thunder-crack ! Then off he went , like a bird with red wings That builds her nest where the cliff-flower springs  --  Like a cloudy steed by the light of the moon , When the night 's muffled horn plays a windy tune ; And away I went , while my garment flew Forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like a streak of white foam on a sea of blue . Up-bristled then the night-charger 's hair too , Like a bayonet grove , at a shoulder-hoo ! Hurra ! hurra ! what a hurry we made ! My hairs rose too , but I was not afraid ; Like a stand of pikes they stood up all , Each eye stood out like a cannon ball ; So rapt I looked , like the god of song , As I shot and whizzed like a rocket along . Thus thro ' the trough of the air as we dash 'd , Goodly and glorious visions flash 'd Before my sight with a flashing and sparkling , In whose blaze all earthly gems are darkling . As the gushes of morning , the trappings of eve , Or the myriad lights that will dance when you give Yourself a clout on the orb of sight , And see long ribands of rainbow light ; Such were the splendours , and so divine , So rosy and starry , and fiery and fine . Then eagle ! then stars ! and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tumbling fall , Where I sung so divinely of them and their glories , While mewed in vile durance , and kept by the tories . Where the red cross flag was abroad on the blast I sat very mournful , but not downcast . My harp on the willows I did not hang up , Nor the winglets of fancy were suffered to droop ,  --  But I soared , and I swooped , like a bird with red wings , Who mounts to the cloud-god , and soaringly sings . But the phantom steed in his whirlwind course , Galloped along like Belzebub 's horse , Till we came to a bank , dark , craggy , and wild , Where no rock-flowers blushed , no verdure smiled  --  But sparse from the thunder cliffs bleak and bare ,  --  Like the plumage of ravens that warrior helms wear . And below very far was a gulf profound , Where tumbling and rumbling , at distance resound Billowy clouds  --  o'er whose bottomless bed The curtain of night its volumes spread  --  But a rushing of fire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thunders a home . You may put out the eyes of the sun at mid-day  --  You may hold a young cherubim fast by the tail  --  You may steal from night 's angel his blanket away  --  Or the song of the bard at its flood-tide may stay , But that cloud-phantom donkey to stop you would fail ! He plunged in the gulf  --  ' t was a great way to go , E'er we lit mid the darkness and flashings below ; And I looked  --  as I hung o'er that sulphurous light  --  Like a warrior of flame !  --  on a courser of night ! But what I beheld in that dark ocean 's roar , I have partly described in a poem before , And the rest I reserve for a measure more strong , When my heart shall be heaving and bursting with song ! But I saw as he sailed ' mid the dusky air , A bird that I thought I knew everywhere , A fierce gray bird with a terrible beak , With a glittering eye , and peculiar shriek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed him then  --  " How my heart swells high thus to meet thee again ! Thou whose bare bosom for rest is laid On pillows of night by the thunder-cloud made ! With a rushing of wings and a screaming of praise Who in ecstasy soar'st in the red-hot blaze ! Who dancest in heaven to the song of the trump , To the fife 's acclaim , and bass-drum 's thump ! Whence com'st thou , " I cried , " and goest whither ? " As I gently detained him by his tail-feather . He replied , " Mr. N  --  ! Mr. N  --  , let me loose ! I am not an eagle , but only a goose !  --  Your optics are weak , and the weather is hazy  --  And excuse the remark , but I think you are crazy .

In that fair grove , The level beams of the retiring sun Streamed mottled , multiform , with magic tints , ' Mid the long spiry leaves and tall straight columns , Where glorious birds , with plumage many-colour 'd , Sat motionless . In their declining trains , Shone ' mid the foliage from aloft , the glow Of ruby , emerald , topaz , sardonyx , All hues that sparkled in the diadems Of Babylon 's or India 's monarchs old , Irradiant . As I gazed , beside the grove , A green vale gently sloping I beheld . There grew the date , the fig-tree and the plane , And in the midst a whispering brook , that kiss 'd Pebbles to modern mineralogists Unknown , made music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many-tufted With peerless flow'rets , such as blushed of yore In Nebuchadnezzar 's yard , or the parterre Of Solomon , or in the regal bower Of great Semiramis . An easy swell Rose from the vale : reposing on its summit A bulky structure lay ; most like two barks , Joined latitudinally , covered with a platform , Whereon a dome is reared , o'er-canopied With shelving roofs . Mechanic specimens Drawn by exertions of equestrian strength , Like this , on Hudson 's waves are visible ;  --  From such , when Tyre defied the child of Ammon , Its massive freight the huge balista hurled  --  Methought a stair clomb high the green hill side , To where in that vast edifice expanded A portal stood . Then came a mingled train , With weary steps and sad reverted eyes , Of size like Amalek , or him of Gath , Or his surpassing stature , who maintained His royal throne in forest-girdled Bashan , And stretched his ponderous limbs on couch of iron . First , touched with earliest frosts of sacred eld , Yet upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great patriarch went . In vain My quest ( so strange the pageantry of dreams ! ) Sought to behold his venerable spouse . Then passed into the ark , three goodly men , Following the sage , each with encircling arm Supporting a fair form of peerless mould ; And a long train behind went mounting still ; As prisoners upon whom the massive portal Shuts , grating dolorous requiem to the joys Of liberty and daylight  --  so they went , And darkness hid them from . But anon , Soft on the breeze came notes of minstrelsy ; A bridal train along the vale advanced , In quaint attire and jewels sheen arrayed ; With step elastic , bounding to the change Of quick delightful music . There the sons Of Tubal touched with fingers light the chords , Which quivered with ecstatic harmony ; And Tubal 's offspring bade the sounding brass Wake its bold clangors . Others through the coil Of serpent tubes the winding sound prolonged ; While some on pastoral flutes and sweet recorders , Breathed tones like those , which o'er Italian seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imbodying passion 's soul in melody , Feed love and young desire . As when a stranger , Lingering amid the gardens of the deep , That stud the glittering Caribbean waves , In some Antillian grove , beneath the shade Of tall palmettos , and the embowering wood Of fig-tree huge , self-multiplied , beholds Dark Afric 's children , on a festal day , In rainbow colours dight , their dance uncouth , Albeit not void of grace with vigorous limbs , Prolong to rustic banja 's tinkling twang ,  --  While on the lively green , the blushing grape , The golden orange , and the shapely pear , And ripe ananas with its scaly coat And virent tuft , in rich confusion lie ;  --  The stranger looks delighted on the scene Novel and gay ;  --  so looked I on the rout Who came with joyance and with minstrelsy . Then in the porch the hoary patriarch stood With aspect tristful yet severe  --  " Avaunt ! " He cried , " repent , repent ! the hour is come , Even now the deluge comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gray hairs , that sportive band Sent forth , responsive to the warning voice , Their heart 's gay laugh exuberant , that shook Their diaphragms , as to the glorious west They pointed . As in Bagdad 's ancient pomp , Or Ispahan , when the last night is o'er Of Ramadan 's long fast , a flood of light Pours from the bazars , on the sequent eve , Resplendent , and the orient waves therein , Burnished with brilliant blazonry , along The streets and crowded marts , in splendid glow Beam like the array of some enchanter 's home ; So far and wide the kindling occident Caught from the eternal fire one blaze of pomp , Flashing with all its multitudinous tints , From molten gold that swam in opal fields To fierce intolerable glory . Thus The sun went down , upon that fatal eve  --  The portal closed . The man of God withdrew . The mirth , the dance , the minstrelsy went on . But where the glory of the west ? As when On Jersey 's shore , the kindled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welkin , So faint , so dim , was now the verge of heaven . Untimely twilight came . A volumed mist Rose suddenly , and far unrolling hung Its sombrous drapery o'er the vaulted cope , Darkening and deepening .  --  Whirlwinds pass 'd along On pinions terrible ; the forest trees Bowed their tall heads , and writhed in agony , Like masts upon the ocean tempest-lashed  --  The bridal train swift scattering , from my sight Vanished  --  The birds flew screaming in wild circuits , Mazed and in terror lost  --  And blackening still The clouds went up . Sullenly , heavily , Huge drops came pattering down . A hollow groan , Even from the bowels of the monstrous world , Was heard presaging wo . And then a roar , As of a thousand chariots , or the voice Of all the ram 's horns when the embattled towers Of Jericho in whelming ruin fell , At distance came . The solid frame of earth Shuddered beneath me ;  --  when above , at once , From tenfold darkness , burst the livid sheet Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and on the distant brow Of the horizon , as it fell , I marked The ocean , piling wave on wave , advance , A wall of waters , beetling over-head , And climbing still , till its impending height Threatened whole continents ; as when it closed On car-borne Ammon 's chivalry and power ; With murmurs wrathful , like the eternal roar On Lapland 's sounding coast . While overhead The dreadful thunder spoke ; and with the peal , I woke  --  Right gladly through the casement then , I marked the dew-drops on the pendant spray , Glittering with early morning 's roseate beam , And bless 'd my stars that I had not been drowned .
