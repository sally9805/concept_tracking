txt *WITH the early history of Peru , you are already as well acquainted as I am myself . We have often conversed together on the enormities committed by Pizarro and his followers , whom a lust for power and conquest carried among the inoffensive worshippers of the Sun , and led to their slaughter like wild beasts - merely to obtain from them that wealth which the poor savages would have parted with on much easier terms . Persecution , insult and injury have nearly exterminated the original owners of the soil . Their national character was that of a feeble , harmless , ignorant race - living in the constant interchange of friendly arts , with no knowledge of the true God , except through his works ; I think we have agreed , that of all heathen worship , that which sees God in his works is the most rational ; for we can easily imagine that an untutored savage would look with awe and wonder on the God of day rejoicing in the East : ' and when he daily witnessed his all-pervading power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must appear to his unenlightened eyes the great fountain of life . The human heart must have its object of worship ; and to bow down to wondrous Nature , is certainly more rational than to bow down to the works of men 's hands . But I must not indulge my* self in this discursive moralizing . You will not wish me to search the ancient records of Peru* that I may draw from its mouldy archives its long and dreadful account of conquest and of crime . I feel sure you will take more interest in the habits , manners and customs of the people as they now are , with a description of all , of nature and of art , that meets my eye , than in any of the wild legends of bigoted monks , or the fabled histories of those old grandees who first located themselves in this land of gold and precious stones . I will not forget , however , that I am writing to one who has a reasonable share of that curiosity which has been , by some saucy writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised you , in my last , a bird's-eye view of the valley of the Rimac , in which Lima - once called the City of Kings - is situated . It is the most luxuriant and beautiful valley on the whole coast of Peru . Its length , from the mountain boundary on the south , to the same on the north , is about twelve miles ; and its width , from the sea to the foot of the mountains on the east , is perhaps nine or ten . The whole of this is nearly an uninterrupted level , rising gently and gradually from the ocean ; its shape is nearly a half circle . Lima is about seven miles from Callao , its sea-port , // and within three of the north side of the plain . The ground on which it stands , is seven hundred feet higher than the sea . The principal part of the city is built on the south side of the river Rimac , and encompassed with high walls - the river forming its defence on the north side . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west ; its circumference nearly nine miles . The water of the Rimac is conveyed into the city through aqueducts , to a number of fountains in different quarters , from which the inhabitants are supplied . It is also carried through all the streets running from east to ivest , by means of trenches ( about four feet wide ) in the centre . The elevation I have mentioned is sufficient to caiise the water to run with some degree of rapidity - carrying with it a large J ) roportion of the filth of the place , which is thrown into it for that purpose : this water , after passing through the city , is carried in ditches , made on each side of the road , to Callao , and is used for irrigating the gardens and fields of the contiguous estates . Of the view outside the walls of the city , I could say much ; but I will not expatiate - preferring to give you a description of all the principal places in the valley , and leaving your imagination to group the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callao - which , being the principal port of Lima , you would naturally imagine must be a place of considerable extent and importance . But such is not the case . It is quite small , and miserable in appearance . There is scarcely a decent house in the place ; in fact , the population is made up of the lower classes . The only respectable people who reside there , are those acting as port-agents for the merchants here . I think the town does not contain altogether more than five or six hundred inhabitants . The harbor of Cailao is the safest on the west cQast of America ; it would be so , from its situation , were it subject to high winds ; but as a gale was never known there , vessels may literally be said to ride secure with a packthread for a cable . It is strongly fortified , both by sea and land having for its defence three large and strong castles , capable of containing ten thousand men . At present , there is only a small garrison in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception of goods in deposit , and where resid also the officers connected with the customhouse . Directly opposite Callao , lies the island of St. Lorcazo , with a number of small ones adjacent : these make the western shelter to the harbor . They are all , I believe , entirely barren - not producing even a blade of grass . They appear to me as if thrown up by some volcanic eruption . St. Lorenzo is the Protestant burial-ground . The Catholics are too much afraid of contamination to allow even the body of a heretic to rest any nearer their // faithful city . There is a gang of convicts kept on the island , who are employed in getting out stone for various purposes , as it is the only place near affording a good supply . Having nothing more interesting to say of Callao , I will direct your attention to the ruins of a once pretty village , in a south-east direction from it , called Bellavista . This place , when Callao was besieged by BOLIVAR and defended by RODIL , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patriot army ; and its destruction was the consequence hy the guns of the castle . A few of the houses have been repaired , and are occupied by those who rent the fine orchards and gardens in its vicinity . From these , the markets of Lima are supplied with some of their best fruit and vegetables . Its ruined buildings present a striking contrast to the profusion of the riches of the earth , by which they are surrounded . The destructive effects of war and the grateful fruits of peace , are both at once presented to the eye , and together make a scene of picturesque beauty not often united in so small a space . The next place worthy of notice , is Magdalena - distant from Bellavista about one and a half or two miles . It was the headquarters of General Bolivar during his stay in lower Peru , in 1825 , and though very beautiful , it is the smallest village in the valley - composed chiefly of neat , comfortable houses , surrounded with orchards and gardens of great luxuriance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which adds much to its romantic loveliness . Most of the estates are owned by the gentry of the city , who retire to them occasionally during the summer months . It is in a south-easterly direction from Lima , and distant from it , by the road , about five miles . The ride to it is the most pleasant on theplain . Leaving Magdalena , and still proceeding southerly , inclining eastward , a pleasant ride of three miles brings you to the large village of Miraflores . This delightful place is on the direct road from the city to Chorillos , about half way between . Chorillos is their chief bathing-place , and where as many as can afford the great expense , spend what is called the bathing season , which generally commences in February and ends in April . Of ChonIbs , I will give you a more particular description when I visit it . I have now given you a brief account of all the places situated in the valley of the Rimac . It only remains for me to describe its general appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous city of Lima . With the exception of the villages I have mentioned , and the enclosures round a few scattered farm-houses , the whole of this rich valley is in an uncultivated state , and presents to the eye the most barren prospect imaginable . The soil , being of a rich claycolored loam , has become baked hard by the sun ; its surface // gets finely pulverized , by the travel over it in all directions , and a high breeze covers eyerything with this gray powder , so that scarce a green blade is visible . The constant motion of this dust makes riding in the neighborhood very uncomfortable . I am informed that the cause of so much barren land , is the poverty of the owners - the chief part belonging to a few old families , who were stripped of their wealth by the revolution . Their slaves were freed , and set adrift to shift for themselves ; of course they soon starved or fell into bad company , and became a burthen to those they once aided . The old grandees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find purchasers , in the unsettled state of the country , are obliged to bear the privations of a narrow income , while there are owners of rich soil enough to make them perfectly independent , if they could by any fair means obtain cultivators . This state of things is a great injury to all , particularly to the inhabitant 's of Lima ; for , if the fine grounds in the vicinity were cultivated as they ought to be , it would reduce the price of almost all the necessaries of life nearly one half . But , alas ! there is no hope of this for a long time to come . They must be regenerated in their feelings and habits , ere any system of government can be permanent . Loudly as they have talked about freedom , they are still a nation of slaves . The only difference in their present and former situation , is that , under the viceroys , they had one tyrant to rule them , and now they have hundreds , equally as despotic , equally as fond of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver mines have been and will , I fear , continue to be a curse to them ; for , so long as they place their reliance on those uncertain sources of wealth , they will neglect the riches which might so easily be obtained from their fruitful soil . If the same labor that is now employed in digging for their precious ores , could be bestowed on the cultivation of the earth , it would make Peru a scene of unrivaled beauty and brightness - while the melancholy miner would exchange his dark and life-destroying abode for a sweet , smiling home on the green turf , enlivened by the cheering rays of the sun . Twice the wealth would be eventually obtained , and the many would not be sacrificed for the few . The only idea of liberty that ever enters the minds of the great mass of the population , is that they may lie in the shade and do nothing . To be freed from all exertion , both mental and bodily , is happiness , liberty , and all that a Peruvian desires.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
