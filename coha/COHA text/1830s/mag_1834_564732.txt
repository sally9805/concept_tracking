txt When- a book has passed through three editions within a year or two , the author has little to hope or fear from critics . Such has been the case of this volume . It was first published in a duodecimo form , with the title of " Indian Biography , " which passed through two editions* and which we thought ourselves bound to mention with commendation , on its first appearance . The author expended much time and labor on the work , in its original form , yet he has since found such an increase of material as seems to warrant an augmentation of the bulk of his volume . - The rapid sale of his two first impressions assures us that his pains have been duly appreciated by the public . As it requires the energies of ten men to make a pin , so there must be a division of labor in the various departments of history . Mr. Drake 's taste has for many years led him to the investigation of our early colonial history , and especially that part of it which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from our personal knowledge , that he- has not spared his own time or purse in his researches , and that if very respectable talents and untiring perseverance in the pursuit of any stated object , be a guarantee of success , we have reason to be satisfied with the result . He seems to have overlooked no authority , to have collected those which differ , and to have given us a work which we may safely believe authentic . His industry can not be too much commended , and we should be gratified to see his example generally imitated by all writers on matters of fact . In his preface , he states that he has been censured for the incomplete condition of some articles in his former editions , and justly remarks thereupon , that had his critics been obliged to examine one fourth l ) art of the authorities and records he has had before him , they would have acknowledged the injustice of their blame at the very outset . // The utility of this work will be apparent to every careful reader . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , that no separation can be made . how could a history of New-England command belief , in which the lives of Uncas , Miantoujimo , Canonchet , Philip , and many other savages , great in their sphere , should be passed over lightly ? How can the name of Attakullakulla be obliterated from the records of Georgia , or that of Tecumseh from the story of the Western states . Yet the biography of these and other barbarian heroes has hitherto been thinly scattered over the pages of innumerable books , in. detached portions . To learn , the whole story of any one of them , would require more time and research than any one but a very devoted antiquarian would be willing to employ ; and moreover , the story so gained , would be a strange mixture of fact and fiction .. We have no Indian autobiographies , save the life of Black Hawk ; . and most of the works which have been given to the public on individual distinguished barbarians , have been speculative romances rather than records of matters of fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has set down the names of almost all the Indians mentioned in our history , in alphabetical order , together with every item concerning each individual that can be pr*-sumed. to be a matter of fact .. We do not recei.ve Mr. Drake 's opinions , or the opinions of others* but simply su.ch facts as are related by writers entitled to credit , and in air matters which are not very notorious , the names of his authorities are given . We know , therefore , whose word we are to rely on . The person , who shall one day write the history of the United States , or of any one of them , will not need to search the contradictory accounts of our early writers , or the musty archives of antiquarian libraries for information ; at least , his labor will be much abridged . We do not suppose that the work in question is perfect , or that many particulars may not have been missed by the compiler ; btrt we do thiuk that it is as near an approach to historical truth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been for four or five years with Indian novels , Indian stories , and travels in the Indian country , we do not expec that the " Book of the Indians " will command the attention which is paid to every new production of a distinguished novelist or poet , or that it will be son'ght or read with avidity . Such , probably , was not the expectation of the author . His intention appears to have been to pablish a work of utility , not of amusement . Should we be mistaken in our estimate of its value , there is at least one Darticular in which every inquirer into ancient story will hold himself obliged to Mr. J4rake . Instead of being obliged to search painfully for his authorities , he will find them pointed out to him ; and in case he should have occasion to refer to the exploits of any particular indiviclnal , he will ' derive immediate assistance from a very copious inch*x , which is annexed to the volume . Though , as a whole , we recommend the " Book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not without its faults , and it is our duty to point them out . Several of the wood cuts which were designed to illustrate the text , are execrable in design and execution . Some men would cut better blocks with a saw and 1*road axe . We pass over the likenesses of King Philip , Pocahontas , and the intended // execution of Captain Smith , because , though as vile as vile can be , deficient in taste , proportion , and perspective , they are fac similes of certain ancient engravings , and may illustrate the state of the pictorial art in former times . Certain we are that the engraver is guilty of no breach of the commandment . There are , also , likenesses of several distinguished individuals of modern times , whose roughness may be pardoned , because the resemblance is preserved . Yet , some there are , which can on no account be tolerated , being mean beyond description , and misrepresenting costume , figure , and every thing appertaining to Indians . Such is the abomination on the 86th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced , such as no Indian ever dwelt in . The man , in this piece , is armed with an Asiatic bow ; his arrows stick out of his quiver feather end foremost ; he wears a beard and whiskers , and supports his flying steps with a cane . his squaw is dressed in long petticoats . All these things are offensive to taste , truth , and propriety . We wonder that our artists have not yet learned to dress an Indian properly . The like impropriety has found its way upon the stage . We have seen Forrest repeatedly make his appearance on the stage in the garb of a Chippeway squaw , which an aboriginal w.arrior would consider it the last dishonor to wear . Book the fifth has an equally offensive misrepresentation over it ; and there are many others which we forbear to mention . Such things may please young children ; butt we suppose , the " Book of the Indians " was intended for men , and we advise the author to leave them out of his next edition . Mr. Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reverence for every thing that is old , that he has admitted the fabulous accounts of the early travelers as authentic .. Most of them are wholly unworthy of the least credit . Not being , probably , much acquainted with Indian wars , practically , our author has fallen into a few blunders , some of which are quite laughable . Speaking of a certain borderer , called by courtesy , Captain M'Culloch , he states , very gravely , that a letter was found in his pocket giving an account of the death of an Indian , whose scalp he had torn off with his teeth , and adds , that this is the process ( of scalping ! ) when the hair is short ! We should like to know how this savage operation could possibly be performed by any teeth but those of a lion or tiger .. The " Book of the Indians " is not currently paged from one end to the other , which we take to be a great inconvenience . It is divided into five books , each paged by itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the index . This was done , as we understand , because the author knew that many facts which have thus far escaped his search , will one day come to his knowledge , and may be appended to the several books in their respective order , and so save expense . Might they not as well have been put into an appendix ? Minuteness of detail certainly does no harm , and may be considered a good fault in a historian ; but we think it may be carried to excess . We find in the book before us several notices like this , in substance . Ckocorua was the last of these primitives , and was murdered on the top of a rock , by a miserable white hunter . " Unless this man had performed some remarkable action , or was distinguished in some way // or other ,  --  or , unless his death led to some important result , we see no necessity for mentioning him at all . What matters it that Tom , Dick , and Harry have lived , if they only ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorate such trifles , is but laying a useless load upon the memory . We have thought it the more necessary to dwell upon the faults of this publication , because it is one , which , taken altogether , deserves our cordial approbation . We may love our friend without loving his ill qualities , and it would be a kind of social treason to speak of him otherwise than he deserves . The style of this work is suited to the subject-things being said in as few words as possible . rrbe arrangement appears to us judicious . The life of each person mentioned , is given entire , and by itself . We have not to look through the entire volume , to learn the history of the individual . All the facts thereunto appertaining , are condensed in a concise article , and each article is complete in itself . The author does not seem vain of his laboriously acquired knowledge ; on the contrary , he gives due credit to every author from whom he extracts an item . He combines history with biography . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spirit and truth which will be highly agreeable to the reader for mere amusement , as well as to him whose sole object is increase of knowledge . We consider it no small merit in Mr. Drake , that he has refrained from advancing mere hypothetical matter , and has wholly repressed the pride of authorship , if , indeed , he ever felt it . He shows us Uncas , Miantonimno , Pontiac , Tecumseh , and a host of others , not as romancers have imagined and described them , but such as they were . All their great deeds , and all their degrading and disgusting qualities are faithfully portrayed . The only part of the volume which we can except from this commendation , is contained in the first book , of which a considerable part consists of a comparison of the opinions of philosophers concerning the first peopling of America . They are sufficiently amusing , though of no practical utility . We give no extracts , because the histories which have incident and importance enough to make them interesting , are too long for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their length , be properly brought within a Magazine review , are the lives of obscure individuals , little calculated to excite attention , and would , therefore , convey an inadequate idea of the work . We merely say , therefore , that many of the articles , while they have all the variety of situations which gives attraction to the modern novel , have the additional merit of truth also . To conclude , then , we say that Mr. Drake has done and deserved well , and we hope that he will persevere in the department he has chosen . There are errors which he may correct ,  --  defrciencies which he may supply , and redundancies which he may retrench . He has done much ,  --  he may yet do more . If we have been free in commenting upon what we think the faults of his book , it has not been to depreciate its value or hinder its sale , but rather to set him right where we think he has been wrong . No author , worthy of life , has ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who deserved to die , ever been kept alive by the breath of flattery.
