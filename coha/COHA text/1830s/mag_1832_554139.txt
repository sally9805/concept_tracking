txt If the excellence of a work consist mainly in its adaptation to the professed object for which it was written , this truly is one of the best productions on the subject of Chemistry , that we have ever examined . In the preface , the author informs us , that the object of this work is to present the science in the most intelligible form to those who are learning its elements ' ; and the principles laid down , the facts adduced in support of these principles , and the mode of their presentation , are all in keeping with the design . Throughout , the whole , he evidently proceeds on the ground that the students for whose use it was prepared , are entirely unacquainted with the subjects of which it treats ; that he is writing for the novice and not for the initiated ; and he endeavors , and we think very successfully , to find his way into the mind of the pupil , and to fix there the knowledge presented to him . ' When Sir Humphrey Davy composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different object in view ; namely , to classify and arrange the great phenomena of the science in such a manner , that Chemistry , arrayed in all the glories of his brilliant discoveries , might not fear to take her proper rank with her sister sciences . Though he probably fell short of what was due from his fine genius , he produced a very valuable work for the master , but not such an one as the student wants . Dr. Henry 's Elements of Experimental Chemistry ' is in some degree chargeable with the same defect ; for it is evident , that his eye is directed rather to the new discoveries in the science , than to what has long been known ; and that in the composition of the work he was thinking more of chemists than of learners ; so that while he is careful not to depart from the dignity of science , he has failed of communicating all that interest to his work , which it ought to have to recommend it to those who have but just entered on the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive editions present a fair view of the progress of the science . But however excellent the works just mentioned are , the one as show .. // ing great genius in generalizing , and the other a sound judgment , they are neither of them well adapted to he text-books in our colleges . In the preface to the work before us , the author remarks , that The materials of this work have been gradually accumulating since 1802 . They have been drawn from scientific journals , from the transactions of learned societies , and from the principal writers who have flourished since the middle of the last century ,  --  the Augustan age of Chemistry . From works of an earlier date , light has been occasionally derived , as well as from notes and recollections of the instructions of the distinguished teachers , to whom the author was formerly so happy as to listen . In this view , he takes particular satisfaction in naming the late Dr. Murray of Edinburgh , and Professor Thomas C. Hope , still a distinguished ornament of the university in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own experience , and from his personal communications with others , are introduced , with occasional figures , for illustration ; and in the notes , many miscellaneous facts are preserved . In the immediate preparation of this work for the press , the original memoirs of authors and discoverers have been often consulted , and the abstract has been frequently drawn from them , rather than from the elementary books ; but the analyses contained in the latter have not unfrequently been adopted ; sometimes even after a careful examination of the original ; and for this reason , among others , that the statements contained in them could be often , without injury , still further abridged . In such cases , several eminent elementary writers have been diligently compared on the same subject ; and thus omissions have been supplied , and obscurity has been removed , either by the comparison or by resorting to the first record . References to the original memoirs have been always preserved , when such memoirs were attainable ; and when the books containing them were not at hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credit has also , in most instances , been given to elementary writers for materials drawn from their pages ; but for brevity , and especially when the facts are the common stock of the science , the references have been sometimes omitted , or an initial letter only retained . There are , however , some works , to which a more particular acknowledgement is due . Those of Bergman and Scheele ; the lectures of Dr. Black , by Robison ; the system of Dr. Thomson , in all its editions , and also his more recent work on the First Principles of Chemistry ; the Dictionaries of Nicholson , Aikins , and IJre , // the Compendium of Dr. Hare , the Dispensatory of Dr. Coxe , the Technology of Dr. Bigelow , the Operative Chemist of Gray , and the Chemical Manipulation of Mr. Faraday ; the System of the late Dr. Murray , and his Elements , ably edited by his son ; as also the writings of Mr. Dalton ; the works of Lavoisier , Chaptal , Berthollet , and Fourcroy ; the System of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscellaneous writings , especially in connexion with Gay-Lussac ; and those of Dr. Priestley , Bishop Watson , Mr. Parkes , Professor Berzelius , and Sir H. Davy , including also his Elements ; - these are among the leading authorities , although it would be easy to increase the catalogue . A recent work by Dr. Turner , of the London University , has been of great utility . It is highly scientific and very exact , particularly on the facts and doctrines of definite and multiple proportions , and combining equivalents ; and many of its details have been adopted . ' Preface , pp. 4 , 5 . After the preface comes the pian of the work , which we shall again have occasion to notice , and then follows an introduction , containing a spirited sketch of the main branches of natural science , and the connexion between them . CHEMISTRY . The remaining branch of science relating to natural bodies , begins where natural philosophy and natural history stop . As the gleanings of its early history may be found in the prefaces of the larger elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annals of its infancy , and the delusions of its middle age . It would exceed our limits to trace the progress of Chemistry from age to age ; to unfold the delusions of ALCHEMY , whose object was to discover the philosopher 's stone , an imaginary substance , which , it was supposed , would convert the baser metals into gold or silver , or to speak of the equally delusive pursuit after the GRAND CATITOLIcON , or universal remedy , which was to remove every disease ; to avert death , and confer terrestrial immortality on man ; or to mention the imaginary ALCAHEST , or universal solvent , whose power it was supposed nothing could resist . The alchemists indeed imagined , that these miraculous virtues resided in one and the same substance , and during the dark ages , most of the cultivators of what was then called Chemistry , smitten with the delirium of Alchemy , pursued their occult processes in cells and caverns , remote from the light of heaven , and wasted their days and nights , their talents and fortunes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many valuable facts , which have been employed with good advantage , in laying the foundations of modern Chemical Science . // Some knowledge of chemical arts is coeval with the earliest stages of human society ; and it has happened with this , as with other branches of natural knowledge , that many facts were discovered and accumulated , in the practice of the arts , and in domestic economy , long before any general truths were established , by a course of inductive reasoning , upon the phenomena . The arts are all either mechanical or chemical , and not unfrequently both are involved in the same processes . The practices of the arts may be regarded as experiments in natural philosophy and chemistry . The object of the arts is usually gain ; but he , or any other person , who views the facts correctly , may reason upon them advantageously , and thus obtain important instruction . The Science of Chemistry , considered as a collection of elementary truths derived from the study of facts , can scarcely be referred to a period much beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been achieved since the middle of that period . It would be premature , to detail on the present occasion , the particular discoveries , which , like stars , rising successively above the horizon , have broken forth in rapid succession . Those discoveries , their periods and their authors , will be mentioned , in giving the history of each particular substance . At present , it would not be proper to attempt any thing more than to convey to those to whom the subject may be new , a general conception of the nature , extent and objects of the 5cience of Chemistry , reserving the details for the time when they will be both the most intelligible and the most interesting . *DEFINITION. * Ghemistry is that science which investigates the composition of all bodies , and the laws by which it is governed . Not satisfied with the knowledge of the external properties and the mechanical relations , which are unfolded by natural history and by physics , but taking them into view , and retaining and using their principal discoveries , chemistry proceeds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ence in earth , sea , and air . Earth , air , fire , and water , were the four elements of the ancient school . They have , however , yielded to analysis , and water , bland and simple as it seems , contains two bodies , whose properties are entirely different from its own and from those of each other ; burning , when mingled and ignited in large quantities , with violent explosion ; and in a small stream , with a heat , which melts and dissipates the firmest substances . We should never have conjectured that water , whose great prerogative it is * For various definitions the student may see the principal authors , Thompson , Fourcroy , Henry , Murray , La Grange , Th*nard , Davy , 3rande , Turner , Hare , and others . ' // to extinguish fire , contains both a combustible and a supporter of combustion . The air , the pabulum of life to the whole animal and vegetable creation , mild and negative like water , is not simple , but incidentally contains many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which , and that constituting four-fifths of the whole , is , and was intended to be , in a high degree noxious and even deadly to animal life , and fatal to combustion . The air does not destroy life instead of invigorating our frames , and extinguish instead of inflaming combustion , because the prevalent noxious principle of the air ( nitrogen ) is balanced by a life arid firesustaining principle , ( oxygen ) too vigorous to be trusted alone , and therefore diluted exactly to the proper degree by the opposite principle ; both being , by another extraordinary provision , sus* tamed , in constant proportion , and thus producing a salubrious and unchanging atmosphere . The earth under our feet , the soil , the sand , the gravel , the firm substance of the rocks , is not simple . In this ancient but assumed element , we have a double complexness . The one imagined simple earth contains at least nine , and each of these is again complex , containing for one principle , oxygen , the same that exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine or ten varieties of metals or combustibles , none of which are known in common life . He who is acquainted with the wonderful effects of chemical combination , will not think it strange that half the weight of marble is carbonic acid , and that metals , when combined with oxygen , resemble very exactly the earthly substances . Light as well as heat , is contained in common fire , and therefore it is not simple , unless fire and heat are varieties of one and the same thing . Modern research has proved that , besides light , which , in its seven prismatic colors , is contained in the solar beam , there is also , in this emanation , an opake , radiant principle , which accompanying light and heat , neither warms nor illuminates , but acts to decompose certain chemical compounds ; that there are opake rays which warm but do not illuminate , and illuminating rays which are cold to the sense of living animals , but impart to the universe its splendid drapery of colors ; and that , associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising power , which imparts magnetism to a needle , and gives it the properties of the load-stone . But we have used the word element without defining it . An element is an undecomposable body ,  --  it is therefore siniple , or in other words , not reducible to any other form of existence . // We must , however , care fully distinguish between real elements , and those which are such only in relation to the present state of our knowledge . When modern science speaks of a body as elementary , it intends nothing more than that it has not been decomposed . It is therefore simple as far as we know , but it is possible that by future efforts , it may be decomposed . Although we have no reason to doubt that there are real elements , we can not say that we are certainly in possession of any one element . It is , however , perfectly safe to reason upon bodies as elementary , until they are proved to be compound . Iron is , as far as we know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in any simple form ; all we can do , is to alter its size and figure , without at all changing its nature . But iron rust , or the scales which fly off when red hot iron is hammered , are not simple ; they consist of iron combined with oxygen , one of the principles of the atmosphere ; we can explain these substances in a simpler form ; the iron which they contain can be separated from the aerial principle , and both can be exhibited apart , and thus the proof will be complete ; red lead and red precipitate are still better examples , because the former can be partially , and the latter wholly , brought back to the condition of metals , by simply heating them . The four ancient elements , earth , air , fire , and water , were assumed at hazard , because they are so conspicuous and important ; the conception was grand , but it was wholly erroneous . Instead of four elements , we have at the present time not less than fifty , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly combustibles and bodies which , combining with combustibles and metals with peculiar energy , are generally called supporters of combustion. * Our simple bodies then are , 1 . Metals , about . . . . . . . 401 2 . Combustibles not metallic , . . . . 74- 3 . **34;470;TOOLONG , . 2or3 4 . One body , or possibly two , t of an undetermined character , in all . . . . 50 or 51 5 . Imponderable bodies , light , heat , and electricity ; besides the power called magnetism and the other varieties of attraction . * Some object to this phrase , preferring to consider combustion as being only an example of intense chemical action ; this view is philosophical ; but combustion is so frequent an occurrence , and involves so many important chemical events , that it is convenient , in accordance with the general practice of mankind , to designate it and the bodies contained in it , by a peculiar phraseology. ' * It is perhaps doubtful , where some of these bodies ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The principal object of Chemistry is to display , first , the great powers upon which its phenomena depend ; and , secondly , the properties of the elements , the mode and energy of their action , the combinations which they are capable of forming , the properties of the resulting compounds , and the laws by which they are governed . This statement obviously includes all bodies , natural and artificial . There are many chemical compounds made by art , which , as far as we are informed , do not exist in nature , and there are many natural bodies which art has not yet been able to imitate . ' Vol . I. Introduction , pp. 14-19 . We have already expressed the opinion , that this work is eminently adapted to the object for which it was prepared , and one circumstance which shows that it is so , is the vast number of interesting facts contained in it , illustrating most distinctly and satisfactorily the principles of Chemistry . They are drawn , not merely from the experiments of the laboratory , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand processes of nature . They are not only such as are found scattered through elementary works and scientific journals , but they are also such as the author himself gathered from his own experience and observation , during the nearly thirty years which he has devoted to the subject . They are also , many of them at least , related in a manner so distinct , graphic , and attractive , as to prove that he is not only a close observer , but a warm admirer of this class of the phenomena of nature . Now this is just what the student wants , as one said a few days since , who was endeavoring to glean some knowledge from a dry text-book . I should be very much interested in Chemistry , if I could find data . ' It is peculiarly a science dependent upon facts , which are needed to give a local habitation to its doctrines ; and without them , though one should write a system with all the acuteness of Aristotle , and the elegance of Plato , it would not interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divinity , compared with the narrations of the Evangelists . Every science has its metaphysics , and we know there are some who would prefer a cold statement of the abstract principles of Chemistry ; just as there are those , who , from their attachment to Anatomy , would feel more interest in a naked skeleton than they would in a form through which life pours its mantling tide , and in which intelligence dwells . And we apprehend that in the progress of investigation and discovery , the tendency is to lay aside facts and to dwell on principles . One chemical philosopher , in all the // ardor of original investigation , arrives at certain conclusions , which he publishes to the world with the facts upon which they are built , and the uses to which they can be applied . Another , adopting these conclusions as his premises , while he says little about those facts or those uses , presses on in the field of discovery , and in his turn enlarges the boundaries of knowledge . And it has happened , that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those interesting phenomena , upon which its great principles are founded , and in the discussion of the practical application of those principles ; while they are fuller than the older systems of the doctrines of the science . This is the case with Dr. Turner 's recent work ; which is worthy of all praise for the philosophical accuracy of its statements , and yet has very little attraction for one who has just entered on the study of the science , as we have had good opportunity of knowing . And here we are happy to fortify our opinions , by quoting the kindred sentiments of Dr. Ure , from the preface of his Dictionary of Chemistry . It must however be confessed , that the listlessness with which chemical systems are frequently perused , is not entirely the fault of the reader . Too many of these books are dry compilations of names , qualities and numbers , in methodical complexity , containing no intelligible examples of chemical inquiry ; nay , hardly a trace of the genius of discovery or of the splendid course which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the selection of a great number of facts , led the author to dwell on those doctrines , that are the most important and interesting ; and this is another circumstance , which renders the work well adapted to the purpose for which it was prepared . When Nicholas Lemery published his course of Chemistry , we are told that it was devoured like a novel , and we are disposed to believe , that by a selection , of certain topics , illustrated in a suitable manner , a book might be prepared which would be equally attractive at the present time . Let the grand doctrine of caloric be exhibited , with its various phenomena of radiation and slow communication ; in its vanishing and re-appearing forms , according as it becomes latent or sensible , with its several sources and its powerful effects , whether they are seen in clothing the earth with verdure and working into life the tribes that people it ; in changing the dimensions and the state of bodies by its expanding // and decomposing power ; or as they appear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over nature ; and in the volcano , which sends forth from the interior of the earth its desolating flood . Let the simple combustibles , such as carbon , phosphorus , sulphur , and hydrogen find a place ; and the grand supporter of combustion , oxygen , in its several states , solid in union with the metals , liquid in the water we drink , gaseous in the air we breathe ; united with one class of bodies to form the alkalies , earths and oxyds , and with another to form the common acids ; expanded in large quantities to support animal life , and , by a beautiful arrangement of Providence , restored to the atmosphere by the vegetable creation . To these should be added chlorine , some of the more important metals , some of the proximate vegetable principles . It would be highly important not to omit galvanism , with its wonderful phenomena , and the laws of affinity , especially as they are exhibited in the doctrines of definite proportion . Let these and some other topics be selected and presented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same spirit with which Sir Humphrey Davy wrote his last work , though ifl a less ambitious style , and the science could not fail of awakening a deep interest , and of securing more attention than it now does . Chemistry has become very extensive in its ordinary branches and applications , and we see not why the same course should not be taken in preparing works for the learner , on this as on most of the other sciences . He who prepares a work for schools and colleges , on arithmetic , or algebra , or geometry , does not think it necessary to include in it the theory of numbers , or of analytical functions , or the porisms recorded by Pappus ; and for the plain reason , that these investigations would not only be of no use to the student in his incipient course , but from their intricacy , would be actually discouraging 's and Henry 's , there are subjects introduced , with which it is impossible that a student should become acquainted in the time usually allotted to the study of Chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbling-blocks in his way . We are happy to find that M. Lavoisier justifies this view of the subject , in the course which he took in the composition of his work ; though the reasons for it , owing to the progress // of the science , are much stronger now than they were when he wrote . Having omitted the subject of affinities , he remarks in his preface that he had done so , because he considered the science of affinities as holding the same place with regard to the other branches of Chemistry , that the higher or transcendental Geometry does with respect to the simple and elementary part. * In the work before us , Professor Silliman , while he has conformed to the common mode of saying something on every substance , has , for the most part , bestowed attention upon each according to its relative importance , presenting some of them in a strong light , and casting into the shade others of less importance . The next circumstance to be mentioned , which renders this work well adapted to the object for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been prepared for the purpose of presenting to thorough-bred chemists a logical view of the various substances in nature in their relations to each other , perhaps the order in which the subjects are treated , would not have been in every respect the most scientific ; while it may be the best that could be devised for those for whose use it was especially designed , and who are supposed to know absolutely nothing on the subject of Chemistry . The problem to be solved was , what is the arrangement best adapted to awaken and sustain an interest in their minds , and communicate to them clear and adequate views of the science ? and from his long experience and great success as a teacher , we think that no one is better qualified than the author to furnish a solution . There is an inherent difficulty in the case , which does not exist in the exact sciences , and it is not surprising that a man trained in these , should be dissatisfied with any system that can be proposed . Bodies are frequently related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in their ultimate principles . For instance , carbonate of potash and carbonate of soda agree with each other in being made up in part of carbonic acid ; and after this is removed by lime , the two substances , potash and soda , agree in being made up in part of oxygen ; and after this is removed by iron turnings or charcoal , the two substances agree in being metallic . Now let a classification be adopted , founded on either of these relations , and there will be practical inconveniences of one kind or another , if the system be carried through . For particular bodies it would // not be very difficult to determine what should be the arrangement , yet a mode that would answer for these , would not answer for all others . Among the British chemists , there is considerable diversity in their systems of arrangement , and which of them has adopted the best , it would be rather difficult to say ; we are sure it is not Dr. Thompson , however meritorious he may be in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance has been attached to a logical system , just as theologians formerly thought lightly of doctrines , which could not find a place in some body of divinity . Instead of entering at large into arguments in support of our opinion , we shall barely allow ourselves space to quote a paragraph from Dugald Stexvart ' s Dissertation on the Progress of Philosophy . Page 248 , 1 dis . part II . The passion of the Germans for systems , is a striking feature in their literary taste , and is sufficient of itself to show that they have not yet passed their noviciate in philosophy . ' " To all such , " says Mr. Mc Laurin , " as have just notions of the Great Author of the Universe and of his admirable workmanship , all complete and finished systems must appear suspicious. ** At the time when he wrote , such systems had not wholly lost their partisans in England , and the name of system continued to be the favorite title for a book , even among writers of the very first reputation . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Complete System of Optics , by Smith , titles which , when compared with the subsequent progress of these sciences , reflect some degree of ridicule upon their authors . ' In the plan of the work before us the author remarks , I have not thought it best to describe the simple substances in uninterrupted succession . Such a method does not appear to me to present advantages sufficient to compensate for the inconvenience of plunging at once into the most complex parts of the science ; which must be done , if we would draw the elementary bodies from their combinations , and present them in the beginning in a connected view . ' p. 1 . The natural process of acquiring knowledge is the analytical , or the progress from the complex to the simple , from the whole to its parts ; the shortest is the synthetic , that is , from the simple to the complex ; from the parts to the whole ; and this is the course now more generally pursued in Chemistry . If our knowledge were perfect , this would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and perhaps that mode will be found to combine // most advantages , which unites them both . With this view , I have therefore sometimes adopted the one and sometimes the other , aiming to present the most important elements and combinations as early as possible . ' p. 2 . In teaching , the great object should be , to find our way into the mind of the pupil , and to fix there the knowledge that we present to him . He is ordinarily no judge of our theoretical views , with regard to classification and arrangement ; he will in most cases even fail to understand us , when we discuss them ; and he will be best satisfied with that course , which , in the most interesting and intelligible manner , presents to him the greatest amount of useful knowledge . Both in my public courses of lectures , and in the present work , I have , therefore , considered this object as paramount in importance to every other . ' p. 3 . Another circumstance which adds very much to the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrines of Chemistry in their connexion with the practical arts of life . There is enough , indeed , in the grand and beautiful phenomena they unfold , to awaken interest and secure a generous and lasting attachment to the science from its own intrinsic excellence and beauty . But it must be confessed , that the amor habendi has gained a place in so many hearts , that even science herself is loved mainly for the dower she brings . You must convince men that Chemistry will enable them to increase their wealth , before they will consider the study of it as worthy of their attention . It was said by one , who had borne the honors of his country , and by his counsels had helped to increase her resources , in speaking of a young lady who was about to commence the study of Chemistry , Why , if it will help her to make a better pudding , let her study it . ' Now to men of this class , who value every thing as it contributes to the amount of national or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts , presents strong claims , as the experience of France can testify . Formerly , the arts were enveloped in mystery and concealment . They stood separate from each other , and a knowledge of some one of them was frequently transmitted from father to son as a valuable inheritance . But the lights of modern Chemistry have disclosed these confidently treasured secrets ; and besides introducing a great many new arts , have shown a connexion between those already known , that was not suspected to exist before . It is in this way that Chemistry , by discovering the laws of nature , has been a source of wealth to those who have applied // these laws to the practical arts of life , and enabled them to realize for themselves and their country , that of which the votaries of alchemy only dreamed . Professor Silliman has generally mentioned the uses to which the various substances described are applied , and not unfrequently , some of the processes by which this application is made . As , for instance , under silicia , he mentions some particulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process for making porcelain and pottery ; and under nitre , the mode in which gunpowder is made . This work was needed . It was due from the author that he should promote the science by his pen , as he had long done by his lectures . It was due to the Institution with which he has been connected , with so much reputation to both . The science has undergone almost as many changes as the objects in the vegetable , the animal , and mineral kingdoms , which it investigates , though no valuable truth is lost . Omnia mutantur , nil intent . Take as an instance the theories of combustion . At one time , the doctrine of phlogiston prevailed , with its successive modifications . In place of this , the views of Lavoisier were brought forward , and his house , we are told , became a temple of science , where the Parisian chemists held a festival , at which Madame Lavoisier , in the habit of a priestess , burnt Stahl 's Fundamenta on an altar , while solemn music played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines of Davy . A science thus constantly changing requires a work suited to its present condition , enriched as it has been within a few years by a succession of brilliant and useful discoveries , and such a work is the one before us.
