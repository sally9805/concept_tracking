txt SEVERAL years since , a few gentlemen of intelligence in the Northwest associated themselves for the purpose of col // lecting facts relating to the Indian character , condition , &amp;c. , and putting them into a shape to he preserved . The first suggestion of this society came , we believe , from Mr. H. II . *choolcraft , who was very properly placed at the head of it , and who gave the name , " Algic , " by which it was known , - a term formed from the Indian word from which Alleghany is taken , and denoting " all that family of tribes , which , about A. D. 1600 , was spread out , with local excej ) tIons , along the Atlantic , between Pamlico Sound and the Gulf of the St. Lawrence , extending northwest to the Missinipi of Hudson 's Bay , and west to the Mississippi . " Mr. Schooleraft at once set himself at work to fulfil the purpose for which this society was formed , or rather , began to arrange his past labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have not heard what was done by others . It is probable , that Mr. Schoolcraft alone has produced any useful result , though other members may have encouraged his zeal , and urged on his progress . In the " General Considerations , " prefixed to the volumes , of which the foregoing is the title , Mr. Schoolcraft remarks , upon the collections he has made respecting the Indians , that " materials exist " ( that is , have been collected by him ) " for separate observations on their oral traditions , fictitious and historical ; their hieroglyphics , music , and poetry ; and the grammatical structure of the languages , their principles of combination , and the actual state of their vocabulary . " Out of these materials he has chosen , for pressent publication , the " Oral Tales , " which form a " First Series " of his " Algic Researches . " When the other series are to appear , " will depend , " Mr. Schoolcraft says , " upon the interest manifested by the public in the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mass of original papers , the accumulation of nearly twenty years . " That this interest will be manifested , we not only hope , but believe . We can not admit , that the opportunity to acquire such valuable stores of information on the " mythology , distinctive opinions , and intellectual character " of the Indians , is likely to be lost through lukewarmness , or want of proper patronage , on the part of the reading public . These interesting points relate to a race , which , from being the sole possessors of the Western hemisphere , - the new world which Columbus discovered and opened to the old , // has dwindled into fractions of people , fast becoming less and less , with a principle of decay mingled in their institutions , or pervading their customs , which threatens them , in spite of all the efforts of philanthropy and conservative legislation , with extinction in the course of a few generations . However we may regard the causes which have produced this result , and wherever we may incline to fix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the less value all memorials that give us an insight into the habits and opinions of this fated race . In the same degree that we deplore the hard destiny that is hunting it down , and feel a sorrowful conviction that it is inevitable , we shall prize all evidences that are recorded to assist us , and those who may come after us , in judging of them in these respects . No traveller has ever been among the Indians without gathering up something , which he considered illustrative of their customs , languages , or history , well knowing that the public curiosity was awake to all such sketches ; that they dashed a spice into his pages . Thus far we have had but small means to determine the authenticity of these accounts . they were often discredited by disagreenient , but we had no standard by which we could determine the right . In the works which Mr. Schoolcraft now gives to the public , and those which are to follow , we may flatter ourselves , that this standard is likely to be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar . Before he became fixed among the Indians in an official capacity , he had passed through their wide-spread country in many and various directions , as his " Travels show . He had thus far seen them under all the aspects which present themselves to the eye of ordinary travellers . His hooks of travels all contain much information relative to the tribes he saw ; but this information was necessarily superficial , excepting as to externals , numbers , &amp;c . In this respect he was like his predecessors , excepting , perhaps , that he did not profess to have seen so much as they . It is well known to all who have had even a slight acquaintance with the Indians , that they are wrapped up in a close reserve before most of the whites , - all of them , with whom they have not become familiarized by long intercourse . Rapid observers , such as all travellers are , see little except this assumed exterior , which is intended to conceal , perhaps // to mislead . And it is most naturally impenetrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such persons catch only views of the surface , and are left to conjecture as to all beneath . These conjectures , as might be expected , have been wild and jarring . Still , they were all , or nearly all , we were likely to have . It was scarcely probable , that any intelligent and well-educated man would be among the Indians for a series of years , upon a footing of unreserved intimacy , making the study of their character a constant object of zealous and benevolent pursuit . The sacrifice appeared to be such as very few would be willing to make . But Mr. Schonicraft has been in that position with what qualifications to improve it , the public well know . Soon after his return from his travels with Governor Cass , in 1820 , Mr. Schoolcraft determined to fix himself on the verge of the Northwest settlements , whence he might leisurely survey the grounds over which he had necessarily been hurried by the limits of a summer 's tour , and where he might also have the Indian constantly under his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly he accepted an appointment under the government in the Indian Department , which established him over a large area as Superintendent of the Indians , having paternal relations with them , which must lead , in due course of time , to circumstances of intimacy , most favorable to the designs of a liberal curiosity . But this was not the chief advantage which Mr. Schoolcraft enjoyed . In this he might have been only on a footing with many of his contemporaries or predecessors , except in his literary tastes , and his fondness for investigation . At the Sault Ste. Marie , which was his station , Mr. Schoolcraft found an Irish gentleman , who had early obeyed the impulse of an adventurous spirit , and left his native country to embark in the fur-trade , a calling , which , at that time , held out strong inducements to all who were to be lured by a love of novel enterprise , as well as by a promise of easily gotten wealth . Mr. Johnson , while yet a young man , had established himself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper seasons , into the regions of Lake Superior . Thus he became acquainted with one of the principal chiefs of that region , whose daughter he married , as has been detailed by Mrs. Jamneson , in her recent Ram // bles among the " Upper Lakes . " The eldest daughter by this marriage , at a suitable age , was taken home to Ireland by her father to be educated , where she found a kind and efficient patronage in several ladies of rank , who took delight in watching the effect of cultivation on an exotic from so remote a region . She was brought back by her father to her distant home , with every intellectual accomplishment which an apt mind could acquire in the course of a few years . Not many years after this , she became the wife of Mr. Schoolcraft . This allusion is made to domestic events , as having a strong bearing upon Mr. Schoolcraft 's fitness for the undertaking he has in hand . Mrs. Schoolcraft became a most zealous and efficient coadjutor of her husband in his researches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mothertongue , she combined a thorough knowledge of that of her mother . Through her the Indians , or a select portion of them , were admitted to the fireside of the agent as relations , having all the kindly privileges of such , and throwing off the reserve habitual with them under most connexions with the whites . Affinity smoothed the way to familiarity . Under these circumstances , Mr. Schoolcraft has been maturing the collections , from which the Tales now published are taken , and which will enable him to illustrate their hieroglyphics , music , and poetry ; three sources of illustration which are likely to shed much light on the aboriginal mind , tastes , and history , as they strongly mark a race in its primeval stages , anti also to illustrate the still higher department of information connected with their language . In reference to this last branch of Mr. Schoolcraft 's inquiries , his " Preliminary Observations " exhibit many hints , which show the important conclusions to which they may lead . There is no doubt , that language is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be modified , it may be obscured , until all obvious traces of connexion are lost . Yet something remains to meet the eye of patient and discriminating inquiry , which lends a clue , when no other guide could be found . Mr. Schoolcraft , it appears by the hints we have alluded to , has been enabled through this aid , to ascertain relations between tribes , which con0regate them into larger classes than we have heretofore // felt authorized to admit . The present is not the time to follow out the train of thoughts that these hints would lead to . We refer to them now merely to point out the value of the information which the public may receive , provided Mr. Schoolcraft he encouraged to fulfil his plan . It is proper now to turn our attention to the " Tales , " which form the " First Series " of this work . Early in his residence among the Indians , Mr. Schoolcraft became aware of the importance of " oral traditions " in developing the bent of their minds , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imagination ; and , assisted by the favorable aids which his domestic ties constantly afforded , he began to collect those which arose from accident , as well as a greater number that were elicited by a kindly spirit of inquiry among the occasional inmates of his household . He saw , as he advanced in this work of collection , that the harvest would fully reward the toil of gathering it ; that he was unfolding a view of the past , as well as of the present that , among the vivid sketches of manners and customs , superstitious observances and supernatural agencies , influencing the destinies of individuals , of families , and of tribes , he was catching glimpses of revolutions , physical , moral , and national , of the bearing of which the narrators themselves were probably but imperfectly , if at all , aware . A rude people , who have no records , no literature , no outward monuments , preserve the knowledge of events , whether personal , local , or general , by tradition , that is , by stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father to son , ever changing , no doubt , in form and expression , but essentially the same . The main fact , the original event , still glimmers like a spark beneath smouldering embers or ashes . Regarding these Tales in this light , as the vehicles that have conveyed down , through an unknown series of ages , the recollections of a people , that have no other means of preserving them , Mr. Schoolcraft has not put upon them an undue value ; he has not miscalculated the interest they must sooner or later excite ; nor is he mistaken in supposing , that they will suggest a thousand inferences to correct past errors , and lead aright for the future . In the first place , we must endeavour to feel satisfied , that they are genuine , that they have been rendered faithfully , // or with only such modifications as are inevitable in the course of interpretation , or were required to purge some of them of the grossness which often intermingles with the narratives of a barbarous people . With these exceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true reflections of the " oral traditions " of the Indians ; that nothing has been intentionally added , or taken away , with the exception just mentioned. * If we had not confidence in Mr. Schoolcraft 's integrity , which would restrain him from palming upon the public a series of stories as aboriginal , which were mainly of his own invention , there is much internal evidence of their being the unadulterated offspring of untutored minds of savages . They are often disjointed , extravagant , and repulsive , and most of them could , with a little art , have been improved in all these respects , if the plan had been merely to make them the groundwork of an attractive work of imagination . We believe Mr. Schoolcraft , at first , feeling some distrust whether the Tales would be acceptable or popular in their present shape , thought of submitting them to some polished pen , which , like the pencil in respect to many of the Indian portraits that have been given to the public eye , would have detracted from their merit in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the public , that he did not yield to this idea . The standard which we now have for measuring indian intellect , and judging of Indian imagination and powers of invention , of Indian mythological notions and superstitions , - a true standard , as we are fain to believe , - would have been falsified and erroneous . We should still have been left a prey to the fancies of authors , who could paint the Red man en beau , with little chance , among their readers , of discriminating the creatures of the brain from the realities of the forest . Mr. Schoolcraft observes , that he found those , who were professionally the relaters of tales , were also the depositaries of historical traditions . Hence history and fiction were often wildly intermingled , the landmarks of the former being Since we have been engaged in these remarks , we happened to allude to " Peeta Kway , or the Tempest , " to an intelligent " half-breed , " who had not seen Mr. Scboolcraft 's work . She immediately stated , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then repeating substantially the whole of it . // lost in the confusion . But he finds a stamp upon them , whether historical , mythological , fictitious and fanciful , or all combined , which gives a resemblance , wherever heard , by whatever tribe related . This is obvious to the reader , who , in looking over those which come from different tribes , discerns many similar features , which bespeak a common parentage . This suggests an interesting consideration as to the great question of affiliation among the tribes , their arrangement into families or classes , in which the numerous sub-varieties and segregations should be merged . In this respect these Tales have a high value . And that this value might not be impaired by any extraneous ornament , or any attempt at fancied improvement , they have all been left as they were found ; their very defects , their occasional wildness and incoherency , and the revolting character of their incidents , being evidences of their genuineness . Mr. Schoolcraft has many ingenious conjectures as to the antiquity of these Tales . Nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as most of their allusions show an ignorance of modern arts and events . With few exceptions , not a hint is found in them that refers to improvements derived from the whites . They belong to the " era of flint arrowheads , earthen pots , and skin clothes . " Nature is untouched ; not a tree is cut down . " Tobacco * and " maize " are constantly alluded to , two species of plants which are known to have been peculiar to this hemisphere before its discovery by Columbus . We are surprised at their silence on the subject of " wild rice , " which is a grain in certain regions of the Northwest , of incalculable importance to the indians frequenting the waters where it grows . This omission , combined with other evidences of a higher and more remote Northwestern origin of the principal Tales , may lead hereafter to interesting speculations as to the migration of the Indians , the tendency from the Northwest to the Southeast , which has undoubtedly marked the history of all the tribes now remaining on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they render all nature social , endowing its various products , its birds , beasts , fishes , and trees , with the faculties of reason and speech , and powers of transformation , that give them peculiar influence over the fortunes of man , for good or for evil , like those that spring from a fellow-being . This propensity // to give animals , and even inanimate objects , such an intimate communion with the human race , belongs to all rude people , but is particularly conspicuous in the red man , as appears in their traditions . Their fewness , sequestered condition , and wandering habits deprive them of most of the social pleasures . The solitary hunter , the hermit of the forest , learns to look on all objects around him as his companions . Many of the animals surpass him in sagacity and in industry , and all of them in providing against the demands of xvant . This attracts his notice and commands his respect . He even trenches upon them , to appease his hunger , with reluctance , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a shade of cannibalism in it . Indeed , there are some of them which he never eats , but in the extremity of famine . rllhis same leaning upon animals for comfort and social pleasures , makes the Indian also regard the forest , the plains , hills , rivers , all as holding intercourse with him . From a higher sentiment than governed the " melancholy Jaques , " who found sermons in trees , heard music in brooks , and moralized upon the whole landscape around him , he literally looks up through nature to a great invisible Being , incomprehensible , and therefore terrible , and worshipped in and under all the sublime manifestations that speak him forth . Unused to that intellectual enjoyment that belongs only to refined society , the Indian finds , in the varieties of the scene abroad , the whispering branches that give him grateful shade , the high hill that affords him a noble prospect , the rapid river that sends him dancing on his wayward journey , a keener enjoyment than any domestic , any social pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become sublimated ; his dreams , wild ; his associations , imaginary ; arid his Tales all have the stamp of a moody , excited , visionary state of mind . It may be thought , that we have dwelt unnecessarily long on these preliminary reflections . We have indeed regarded the Tales themselves , independently of such reflections , as of secondary importance . It is true , they have an intrinsic merit , a merit such as a child would discover , who saw or thought nothing of the bearing they have on a most interesting and deep problem , connected with a portion of the human race . Those who have read them , with a constant reference to this bearing , can hardly separate the gratification proceeding // from this source , from that which might otherwise have been felt , in dwelling only on the invention , the wildness , occasional sublimity , severity of satire , high moralizing , and instruction , - for all these are interspersed throughout the Tales , - which the most cursory reader must find in them . After reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand and one oilier Oriental Stories , we are inclined to place these Occidental Tales not far behind them in all that does not depend on wealth and refinement for its effect . We will now turn to the Tales themselves , to see how far we are home out in this praise . The first is " Ojeeg . *nnung , or the Summer-Maker . " It is an Odjibwa tale , which tribe calls a certain group of stars , in the northern heavens , " Ojeeg Annung , " or the " Fisher Stars , " in commemoration of the event to which this tale relates . It was said hy a learned man of our country , that our present zones , our present climates , do not correspond with those which prevailed of old that certain natural phenomena can not he explained hut by supposing , that the position of the earth with respect to the sun has undergone a change . We may suppose , that the Summer-Maker alludes to some such change in the seasons , brought down hy Indian tradition . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supposed to descend through such a shadowy medium . The Indians rely upon the change of the seasons with a dependence unknown to civilized man , who has a thousand appliances and means to modify and correct its inconvenient or hurtful effects upon his condition . Where days , and months , and years , pass away , " and still the same " white cloak " covers the form of the earth , they become pinched with want , and finally stiffen and sink into the general mass of insensihility around them . A summer , hreaking in upon such a people , so situated , might naturally make an impression that ages could not efface . The distinction , which the wolverine , an animal not much known , receives in this tale , is not unsuited to his brisk and elastic habits and frame . * The " Celestial Sisters " would be regarded as a beautiful Tale in any language . It is well constructed , evolving * Michigan wilt find new reason for being pleased with the sobriquet , - Wolverine , - which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sufficiently dashed with extravagance to give them poignancy . The Shawnee 's imagination literally roved from earth to heaven in a fine frenzy , and with a finer invention . Waupee , or the White Hawk , is a hermit hunter . Such a separation from all kith and kin is not uncommon in the forest . No evils attendant upon the Indian are particularly aggravated by it . Food , raiment , these do not depend on society , neither do the alleviations of sickness in any efficient degree . If it be slight , his own means are sufficient ; if it be mortal , submission is the same in solitude as with the tribe . Waupee , therefore , makes little sacrifice in quitting all , and realizing the poetical wish of Cowper , who longed , in the inspiration or desperation of the moment , " for a lodge , " such as Waupee 's , " in some vast wilderness , some boundless contiguity of shade . " While thus apart from the world , this hunter discovered , in a remote prairie , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , not to abide upon it . His curiosity was excited , and , watching from a covert , he soon heard sweet music coming down from the sky , and accompanying a basket , which settled in a " magic ring , " of the prairie , and let down twelve beautiful sisters , who began to dance . Though all were beautiful , the youngest ( as usual ) was the most so . Waupee , accordingly , fell in love with her , and rushed from his hiding-place to woo or seize her ; when the whole group , offended at such intrusion , leaped into their basket , and reascended to heaven . Admonished by this failure , Waupee disguised himself , the next day , as an opossum ; but this animal appears to have been an object of suspicion even in that early day , and was no sooner seen by the lovely sisters , than they broke up the dance , and reascended as before . He succeeded better as a mouse the next day , and caught his favorite , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who returned no more to earth . Waupee wins his star-bride ( for the sisters were star-maidens ) by kindness , and she seems to be satisfied with the pleasures of earth , until a son is born , when the skyey influences begin to draw her upwards again , and she resolves to leave Wanpee and his planet . Her preparations are made secretly , and , having her basket all formed , she goes to the magic ring while her husband is hunting , and ascends to the stars with her child , Waupee 's ears catching the well-known // sounds , but all too late to arrest his wife and child . He is left disconsolate on earth many years . At last , the same natural longing for native scenes , which led his wife to desert the earth , leads the son , when he grows up , to wish to revisit it . The star-people consent , that the mother and child may descend and bring Wanpee up to their bright abodes . Waupee again hears the well-known music , again embraces his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takiug with him a len , wing , or tail , of any animal which he could kill , as a specimen for his father-in-law . A great feast greets the new comers , when each star present is allowed to take one of the specimens as his own . All approach to make the selection , when suddenly they become transformed into the fowl or beast , whose wing , foot , or tail had been taken up , and scatter themselves wildly through the heavens while Waupee , his wife and child , as white hawks , fly down to earth . We have thus given the entire skeleton of this tale , as a specimen of the general structure and design . It has more than usual unity in its arrangement , but is purely aboriginal in its scope and allusions . It gives a pleasing display of the gentler affections , and shows , that a savage may love " a bright particular star , " and win it too . its principal incidents are most happily made to turn on the anirnus reverlendi , the fondness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians . And the metamorphoses , that take place at the starfeast may easily be supposed to glance at some tradition relative to the constellations , when the bear , the swan , the wolf ( dog ) , fox , &amp;c. , were scattered over the firmament . There is a prominent moral in many of these Tales . Indeed most of them carry home to the heart a useful lesson of life , and were doubtless intended to inculcate it . The " White Feather , " a Sioux Tale , furnishes an example of the consequences of forgetting or neglecting wise injunctions , and yielding to the allurements of temptation , that may compare with many an allegory , in which the philosophers of old enforced their teachings of virtue . This " white feather , " on the possession of which , like some of the fabled helmets of antiquity , success in difficult contests is made to depend , is won through a dream , when giants of evil are overcome , until one of them , the last to be conquered , assumes the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been previous warning of her blandishments , first deludes and then betrays . Her victim loses not only his magic feather , but the form of a man , being changed into that of a dog , or wolf . But the moral does not end here . Practical justice is finally done . The dog suffers , hut is adopted by a modest and virtuous woman , whom he serves with skill and fidelity ; and , in due time , he is disenchanted , recovers his feather , and marries his kind patroness . Jamo , or the Undying Head , " from the Ottawa , is a true Tale of horrors , - a fine specimen of the raw head and bloody bones . It has , however , much invention , and most strikingly exhibits the Indian mind , its proneness to extravagance , belief in supernatural agencies , and dreaming superstitions. lamo is doomed to die , but death begins at his feet , and he cunningly directs his head to be cut off just as it reaches the neck ; thus saving his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play an important part in the destinies of his friends . The tale is crowded with adventures of the most extraordinary character , all for the sake of winning or preserving a wampum belt . This ornament , among the Indians , is of great value , and often invested with magic power . It has mysterious virtues , records traditions ( each brad being a sentence or a chapter ) , speaks from the dead to the living , and is transmitted down through generations with reverent care . No object can be more regarded , or more coveted . In this tale , a wampum , around the neck of a monstrous she-hear , and guarded by unnumbered obstacles and terrors , has been sought by thousands , who have fallen in the enterprise . Ten brothers renew the trial , and , by courage and stratagem , succeed in getting the belt . But they are pursued by the bear , which passes over whole latitudes at a leap . She would have left " seven-league hoots * behind . The brothers dream , and Manitos interpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last a dream reveals the " undying head . " It is resorted to , and the she-bear is overcome ; when , on her being beaten into fragments , each fragment turns into a cub , and runs off . Hence the race of hears . This Tale does not end here . But we have not time to pursue the fate of the ten brothers , who are all killed , and all brought to life again , while the " undying head " is reunited to its trunk , and recovers life and form in all its original vigor and dimensions . Nor have we space to pursue the refiec // tions which these incidents suggest to Mr. Schoolcraft , as to the aboriginal notions concerning the dead , the immortality of the soul , the resurrection of the body , &amp;c . We do not fully concur with him in the extent of the inferences he is inclined to draw from this tale ; thoijgh we believe that the human mind , in all its stages , even when " most uninstrucled and unenlightened , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is to introduce happiness to the race . " We do , however , infer from this tale , as well as from incidents scattered throughout these volumes , that there are certain impressions stamped on the human mind , bespeaking the common origin of men , and their common subjection to influences arising from certain great moral and physical changes , that no time , no climate , no dispersion , no degradation can wholly obliterate . Enough ever remains to tell the great truth , that " in the beginning** we were all the same . " Mon-dau-min , or the Origin of Indian Corn , " is an expressive and characteristic tale , though meagre in incident , and with no variety . It is the Cereal allegory of the West . The Indian is here taught , that the transformation can be effected only by labor and perseverance . There is much beauty of fancy in describing the change . It is to be regretted , that the idle savage does not seem to be more inclined to profit by the lesson it inculcates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great incarnation of the North " ; but he is too important a personage to be compressed within a page or two . He performs a conspicuous part in many of the Tales , - a sort of fact otuin on earth and in heaven . We do not , however , see the force of the expression , " incarnation of the North , " unless it be intended to mean more than we can allow ourselves to suppose . Much information respecting the distinctive opinions of the Indian can he derived from the contemJ ) lation of this character , which mingles in all things , from the sublime to the ridiculous . His power is comprehensive and minute in its workings , and the delineation of it shows the jumble of ideas which may accumulate in untutored minds . It is difficult to determine which of the remaining Tales most deserve our notice , in the brief space we have to spare . We are desirous of turning attention to those more particularly , which develope the mythological notions of the Indians , // and the points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early races of man in the old hemisphere . In the " lied Swan , " which is one of the most pleasing of the Tales , there is a descent into the regions of the departed , which , without any of the imagery that invests similar visits , descrihed by the ancient poets , clearly shows , that the red man has glimpses of " Pluto 's drear abode , " where the " good " stand apart from the " wicked " ; the one dwelling in " light , " and the other under a " dark cloud . " " The Weendigoes " are the Polyphemi of the Western wilds . Ulysses had not more need of courage and stratagem to overcome the giant Cannibal , who gorged himself on his companions , than the hunter , whose wife had been swallowed by a Weendigo " at a mouthful . " The revenge is brought about with much fanciful invention , and the incident of the son 's birth from the hollow of a tree , in which the bowels of his mother , scattered about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished Ovid with a good subject for a metamorphosis. f he Son of the Evening Star , " is a neat allegory , and has a new interest in the interpretation which it gives to the name of Michilimackinac , that island of the Lakes , so picturesque , so full of romantic tradition , so marked by the freaks of nature . There are constant allusions in these Tales to the manner in which birds have received their form or color , beasts their propensity to fatness or leanness , &amp;c. ; some of them evincing much fancy , others much drollery . The Indian is accustomed to look abroad on the infinite variety of form and color that marks animate and inanimate nature , and he may be supposed to indulge in many conjectures as to the cause . In one instance the woodpecker , who sat on a bough watching the ineffectual shooting of a warrior at a monster , gives a hint which leads to a successful shot , and , in reward for his service , has a dab of the victim 's blood upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is well known , that the duck has an awkward gait , its legs being placed very far behind , and its tail perked up more than is usual with fowls . This malformation the Indian attributes to a kick which the duck once received from the Manahozho upon the hind part , in punishment for having , after the vigilant manner of its kind , kept one eye open , when both were to have been shut . At the same time and // place , the beasts and birds took their character for fatness and leanness , the former being the happy consequence of an early and punctual attendance upon a feast given by Manabozho , and the latter the punishment of tardiness . The first corners served themselves , according to the old rule , first , and ate up all the fat and choice pieces , like the bear and the opossum ; while the moose , the martin , and others , the late corners , found only a fare , which has kept them the " lean kine " to this day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the moccasins play a part equal to the " magic carpet " of the Orientals . A young hunter has a pair made by his sister , and sets out in pursuit of adventures and a wife . He is directed to a village , where he receives instructions from an old woman , who sends him to another , whence none have thus far returned ; but gives him many helps and much admonition . The village is reached , and a lodge is found attached to the trunk of a tall tree , in which two beautiful sisters reside . It is in attempting to reach these fair ones , that so many have failed and been destroyed . The young adventurer immediately makes an effort to climb up to the lodge , but finds that the tree suddenly increases in height , bearing up the lodge with it , as fast as he ascends . Assisted by certain magic bones , with which he had been provided hy the old woman , he continues to ascend , while the tree grows , like " Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can get no bigher . Here the young man gets in , and addresses the sisters , and finds , as one speaks , the lodge inclines to ascend , and to descend as the other speaks . He accordingly keeps the latter conversing , until the tree had shrunk down to its usual height , when he kills the sisters and escapes . A hot pursuit is soon made by a powerful brother of the sisters , when , almost overtaken , the young hunter enters into the carcass of a dead moose in the way , and tells his moccasins to make tracks onward , which they do to the end of the earth , the pursuer following them up to that remote point , where alone he is undeceived . Retracing his steps , he finds the suspected carcass gone , and renews the pursuit . At the outset he had been enjoined to eat nothing until he had overtaken and punished his enemy . In violation of this injunction , he was induced , when hungry and faint , to taste some tempting fruit , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he eats , he is overcome , and his victor returns in triumph . " Puck Wudj Ininee , " an Odjibwa tale , speaks of the destruction of all the human species , excepting a boy and a girl , who were asleep when the catastrophe happened . This glimpse of such an event , and the more detailed account of a deluge in " Manabozho , " show , that the traditions of the forest shadow faintly forth a time when the earth was drowned , and all but a remnant of its inhabitants became extinct . Manabozho had killed an enormous water-serpent , when the floods rose , pursued him to the highest mountains , and submerged the loftiest tree upon them , in which he had taken refuge , and bathed his chin before they were stayed . While this Tale bespeaks a glimmering knowledge of that awful event in the world 's history , which left the ark alone afloat above the general desolation , it discloses also the strange mixture of the ridiculous with the sublime , before alluded to , which marks these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been destroyed , it was to be recreated , or restored , and Manabozho does this great work out of the mud clutched by a muskrat , which had died in the attempt , made at Manabozho 's request , to dive down to the bottom of the deep , combined with the carcass of a loon . We can hardly smile at these monstrous incongruities , when , while they show us how far the benighted Indian has wandered from the light of truth , they at the same time lead us to believe , that he may once have been near its source . " Mishosha , or the Magician of the Lakes , " is full of necromany and wonder-working . He is an evil spirit with great power , which he exerts only to injure or destroy . But he has daughters , who would cure as fast as he would kill . The self-moving canoe is an ingenious fancy , and the whole tale is a beautiful illustration of the power of innocence , which can invoke efficacious aids in all extremities , making even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally circumvented and destroyed near the Lake shore , and becomes a sycamore , a tree that always thrives by the waterside , and is mostly hollow*hearted. * * This is a Sagana tale , and the Saganas , Mr. Schonicraft says , are the Seminoles of the Northwest . They are now few in number , and have long been on the skirts of our settlements , but inaccessible to all approaches of civilization . The present chief of the tribe is a true Sagana , as an act of // We would gladly pause upon the " Fire-Plume , " in which the fate of Proserpine is reversed , a young man being rapt away from his companion , and borne to a nether region , by two women . His companion , who was asleep at the time , is held responsible for the lost one to his relations , and , according to the custom in such cases , is to pay the penalty by death . A certain time is allowed , near the expiration of which the condemned , while walking on the shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend , who had just come up from the caverns below to revisit his tribe .

Again he seeks his new relations , and again returns to the surface , his wife accompanying him . Their final departure for the waters is a fine specimen of descriptive writing . The day was mild , the sky clear ; not a cloud appeared , nor a breath of wind to disturb the bright surface of the water . The most perfect silence reigned throughout the company . They gazed intently on Wassamo and his wife as they waded out into the water , waving their hands . They saw them go into deeper and deeper water . They saw the waves close over their heads . All at once they raised a loud and piercing wail . They looked again , a red plume , as if the sun had glanced on a billow , marked the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife had disappeared for ever . " - Vol. ii . p. 150 . These desultory remarks may justify the opinion , that there is evidence of intellectual power in the Indians , such as they have not heretofore been supposed to possess . The common impression is , that they are of a saturnine disposition , disinclined to cheerful imaginations , and apt to look on all things around them with little or no sympathy . We have also been accustomed to regard them as exercising the mind only so far as the few practical concerns of life required . War , the chase , these alone were supposed to arouse them , to excite and employ their faculties . But we now his , which occurred not many years since , will show . In some quarrel among his tribe , he was wounded in the side , so that his liver obtruded through the wound . He seized the protruding part with one hand , while with the other he cut it off ; then deliberately cooked and ate it . He is still living , remarkable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have lively fancies , which can invest bird and beast , and even inanimate objects , with social qualities , that may surround them , even in solitude , with many of the charms of life . The stirring excitements of war and the chase are still paramount ; but these Tales show , that there may be something to enliven the wigwam fire ; that privations , pinching want , and piercing cold , may all be rendered endurable by traditions of Manitos , of lucky and unlucky loves , or of more mysterious hints of mighty agencies , that have convulsed the earth and changed the heavens . It is pleasing to believe , that this is the case ; that there are happy methods of softening affections which we feared were unchangeably obdurate , and that untaught and grovelling minds may occasionally be led into deep thought , giving them , though all unconsciously , perhaps , a new enlargement and elevation . We have made only one short extract from these Tales , as our object has not been with the nianrter , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it affected the latter . All externals must be considered as belonging in a great degree to the editor . The aboriginal dress is necessarily lost , or nearly so . The utmost simplicity of rendering should have been the aim . All elaborate language would seem to be a departure from the original meaning . That meaning alone it is desirable to see ; the ideas , as nearly as possible , as they came from the Indian 's lips . Strictness of adherence to the plain sense has no doubt governed the manner in most instances . Whenever it has not , when there has been an indulgence in fine writing merely , the graft , however ornamental , betrays itself . Most of the poetry is smooth in versification , and of appropriate and striking imagery . Some of it is quite beautiful ; but it seems to be misplaced in proportion as it is excellent . It leads to a distrust of the context . But these embellishments are not thrown over those tales which have the most important bearing on the question of Indian intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proofs of these qualities stand out in the main tales with no shade of doubt resting upon them . And for these we are indebted to the long , persevering , and discrimmating labors of rvfr . Schoolcraft , who , we most ardently hope , may be encouraged to persevere in them.
