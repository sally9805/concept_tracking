THE SPANISH HUSBAND ; or , FIRST AND LAST LOVE There are four different manuscripts at Harvard representing four different stages of composition of The Spanish Husband ; or , First and Last Love : first , The Painter of His Own Dishonor , a tragedy ( TS 4501.319 ) ; second , The Spanish Husband , a transformation of the tragedy into a tragi-comic opera , dated December 17 , 1824 ( TS 4637.32 ) ; third , a revision of the opera with the same title ( TS 4637.32.3 ) ; and fourth , an alteration of the opera into a tragi-comedy with the full title ( TS 4637.32.5 ) . The Painter of His Own Dishonor is in an unknown hand , perhaps that of a professional translator , as Payne had been commissioning work off and on for some time to at least one , a man named Sullivan to whom he wrote on February 7 , 1825 . In the three versions called The Spanish Husband textual revisions in various hands besides Payne 's are evident ; it seems possible , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peter Irving in the first version ( see F. P. Smith , Washington Irving and France , a Harvard thesis , unpublished ; Cambridge , Mass. , 1937 , p. 196 , n. 1 ) . In the British Museum ( L.C. 5/22/1830 ) is the copy , in an unknown hand , submitted to the licenser for acting ; this , which is much like the last of the Harvard texts , is reproduced here . In place of illegible readings in the licenser 's copy , legible ones have been added from the last Harvard text . The play , which was brought out anonymously at Drury Lane , May 25 , 1830 , was revived about half a dozen times during the year . Several months later , on November 1 , it appeared in New York at the Park Theatre . According to the reviewer in The Theatrical Observer , May 26 ( who incorrectly conjectures that Theodore Hook is the author ) , the London performance attracted a small house that nevertheless received the play more favorably than it deserved , for only the acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " The life of the play was too short to repay Payne for his long labor . He began work soon after the source , La Beaumelle 's Le Peintre de Son Dshonneur , a prose translation of Calderon 's tragedy El Pintor de Su Deshonra , appeared in Chefs-D'Oeuvre des Thtres trangers , Paris , 1822 . Intermittently during the next eight years Payne , aided by the general criticisms and , at an early stage , by the textual revisions of the Irvings , reworked the play at least four times . The first version , The Painter of His Own Dishonor , is a close rendering of La Beaumelle and , as the interpolation of a good many French phrases indicates , merely a rough draft . By December 17 , 1824 , he changed the tragedy into a tragi-comic opera , The Spanish Husband , with songs added and with the prose recast into blank verse . It is probably this version which Irving , in his letter to Payne , January 20 , 1825 , says that he and Peter are shortening ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Soon afterwards Payne rewrote the opera but failed to find a producer , as his letter to Irving , June 10 , 1825 , and that to Fawcett , January 7 , 1826 , show . Finally Payne changed the opera back to drama . Although The Spanish Husband is treated with considerable originality the reviewer 's opinion is correct : its language is " commonplace " and only " occasionally poetical , " and the intrigue plot , " wild and improbable , " as the characters are swayed erratically by the " heroic " motives of love and honor . CHARACTERS Don Carlos Don Alvar Don Salerno Don Hyppolito Benedetto Lissardo Celio Cardenio Another Spanish Captain Thomaso Jeronymo An Attendant A Masquerader Sailors Bianca Julia Cariola Flora The action takes place in Naples and Barcelona Main text ACT I. Scene 1 : Naples . A state apartment in the castle of St. Elmo . Servants preparing the decorations of the room , Lissardo superintending . Lis . Lissa rdo Hum ! Ha ! Very well . The roses here , the plate there ! Ho , Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his Excellency 's approach . Ha ! Paulo ! Is the fellow deaf ? A head like yours should have no lack of ears . Hurry ! Hurry ! Shouts and trumpets in the distance It would be well for some of you that I were Governor of his Majesty 's castle of St. Elmo for half an hour . There arc half a dozen of you that I should send to keep guard in the dungeon for the next century . The Signor Magnifico , Don Alphonso Alvar , is arrived this moment . Shouts and trumpets again . The Count Salerno enters , meeting Alvar. who is magnificently dressed Sal . Don Salerno Welcome , most noble lord , to Naples . Welcome , too , your lovely bride . A soldier 's hearty welcome ! Alv . Don Alvar Thanks , my good lord . My bride will thank you too , When she has first embraced her early friend , The lady Julia . I have left them now ; Like doves long parted they have flown together , Though mine 's the caged one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner longs to break no more . Alv . Don Alvar I 'll make it so , if most unwearied love Is worth her liberty . Sal . Don Salerno I 'm glad your travels Have ended thus in triumph . Little dreamed you When love for painting lured you to our land , To bear so fair a picture with you hence To witch the wonderers of Barcelona . Alv . Don Alvar Aye , noble sir , till now the brighter half Of this world 's bliss to me was in eclipse . Study , the arts , and more than all , that art By which the pencil , like a wand , detains All nature 's beauties , making them our own , And whiled my spring of life away , and left me In every treasure but affection , rich  --  Sal . Don Salerno Without which treasure even the rich are poor . Alv . Don Alvar I found it so . I felt the void Which makes the empty heart an aching heart . Sal . Don Salerno And so at last you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter ? Alv . Don Alvar To see her and to love her were but one . But there 's a waywardness in our affections Which shrinks from loving where ' t is wished we should . And when besought to meet Fabritio 's daughter , My stubborn will disdained to be thus forced ; I fled from Naples , wandered three long years , Hating the sex , and most of all her name Whom they would thus have bound upon my heart . My pencil was my mistress ; till one eve , Wandering amidst the rose and vineyard bowers That tissue Etna 's side , I heard a voice , The silver rival of the nightingale 's  --  Sal . Don Salerno Aye , the old tale , your freedom for a song . Alv . Don Alvar I turned and saw a vision by a fount , A form of bending beauty like a nymph , The guardian of the stream . My hasty step Disturbed the leaves . She raised a lightning eye , A cheek to which the glow of western clouds Were earthly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found her noble in her soul As in her beauty . Aye , the paragon . My fancy had conceived of female charms . Oh , then I thought how hopeless is late love . I writhed with jealousy when blithe eighteen Smiled with its ruddy lip upon the fair , But who can tell my sudden rapture when I found the wonder I had scarce dared dream of Was the self-same my friends had chosen for me The Count Fabritio 's daughter , the Bianca Whom I had scorned so long . Sal . Don Salerno ' T is a shrewd proverb , there 's a fate in marriage And I 'll be sworn now you yourself are yoked . You 'd preach the singly blest into bonds As earnestly as e'er you hated wedlock . Alv . Don Alvar Oh , could I make the bliss of chaste love felt Youth should never skulk in shame from bought embraces . Oh , could I make young luxury but feel The secret comfort which steals o'er a man Reading love 's truth in a wife 's honest eye The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don Salerno Once more I give you joy . You 've stolen a gem from our Italian mine That will flash living luster mid the pomps Of your proud Barcelona . Alv . Don Alvar No , she still loves the shade . Her sunniest smile Seems touched by nature with sweet melancholy , Like that which tints the maiden 's lip for love , Lost in the tomb . But no . She is too young To know an earlier love . I 'd hate the heart Were it an angel 's , that could have a thought , An image , but my own within its shrine . Sal . Don Salerno I long to greet this wonder love , my lord ; We 'll find them in the alcove . How years will fly ! It seems but yesterday , since on this knee She sat , a rosebud . My Julia 's playfellow , My son Hyppolito , ill-fated boy , I now remember spoke of her as one On earth unrivalled . Alv . Don Alvar My young lord Hyppolito , no evil as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sleeps where evil can not come . This day , ' t is three long years of bitterness Since my boy sailed for Spain . I was to blame . He called it exile . I was stern . He went in agony . The winds Were up that night . The mountain waves Covered our shores with wrecks ; and from that hour I never saw him more . Alv . Don Alvar What ! Lost at sea ? Sal . Don Salerno I know ' t is nature 's law that all must die And would have bowed my head to meet the blow But for remorse . I drove him to that death . He pressed me with solicitings that seem Like warnings of his fate against that voyage ; And thus we parted sternly , and forever ! Alv . Don Alvar Yonder they come , my lord : your lovely daughter And my fair bride . Enter Julia and Bianca Sal . Don Salerno Welcome , fair flower of Sicily , and take An old man 's blessing . May your years be smooth As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sparkling of those azure eyes ! Your path be roses , and your thoughts be joy . Bian . Bianca My lord , all praise to me is flattery ; And yet I thank the noble Count Salerno . Heaven grant I ever merit it . Aside Poor Hyppolito ! Cannon without What means that fearful sound ? Alv . Don Alvar Be calm , my love  --  a signal gun . Bian . Bianca Its sound was strange . Death 's herald ! ' T is Of what I know not . But my heart is chill . Jul . Julia Apart The color leaves her cheek ; her hand is ice . To Alvar The voyage has overpowered her , but , begone ! I 'll take her to her chamber . Sal . Don Salerno Come , my lord . I 'll lead you through our city . We have sights Well worth an artist 's eye ! Alv . Don Alvar Lead on , my lord . Nay , cheer thee up , my love . Repose thee for awhile . This bustling voyage Has worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Adieu . Rest ye both well . Exeunt Alvar and Salerno Jul . Julia Look up , Bianca love ! Bian . Bianca Thank Heaven , we are alone . Jul . Julia In tears , Bianca ? Bian . Bianca Alas , my Julia , even the sight of thee , Linked with the fatal story of my love , Raises the lost one from his watery grave ! Thou , the companion of my early thoughts , Who knowest the first fond feeling of this heart , Can pardon all its weakness . Jul . Julia From my soul ; For mine has suffered  --  Bian . Bianca Thine ? What ? Carlos false , Or has he perished ? Jul . Julia He lives ; yet lives to torture me . Gallant and gay and fond , yet each new face Threatens to lure him from me . Fickleness Is his delight . The gilded butterfly Roving from rose to rose is constancy To my light lover . Bian . Bianca But he comes again . He has not perished . Jul . Julia Then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son of a haughty father , matched from childhood To Spain 's proud daughter , thus my heart is filled With hidden doubts and fears . Bian . Bianca Oh , such concealments Are like a serpent nursed within the breast . There gnaws that serpent ! Julia , chide me not . True love 's a deathless spirit . Its gaze O'erlooks time 's gulf to seek its home in Heaven . Jul . Julia I deemed thee happy with the noble Alvar . He was your father 's choice , as I remember , When you and I and poor Hyppolito Lived in the fairy land of untold love . Bian . Bianca Are any happy ? Ah , the healthiest face May wear a nearer death beneath its bloom Than the pale cheek which has looked out its tomb . Jul . Julia You talk in riddles . Tell me all ; be plain . Bian . Bianca I gave Don Alvar all I had to give : A trusting spirit but a bankrupt heart . When my heart was with your brother drowned , For three long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded to a father 's will . I valued Alvar , knew him full of honor , Generous and gentle , though I could not love him . A  --  more than gratitude  --  a soft esteem , A twilight of affection dawned within me ; I felt the delicacy of his suit That nothing urged , though ardent was his love , And by a father 's sovereign will enforced Fondly , but silently , he gazed upon me And waited till my eye should turn and bless him . We wedded , and a tender friend he proved ; And day by day I found new cause to prize him , And day by day was softly wearing out Remembrance of the past , till , seeing you , With fearful power it rushed back on my mind . Oh , when that signal gun  --  Jul . Julia Our constant music . Forget it , dearest . Bian . Bianca ' T was to me the voice Of the death angel , calling me to turn From my own bridal to behold my love  --  Cannon again Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Jul . Julia ' T is nothing . Some newcomer at the port  --  Bian . Bianca It shrieks , " Hyppolito ! " Such sounds are heard In nights of storm . Oh , such a sound it was That sent its roar above the sinking ship That down the billows bore Hyppolito ! Enter Celio Jul . Julia Ha ! Celio ! The Prince 's page . What has befallen ? Speak ! Is your lord dead ? Cel . Celio The Prince is well and on his way to Naples . Jul . Julia Comes he today ? Have you no letters , sir ? Cel . Celio Lady , I have letters , But was commanded , ere I gave the letters , To ask a word in strictest privacy . Bian . Bianca I 'll leave you to confer . I 'll walk awhile About the garden . I am better now . When you have heard this page 's news , you 'll seek me . Apart Yes ! I 'll seek the scenes so much endeared in youth , Then close my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour !

Yet one thought Deeper than all throws beauty o'er ye all : First love ! First love ! Earth has no stronger spell . I 've struggled with thee , driven thee from my dreams , Weighed thee against a husband 's noble heart , And thought I conquered thee ; but here , one chance Has shaken all my wisdom , sunk my heart Into a hypocrite , made all my vows Empty as air ! First love ! Thy fatal flame Is quenched but with the grave ! Exit Jul . Julia But how is this ? You say the Prince has news of my lost brother ? You say the Prince knows that by Algerines Hyppolito was from the floating mast  --  How knows he this ? Was't then in slavery My brother died ? Cel .

Now to my father , to Bianca  --  Heavens ! Wretched Bianca ! Cel . Celio Lady , I am gone . The tidings shall be spread through Naples . Jul . Julia Hush ! Breathe not a word of it . The sound is death to Wretched Bianca ! Well , thy prophet heart Beat at the signal gun ! Go , tell your lord To keep the tidings secret as his soul . Aside Bianca sails tonight .

Cariola Benedetto , is n't Barcelona a charming place ? It gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without seeing something prodigiously well worth looking at . Ben . Benedetto No doubt you are of that opinion at this moment , Signora Cariola ; but , for my part , I see nothing to admire in it . Cari . Cariola Turn ing to him What a savage ! Ben . Benedetto Except when they have some public rejoicing , and then they may be endured . At all other times I never saw such a drowsy set as these Spaniards are . Not a laugh to be squeezed out of a hundred thousand of ' em . Compare ' em to the people of Naples , of merry , junketing Naples ; why , unless they 've something vastly uncommon to stir ' em up , you 'll see a whole street of ' em yawning like an oyster bed at the turn of the tide . Cari . Cariola You ungrateful varlet ! Have we had anything but delights and shows of all sorts since we came ? A concert in the morning , a ball at night , a banquet the next day , a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is from the mere weariness of pleasure . Ben . Benedetto Then I should think master and mistress would do nothing but yawn . How much they do make of ' em here ! This comes of being a rich old man 's new young wife ! It is not enough that they 're to go to the grand national masquerade in the public square tonight , but there 's the fine bridal supper at Don Diego de Cardona 's , where all the rest of master 's kinsmen are to be assembled to do honor to his choice . When they are tired of walking about , they 'll have a capital view of the show from the windows . There they can fill their eyes and their stomachs at once ! Ah ! Cari . Cariola Have you seen ' em in their new dresses ? What a glorious figure they cut ! They quite do us credit . Ben . Benedetto By the bye , Carry , what dresses are you and I to wear ? Cari . Cariola Look like a sensible person , and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil one , and if anybody knows you , they 'll swear they are mistaken . Cari . Cariola La ! We shall have rare doings ! All sorts and ranks mingle in these public masquerades here . People may do as they like on holidays of this kind in Barcelona , and nobody has a right to be offended . Ben . Benedetto With a grimace of alarm May they ? Ah , this reminds me of a story , a capital one , by St. Agnes ! of how once upon a time a tailor from Valencia married a pretty girl from Cadiz . She was as lively as cherry bounce , but had a tongue as hot as cayenne pepper . On the marriage day , says the tailor to his bride  --  Cari . Cariola Poh ! you chattering wretch ! Hold your tongue ! Ben . Benedetto " Hold your tongue ! Poh ? " No ! He had too much sense to expect anything of the kind . So , says the tailor  --  Cari . Cariola Nonsense ! Don Alvar will be here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . Put this bust upon the stand . But hark ye , Benedetto , what can be the reason my lady takes the trouble to sit for so many copies of her face on canvas ? Ben . Benedetto Because a beauty thinks she can never see her face too often . I should think nobody knew that better than you , by your ogling your mirror so . Cari . Cariola No ; it is because master thinks nobody can make her half beautiful enough . He tried his own hand at it , till , only think ! he who never failed before !

That 's shocking ! What ! A mistress manage a love affair unknown to her maid ! It is really quite out of rule . Lis . Lissardo Ah , she thought she had done it unknown to her father too , but . the old fox was too sly for her . He detected the stolen interviews and called the Prince to account .

Flora Well , wonders will never cease . I am astonished ! Lis . Lissardo Are you ? Then be amazed ; for there are greater wonders yet : an illustrious stranger is arrived . Flor . Flora Hey ? Lis .

There you 'll see The centaur springing on the further bank , His arm flung round his prize , his visage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writhing Damn him , damn him , damn him ! Carl . Don Carlos While the husband stands  --  Alv . Don Alvar Aye , what of him ? The great , the demigod , turned to an idiot ? Carl . Don Carlos Ah , the sad fate of husbands ! Who would marry To see his wife borne off before his eyes  --  Alv . Don Alvar Violently He had his great revenge ! The monster fell ! He had revenge ! Ha ! Ha ! Nor man nor devil Can cheat him there . The husband had revenge ! I see him grasp his bow , I see the shaft Dipped in the hydra 's poison . Now it twangs  --  ' T is in the robber 's heart . He has revenge ! Carl . Don Carlos Sir , you seem moved by this  --  Alv . Don Alvar ' T is passed . ' T is nothing  --  fancy 's dream , no more ! Carl . Don Carlos We must be speedy . ' T is of such high dreams That genius builds its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiery mind . Calls My horses there ! Follow me , sir . An hour Will bring you to the picture . Alv . Don Alvar Apart , violently And revenge ! Exeunt Scene 4 : A picturesque garden in the chteau at Terra Nuova . A wing of the villa seen partly over trees in the distance . Right hand of the audience and in front , a pavilion with bars from the ceiling to the floor , running the whole length of the side facing the audience ; or else , full-length French windows standing open . At the side , steps leading up to the entrance of the pavilion , which opens on the garden . In the pavilion , a large painting with a curtain before it , a table and chair . Opposite the pavilion , a beautiful bower . Enter Bianca , led by Julia . Jul . Julia My heart is lighter , love . The Prince is here . Now we can meet , now all can be explained . Flora , the maid we brought , found out the secret : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father promised of the noble picture In yon pavilion . With him comes some artist  --  Bian . Bianca And have you seen him ? Jul . Julia No , not yet , my love ; But when true hearts are near as we are now , The rest is easy . We shall both dissemble For yet a little while ; then both be fonder Than we have ever yet been . ' T is the history Of all love 's quarrels . Enter attendant and whispers to her What ! Father come ! My father 's just alighted with Lissardo . Pardon me but a moment , dear Bianca . He is incensed to find me gone o ' th ' sudden ; He comes to scold me and to know the reason , Which ' t is not fitting that he yet should know . I must begone to soothe him with excuses . A moment and I 'm yours . Exit Julia Bian . Bianca Alone Oh , gentle girl , Bright be your hours with the sweet smile of love ! Your name ne'er torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is malice to the consciousness Of an untainted soul ! There 's but one scorn By which we should be shaken : ' T is the scorn Of the accusing heart ! The world may hate , Virtue o'ercomes the world ! What lethargy Is this that darkens o'er me ? On my eyelids A weight is pressing , as upon my heart . Hyppolito , ' t is you have made me what I am ; Yet I forgive you all , I pardon you , Aye , as one pardons on the bed of death ! I feel the world 's passed from me ! To my lord I shall return no more to bring a stain Though innocent upon his stainless name ! Let me rest here awhile ! The air is soft . Would that this couch were but my last retreat , Were but the cloister where the hours shall pass That lie between me and my early tomb ! Come , sleep ! Sleep ! Sleep ! Oh , would thou wert repose ! Sinks to sleep in the bower . Attendant enters the pavilion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince and Alvar , and retires Carl . Don Carlos Pointing to the picture This is the picture , sir ; and hence , perhaps , You may behold , ere you complete your work , The Dejanira of the noble artist . She often roams this garden . For the moment Farewell , good sir . I leave you to your labor . Exit Prince . Alvar distributes the painting implements and takes out the pistols , placing them on the table by the side of the painting things . He then sits down for a moment , exclaiming Alv . Don Alvar Gloomily No news of this Hyppolito . No clue  --  At this moment . Hyppolito cautiously steals in , wrapped in a mantle , from the side where the pavilion stands . He comes between the window and the bower , his back being turned to the window , so as to intercept Alvar 's view of Bianca , while unseen himself Hyp . Don Hyppolito Advancing , says low It was Bianca whom I saw . All 's still  --  ' T is she . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What miracle  --  Her sleep seems troubled  --  Hark ! Bian . Bianca In her sleep I 'm wronged ! Death if thou wilt , but hear me ere I die ! Alv . Don Alvar Springing from his stupor That voice  --  can it , no , No , my ravished fancy In every voice of woman hears but hers ! Drops back in his chair again Bian . Bianca Writhing Spare me  --  oh , spare me till you know the truth ! Then kill me and I 'll bless you ! Springs from the couch , rushing down the stage , and falls on her knees before Hyppolito , still unseen by Alvar Alv . Don Alvar Ha ! Hyp . Don Hyppolito What means this madness ? Speak ! You 're safe , most safe . Bian . Bianca Seeing him , recoils You ! Is it you ! The man 's here , then  --  tremble ! Hyp . Don Hyppolito What man ? What ? Bian . Bianca Oh , such a dream , so full of horror . Alv . Don Alvar Apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bianca I thought I was once more upon that wave Which makes me such a wretch , when suddenly A tempest shook me from my sleep . I started , Sprang to the deck , black clouds encompassed me . A voice amid the fearful darkness howled , " Traitress , I come ! In death I claim my bride ! " And I saw hovering o'er me a fierce spirit , Half wrapped in cloud . I recognized the face Though changed to fury ' t was Don Alvar ! Alv . Don Alvar Who has remained as if petrified , and unconscious , shrieks ' T is she ! It is my wife with her betrayer ! Both start Bian . BiancaShuddering , involuntarily clings to Hyppolito Hark ! Heard you not a voice ? A voice like his ? Hyp . Don Hyppolito Trembling violently I  --  I  --  but no , it can not be . Bian . Bianca Loosening her grasp of Hyppolito and with calm decision As I am living , ' t was his voice I heard . Hyp . Don Hyppolito Flurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived But now at Naples . Alv . Don Alvar Confusedly pacing the back of the pavilion Like the pent lion must I pace my cage , Denied to dart and crush them at a bound ? Bian . Bianca Recovering from a burst of tears , mournfully No more ? ' T is well . Life were to him a curse , Doomed to endure the scoffs of an unjust world Which turns the husband 's wrong into his shame ! Alv . Don Alvar Who has , in the meantime , been feeling wildly for his pistols , now grasps them , but trembling violently Now , ministers of justice ! Hyp . Don Hyppolito Hurrying Bianca away Come hence with me . I feel there 's danger here . I know not why , but here I 'm sure there 's danger . Bian . Bianca Struggling Whither ? Where would you drag me ? I 'll not leave ! Hyp . Don Hyppolito You stand upon a precipice . Your next step May be  --  perdition ! Bian . Bianca Struggling Oh , whither ? Whither ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now  --  now  --  Hyp . Don Hyppolito Seizes her To  --  to  --  She throws off Hyppolito , and the struggle forces her out of the range of the shot Alv . Don Alvar Fires and shrieks violently Death ! The Prince , Julia , Salerno , Flora , Cariola , Lissardo , and Benedetto instantly run in from different sides . Julia receives Bianca , who is yet staggering from the struggle by which she has been withdrawn from the grasp of Hyppolito . Hyppolito falls . The Prince and Salerno rush to him Carl . Don Carlos Raising up Hyppolito What murderer has done this ? Sal . Don Salerno Shut all the gates ! Let search be made . He bleeds . Hyp . Don Hyppolito Faintly Look to the lady . Ben . Benedetto Low Run to your mistress , Cariola . Bianca sinks on Cariola 's shoulder Sal . Don Salerno Bianca ! Can it be Bianca ? Carl . Don Carlos Whence came the shot ? Bian . BiancaFeebly , pointing to the pavilion There ! There ! Carl . Don Carlos She points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach , the door flies open , and Alvar appears wildly on the steps with pistols Alv . Don Alvar ' T was I who did the deed ! ' T was I ! Bian . Bianca At hearing his voice , springs towards him Alvar ! Suddenly stops , overcome by recollections , and falls back in the arms of the attendants All . Alvar ! Alv . Don Alvar Aye , the wronged husband , Alvar : it was I ! I saw them twining in each other 's arms And swore revenge on both . Are they both slain ? Sal . Don Salerno Oh , my unhappy boy ! Bear him away ! Carlos resigns Hyppolito to the attendants , who bear him to the house He bleeds ! Don Alvar , this was fierce revenge And shall be sternly recompensed . Jul . Julia Bianca is unhurt , murderer , unhurt ! Alv . Don Alvar What ! Has my traitor arm refused to right Its injured master ? Thus then let me end  --  Alvar dashes down the pistols and starts forward with his dagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bianca , and Lissardo and Benedetto go to Alvar ' T is well . Yes , yes ! Enjoy the spectacle Of injury unredressed . Smile as scorn 's finger Points at the husband who has twice stood by And seen the traitress with her paramour . Jul . Julia Bianca , speak ! Give tortures to his heart By telling him that thou wert pure as Heaven ! Carl . Don Carlos To Alvar Sir , this Was frenzy . She is innocent . Sweet lady , wake and tell thine own proud tale To him who would have drained thy generous veins In wild suspicion . Bian . Bianca Kneeling to Alvar Alvar , by our love , By plighted faith , by all my hopes of Heaven , Your wife is at this fearful hour as clear Of all offense as lisping infancy . I have been made the prey of bitter tongues , Of desperate chances , strange and evil days , But still was true to thee . I ask but now Thy leave to give the remnant of my days To some sad cloister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alv . Don Alvar Aside Can I believe all this ? Yet truth seems living in her countenance ! Aloud , bitterly Came she not here to meet her paramour ? Jul . Julia It was I Who brought her here to shun him , nor , till now Knew I that he was here , nor where he was . Sal . Don Salerno ' T was I that sent the Count Hyppolito  --  Sent him a prisoner , ' gainst his strong entreaties , Now , until now , had I a thought Bianca Was even in Italy . Alv . Don Alvar Aside All can not league against me ! Sal . Don Salerno My boy revives . He strives to speak . Give way ! They bring Hyppolito forward Hyp . Don Hyppolito Lord Alvar , hear my words , as if I spoke The last these lips shall utter . She is pure . I loved her , sought her heart , and I was scorned . She told me that her faith was thine , Lord Alvar , And that her heart went with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall survive this wound , Naples shall see my face no more . I go To fight the battles of the Holy Cross Against the Moor and live a penitent . Bear me away . Salerno and Lissardo lead him out Alv . Don Alvar Apart Yes , yes , I 've done her wrong . Oh , what a storm of undeserved woe Has poured upon that innocent ! The cloud is gone from my benighted soul , My heart now owns thy virtue and o'erflows For having wrongfully suspected thee . Flings himself in a passion of tears at her feet Bian . Bianca Oh , rise , pray rise . You break my heart with joy . Alv . Don Alvar With frantic exultation She 's saved ! She 's saved ! Virtue is ne'er deserted ! Bianca 's innocent ! Bianca 's here , Here in my arms ! We part no more forever ! Bian . Bianca Flinging herself on his arms Now , now to die were happy ! Alv . Don Alvar Talk not of death , but rapture . No , sweet wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hour I 'll scorn suspicion . Come to my arms !
