txt THE young men of some of our largest cities and seaport towns have , during the past year , formed themselves into asso* ciations by the name of Young Men 's Societies . They appear to have no sinister or doubtful oh in view , but to aim simply at mutual improvement . They are not sectarian , but include in their ranks persons of all sects and denominations , nor do they seek to secure the elevation of any one to office , because he belongs to this or to that political school . On this subject , they have acted according to their individual opinions ,  --  and one great benefit of their association will he , to make them feel their obligation to act conscientiously in the selection of their rulers . It can not be supposed that , during the short period since these societies were established , they can have ascertained all the means , or even the best means , for effecting their objects . They have , however , established libraries and reading-rooms , which are opened in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from temptation and idleness , and improve their minds while they are amused and interested . They give their countenance and patronage to public houses conducted on the principle of temperance . They have addressed circulars to clergymen of the various denominations , asking their cooperation in this work of hurnanity ,  --  and they favor lectures on this account , as well as for the reasons just assigned . // We do not perceive that any danger can reasonably be apprehended from these associations , and their general result must we think be useful . They encourage young men to activity and independence , they inculcate fearlessness in the discharge of duty ,  --  and the public are their censors and their judges . If they do not accomplish all that they propose , they will at least produce the conviction that their motives are good , their principles sound , and their objects laudable . One of the results of these associations is the work before us . The Boston Young Men 's Society , finding public attention aroused and directed to the evils of lotteries , determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject ,  --  and to diffuse the information upon it , now in possession of but few , among the mass of the community . For this purpose they invited Mr. Gordon to deliver publicly , and afterwards to repeat , a Lecture on Lotteries ; and they have now published it , from a belief that the reasoning which it contains , supported , as it is , by abundant and satisfactory evidence , will do much towards extending into other States the reformation , which is so favorably commenced in our own . This lecture was not hastily prepared ; it bears marks of much research ; and , were we sure that it would be as extensively read as the importance of its subject demands , we might well spare our readers any farther remarks . The writer commences with a history of lotteries in this and in foreign countries ; tracing them hack as early as the distribution of gifts among the Roman soldiers . In closing his notice of English lotteries , he makes the following remark , which commends itself to our consideration a a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so frequent . There is , however , one fact connected with English lotteries that we can not withhold : it should ever be remembered in the annals of self-destruction . A short time previous to the abolition of lotteries in Great Britain , a scheme was formed at London , containing several magnificent prizes of 20 , 50 , and even 100,000 pounds each . The display of this scheme induced many extensive adventurers , and the night following the drawing was sig* nalized by fifty suicides . ' Mr. Gordon candidly examines the ground often taken , that lotteries are not properly gaining ; and shows conclusively , that // they are not only gaming , but of the worst and most extensive character . The principle upon which all gaming proceeds , and which is the root of all the misery and distress attendant upon it , is this :  --  the transferring of property from one to another without receiving an equivalent . The truth of this position is too evident to need illustration . Another constituent of gaming is the placing of property at the disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed , can it he more completely subjected to the control of chance , than in the lottery wheel . It matters not , whether all the parties* interested in the hazard , are actively engaged in bringing about the result . Are the gamesters upon the turf less interested , because they do not ride their own horses ? Every ticket-holder is a partner in the lottery game , and the managers are his deputed agents to play it . Whatever has a tendency to create an excessive thirst for gain , or to excite irregular appetites and desires , must make men vicious , and is injurious to the public morals . This proposition alone is sufficient to determine the dangerous influence of lotteries . ' But we are told that , if lotteries are gaming , so are assurances , .  --  and why are they not equally innocent ? Why is not a lottery broker making a livelihood in a manner equally honest with and underwriter ? This reasoning may at first appear rather specious , though a moment 's consideration will satisfy any one that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are founded upon opposite principles ; as fully appears from our author 's reply . Assurances are undoubtedly matters of chance . But if they are therefore instances of gaming , the merchant 's adventure , the physician 's efforts to save the sick , and , in fact , all the affairs of life , must equally fall under the same imputation , since their final success or miscarriage is alike unknown , before the result makes it manifest . But there is a marked difference of character between these chances . Policies of Assurance are intended to guard against loss , or to prevent distress by diffusing a loss among many persons ; while lotteries are matters of chance , intended to allure to loss by fallacious hopes of gain . Policies of Assurance hold out no allurements of gain . No man can enrich himself by lawful assurance . Neither can one man be impoverished by the assurance of another , but on the other hand they furnish protec*-tion against poverty . // In the collection and distribution of money , lotteries and assurances are totally unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the many , to be given to the few , without any regard to circumstances , or to the merit of those who receive it . While in the other case , it is collected from those who have property at risk , and who are , perhaps , unable to take the hazard of its safety ,  --  and is distributed to those who are so unfortunate as to be losers . The premiums , gained by an Assurance Company , are a reward in consideration of the capital employed and placed at risk , for the benefit of those who take out policies . While in the lottery there is no capital whatever employed ; not a farthing is deposited for the benefit of the adventurers , but what is by them contributed ; and yet immense profits arise for the benefit of the managers . And that such immense profits should be realized without the employment of any capital , seems irreconcilable with all the principles that regulate commercial transactions . Besides , in the case of assurance , both parties are interested that the event should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there should be no loss ; and thus all the heart-burning , envy and jealousy , which exists among ticket-holders on account of the opposition of their interests , has no place under a policy of assurance . Nor does a policy of assurance afford a mere chance of gratification , ( which is all a lottery ticket gives , ) but a present substantial benefit , in that peace of mind which the security of property is calculated to afford . Nor does the advantage stop with the person assured , for the process that guaranties security to him , is beneficial to the whole community in all its relations with that individual ;  --  and hence , assurances form a main pillar in the structure of commercial integrity . ' Having examined some principles , by which we are to judge how far lotteries are ever useful to the community , let us next proceed to matters of fact , and treat of lotteries as they are . We have the scheme of a New York lottery before us , and we learn from it two things : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of the lotteries in which they adventure ; and 2 . What they are not permitted to know . It is a matter of general notoriety , that brokers uniformly deduct fifteen per cent . from all prizes for themselves . It is not generally known , that they also gain twenty-five per cent . in addition , by the difference between the scheme price and the retail price . It appears from the scheme , that // The whole number of tickets , which represents the number of adventurers , is 45,760 ; from this deduct the number of prizes , 18,040 , which represent the chances of gain , and the result shows , that the former are to the latter nearly in the proportion of 3 to 2 . In other words , there are only two prizes to be distributed among every five ticket-holders ; so that three out of the five must draw blanks7 and lose all their money . Thus , out of 45,760 adventurers , three fifths , or 27,720 , must be losers , and their loss , at $5 each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With what feelings would the laborer go forth to his daily task , with the expectation of losing the wages of three days out of every five , or of $60 out of every $100 he might earn ? ' There is another point , on which there is much misunderstanding and blindness . Not only are the adventurers ignorant of the fact that three fifths must be losers , but they keep out of mind another important fact , that the chance of securing a high prize is very inconsiderable , and diminishes in value as you approach the highest prize ; for ( as our author says ) the adventurer 's object is not to obtain a small prize , and thus barely save himself from loss ,  --  it is to secure a fortune . ' Mr. Gordon gives an application of the doctrine of chances ( according to Dr. Brewster 's Encyclop*edia ) , to this scheme ,  - -  from which it appears that The chance of drawing simply a $100 prize in this scheme , is as one to 381 ,  --  and should an adventurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , it would be more probable that 264 of them would draw blanks , or be entitled only to smaller prizes , than that even one would draw a prize as large as $100 . And the chance of drawing a $500 prize , which in fact would be but $425 , 15 per cent . being always deducted , would be as one to 915 ; and should a person purchase 915 tickets , paying $4575 for them , it would be more probable that 640 of them would draw blanks , or smaller prizes , than that even one would draw a prize of $500 . ' The principle of excitement operates very strongly on mankind in reference to almost every subject , be it good or bad . If our feelings are engaged we become warm , zealous , and ready to make any sacrifices which are demanded7 in order to secure our object , and there are few subjects , on which persons are so easily or so strangely excited , as on lotteries. // The young adventurer , after drawing his first blank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds to his disappointment , he is still eager in pursuit of the phantom which decoys him , but ever eludes his grasp . Often when he has spent his lawful earnings in the purchase of tickets , be is so earnest and determined that nothing can oppose him in his course , and that honor , honesty and integrity all forsake him . On the other hand , the man who calls himself ' the favorite of fortunes ' and wins the highest prize , is scarcely ever satisfied . We hardly hear of an individual , thus obtaining the object of his ambition , who does not dip again , and deeply , into these exciting waters . We are furnished with many facts in referto those who thus continue to purchase without winning , even when they are driven to unlawful means of acquiring money , and to those who are ruined by drawing high prizes ; who , being induced not only to continue gaming , but also to neglect their regular employment , contract idle , and too often vicious habits , and finally involve themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the folly of lotteries is presented in this lecture , to which we desire especially to call the reader 's attention . We have been examining the comparative chances of gain or loss ; we are now invited to examine the real value of a lottery chance . In fair dealing , no man is willing to pay more for a mere expectation of profit than it is worth ,  --  and the rule for determining the value of this expectation , is to multiply the benefit expected by the fraction which represents the probability of obtaining it . But we may make some advances towards a true estimate by supposing , in each case , that there are no prizes of any other denomination than the one , the expectation of gaining which is the subject of calculation . Under this view , and deducting fifteen per cent . from all prizes , we arrive at the following results : The chance for a $50 prize being 1 to 817 , is worth 5 3-16 cts. 1,250 " 1to22880 , " 45-8 20,000 " 1 to 45759 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worth of the chance is the price , which , upon a fair calculation , a person ought to pay for a ticket ; by which it will be perceived , that a lottery office is a dear market for fortunate chances . ' There is a disposition on all hands to rest on authority , and to cite great names with satisfaction , when they have // been ranged on that side of a question which we espouse . This is , however , extremely dangerous ; and if followed out , lays the axe at the root of all improvement , civil , political or religious . Where would have been the model of republican government and of free institutions which our country now presents , had we always acted on these principles ? Because the evils resulting from lotteries were not fully known , and were often entirely unobserved by the great and the good of past times , must we sustain them still , when evidence accumulates , day by day , proving conclusively that they do no good , but are rather productive of positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject we extract the following passage : Contemplate the slave trade . Century after century rolled away , before a question was raised in regard to the lawfulness of that traffic . The slave traders invoked the blessings of Heaven upon their enterprise ; and , when returning from their depredations upon the shores of Africa , thanked God for that mercy which had protected them from harm , and blessed their undertaking . And these men were , no doubt , oftentimes sincere , and perhaps pious . Even in Great Britain , where slavery is now unknown , It was not until after an arduous struggle of twenty years ' duration , that Parliament could be persuaded to abolish it . And shall lotteries be sanctioned in this age , because other ages have done so ? Will this community support an error , nay , a demoralizing evil , because other nations , or other communities in our own nation , continue to do so ? We trust not . ' There prevails a misapprehension on the subject of lotteries . It consists in supposing , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the extent of the tax levied upon the community , to carry on the proposed lottery ; and the question is often asked , with an air of triumph , Is the sum ( say ten or twelve hundred dollars ) a very great one ? Are we not continually called upon to supply much larger sums ? We are : but what then ? If the managers of a lottery would engage to raise the sum proposed without reserving a large sum for their own emolument and expenses , and without stripping those who can ill afford to part with a shilling ,  --  there might be some force in these interrogations . But facts abundantly prove that this is not the case . Examinations made by the English Parliament , by the Legislature of Massachusetts , and by individuals , give a. very different result . The error lies in // supposing , that the individual adventurers are not taxed in a lottery which is established to raise a given sum for the community . But when we consider how disproportionate is the sum paid by ticket purchasers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall be satisfied that the community will be less impoverished and straitened by a direct tax of $500 , than by a lottery to raise $60 or $70 . There is , probably , no subject on which the community are so little informed and so credulous as on lotteries . They are often much incensed by taxation , and consider a small excise oppressive ; but they will cheerfully give $5 , that the government may receive fifty cents , if they have any , even the most remote chance , of winning a prize . We find several facts in this lecture , proving conclusively that there are multitudes of fictitious lotteries , by purchasing tickets in which , no benefit accrues to any one but the seller . This is a species of swindling , to which those , who can ill sustain the loss are especially exposed by their ignorance . And yet , after all the facts which have been made public , on the evils , both necessary and incidental , of lotteries ,  --  they still exist , and have the sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union . It is impracticable to ascertain the amount of pecuniary evil and loss which is thus occasioned annually to the community ; and the amount of moral evil is far greater , in the loss of character and influence , in the formation of intemperate habits , and in the destruction of domestic peace and comfort . It appears , from good authority , that in nine States of the Union , there were four hundred and twenty classes sold in 1832 ,  --  amounting , at scheme prices , to $53,136,930 ; and , with the addition of brokers ' commissions , to $66,420,162 . It is devoutly to be hoped , that the eyes of the people may be speedily opened to the alarming and increasing extent of this evil ; that we shall not , as in times past , find it arresting the attention of a few separate States only , but that all the States , viewing it in a proper manner , will resolve to exterminate it from the land.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
