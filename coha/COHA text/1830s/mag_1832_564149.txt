txt WE had thought that no part of the world presented a fairer field to enterprise and industry , than that portion of North-America which lies east of the Mississippi and south of the great lakes . We have good laws , and well administered ; commerce and agriculture flourish , and honest labor is sure of its reward . We had thought that in NewEngland , especially , sickness and unavoidable accidents were the only causes for fear . Here education is more encouraged than any where else . The helpless poor , even those whom vice has rendered so , are not suffered to starve . All this is well ; very well ; but it seems we can do better . At least , so say , and perhaps think , the projectors of the intended expedition to ttie mouth of Columbia river . A gentleman , for whose talents and ambition his native land does not afford sufficient scope , has been employing his leisure in devising schemes to better the condition of his fellow countrymen . His studies have not been in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be will bless him as their father and benefactor . In a word , he has issued advertisements , inviting the good people of New-England // to leave their homes , their connections , and the comforts of civilized society , and follow him across the continent to the shores of the Pacific . When we heard of this scheme , our first impression respecting the morals of its originator was by no means favorable . His noble confidence in his abilities as a governor and a guide , over territories he had never seen , to a country in which he had never been , appeared extremely like impudence . We observed , too , that while his public programma spoke of the natural advantages of Oregon , and of two hundred acres of land which he intended to bestow on each emigrant , it said nothing of the sum said emigrant was to deposite in his hands previous to the commencement of the journey . But when we considered the hardships and dangers which he , as well as those he may delude , must undergo ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still runs , of being sent to the insane hospital ; when we reflected on his certain disappoiiitment , and the ridicule he will incur by it , we were constrained to believe that disinterested benevolence was his motive . We are informed that this excellent person has now a list of the names of many hundreds who receive his dreams as oracles . Were our prisons to be emptied on the shores of the Pacific , the benefit to the United States would be undeniable , whether the convicts perished on the way or not . Even then a wrong would be done to the natives of Oregon . But we are informed that the persons who intend to leave us , and to lead their wives and children to misery , if not to destruction , are hus'bandmen , mechanics , and other respectable members of society . Such persons should not be lightly lost , and we write in the hope that they will read and pause . The proceedings of our projector have been so involved in mystery , that it is impossible to speak minutely of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers are to assemble at St. Louis as early next spring as possible , and thence proceed to cross the Rocky Mountains , somewhere near the sources of the river Platte . The expedition is to go by land , but farther our informant saith not . Whether half the Oregon emigrants will ever reach St Louis is at least doubtful . Do they seek a fine country on the Oregon river ? They will pass through a much finer , even allowing the tales on which they rely to be true , whether they go by the Ohio or the lakes . They will find as healthy a climate as is in the world , and a soil that yields eighty bushels to the acre . They will pass through lands of which they may buy two hundred acres for less than the farther expenses of their journey . They will pass through a kindred people , from whose society they will derive as much advantage , to say the least , as they could from the Clatsops and Chopunnish of Oregon . In short , they will see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a long and perilous journey , and after several years of strenuous exertion , already established , without trouble on their part . If they pass the Mississippi they will injure the reputation of New-England for sagacity . Those who reach St. Louis will find there many who have been to Oregon and found no temptation to remain there . These will treat their undertaking with the scorn it deserves ; and if they go farther it will be in spite of good advice . The people of Missouri , though a // little addicted to dirking and duelling , are not destitute of humanity , and will not see their fellow creatures perish without expostulating . We will suppose that a considerable number persist and proceed onward . They may , possibly , charter a steamboat to take them to the mouth of the Platte , but no farther , for that stream is not navigable for steamboats , unless during freshets . We take it for granted that women and children can not perform so long a journey on foot , and that the baggage , household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed on pack horses . Wheel-carriages will , therefore , be necessary , and animals to draw them . So large a caravan must necessarily proceed slowly , especially as it will be encumbered with so many helpless persons . We have seen bodies of the Ossinneboia emigrants on their way from Red river to the Falls of St. Anthony , and they never gained more than ten miles per diem . Moreover , they had been seasoned to the hardships of an Indian country , which can not be said of the Oregon adventurers . Besides , their journey was not so long , and there were several trading stations on their route , so that they were not obliged to halt to procure provisions . If our friends are ready to start from St. Louis by the first of June , they will have done wonders . If they reach the mouth of the Platte in a month more , it will be more than we think possible . Thence they have a thousand miles to go before they reach the Rocky Mountains . At the above mentioned rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of September ; that is , supposing they met no accident , hindrance , . or delay . But there are many obstacles to their progress , against all of which they may , and some of which they must , be obliged to contend . They can not take provisions with them for more than a few days , and must , therefore , depend on their guns for support . The only game the country affords in abundance are buffaloes , and of these there are enough , and more than enough , in some seasons . There are bears , indeed , but these are of the kind properly called by naturalists hornbilis , and are much more likely to feed on the travelers than to furnish them with a meal . There are deer , and elks , and prairie antelopes ; but too few , and too seldom seen , to be relied upon . Likewise there are marmots , owls , rattlesnakes , and other vermin , on which all who make long journeys in the steppes of North-America , must occasionally be content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The buffaloes are all " that are to trust to , " and a very precarious trust it is . They are constantly migrating , and their migrations are not regulated by the seasons , or any circumstances on which calculations can be made . We may say without exaggeration , that we have seen hundreds and thousands at a glance , and we have also passed months in a buffalo country without seeing a horn . The Indians live on them , it is true ; but they follow them in their travels as closely as the wolves , and if the herd enters the country of a hostile tribe , they endure the horrors of starvation . Very many of the buffalo-hunting savages perish every year of ' literal famine . There is ever either great abundance or extreme want . If ' the Indians suffer , how will the emigrants , who are not hunters , provide for themselves ? A ship 's crew , who should undertake a voyage to India , relying on the fishes they might catzh on the way , would // have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march to Oregon , relying on the buffalo . The country through which the adventurers must pass is a level plain , where the eye seeks in vain for a tree or a shrub . The streams only are scantily fringed with wood . In some places the emigrants must travel days and nights without finding wood or water . None but those who have endured these privations can conceive the sufferings attendant on them . And supposing the horses are not stolen by the Indians , or driven away by the wolves and grisly bears , they can not find food . The ground is covered with herbage for a few weeks in the year only . The Indians burn the prairies regularly twice a year , from Lake Winipeg to Mexico , and for at least nine months in the twelve , nine tenths of their area is as bare of vegetation as the desert of Zahara . The wet and swampy spots , only , escape the flames . The wild horses and other animals , contrive to exist , indeed ; but it is by keeping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a green leaf , and then flying like the wind in search of others . Their existence depends on an activity which draught horses can not exert . There is yet another difficulty which the emigrants should consider . We can assure them , on our own experience , that not one horse in five can perform a journey of a thousand miles without a constant supply of something better than prairie grass . If our friends lose half their cattle on the way , as it is twenty to one they will , what is to become of those who must necessarily be left behind ? Between the river Platte and the Rocky Mountains there are several streams , which are dry , or nearly so , more than half the year . But when a long rain falls in the mountains they swell , into raging torrents , and are impassable , at least to carts , women and children , for days together . Is it not likely that the caravan may be delayed by such an occurrence ? May not such a delay take place while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away ? The country through which the expedition must pass is precisely in the track of all the war parties that travel over the space between the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains . It is the abiding place and the battle ground of fifty warlike tribes . We grant that there is not an individual among them all who will not receive a stranger kindly in his wigwam , and give him to eat of the best ; but neither is there *in individual among them who will not cut that stranger 's throat , for the value of his gun-flint , if he meets him alone in the prairie . Besides , it is their rule , when they undertake a warlike enterprise , not to bear the sword in vain , and if they happen to be unsuccessful , or defeated , wo to him who crosses their path . We could adduce a hundred instances of American citizens who have been put to death for no other cause than having accidentally fallen in the way of an unsuccessful warparty . Was not the last caravan that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only preserved from destruction by a strong armed party of United States troops ? Those traders gave no offence to the savages , unless passing through their country be considered such . Allowing that the travelers can save their persons from the attacks of letans , Pawnees , Pawnee Loups , Pawnee Republicans , Appaches , Comanches , Arrapahoes , Shoshonees , Rickarees , Konzas , Crows , // Blackfeet , and fifty more predatory hordes , whose very names are abominations , can they save their horses ? Do they know that all the buffalo-hunting Indians are the most expert horse-thieves in the world ? Do they know that they make their proficiency in horse-stealing , their boast and pride ? that they consider the appropriation of a horse a very virtuous and praiseworthy action ; little less glorious than the slaughter of a white man ? Do they know that a horse is absolutely necessary to a buffalo-hunter 's existence , and is , therefore , the greatest temptation that can be put in his way ? Do they know that their path is directly in the track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Captain Lewis killed two of their tribe ( in an attempt to steal his horses ) made a vow never to spare an American , and have religiously kept it ever since ? Do they know that all the Indians of that region justly hold the very name of an . American in abhorrence ? Perhaps , if we give them the reason for this hatred , they will believe us the more readily . About twelve years since it was discovered by a public-spirited citizen of St. Louis , that the supply of furs was not equal to the demand . To remedy this evil he raised a corps of white sharp-shooters , equiped them with guns , traps , ammunition and horses , and sent them into the wilderness to teach the Indians that their right was only a right of occupancy . They did the savages irreparable injury . They frightened the buffaloes from their usual haunts , destroyed the fur-clad aniTnals , and did more mischief than we have room to relate . The Indians were wont to hunt in a slovenly manner , leaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more thorough-spirited , and made root and branch work . When they settled on a district they destroyed the old and the young alike , and when they left it , they left no living thing behind them . The first party proving successful , more were fitted out , and every successive year has seen several armed and mounted bands of hunters , from twenty to a hundred men in each , poured into the Indian hunting grounds . All this has been done in open and direct violation *of a law of the United States , which forbids trapping and hunting On Indian lands in express terms . The consequence has been , that there are now no fur-clad animals on this side of the Rocky Mountains . These proceedings , we think , may account for the hatred of the Indians ; but there is yet something more In eighteen hundred and twenty-five or six , the Rickarees attacked a body of about a hundred hunters , and killed several of them . These met the fate they had provoked and well deserved . Nevertheless , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the savages having been sacrificed to the manes of the intruders they had slain , peace was granted them , and after the honor of our country had been pledged to pursue them no farther , the l ) romise was violated , and their village was burned before their eyes . Though ignorant , Indians are not idiots , and our Oregon friends may be assured that these transactions are remembered by all the Indians of that region , and will continue to be , perhaps to their cost . We may be told that it is no news that horses may he stolen if they are not watched , and that men may be attacked and defeated , if they do not defend themselves bravely . We may be told that there are engaged in the expedition , men enough to bid defiance to all the Indians // west of the Missouri , and that it is hoped government will grant additional protection . We may be told that what has been done once , may be done again , and that the journey has already been performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wherefore . When so many travel they must have many horses , and these must be suffered to feed at large every night . Indians lose their own cattle , and Indians are more watchful and see better in the night than white men . Captains Lewis and Clark lost their horses ; the hunters and trappers have lost hundreds . Why should our friends expect better fortune than commonly falls to the lot of others ? We make no doubt that the emigrants are numerous enough to beat any number of savages that can be assembled , in a fair field . But Indians do not fight pitched battles . They come when they are least expected , and , if they find too much resistance , retire and wait for a more favorable opportunity . In so long a march it is impossible that so many can keep together . The Indians may easily cut off the stragglers , and those , who , from very weariness , fall in the rear . They may drive the buffalo out of their road and burn the prairie before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence , the women and children also . In a word , it is impossible that such a body can make so long a journey , through a hostile country , without a hundred times exposing themselves to attack at disadvantage . Their numbers will increase the difficulty of procuring food , and they will therefore be obliged to scatter more than other parties are wont to do . That they will lose their horses we consider absolutely certain , and if they do , the women and children will inevitably perish by hunger or the tomahawk . If they are not assailed more than once before they reach the sources of the Platte , then must the Indians have changed their opinions ; nay , their very nature . The project of a settlement on Columbia river has been repeatedly before Congress , and has been pronounced visionary by the wisdom of the nation . At this present session , such an opinion has been expressed by one of the best and greatest men in the country , and there is little appearance of any measures in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , is to protect the Sante Fe traders , and our troops are too few to permit a second detachment for a similar purpose . The journey has , indeed , been performed ; but by whom ? Not by farmers just from the plough ; by handicraftsmen just from their workshops , led and guided by a student , who confessedly does not himself know the way ; but by small parties of practised hunters . They carried no women or children with them ; no carts , no baggage . They did not linger along the route . They knew the dangers and hardships they were to encounter , and prepared to meet the hardships and avoid the dangers . Have they not , nevertheless , endured much ? Was not Captain Lewis obliged to fly for his life with his men ? Was not Major Long 's party robbed once ? and were they not in imminent danger of suffering the like again ? We are told that General Ashley and Mr. Pilcher encourage this undertaking . Have not parties under their command been repeatedly attacked ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hunger , or been killed by wild beasts and Indians ? Did any white man ever cross the Rocky Mountains , who will say that a white woman could have followed him ? In short , // to live in an Indian country , men must be able to move with a celerity which can not have being in our body of emigrants . Let us suppose , for the sake of argument , what is impossible-that our friends surmount all the difficulties we have mentioned . Perhaps , it will not be unreasonable to suppose that these difficulties will detain them a month longer on the route . They will then reach the Rocky Mountains about the beginning of October , and winter will stop them on the summit . They will find a climate of which they have never dreamed in the Atlantic States . How are they to winter in the mountains ? That region has no buffaloes , and does not abound in game of any kind . Captains Lewis and Clark describe the Indians who reside there as miserable in the extreme , and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And how7 tire the cattle , which will have been as miraculously preserved as were the Israelites in the Exodus , how will they subsist among rocks and precipices , from which the argali will . lo*k down and laugh at the guns and the folly of the adventurers . The people will have brought no winter provision , no forage . There is one comfort , however ; having performed a journey of little more than a thousand miles , with light loads , and having had the grazing of perhaps a hundred acres of prairie , the beasts will no doubt be plump and well-conditioned . They may be killed and jerked , and the deluded crows , attracted by the scent of the feast , will not , as usual , wing their way to a more hospitable region . When this supply fails , the settlers may climb over the rocks which echo the cries of their famishing. children , in vain search for tripes de roche . We have taken it for granted , that they . have found a practicable road into the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at least , so Mr. Kelly tells us . Perhaps it would be well to inquire if these gentle .. men ( who have much business beyond the Rocky Mountains ) have not some interest to desire a settlement on the Columbia . But they are far distant , and we have no wish to impute other than the best motives to them . Let it suffice that the emigrants have now gone over half their distance . We know that there is a nutriment in old shoes ; and though two thirds of Captain Franklin 's men died of abdominal cramp in consequence of eating tripes de roclie , that fungous aliment may agree better with the emigrants . It is but trying it , when the worst comes to the worst . With these helps , then , we will suppose our friends have starved through the winter with the wolves . The horses may also be supposed to have been brought through the winter as they were through the prairies , by the especial favor of Providence . By the first of April , perhaps , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper day it will be for the renewal of such a journey . Lewis and Clark tell us that the country on the Columbia River is to the last degree rugged and mountainous . So say hunters who have been there ; and so says the map . Messrs . Ashley , Pilcher and Kelly say , nay ; and that there is an excellent cart-road . Which are we to believe ? The persons who intend to emigrate believe Mr. Kelly . For our own part , having found the reports of Lewis and Clark , touching a part of their travels , corroborated by our own experience , we are content to take their word for the rest . Mr. Kelly says that the country abounds with food . Lewis and Clark say that they often found // the natives in extreme want , if not actually starving , and that their own party , though provided with fishing tackle , and guns , which they well knew how to use , were glad to buy a few small dogs wherewith to quiet the cravings of nature . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that it is wet and uncomfortable ; Lewis and Clark also say that if their party did not actually suffer from hunger , they at least found much difficulty in making their rifles maintain them . A proof of the fact is , that they were glad to mend their fare with the putrid carcass of a dead whale which the sea had washed up , and for this they went ten miles over a high and steep mountain , at the imminent risk of their necks . Lewis and Clark do not agree with Mr. Kelly in a single point , and as they have been where he grants that he never has , we must prefer their word to his . When Mr. Kelly has gotten his gulls fairly to their nests , that is , to Oregon , how is he to obtain the land which he proposes to lay out for them , in lots of two hundred acres each ? Does he mean to purchase it of the natives with the money with which the settlers will have so judiciously entrusted him ? The laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians and private individuals . We hope the gentleman does not intend to set up the doctrine of " state rights , " and " nullify " the laws and the constitution . It would throw discredit on Massachusetts . Especially do we hope and trust that he does not intend to throw off allegiance and become the founder and ruler of a western empire . If he does , we can tell him that we shall not permit the establishment of such an imperium in imperio . But there is no danger of his making such a bargain , on any pretence whatever . We do not think he can take the goods which would be necessary with him , and unfortunately the Clatsops and Chopunnish set no value on coined silver ; still less on hank notes . I4is dollars would have far less value in their eyes , than so many fish hooks or musket balls . We are reluctantly obliged to draw this inference from the facts ; that he intends to follow the example of Attila ; to lead his followers to the field , slay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For any of our citizens to levy war , on their own responsibility , against a foreign people , savage or civilized , is , if not exactly treason , yet a grave misdemeanor , and , as such , punishable by law . The arm of the law , too , is long enough to reach Oregon . An armed vessel was sent to the Mulgrave Islands in search of the mutineers of the Globe whaler , and it is but a few days sail from the Mulgrave Islands to the mouth of Columbia river . There is yet another objection to such a course , which we think is insuperable . It would be matter of supererogation to offer Mr. Kelly any information on the subject , as he knows more than we do about it , and would not thank us ; but the emigrants shou ! d know , if they do not know already , that when it comes to the voje defait , they will not be the strongest party . The Clatsops and Chopunnish are numerous enough to drive them into the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the Multno .. mahs , Skilloots , Echeloots and Sokulks to their assistance . There is no part of savage America more densely peopled than the banks of the Columbia , and if the natives of Oregon suffer the intruders to sit down in peace and quietness among them , it is more than the latter have any right to expect . // Our ancestors fled hither to avoid religious persecution , and it was many years before they made good their footing in the land . Every one knows what their sufferings were , and yet they came with more advantages than the emigrants will carry to Oregon . They did not come in carts . They brought with them all that was necessary to procure the comforts if not the luxuries of life . They did not cut themselves off from communion with their friends and connections . The Oregon settlers can , for obvious reasons , carry nothing with them . They are about to put a barrier between themselves and their native land , which can not be passed and repassed in less than two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be said that the sea is open to them as it was to their fathers ; but it should be remembered that there is a vast difference between a voyage round Cape Horn and one across the Atlantic . Our friends , we fear , are about to attempt to put themselves beyond the reach of human sympathy , aid and protection ; and for what ? We believe that nobody but Mr. Kelly can tell . For the first season after their arrival in Oregon , the settlers must rely on their guns and fishing tackle ; for we are not told that corn grows spontaneously there . No great crop can be expected the second year . They will not have had time to break the soil . If they raise enough to support life they will do well . Thus three years will be absolutely wasted before their affairs can possibly begin to be prosperous . The advertisements before mentioned inform the colonists that they can vend their surplus grain in the Asiatic ports ; among others , in Japan . Japan I quotha . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full at the bottom of the programma ) a copy of Morse 's Abridgement or Guthrie 's Grammar . He might there learn that there is but one port in the Japanese Isles open , and that only to the Dutch . He might learn that the lower classes of all India subsist solely on vegetable food , which is so abundant that an individual may live well for about a penny a day . And if grain were not abundant in India , where is there a better soil than that of Hindostan and of the Burman peninsula ? and wherir can manjial labor be procured cheaper ? It is really astonishing that one , who has spent the best years of his life in teaching others , should be so grossly ignorant of what every merchant 's clerk knows . Mr. Kelly 's grain might , indeed , find acceptance in Kamschatka , but unluckily , the Kamschatkadales are too poor to pay for it . Again , the advertisement tells the settlers that they may carry on a profitable trade in lumber with the Spanish American ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chili have lumber of their own , and nearer at hand . Three years ago there was a law in Mexico , and we believe it is still in force , absolutely prohibiting the importation of lumber . It is notorious that several vessels were run ashore in distress , to evade this law . If any one is disposed to take lumber to Spanish America , or grain to Japan , can not he get a ship built here , and purchase beams , boards and spars in the state of Maine ? He could do it cheaper here , and more easily , than by taking his tools , &amp;c. to Oregon to build there . Or , if he has a partiality for Oregon timber , what is to hinder him from doubling Cape Horn and cutting his trees , without thanking Mr. Kelly , or any one ? He may get trees in Oregon without crossing the // continent ; but if he goes thither any time within a dozen years to come , in the expectation of loading with grain , we fear that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any such trade as Mr. Kelly promises can be carried on , how comes it that none of the masters of Northwest Coast vessels have ever made the discovery ? And , supposing the possibility of such a trade , how long will it be before the people of Oregon will commence shipbuilding ? Not in this generation , we fear . The art belongs to an advanced state of society . We can see no advantage in Oregon which the emigrant may , not secure in the state of Maine . The sea washes the shores of both . The soil is good in both . There are fisheries pertaining to both . If the climate of Oregon is milder , it is not proved that it is better . There is waste land in both . There is plenty of timber in both Maine has these advantages . Her inhabitants are under the protection of the laws . They are numerous enough to protect each other . They have free communication with every part of the world . There is no art or science of which she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done in Oregon , within a hundred years , is already done in Maine . Above all , she has no Indians to root out with fire and sword , fraudulent treaties , or oppressive enactments . That a party of young , brave , hardy men may cross the continent to the mouth of the Columbia , we know ; but that a large body of the inhabitants of New-England , wholly unacquainted with Indian life , and encumbered with baggage and their families , can do so , we hold impossible . We think we have proved that it is so . Our facts can not be disputed , and the inference is as clear as a geometrical demonstration . We do not know that the prime mover of the folly we have exposed is actuated by any evil motive ; we do not believe it . - We look upon him as an unfortunate man , who , deluded himself : , is deluding others , and conceive it our duty to warn those who are about to follow him on the road to ruin . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to embark in this enterprise to erase their names from the list as soon as possible . If they can not retrieve the money they may have advanced , let them consider it better lost , than followed to Oregon , and be thankful that they have so escaped . W. J. S.@@183068157.txt Tun " greatness " of man is to be inferred from his successful accomplishment of great plans ; and if those plans include public good , as well as his own benefit , then he may with some propriety be called a good man . We leave it to casuists to settle the exact line between greatness and goodness , and adjust the more difficult question , of what goodness is ? while we refer hastily to some of the leading features in the life of one whose name has for many years been as familiar to the ears of our commercial fellow citizens , " as household words . " Among the many aged men whom death has this season claimed , under the agency of colds and " Influenza , " is to be ranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , on Monday , the 26th day of December , 1831 . Mr. Girard was born in or near Bordeaux , in France , about the year 1746 . We have no materials from which to form a regular biography of him . It does not appear that he owed much to his family on the score of education , and he very early left his paternal mansion to seek his fortune amid new scenes , more congenial to his taste , and , as he hoped , more promising in pecuniary benefits . Whether this determination was the consequence of real or imaginary wrongs , on the part of his parents , or whether a " love of roaming " alone influenced young Girard , we can not assert ; but the spirit of enterprise was ever predominant with him , and probably was the chief incitement to his early undertaking . In the humble capacity of cabin , boy , at about the age of twelve years , Girard left France for the West-Indies , where he resided some time , and also made many voyages thence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate . About 1775 , he arrived in NewYork , and became a resident in this country . We know little of him in that city ; but when the American army was in New-Jersey , we find that Mr. Girard kept a small shop in Mount Holly , a village in West New-Jersey , near the Delaware , where he manufactured cigars , and sold them , with the other stock of his small shop . It was about 1780 , that Mr. Girard moved to Philadelphia , and in a few years we are enabled to trace him to the occupancy of a very small wooden building in North Water-street , where his commerce consisted chiefly in old iron and old junk ; and he was about as well known , as any other persons similarly employed . Nothing , however , is mentioned of his transactions in any situation , humble or exalted , that could , by the customs of trade , be considered di*honorable ; " close , but honest dealings , " appears to have been his motto . Mr. Girard grew rich by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preserved with economy . From his shop in Waterstreet , we have heard it stated that he frequently made trading excursions up the river Delaware in a small boat , making small but sure gains by his sales of groceries and clothing to the " well to live " farmers along the borders of the river . As his business , however , increased , we believe , he added to his employment the sale of liquors , and these , joined to the continuance of his segar fabrication , multiplied the small gains , till the aggregate was enough to insure an adventure // by sea . We need not trace , step by step , the progress of the successful merchant ; most of our readers know how wealth accumulates , when good sense and good fortune plan and execute the voyage . Mr. Girard soon became the proprietor of the building in which he had carried on his small traffic , and he erected on its site , a large mansion , including his counting house ; this continued to be his city residence , until his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buildings below , and a few adjoining tenements and stores . He continued to pursue commerce exclusively until 1811 , when Congress , by a decision not now to be censured or approved , refused to recharter the old Bank of the United States . Mr. Girard then possessed the means to open a banking establishment , and availing himself of the experience of Mr. GEORGE SIMPsON , who had long acted as Cashier of the United States Bank , he purchased the Banking House of that institution in South Third-street , Philadelphia , and became a Banker . The notes which he issued were ever regarded as equal to those of any Bank in the city of Philadelphia , and the liberality with which he conducted his business won for him the respect and gratitude of a large portion of the active merchants of that city . For several years previous to his death , Mr. Girard had gradually diminished his commercial capital ; vesting it in real estate , of which he had become an immense holder . It has been remarked by many , that the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other person , by the extraordinary thickness of walls and other characteristics of permanency with which he invested them . This fashion of " building strong " was well followed up by Mr. Girard ; his ships were especially noted for the quality and quantity of their timbers , and the strength of their various fastenings . We should have mentioned above , that the capital which Mr. Girard first invested in his Bank , was one million , eight hundred thousand dollars . This he subsequently augmented to five millions . It is said that he gained more than half a million of dollars , by selling out part of his stock in the present United States Bank , at the time when it had been raised from 40 to 60 per cent . above par by a system of speculation . During our late war with Great-Britain , the government found difficulties in raising the necessary funds ; and public credit had sunk so low , that seven per cent . stock was offered at 30 per cent . discount . Of this , Mr. Girard took FIVE MILLIONS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while public good was promoted , private profit was the moving principle ; and this remark will apply with equal force to other business concerns of Mr. Girard . In the prosecution of his commercial affairs he promised cautiously , and paid promptly ; his calculations were ever for his own profits , without infringing the acknowledged rights of others , and his liberality was distinctly marked with the peculiarities of business . Mr. Girard was a liber&amp;l subscriber to the stock of companies formed for internal improvement , and perhaps in such matters he made less calculation on profits than in most other business concerns  --  and it is as a man of business that Mr. Girard is generally known . But Stephen Girard , with all his devotion to the acquisition of wealth , had points of character that ranked him high as a genuine philanthropist . He contribut // ted to a vast many public charities ; to the erection of many public buildings . He was a liberal friend to the Masonic order . He was punctual in the discharge of duties which he assumed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused for ranking it among the virtues ) was never known to interfere unsolicited in the business of the people . There are those in the city of Philadelphia who have a tale to tell of Stephen Girard , that we shall not attempt to narrate at length ; but even this hasty notice of the man , wonid be unpardonably incomplete if no reference was made to the facts . In the year 1793 , the city of Philadelphia was visited with that fatal scourge , the yellow fever . Such was the panic which its sudden and awful ravages struck into the hearts of the inhabitants , that thousands of families fled from the city without providing for their business , and some even left their own sick to die , without a relative to close the eye or to offer the rites of sepulture . Attendants and nurses were vainly sought for to wait on the dying at private houses , or attend the wretched sufferers at the Hospital , hastily prepared in the vicinity of the city . At such a time , Stephen Girard , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen watching beside the hed of the afflicted* , enhaling the loathsome atmosphere of the chamber , where the victims of the fatal disease were receiving from his hands moisture for their parched lips , or those offices which kinsmen and relatives had shrunk from performing . The love of gain appeared to have passed frnm his mind ; his whole thoughts were given to the sufferings of others , and the devising of means for mitigating those sufferings and checking the of a disease , that seemed at one time to threaten , that thoucrh ravages b he should be spared , he only should be saved alive to tell the tale of horror . None of the loathsome forms which the yellow fever assumes , nor the multiplicity of deceased , prevented Mr. Girard from a constant and unremitted devotion to the duties of a nurse which he had assumed . He , with a few others of a noble courage , endured unto the end ; and when the pestilence had passed away , when the hand of charity was no longer required to minister to the necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his counting-room , immersed himself in business , pursued his gains ,  --  the last man perhaps that thought of the amount of services he had rendered his fellow man , or how much his generous devotion had shed lustre upon human nature . To have a just conception of the benefits which Mr. Girard conferred upon the community by his services-one must sit and listen , as we have done , to the recital of the horrors of that dark season of calamity by some one who passed through the fearful ordeal . What is the deed of the conqueror to such acts ? What the acclamations that follow the leader of a victorious army , to the silent gratitude that at the mention of Girard 's name springs up in the hearts of those who , in 1793 , were objects of his solicitude ! Such devotion to the afflicted , to those who could never make returns , has erected for the object of these remarks in the bosom of his late fellow-citizens an imperishable monument of gratitude . In person , Mr. Girard was below the middling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably plain in his attire , hut with sufficient attention to dress to escape observation . In early life he lost his right eye ; and about a year beibre his death , he lost nearly the // whole of his right ear by being forcibly thrown down in the street , and run over by a loaded wagon. * Mr. Girard was but once married-he buried his wife nearly seventeen years before his own death , and was thus left without direct heirs to his immense wealth . Three nieces had formed a part of his domestic circle , and these with their children were remembered in his will . We can not refer to the WILL of Mr. Girard , an abstract of which will be found in another part of this Magazine , without a passing notice of some of its provisions , as indicative of his mind . There are no clauses of that instrument , which pour floods of wealth into the laps of those who have for years earned their bread by the sweat of their brow ; though a large number are furnished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customary economy , and without the fatigues of customary labor . At Mr. Girard 's age , and with his habits of observation , he must have been fully conscious of the immense evils that have resulted to individuals by a sudden influx of wealth . Hundreds , he knew , had borne reverses with philosophy , and conquered , by bearing their fate ; but rare , indeed , were the iii*tances in which sudden prosperity had not turned the head of its pitiable victim . It can scarcely have escaped the observation of any one , who has read these hasty remarks , that the object of them must have possessed , in an eminent degree , that property which is usually denominated " good sense . " He was remarkable among those who knew him best for his close observations of the human character ; rarely , indeed , if ever , was he deceived by the specious arguments of the designing . He saw at once the character , and generally understood the motives , of those who approached him , and not unfrequently startled applicants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of their representations . The loss of a ship and cargo never disturbed the equanimity of Mr. Girard , or did the sudden gain of half a million , by a single speculation , cause the least change in his steady and sober calculations . He was truly philosophical in the ordinary acceptance of that term . In referring to the " g*ood sense " of Mr. Girard , we meant to have added that , from causes which we have already stated , he was deficient in the learning of the schools ; and probably to that cause  --  to remembrance of inconveniences which a lack of learning subjected him to-is due the liberal bequest for an " Orphan College , " from which boys may issue , prepared for any of the productive occupations of life . Mr. Girard , it is seen , obtained his immense wealth by industry , prudence and economy . He preserved the respect of his fellow citizens by a discharge of his various duties with strict justice , not unfrequently tempered with liberality ; but he was scarcely more to be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost uninterruptedly , and this he owed to regular and temperate habits-and , we believe , the noble and generous devotion which he manifested for his fellow man , when the yellow fever was slaying thousands by day and night , will show him also a man of fortitude and courage . Prudence , Temperance , Fortitude and Justice , usually denominated the cardinal virtues , * Mr. Bass Otis , a portrait painter of distinction in Philadelphia , a native of Bridgewater , in this State , obtained permission to take a cast of Mr. Girard 's face , shortly after his death , from which he painted a most correct likeness  --  the only oise ever taken of the distinguished original . Messrs . Childs &amp; Inman have been allowed to lithograph the likeness . // were , in no inconsiderable degree , to be discovered in the character and transactions of Stephen Girard . Mr. Girard was born into the Catholic Church , but we believe he had little direct intercourse with the clergymen of that or any other church , as such ; although he contributed liberally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different denominations of Christians . We commenced these notices with no intention of writing a biography of Mr. Girard , nor of offering an eulogium upon his life and character ; but , on recurrence to the first paragraph , we find that we have said something of greatness in connexion with his name . The attainment of wealth with a view to benefit others , as well as for self-gratification , may be considered a noble end ; and when probity marks every transaction by which the object is attained , something like noble means must be granted . Pope hath said of one who reaches " noble ends by noble means , " that he " is great indeed . " But greatness is a less lovely attribute than goodness . We have said , and we might have multiplied proofs , that Mr. Girard was charitable himself , and aided the charities of others . Bitt we have recorded a more ennobling instance , than the mere " giving of gifts unto men . " Every day will show us a man who could earn a laurel by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a profuse disposal of money for the furtherance of benevolent purposes ; but how rare , how exceedingly rare , are the instances of goodness , such as we have recorded of Mr. Girard ! Selfishness had apparently severed the fondest and dearest ties of consanguinity ; friend had forsaken friend , and brother , brother ; it was no longer a question , what could be done for others , but how could each save himself ? In the midst of those whom death had struck , Stephen Girard had no relative nor pledged friend . In the mansion where , at best , squalid misery was to be found , and where then loathsome and contagious disease was raging , the rich merchant had no associate ; there was none there whose name he could know ; yet thither had he threaded his way , through interdicted lanes and alleys ; and while the African , by a law of his nature almost exempt from the disease , dragged forth the putrid and decaying bodies of the recent dead , he noted Girard ministering to the comforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease seemed to have consummated her most horrid bargain with death ; where , if pestilence hath form and proportions , the horrid power must have set up its throne , there was Stephen Girard , with his own hands discharging the loathsome offices which that awful disease requires at the hands of some . There could have been no vanity there , no love nor hope of praise . The mouth , which he in the morning moistened , might be , and most often was , at evening , festering in the charnel-house . And few , indeed , were the chances that those who like him were volunteers in the cause of humanity , would live to tell of his generous devotion . But he shrunk not from his noble purpose . His immense wealth , honorably acquired , will allow a splendid mausoleum for his tomb ; and schemes for public advantage , which he has either devised or promoted , will justify the present age for marking greatness beneath his name . But true Philanthropy , when she reviews the scenes of 1793 , will chisel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
