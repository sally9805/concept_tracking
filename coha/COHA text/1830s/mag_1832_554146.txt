txt Those who have been accustomed to observe the progress , and reflect upon the tendency of our institutions , have doubtless remarked the rapid progress of the Military Academy at West Point in the public estimation ; nor can they have failed to notice the important position which it now occupies , among those objects that ought to be well understood by all who pretend to a knowledge of our national policy , and of the means by which that policy can best be cherished and sustained . The comprehensive mind of Washington first suggested the necessity of an establishment , where a portion of our youth might be constantly employed in acquiring such fundamental principles of knowledge , as are generally esteemed indispensable for the attainment of much proficiency in the science of modem warfare . The views of Mr. Adams were in harmony with those of General Washington on this subject , but circumstances prevented their consummation during the administration of either ; nor was this finally accomplished , until Mr. Jefferson was placed at the head of the Government . Under his fostering care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a // plan differing considerably from the existing one , and much more limited in its objects and operations . Since its establishment , through the influence of various changes and modifications , introduced by Congress , and those who have the more immediate direction of its concerns , it has risen with a steady and rapid progress to its present flourishing condition . Until within the last few years , however , it has not much engaged the public attention ; but the constant and zealous assiduity of those charged with its management , has now placed it on an eminence , where it must infallibly attract the public gaze , and receive decided condemnation or applause . We feel , however , very little apprehension for the result of this scrutiny ; for the indications of warm approbation and cordial support have been so numerous and unequivocal , as to leave little doubt , that it will continue to be sustained and cherished by Government and the people . But however great and obvious the utility of this establishment may appear to those who know it well , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from ignorance of its true character , regard its progress with an unfavorable eye . It is to such persons , that our observations will be chiefly addressed , while we endeavor briefly to examine a few of the principal objections that have been made to the Military Academy , and , if possible , to remove some of the obstructions , that tend to impede its progress in the public favor . We shall , also , in the course of our remarks , take occasion to refer to some leading points in the present system of instruction , and to suggest , for the consideration of those more immediately concerned , a few alterations , which appear to us to be necessary for the more complete attainment of the ends proposed by the friends and supporters of the institution . In performing this task , we propose , instead of making a separate statement of the objections which occur to us , and attempting to give to each a formal answer , to offer our ideas in a more general form ; hoping , that we shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material point , a full and satisfactory examination . The following extract from the Report of the Board of Visitors for 1830 , explains the general objects of the West Point Academy . We consider , then , that this Academy is expected to furnish to the army a supply of efficient officers ; to the militia , an intermixture of well trained citizens , qualified , on emergency , to dis . // cipline that last and best arm of republics ; to internal improvement a corps of engineers , capable of giving wholesome direction to the spirit of enterprise which pervades our country . It ought to furnish science for exploring the hidden treasures of our mountains , and ameliorating the agriculture of our valleys ; nor is it upon inert matter alone , that it ought to exercise a vivifying influence . Inheriting from our varied ancestry the discordant characteristics of every people on the globe , it yet remains to form a specific and all-pervading character for the American nation ; nor do we conceive any surer method of stamping upon the yet glowing wax a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men , emphatically the children of our country , trained to the manly exercise of arms , and imbued with the tastes of science and literature ; instructed in the principles and action of our political system , and the living exemplar , from which sound education may rear the social edifice . ' This , we think , is a tolerably fair statement of what is expected of our National Military School ; and perhaps it will be well , in this place , to take a cursory view of the subjects embraced in its course of study , in order that we may ascertain how far these expectations will be likely to be realized . The first year is devoted entirely to the French language and Mathematics , in each of which there is a daily recitation . During the second year , Mathematical studies are attended to every day , and French three times a week , the other days of each week being partially devoted to copying with crayon models of the human figure . The Mathematical and French courses are completed in the two first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trigonometry , Stirveying , Descriptive Geometry , the principles of Shades and Shadows and Perspective , Analytical Geometry , Conic Sections , and the Integral and Differential Calculus . These subjects are all pursued assiduously , and to a considerable extent , and occupy about three fourths of the student 's time for two years . Many are of opinion , that the Mathematical department is made to engage too much of the cadet 's attention ; and this opinion was adopted by the Board of Visitors for 1830 , from whose report we extract the following paragraph . This , ( Mathematics , ) appears to us a pursuit of somewhat all-engrossing character . To a certain extent , Mathematics are indispensable , and must occupy much time ; but , beyond that universal test , utility , we think they ought to give place to studies of equal importance . ' // Whether this opinion is well founded , is perhaps questionable . Some portions of the Mathematical course are undoubtedly not very essential to a strictly military education , nor for those who are in pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full acquaintance with scientific subjects , the whole is not only useful , but indispensable . One object of the Military Academy , independently of the chief one , ought certainly to be the encouragement and promotion of what are commonly called the exact sciences ; and there is no other institution in our country , where so thorough a foundation can be laid for the attainment of eminence in these departments of learning . If the value of this advantage be duly appreciated , may we not reasonably hope , that , hereafter , some Newton , Davy , or La Place ,  --  some Franklin , Bowditch , or Fulton , will rise from this cradle of science to ameliorate and elevate the condition of man , and thereby repay to the country , with abundant interest , the small pittance it bestows ? Considerations of this nature plead strongly in favor of continuing the present system ; yet , on the whole , we think it may well be doubted , whether , while the term of study is limited to four years , some portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , with more profit , be devoted to other pursuits . The Mathematical course might be considerably curtailed , and there would still be left enough to keep the advantages of this school far above those afforded by our colleges , and at the same time to comprehend every thing requisite for the education of a military man . One reason for introducing French into the course of studies , independently of the consideration , that every well-educated young man ought to be acquainted with that language , is to enable the cadets to read French works with facility , many of their text-books being the productions of French authors . It is , we believe , the universal opinion of scientific men , that French writers have been much more successful and happy in their investigations and explanations of the sciences generally , and of that of war in J ) articular , than those of any other nation . It is both an evidence and an effect of this opinion , that a large portion of the works on scientific and military subjects , contained in the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the cadets derive great benefit from this collection , by means of the explanations and // illustrations given by the professors , who are , of course , familiar with these authorities . The third year is devoted to the various branches of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry , and to the completion of the course of Drawing . The afternoons of about half of this year are employed in copying sketches of landscapes , etc. with the lead pencil , and the remainder in copying topographical drawings with the pen and hair-pencil . The Board of Visitors for 1831 , in alluding to this subject in their Report , use the following language : In Drawing , the cadets of the second and third classes have made surprising progress . In topography , landscapes , and the delineation of the human figure , their performances are excellent , and in a high degree creditable to themselves and to the accomplished artist from whom they have received their instructions . ' The Board of Visitors for 1830 , in reference to the same subject , say : An astonishing proficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that department ; but its character is entirely civil , and confined to the imitation of pictures and models . Is it not essential that military surveyors should be accustomed to sketch nature readily and accurately ? ' It should be observed , that three afternoons of each week in the second year , as well as all the afternoons during half of the third year , are employed in copying , with crayon and the lead pencil , from models of the human figure , landscapes , &amp;c . The principal object of this is said to be , to prepare the student for entering with advantage upon the subject of topographical drawing ; but we are inclined to doubt , whether enough is gained by this preparatory course , to compensate for the time consumed by it . If crayon-drawing , which engages so very large a portion of the cadet 's attention , were dispensed with , and the time now devoted to pencil-drawing principally given to learning to sketch from natu*e , instead of copying from painted landscapes , we conceive that the cadets would acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to ob*iin under the present arrangement ; and the time devoted to crayon-drawing might , as it seems to us , be more profitably employed in attention to some other branch of study . Topography is a highly useful part of a military education ; and it is especially necessary that it should be well attended to // in this country , where few persons are now very conversant with the subject . But to be a good military topographer , supposes the ability to sketch nature readily and accurately ; and the neglect of this art at West Point is very justly criticised by the Board of Visitors for 1830 . Thus far , every thing is but preliminary . The main object of the institution is to qualify the pupil for the performance of all the duties of a military life ; and by way of preparation , he is carefully disciplined in the various duties of a soldier and officer , from the handling of a musket , to the commanding of armies . The use of the various instruments of attack and defence ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most approved methods of attacking and defending these works ; the manner of conducting the marches of armies , and of disposing of the different arms , with a view to their mutual protection and assistance in cases of emergency ; minor tactics , or the evolutions of troops , whether in small or large numbers ; and the more complicated and exalted principles of grand tactics , or strategy , are each in turn carefully attended to , so far as theory and the lessons of experience extend . Besides these military subjects , studies of a different nature are made to engage a large portion of the pupil 's attention during the last year . Civil engineering , in its multifarious departments , viz , the construction of roads , canals , bridges , and rail-roads , together with the elements of carpentry and architecture , holds an important rank . As architecture is becoming daily more interesting to the public at large , its encouragement and advancement can not be too strongly recommended . A deficiency of taste and information upon this subject is but too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution , which tends to diffuse the correct and chaste principles of this art , deserves to be cherished and encouraged . A fine collection of casts , representing the most celebrated buildings of antiquity , has recently been procured from France for the Military Academy ; and there is every reason to hope , that it will tend materially to improve the department of architecture . The studies that have now been enumerated , together with rhetoric and national and constitutional law , embrace the chief objects of attention at this institution . A cursory glance at this course of instruction will be sufficient to convince // the observer , that it comprehends much useful information . Yet there are many , who profess to believe the Academy not only useless , but absolutely injurious in its effect upon the public interests . They maintain , that genius and courage alone are enough to ensure distinction in the military pro . ' fession . They say , that all our citizens are soldiers , and that competent officers can be selected from among them , whenever military services are necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become an able officer is not a very difficult matter . But , with due respect for the sincerity of these opinions , we must confess our preference for the doctrine of our illustrious Hamilton ; who says , that war , like most other things , is a science to be acquired and perfected by diligence , by perseverance , by time and by practice . ' These few words , coming as they do from a statesman of acknowledged genius and wisdom , are entitled to the most respectful and deliberate attention . That great man had investigated with the most keen and discerning scrutiny , the many and complicated causes of national grandeur and infirmity . He had especially weighed the mighty causes , which had elevated , sustained , and overthrown the various contrivances of men for self-government ; and he was of the unqualified opinion , that a national military establishment was indispensable to our peace and security . The reasons which led him to this conclusion are , doubtless , familiar to most of our readers , * and still operate with undiminished influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military establishment without skilful * be about as inefficient as powder and bullets without a gun , or a vessel without helm or compass . But how is this skill to be . . acquired and perfected ? ' Doubtless , by diligence , by perseverance , by time , and by practice . ' These objectors should hesitate , before they destroy ope of the most useful instru-. ments by which this benefit is to be secured . Such an instrument is the Military Academy . Before they attempt to subvert so noble an edifice , they should reflect , that it is not always wise to suffer speculation to prevail over experience . They should remember the consequences , which have heretofore resulted from the want of military science and skill , before they labor to expose us anew to similar evils . They ought not to forget , that nations , as well as individuals , are liable to be overwhelmed by adverse events , whose approaches // can not be foreseen , or guarded against by any sudden exertion of art or power ; that a hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obligation greater than ever was imposed upon any other political society ; and that we ought , at least , to pause , before we divest ourselves of any of ' those securities , upon which the peace , the progress , and the stability of our institutions may depend . One objecti* , which has frequently been urged against this institution is , that it is used as a mere engine of favoritism , for the benefit of the wealthy and influential ; and many who highly approve the policy of maintaining a National Military School , are hostile to the existing one , in consequence of this supposed partiality in the appointment of cadets . Now , nothing can be more unjust or unsubstantial than this objection . It is unnecessary to waste words upon it , for the inspection of a single document will exhibit it in its true light , and prove it to be wholly groundless . Those who wish fully to satisfy themselves upon this point , can do so by referring , to a paper published in the spring of i 830 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , who have ever been members of the Academy . There are some who maintain , that the sons of rich men should be wholly excluded , and that those of the indigent only , who are destitute of the ordinary means of education , should be admitted into the Military Academy . They have evidently come to this conclusion , without sufficiently considering the effect of such an eleemosynary establishment . It would invest the indigent of the community exclusively , with the most un- . limited power over liberty and property in times of danger ; and , although , under such a system , there might be no want of ' fidelity and patriotism , is it probable that the same interest would be felt , either for , or by the army , or the same confidence inspired by it , as if the officers were taken indiscrirninately from all classes of society ? Certainly not . The spirit of our institutions is decidedly in favor of placing , as far a practicable , persons of all ranks in those stations which they are qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we provide for the preservation of republican principles , and the stability and harmony of the Union . If none but the sons of the wealthy and influential were appointed cadets , we should be among the first to object to such partiality : if none but the sons of the poor and obscure , we should be just as ready to enter ou* // protest against it . But we are persuaded , that neither principle prevails in their selection , and think that a moment 's attention to the rules of appointment will convince the reader , that our opinion is well founded . The number of cadets is limited by law to two hundred and sixty ; and every State is entitled to have one cadet always at the Academy , from each of its congressional districts . The aggregate of the quotas of the several States being but two hundred and thirteen , there remain more than forty vacancies , which are usually filled by young gentlemen from the territories and District of Columbia ; by sons of officers of the army and navy ; and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most fastidious could hardly imagine a more equitable method of selection ; but as there are always many more applicants than vacancies , it of necessity follows , that where one is gratified , several are disappointed . The Secretary of War has doubtless a delicate and sometimes exceedingly unpleasant duty to discharge , in making a selection from the multitude of candidates . As a general rule , however , it is believed that he is governed by the wishes of the representatives in Congress from the particular State , to which the applicant belongs . This system of appointment is as free from objection as any that could be adopted , and ought to give universal satisfaction . It is , indeed , sometimes made a subject of complaint , that citizens are precluded , under the present system , from receiving commissions in the army ; but we trust that enough has already been said , to show that a preparatory course of study , such as citizens have not generally an opportunity of pursuing , is indispensable ; and as , moreover , the cadets who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equitable rule from the mass of citizens , we are at a loss to perceive , why this is not in fact a virtual compliance with the principle in question . We come now to the consideration of another objection ; which is , that young men , after having been educated at the national expense , often resign their commissions in the army . Those who make this objection contend , that no one should be admitted to the Academy , who does not intend perma* nently to pursue the military profession . This we can not admit . We are persuaded , that it would be very advan. * tageous to the country to educate even a considerably larger number than is required by the immediate necessities of the army , and not only to permit those who choose to resign , but // even to refuse to commission any more of the graduates than the service absolutely demands , leaving the remainder to pursue whatever calling suits them best . Suppose , for example , that fifty should be graduated annually , and only twenty be required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and discharge the others . We would not , however , as a matter of course , retain the first twenty of each class , as they are arranged at the Academy according to their comparative proficiency ; but we would have each State and territory proportionately represented ; and this proportionate representation might be secured by the observance of the following rules. - Let one be commissioned from each of the twenty largest States , provided the graduating class contains one from each of those States , who is desirous of entering the army ; but if not , then let the selection be made from other States in succession . If several from the same State should be candidates for a commission , let it be given to him who is most distinguished as a scholar . When it becomes necessary to commission twenty more , let them be selected according to the same rule , from the remaining States , the District of Columbia , and the territories . Let this principle be observed from year to year , extending equal privileges to every State . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to the number of its representatives in Congress , let the graduates belonging to that State be precluded from receiving commissions , till all the other States and territories are represented in the same ratio . As the army has now its full complement of officers , it becomes a matter of some importance to determine what disposition shall hereafter be made of the graduates of the Military Academy , or what modification of that institution circumstances m*y render it necessary to adopt . Either the number of cadets must be very much reduced , or provision must be made for an increase of the army , or some arrangement like the one here proposed must be adopted . After much reflection upon the subject , we do not hesitate to express the opinion , that a reduction of the number of cadets would be extreniely injudicious . There are on an average about forty who annually leave the Academy ; and if the system should be adopted , of commissioning each year as many as are required for the immediate necessities of the service , and of discharging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their character and standing , // we doubt not , that the individuals thus discharged would do vastly more to advance the real objects of the Military School , than they could possibly do by being retained in the service . They would enter upon civil life , not only well qualified for its ordinary pursuits , but with the possession of that military knowledge , which it is the purpose of the National Academy to disseminate . In a few years there would be several of these graduates in every State , who would aid greatly in establishing a uniform system of discipline throughout the militia of the different parts of the country . If so desirable a result could be obtained so easily , we should have abundant cause to rejoice . The present militia system is generally allowed to be a very defective one . As respects discipline , or any important knowledge of military matters , they are wholly out of the question , and must ever remain so , as long as the subject excites so little attention . One valuable end , and only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of armed men in the country . But this inight be done at a vastly less expense of time , money , industry , and morals . Relying as we now do upon the militia as our chief security against foreign invasion and domestic convulsions , it behoves every one to lend his zealous efforts to raise it from its present comparatively impotent condition , and to give it an efficient and useful organization . The necessity of some change is apparent to all ; but the difficulty is , to ascertain the means , by which it may best be accomplished . It is much to be regretted , that , although the subject has been earnestly recommended to the attention of Congress , that body has not yet given to it the consideration , which its importance obviously demands . It is only by means of officers instructed in military affairs ; that we can ever hope to reduce to any thing like discipline , the present unwieldy mass of our militia ; but with the assistance of such officers , large levies of recruits might in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every one is aware of the importance of military science in the conduct of warlike operations ; and the cultivation of that science is , as we have already remarked , the prominent object of the West Point Academy . With the assistance which the graduates would be capable of rendering , might we not reasonably hope , that in a few years , with a moderate degree of attention to the subject , the officers of the militia throughout the country would become familiar with a uniform system of // tactics , which would always enable them , in cases of emergency , to act effectively together ? In this way , raw troops might soon be disciplined , and an army of efficient men brought into the field in a far shorter time , than can possibly be hoped for now . Unless some measures are soon adopted to give . more vigor to our militia , it will become necessary to increase to a considerable extent the force of our regular army , or we may be destined again to hear of those scenes of desolation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a portion of our land . Our regular military force is , and has for some years been , reduced to the smallest possible limit . It is but a mere fragment , scattered in small detachments over an immense frontier ; and has hitherto been found scarcely sufficient to preserve our munitions , and impose a salutary check upon the numerous tribes of Indians on our Western borders . A large standing army has no advocates among us , and is wholly adverse to the spirit of our Government and to public sentiment . But it would be equally adverse to the dictates of justice and humanity , so to curtail its limits , as to leave it entirely inadequate to the performance of its duties . Whether the symptoms of disaffection that have at various times appeared among our black and red inhabitants , or whether the rapid augmentation of our wealth and population , and the consequent increase of the number of important military positions , require or would justify an increase of our army , are questions , which do not properly fall within the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consideration of our statesmen and legislators . We trust that enough has already been said to prove the great utility of the West Point Academy , in the education of officers suitable for the army , and in disseminating correct military information through the country . It has also , we hope , been made to appear , that the sciences and artsare likely to be advanced in time by the same means . We now ask the attention of the reader to another of the benefits , which the public will derive from this Academy . We mean the aid which it gives , in perfecting the system of internal improvements . The extensive works in progress or in contemplation in various parts of our country , require a far greater number of skilful civil engineers , than can now be readily obtained . This demand will continue to increase for many years to come ; and there is no school in the country , where the knowledge // necessary to satisfy it can be acquired so well , as at this institution . It is well known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific attainments , are annually invited to attend the public examination at West Point , and to make a detailed report of their impressions concerning the institution , to the Secretary of War ; and the opinions of these visitors , for the last few years , as exhibited by their reports , bear the most ample testimony to its utility and excellence . The reports of the Boards of Visitors for 1830 and 1831 , are full of almost unqualified encomium ; and the other reports , for several years past , are scarcely less favorable . What higher or more honorable evidence in its favor , can be expected or desired ? And yet , we regret to see , that there are those , who would impair its usefulness , by detracting from its well earned fame . Of this class is the author of a pamphlet , published at Washington , in the winter of 1829-1830 , under the signature of Americanus . ' This writer altogether denies the utility of the Academy , as it is now conducted ; condemns the course of those intrusted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates wholly unsuited to the ends proposed . His pamphlet is strongly tinctured with prejudice ; his assertions are , in many instances , notoriously unfounded ; and his reflections upon particular individuals , are rather too indicative of disappointed ambition and personal resentment . The candid reader , in comparing the assertions of Americanus ' with the language of the reports above alluded to , will doubtless form a fair estimate of the merits and justice of the former ; and we take our leave of him , with a siml ) Ie expression of our regret , that his eagerness to gratify any personal feelings should have hurried him so far beyond the limits of prudence and propriety . Those who have never visited this school , can form only an inadequate idea of the manner in which it is conducted ; but of the multitudes who have , few , we are persuaded , have ever left it with other than friendly feelings , it has often happened , that persons going there with strong prejudices against it , have found reason to alter their opinions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , assembled on terms of the most perfect equality , is a large number of young men , from every quarter of the country , and from all classes of society . Wealth , so often in other stations the // criterion of worth , is there deprived of its baneful influence over the youthful mind ; which , animated by a salutary discipline , strives with generous and ardent emulation for a nobler prize . The rich and the poor , the high and the low , are clad with the same garments , fed at the same board , and subjected to the same discipline . Artificial distinction , with its unsubstantial appendages , avails nothing in the contest for intellectual superiority . We doubt whether our boasted principle of equality is any where more completely exemplified or more carefully cherished ; the only aristocracy which is known there , is that of intellect and character ; and honors are awarded only , where the title to them has been fairly earned by diligence and merit . Such a system of instruction forcibly teaches the young mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's deserts are to be measured , not by gold and genealogy , but by genius and moral worth . By the free and familiar association of persons from every portion of our country , the asperities of sectional jealousy are smoothed away . It is , indeed , no rare occurrence , for young men , whose homes are most widely separated , to contract at this school attachments of the warmest and most enduring character . It is situated , as is well known , on one of the most romantic spots on the banks of the beautiful Hudson ; and its seclusion , together with the wholesome effects of rigid but well regulated discipline , combine to render it almost unrivalled , as a place for study and improvement . Whatever is most conducive to corporeal vigor and elasticity of mind ; whatever is calculated to create or cultivate independence and decision of character ; and whatever has a tendency to nourish noble and generous sentiments , are concentrated in this lovely region . We may not immediately experience all the benefits of this admirable school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its interests , in the mean time , ought to be guarded with careful solicitude , especially from the assaults of igno .. rance and malignity . We are bound to express our convictioti , however , that although much which is highly useful is now undoubtedly acquired by the pupil , much more is requisite to give a proper finish to his elementary attainments . To become an accomplished officer of either the army or navy , requires not only minute professional skill , but an acquaintance with all subjects commonly embraced in a polite education . It is the duty of // those who have the direction of early studies , to point out with careful and considerate attention , all the paths that lead to excellence ; but he who wins the prize , must be indebted for success to his own diligent and judicious exertions . At West Point , the youthful mind , untaught by experience , and in a great measure excluded from the beneficial influence of an association with those of more advanced age and experience , does not readily appreciate the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first importance in all refined society ; and in consequence of this , it too often happens , that graduates , who have entered the Academy at an early age , find themselves , on mingling with the world , greatly deficient in much of that knowledge which ought to be deemed indispensable in every U*ve of our national seminary . Our impression may be erroneous ; we hope it is so ; but if it be well founded , the fault is not so much with the pupil , as with those who have the charge of his instruction . Perhaps the term of four years is not enough to accomplish all that is desirable ; and if it is not , the period of study should be extended so far , as to give the students time enough to attend to the outlines at least , of civil , natural , and military history , and the elements of geography , political economy , and literature in general ; all of which are now almost wholly if not entirely neglected . Some knowledge of these subjects is certainly indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be effected by time and continued exertion ; but the outlines of each and their general utility , should be pointed out and illustrated , in every well regulated system of instruction . History is a subject of far greater importance in this view , than is apt to be supposed by the superficial thinker . To the military man , it is of the last importance . Bolingbroke , in drawing a parallel between Lucullus and Marlborough , makes the following forcible remarks : The Roman had on his side , genius and experience , cultivated by study ; the Briton had genius improved by experience , and no more . The first , therefore , is not an example of what study can do alone ; but the latter is an example of what genius and experience can do without study . They can do much , to be sure , when the first is given in a superior degree ; but such examples are very rare ; and when they happen , it will be still true , that they would have had fewer blemishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public virtue , in all the // arts of peace and achievements of war , if the views of such men had been enlarged , and their sentiments ennobled , by acquiring that cast of thought , and that temper of mind , which will grow up and become habitual in every man , who applies himself early to the study of history , as to the study of philosophy , with the intention of being wiser and better , without the affectation of being more learned . ' Why then , is the study of history totally neglected at a school , where the professed object is to render the pupils accomplished military men ? Were the term of study at West Point made five , instead of four years , there would be time enough to attend to all the subjects that we have mentioned , and perhaps to other useful ones , that now receive no attention . It appears to us , that it would be a decided improvement in the present system , to introduce to a considerable extent , the exegetical method of instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be added to the list of studies . The exegetical , if judiciously combined with the existing method , would probably render the system of instruction at West Point much more thorough , than that of any of our other institutions . As this Academy is a national institution , and one , respecting which considerable interest is beginning to be felt , we should , perhaps , be justified , in laying before the public a much more minute account of its affairs , than we have here attempted ; but we trust that what we have said is sufficient to show that its defects , when contrasted with its merits , are but as the glimmering of a taper to the brightness of the sun . In comparing its present condition with its situation ten or twelve years since , we are forcibly impressed with the rapid improvement that has already been made . Our observations upon it have been rapid and general , being only intended as a hasty commentary on the existing organization of a noble institution , which , we believe , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hope that the time is not far distant , when it will become a model to all others of a similar character , and an imperishable monument of the wis7 dorn of its founders.
