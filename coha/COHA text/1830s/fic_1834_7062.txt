Covers , Edges and Spine Main text THE LITTLE , HARD-FACED OLD GENTLEMAN . From the Diary of an Editor . BY THEODORE S. FAY . I was passing from my office one day , to indulge myself with a walk , when a little , hard-faced old man , with a black coat , broad-brimmed hat , velvet breeches , shoes and buckles , and gold-headed cane , stopped me , standing directly in my path . I looked at him . He looked at me . I crossed my hands before me patiently , forced my features into a civil smile , and waited the development of his intentions ; not being distinctly certain , from his firm , determined expression , whether he was " a spirit of health or goblin damned , " and whether his intents were " wicked or charitable "  --  that is , whether he came to discontinue or subscribe , to pay a bill or present one , to offer a communication or a pistol , to shake me by the hand or pull me by the nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my part , I am peaceable , and much attached to life , and should esteem it exceedingly disagreeable to be either shot or horsewhipped . I am not built for action , but love to sail in quiet waters ; cordially eschewing gales , waves , water-spouts , sea-serpents , earthquakes , tornadoes , and all such matters , both on sea and land . My antipathy to a horsewhip is an inheritance from boyhood . It carried me across Csar 's bridge , and through Virgil and Horace . I am indebted to it for a tolerable understanding of grammar , arithmetic , geography , and other occult sciences . It enlightened me not a little upon many algebraic processes , which , to speak truth , presented , otherwise , but slender claims to my consideration . It disciplined me into a uniform propriety of manners , and instilled into my bosom early rudiments of wisdom , and principles of virtue . In my maturer years , the contingencies of life have thrust me , rather abruptly , if not reluctantly , into the editorial fraternity , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and in the same candor which distinguishes my former acknowledgments , I confess that visions of this instrument have occasionally obtruded themselves , somewhat forcibly upon my fancy , in the paroxysms of an article , dampening the glow of composition , and causing certain qualifying interlineations and prudent erasures , prompted by the representations of memory or the whispers of prudence . The reader must not fancy , from the form of my expression , that I have ever been horsewhipped . I have hitherto escaped , ( for which heaven be praised ! ) although my horizon has been darkened by many a cloudy threat and thundering denunciation . Nose-pulling is another disagreeable branch of the editorial business . To have any part of one pulled is annoying ; but there is a dignity about the nose impatient even of observation or remark ; while the act of taking hold of it with the thumb and finger , is worse than murder , and can only be washed out with blood . Kicking , cuffing , being turned out of doors , being abused in the papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed many of my brother editors rather pique themselves upon some of them , as a soldier does on the scars obtained in fighting the battles of his country . They fancy that , thereby , they are invested with claims upon their party , and suffer indefinite dreams of political eminence to be awakened in their bosoms . I have seen a fellow draw his hat fiercely down over his brow , and strut about , with insufferable importance , on the strength of having been thoroughly kicked by the enemy . This is a long digression , but it passed rapidly through my mind , as the little , hard-faced old gentleman stood before me , looking at me with a piercing glance and a resolute air . At length , unlike a ghost , he spoke first : " You are the editor ? "  --  &c.; A slight motion of acquiescence with my head , and an affirmative wave of my hand , a little leaning toward the majestic , announced to my unknown friend the accuracy of his conjecture . The little old gentleman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid it down with his cane carefully on the table , then seized my hand and shook it heartily . People are so polite and friendly when about to ask a favour . " My dear sir , " said he , " this is a pleasure I have long sought vainly . You must know , sir , I am the editor of a theatrical weekly  --  a neat thing in its way  --  here 's the last number . " He fumbled about in his pocket , and produced a red-covered pamphlet . " I have been some time publishing it , and , though it is admitted by all acquainted with its merits , to be clearly the best thing of the kind ever started this side of the Atlantic , yet people do not seem to take much notice of it . Indeed , my friends tell me , that the public are not fully aware of its existence . Pray let me be indebted to you for a notice . I wish to get fairly afloat . You see , I have been too diffident about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us often . I will leave this number with you . Pray , pray give it a good notice . " He placed in my hands the eleventh number of the " North American Thespian Magazine , " devoted to the drama , and also to literature , science , history , and the arts . On reading over the prospectus , I found it vastly comprehensive , embracing pretty much every subject in the world . If so extensive a plan were decently filled up in the details , the " North American Thespian Magazine " was certainly worth the annual subscription money , which was only one dollar . I said so under my " literary notices , " in the next impression of my journal ; and , although I had not actually read the work , yet it sparkled so with asterisks , dashes , and notes of admiration , that it looked interesting . I added in my critique , that it was elegantly got up , that its typographical execution reflected credit on the publishers , that its failure would be a grievous reproach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer , and a gentleman , and was favorably known to the literary circles by the eloquence , wit , and feeling of his former productions . What those productions were , I should have been rather puzzled to say , never having read , or even heard of them . This , however , was the cant criticism of the day , which is so exorbitant and unmeaning , and so universally cast in one mould , that I was in some tribulation , on reading over the article in print , to find that I had omitted the words " native genius , " which possess a kind of commonlaw-right to a place in all articles on American literary productions . Forth , however , it went to the world , and I experienced a philanthropic emotion in fancying how pleased the little hard-faced old gentleman would be , with these flattering encomiums on his " Thespian Magazine . " The very day my paper was out , as I was sitting " full fathom five " deep in an article on " the advantages of virtue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I rather flattered myself , ) I was startled by three knocks at the door , and my " come in " exhibited to view the broad-brimmed hat of the hardfaced old gentleman , with his breeches , buckles , gold-headed cane , and all . He laid aside his hat and cane with the air of a man who has walked a great way , and means to rest himself a while . I was very busy . It was one of my inspired moments . Half of a brilliant idea was already committed to paper . There it lay  --  a fragment  --  a flower cut off in the bud  --  a mere outline  --  an embryo ; and my imagination cooling like a piece of red-hot iron in the open air . I raised my eyes to the old gentleman , with a look of solemn silence , retaining my pen ready for action , with my little finger extended , and hinting in every way , that I was " not i ' the vein . " I kept my lips closed . I dipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovering over the sheet . It would not do . The old gentleman was not to be driven off his ground by shakes of the pen , ink-drops , or little fingers . He fumbled about in his pockets , and drew forth the red-covered " North American Thespian Magazine , " devoted to the drama , &c.,; number twelve . He wanted " a good notice . The last was rather general . I had not specified its peculiar claims upon the public . I had copied nothing . That sort of critique did no good . He begged me to read this carefully  --  to analyze it  --  to give it a candid examination . " I was borne down by his emphatic manner ; and being naturally of a civil deportment as well as , at that particular moment , in an impatient , feverish hurry to get on with my treatise on the " advantages of virtue , " which I felt now oozing out of my subsiding brain with an alarming rapidity , I promised to read , notice , investigate , analyze to the uttermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability . I could scarcely keep myself screwed down to common courtesy till the moment of his departure ; a proceeding which he accomplished with a most commendable self-possession and deliberate politeness . When he was fairly gone , I poked my head out , and called my boy . " Peter . " " Sir . " " Did you see that little old gentleman , Peter ? " " Yes , sir . " " Should you know him again , Peter ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , if he ever come here again , Peter , tell him I am not in . " " Yes , sir . " I re-entered my little study , and closed the door after me with a slam , which could only have been perceptible to those who knew my ordinary still and mild manner . There might have been also a slight accent in my way of turning the key , and ( candor is a merit ! ) I could not repress a brief exclamation of displeasure at the little old gentleman with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " essay on virtue . " Virtue or no virtue , ' thought , I , I wish him to the d  --  . ' My room is on the ground-floor , and a window adjoining the street lets in upon me the light and air through a heavy crimson curtain , near which I sit and scribble . I was just enlarging upon the necessity of resignation , while the frown yet lingered on my brow , and was writing myself into a more calm and complacent mood , when  --  another knock at the door . As I opened it , I heard Peter 's voice asserting , sturdily , that I had " gone out . " Never dreaming of my old enemy , I betrayed too much of my person to withdraw , and I was recognized , and pounced upon by the little old gentleman , who had come back to inform me , that he intended , as soon as the increase of his subscription would permit , to enlarge and improve the " North American Thespian Magazine , " and to employ all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  said he , and he was in the act of again laying aside that everlasting hat and cane , when a cry of fire in the neighborhood , and the smell of the burning rafters attracted him into the street , where , as I feared , he escaped unhurt . In many respects fires are calamities ; but I never saw a more forcible exemplification of Shakspeare 's remark , " there is some spirit of good in things evil , " than in the relief afforded me on the present occasion . I wrote , after that , with my door locked . This I knew was , from the confined air , prejudicial to my health ; but what was dyspepsy or consumption to that little hard-faced old gentleman  --  to those breeches  --  to that broad-brimmed hat  --  to those buckles  --  to that gold-headed cane ! " Remember , Peter , " said I , the second morning after the foregoing , " I have gone out . " " Where have you gone ? " inquired Peter , with grave simplicity . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little man with the hat , was here last night , and wanted to go after you . " " Forbid it heaven ! I have gone to Albany , Peter , on business . " I can hear in my room pretty much what passes in the adjoining one , where visiters first enter from the street . I had scarcely got comfortably seated , in a rare mood for poetry , giving the last touches to a poem , which , whatever might be the merits of Byron and Moore , I did not think altogether indifferent , when I heard the little old gentleman 's voice inquiring for me . " I must see him ; I have important business , " it said . " He has gone out , " replied Peter , in an under tone , in which I could detect the consciousness that he was uttering a bouncer . " But I must see him , " said the voice . " The scoundrel ! " muttered I. " He is not in town , sir , " said Peter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of the greatest importance . He would be very sorry , very , should he miss me . " I held my breath  --  there was a pause  --  I gave myself up for lost  --  when Peter replied firmly , " He is in Albany , sir . Went off at five o'clock this morning . " " Be back soon ? " " Do n't know . " " Where does he stay ? " " Do n't know . " " I 'll call to-morrow . " I heard his retreating footsteps , and inwardly resolved to give Peter a half-dollar , although he deserved to be horsewhipped for his readiness at deception . I laughed aloud triumphantly , and slapped my hand down upon my knee with the feelings of a fugitive debtor , who , hotly pursued by a sheriff 's officer , escapes over the line into another county and snaps his fingers at Monsieur Bailiff . I was aroused from my merry mood of reverie by a touch on my shoulder . I turned suddenly . It was the hardfaced little old gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two-thirds of his face were just lifted above the window-sill . He was evidently standing on tiptoe ; and the window being open , he had put aside the curtain , and was soliciting my attention with the end of his cane . " Ah ! " said he , " is it you ? Well , I thought it was you . Though I was n't sure . I wo n't interrupt you . Here are the proofs of number thirteen ; you 'll find something glorious in that  --  just the thing for you  --  do n't forget me next week  --  good by . I 'll see you again in a day or two . " I shall not cast a gloom over my readers by dwelling upon my feelings . Surely , surely , there are sympathetic bosoms among them . To them I appeal . I said nothing . Few could have detected any thing violent or extraordinary in my manner , as I took the proofs from the end of the little old gentleman 's cane , and laid them calmly on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that morning . It was out of the question . Indeed my mind scarcely recovered from the shock for several days . When my nerves are in any way irritated , I find a walk in the woods a soothing and agreeable sedative . Accordingly , the next afternoon , I wound up the affairs of the day earlier than usual , and set out for a ramble through the groves and along the shore of Hoboken . I was soon on one of the abrupt acclivities , where , through the deep rich foliage of the intertwining branches , I overlooked the Hudson , the wide bay , and the superb , steepled city , stretching in a level line of magnificence upon the shining waters , softened with an overhanging canopy of thin haze . I gazed at the picture , and contemplated the rivalry of nature with art , striving which could most delight . As my eye moved from ship to ship , from island to island , and from shore to shore  --  now reposing on the distant blue , then revelling in the nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grass , and a little ragged fellow came up , and asked me if I was the editor of the  --  . I was about replying to him affirmatively , when his words arrested my attention . " A little gentleman with a hat and cane , " he said , " had been inquiring for the editor , &c.,; at the adjoining hotel , and had given him sixpence to run up into the woods and find him . " I rushed precipitately , as I thought , into the thickest recesses of the wood . The path , however , being very circuitous , I suddenly came into it , and nearly ran against a person whom it needed no second glance to recognize , although his back was luckily toward me . The hat , the breeches , the cane , were enough . If not , part of a red-covered pamphlet , sticking out of the coatpocket , was . " It must be number thirteen ! " I exclaimed ; and as the little old gentleman was sauntering north , I shaped my course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to protect myself for the future , I took precautionary measures ; and in addition to having myself denied , I kept the window down , and made my egress and ingress through a door round the corner , as Peter told me he had several times seen the little old gentleman , with a package in his hand , standing opposite the one through which we usually entered , and looking at the office wistfully . By means of these arrangements , I succeeded in preserving my solitude inviolate , when , to my indignation , I received several letters , from different parts of the country , written by my friends , and pressing upon me , at the solicitation of the little old gentleman , the propriety of giving the " Thespian Magazine " a good notice . I tore the letters , each one as I read them , into three pieces , and dropped them under the table . Business calling me , soon after , to Philadelphia , I stepped on board the steamboat , exhilarated with the idea that I was to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of my destination about five o'clock in the afternoon . It was lovely weather . The water spread out like unrippled glass , and the sky was painted with a thousand varying shadows of crimson and gold . The boat touched the shore , and while I was watching the change of a lovely cloud , I heard the splash of a heavy body plunged into the water . A sudden sensation ran along the crowd , which rushed from all quarters towards the spot ; the ladies shrieked , and turned away their heads ; and I perceived that a man had fallen from the deck , and was struggling in the tide , with only one hand held convulsively above the surface . Being a practised swimmer , I hesitated not a moment , but flung off my hat and coat , and sprang to his rescue . With some difficulty I succeeded in bearing him to a boat and dragging him from the stream . I had no sooner done so , than to my horror and astonishment , I found I had saved the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  his broad-brimmed hat floated on the current  --  but his cane ( thank heaven ! ) had sunk for ever . He suffered no other ill consequences from the catastrophe , than some injury to his garments and the loss of his cane . His gratitude for my exertions knew no bounds . He assured me of his conviction that the slight acquaintance previously existing between us , would now be ripened into intimacy , and informed me of his intention to lodge at the same hotel with me . He had come to Philadelphia to see about a plate for his sixteenth number , which was to surpass all its predecessors , and of which he would let me have an early copy , that I might notice it as it deserved .
