txt THE story of Emily - and William interested me at the time I heard it , and I have been led to think that in some of its features it is not peculiar . They were natives of the same beautiful village , and the same year ushered them into existence . Their early years were spent in the daily round of childish sports , and they suffered in common their little vexatious . They cultivated their gardens together , and roamed over the fields in company , and their little bridges and miniature edifices were built without any aid beyond their own combined ingenuity  --  and when she drove him before her wagon , and would urge him to quicken his speed in rivalry of their other playmates , at his request she would stop to admire a beautiful flower , or group the clouds in quaint figures . And when they were weary with play , they would rest together under some shady tree , and he would rest his head on her lap , and plan some new excursion , while she would play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enviable air of her uncle , the Colonel . Thus the golden dreams of youth flitted before them , but left , through every change , increased affection and confirmed influence . They were children of nature , and knew no other laws than hers ; their impulses were pure , and no art had taught them restraint . Their more advanced education , of course , separated them , in some degree , and as each became more acquainted with the duties and privileges of their respective sexes , they began to examine each other more minutely , and study each other 's tastes and dispositions with more direct reference to their own . In those sports in which they still both mingled , each was at the same time the censor and the advocate of the other , and each began to demand from the other concessions not made to all . If William chanced to ride with any other of the youthful village belles , ' Emily ,  --  she knew not why ,  --  always took the liberty of being displeased ; or if she manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William always considered it incumbent upon him to leave the ball-room and saunter alone through the walks on her uncle 's grounds . Her mind was of a strongly-marked and powerful cast . Though restless to a degree that in other cases would have proved ruinous , she had been able to master not only the learning expected from her age and sex , but much that is considered the peculiar province of man ; - though not very fond of music , she had cultivated that art with perse // verance and remarkable success ;  --  and in drawing and painting , had made herself a proficient , because her family had always been highly distinguished as excelling in that art . Ambition was the strongest trait in her character , and she only regretted that her sphere of action was too limited for its sway . Her family bad at one time been publicly distinguisbed , though subsequently unfortunate ; and her greatest subject of complaint , was , that she could never revive her fallen name . With the greatest softness , she combined almost masculine energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her disposition . Her feelings were warm and quick ; and where her heart could expand itself : , affection and disinterestedness shone through every change of feeling . Amiability marked her domestic relations , and condescension distinguished her intercourse with the world . Time passed on , and brought its changes . Maturer years succeeded to infancy and youth , and life began to open in its more important relations before them . William had passed through the usual routine of education ; and , without seeking them , had obtained the love and admiration of his equals , for the benevolence of his heart and the strength and variety of his talents . He showed no ambition , and cared not for distinction , and would have been contented to resign the prospect of every thing that talent and family can procure among men , and settle , to enjoy life , in his native and beloved village . His mind was one of harmony and peace , and poetry breathed in every feeling of his heart . He loved best to exercise his talents in the retirement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his best interests were unfolded . Natural scenery was unalloyed enjoyment. ; and a fine sunset , or a starlit evening , on the lake , excited in him greater pleasure than could the triumph of the ambitious demagogue or the factious author . But his life was not destined to be unchequered . He had been happy in every circumstance-happy in his home , his talents , his resources and when Emily confessed that the companion of her childhood was the beloved of her riper years , he thought that fortune 's smiles must be expended ; - her frown he had never known . But the shaft of disappointment came , and from a quarter he least expected it . Though Emily loved him with the deepest , most enduring affection , and depended on his love , as the flower on the breath of heaven , yet she did not think his character a perfect one . She disliked his want of more active energy , a wider ambition , his indifference to honor and distinction from men . It had long been to her a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most deliberate consideration that she demanded of him , that before she should unite her fate indissolubly with his , he should leave his retirement , and , entering into the world , gain a name such as her family had once worn . The discussion was long , warm , painful . He used every argument which his experience of past happiness , and the peaceful character of his mind , could suggest , to dissuade her from her demand . She suffered every agony incident to a struggle , between immediate and strong affection and the bias of a strongly-marked character ; but she remained inflexible . Finally , he yielded ; and with his resolution , his love had given way , if it had not been more firmly rooted than even his long-indulged habits of quietness and peaceful happiness . He asked for no delay ; if his task must be performed before the rich reward could be gained , he // desired to begin at once , and accomplish , as shortly as possible , his painful work . He would not pretend to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the confusion of his mind , at the prospect before him , betrayed his unsuitableness for the life Emily had marked out for him . The interval , before he should leave his home for one of the large cities of his country , was quickly passed ; and though he longed to leave the scenes that were constantly reminding him of his many lost resources of happiness , the day of his departure came too soon . As the coach which would convey him passed near her uncle 's house , Emily accompanied him across the meadows to meet it . The sun was just rising over the mountains which enclosed their beautiful valley , and his golden beams glanced joyously on the glistening leaves , and sparkled in the innumerable dew-drops . The air was fresh , and still , and heavy with the exhilarating odors of the morning , and no sound , except the merry song of the birds , broke the universal calmness-all nature seemed wrapt in admiration of the coming king of day  --  the leaves hung unmoved by any passing breeze , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pebbly bed . Emily and William stood some time silent-now gazing on the stretching landscapes-now searching the depths of the morning sky . All around was quiet ; all was peace and harmony without , but in the secret places of their hearts the tide of feeling swept on its crooked course in tumultuous and broken waves . He was engaged with fast coming remembrances of his early days , and the charms of his home were rapidly reviewed as year after year arose in his memory , and each succeeding one seemed fraught with greater happiness than the former . He thought of his early hopes , that he might rest there where he had first known happiness , and , in the society of her he loved , and surround* ed by all his early and dearest associations , devote himself to their mutual improvement and happiness . His eye dwelt with mournful pleasure on the spot he had marked out for his residence ; quiet , retired , commanding the most beautiful prospects  --  but his heart sickened as he glanced along the road that led to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the thought that a few moments would separate him from the companion at his side , his early playmate , his constant friend , hisfirst and only love . Though their arms were interwoven , she did not press upon him , but stood firm and upright , her eyes bent toward the distant lake ; but the eye within , as it glanced over the future , was dazzled and confused by the brilliancy of the images there conjured up . She thought not of present pain , or of the agonies of separation ; nor did she fear the possible effect of acquaintance with the world in estranging William 's affection from her she felt no sorrow at the prospect of his long absence ; nor did she shrink from the thought of her own loneliness . Her vision was a bright one-she followed him through the intricate paths of ambition , and hailed his success on reaching the highest point her imagination could picture-she discovered his opening splendor , and watched him in a course of increasing glory , till she grew dizzy with the prospect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confounded her triumph with his success . // And as she threw her arms round his neck , and looked upon his glistening eye , she said- " We part now , William , but we shall soon meet again , when your fortunes shall be rising and when men begin to sound your name , as one to be respected and feared-that name , Wilb ian-i , you xviii give me , and proud shall I be to wear it . Your wife , dearest , will be a happy woman , " He smiled as he imprinted a kiss on her marble brow . " That honor would not compensate me for a long absence from you . Emily , I have been thinking how happy we might be if you would be content with the happy lot Heaven has given us . T is not too late yet , Emily - say you are willing , and let me stay . Do not drive me into the cold , selfish world , but suffer me to remain here . I ask no honor above that of being called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and take the happiness we might both enjoy here . " She withdrew her arms , and folding them calmly stood some moments , her eye glistening and lips quivering , before she answered " William , I sacrificed much of peace and happiness when I proposed your leaving me  --  but you are a man , and it was your duty . But , you say well , sir , t is not too late-you are flee , William , free to go where you will , to do what you will , to love xvhom you will . I never will wed the man who refuses to do what , were I a man , should be the object of my life . " Here the rattling of the stage coach was heard as it descended the hill ; a few minutes , and the destiny of each was irrevocably fixed . Emily 's emotion increased as she heard it ; the moisture gathered round her deep blue eyes , and one clear drop fell upon her pale cheek ; hut she betrayed no signs of weakness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not wish to conceal her suffering , but she remained firm in her purpose . William 's agitation was momentary ; at one moment his mind was a chaos of contending sufferings , but they subsided at once , and the current of his thoughts was stilled , and all was calm as the Sea of the Dead . Till this moment he had hoped some kind Providence would save him from the sad alternative ; but now all hope vanished , arid he breathed again freely . But the world was changed to him-from the heaven of his mind every star had been sxvept , save one , and that shed a ghastly light to make more evident the desolation which reigned . As the coach appeared nearer them at a turn of the road , he silently clasped her to his bosoni , his arm encircled her waist , and her head rested on his shoulder . She now appeared the weak and frail one , he the strong and confident . She did not speak ; but , as he separated her from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parting kiss , and said , " Emily , farewell ! tell me , when next we meet , if I am all you expected me to become . " When she looked up he was gone , and the glories of the scene around seemed to mock her wretchedness . The wheels of the receding coach were heard at a distance , as they bore away from her him she loved , and when in a few moments they were heard no more , her desolation was complete . She was now , for the first time in her life , alone  --  the tie , which had bound her in unison with the harmony of nature  --  the spell , which gave the charm to the grand and beautiful , was broken . She knew that every thing around shone in unusual // beauty ; but the power of enjoyment was gone-her presence seemed to her to spread around a spirit of mockery and unreal splendor . We will hasten over the two years which followed William 's separation from his home , and his entrance into the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappointment . His history is briefly told . His talents and acquirements gained for him ready admission into ' all ranks of his fellow-men  --  and respect and envy , flattery and calumny , attended his step . It was long before he bec*mne interested in the novel scenes which were passing before him , or could form any plans of advancement which should bring him into more intimate connection with those among whom he had thrown himself , but whose associations and sympathies were so little in harmony with his own . His feelings , which had formerly flowed in a smooth and peaceful channel , were now liable to continual disturbance , and , beyond his control , bore him along in their irregular course . But , as he became more accustomed to regard his loss as irreparable , and to realize that the only prospect of Emily 's ever bec*mning his depended on his exertions and success , he began to rouse from his inactivity , and apply himself to make the best use of the means necessary for his purpose . His time and talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployed to insure success . Gradually he felt an interest in his occupation , and , in time , ardor took the place of indifference . His resolution was made to forget the pleasures he had abandoned in the pursuit of new excitement , and he found the task more easy than he had anticipatedthe pursuit of power and reputation engrossed every feeling , succeeded to every other interest . his letters to Emily at this time spoke only of his interested plans , his selfish enterprize ,  --  and he called upon her to look forward , at no distant day , to see his final success and distinction among men . But while she exulted in his bright prosl ) ects , she missed the softer and more submissive language of love ; he descanted on his future influence and high reputation , but his hopes of happiness were not now built on the prospect of union with her-he had made a sacrifice for her ; but when he ceased to consider it a sacrifice , he ceased to consider her the object of it . He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing for himself . And now , after two years separation , success seemed almost certain . The rapidity of his rise had been unprecedented ; every obstacle had yielded to his talents and perseverance , and every art had been practised to gain his end . The poetic simplicity and purity of his mind were gone , and interest had become his ruling motive . No class of society had he neglected , nor any means of acquiring favor with each . As a man of the world his discipline was complete ; his court had been artfully and successfully paid to all  --  the softer sex admired his elegant person and finished manners ; the old men commended his steady ad herence to old established principles ; the youn* emulated the multiplicity of his accomplishments . In literature he had won the applause of the reading world , and laid the foundation of an extensive reputation . But on politics he had vested his chief reliance , and every thing answered his expectations  --  the wide field for the popular orator had been assiduously cultivated , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in government had been strenuously advocated , and powerful men boldly defended . So rapid had been his progress , // and so sanguine were his expectations , that he now in triumph announced to Emily his union with one of the most influential men in the state , who had solicited his assistance and promised him speedy advancement . This man he considered under the deepest obligations to him , for he had successfully defended him when in ambiguous circhmstances ) and was now laboring to secure his success at an approaching election . Emily 's happiness was great ; nothing was now too high for her soarin* imagination , no elevation so lofty but she fancied her lover had reached it ; her bosom heaved as she anticipated his triumphs , and the name and influence he was daily building up-he whom she loved better than any thing she could imagine , and lbr whom she had made the sacrifice of separation , was rising to honor and splendid distinction , and she was happy . The harvest of her hopes was rich and mature , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep away the fruits of her fondest care . In the midst of her exultation , allayed by a long silence on William 's part , she received a letter which had traveled far and wide before it reached her , written by an unknown hand , and informing her that William was sick , having been attacked by a violent fever , and that great apprehensions were entertained for his life . He had rested all his hopes of advancement on political success , and , to secure this , had devoted his whole time and energies ; every other pursuit had been abandoned , every thing staked on this game ; and he had discovered , like many others , too late , , that talents , without a knowledge of the world , are not sufficient to secure success in politics . His powerful friend had succeeded through his exertions , and gained a place where his assistance became unnecessary , and then , in fear of talents he had found so powerful , had taken the earliest opportunity of disappointing William 's expectations , and overthrowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shock was too sudden , the ruin too complete ; his fortitude abandoned him , and his constitution , which excessive application had been rapidly undermining , sunk under the powerful moral reaction . Emily lost no time in repairing to him . The distance was great , but she was insensible to fatigue , able to bear every hardship but delay ; and day and night she traveled , alone , unceasing , and untired . Every inconvenience was slighted , every consideration , but him and his danger , forgotten . She imagined him suffering from disease and from separation from her-he might be alone , with no kind friend to attend his wants , none to soothe his troubled mind-he might be reproaching her for unfeeling delay , and might at that moment be listening to every passing carriage to hear if it brought her  --  or his last moments might have been hastened by his impatience to see her , and he might have died-leaving her only a dying message to be delivered by stranger lips . Thus , during her long journey , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no subject of consolation . She at length , however , reached the city where William had gone , whither he had been forced from her and his native home . it was night when she entered its narrow streets , confined by dull brick walls . A slow rain was pattering on the pavements and fell gioomily against the carriage windows . The foot passengers moved busily on their way through the murky streets , unheeding her , careless // of her interest or anxieties . The progress of the carriage was slow , owing to the driver 's imperfect acquaintance with the streets , through which they groped at a most disconsolate and funereal pace . Finally , however , they stopped at a low , gloomy house , where William had taken up his humble quarters . The door was fastened , and Emily thought she could not survive the long interval before it was opened . She asked the rough looking waiter after William , and was told that he lived-though every hour was expected to be his last . She revived at the idea of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , harried after her guide to his room . He lives , she thought ; I shall see him once again ; he will again press me to his bosom ; he will once more say he loves me , and will tell me that he dies prepared for the awful change . I shall watch over his dying hours ; he shall see none but me , and on my bosom shall he breathe his last in calmness and in peace . Thus ran her thoughts when she reached his door . She entered abruptly . A low lamp burned on a table near the bed , and threw a dim light over the room and furniture . The apartment was large and dreary . No marks of comfort appeared . The bare floor sounded coldly under her feet  --  a fe ' ; chairs were scattered about , some holding his clothes as he had taken them off at the beginning of his sickness ; others were occupied by the plates of half-eaten food , or the unopened daily papers  --  a table at his bed-side was covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carelessly brushed into a heap to make room for the phials and cups of medicine , which were there crowded confusedly together . As Emily advanced , she discovered William on the bed . As his frame had always been slender , sickness had made little alteration in him , and as his face was turned from the light , she saw none . His chestnut hair fell , as in boyhood , curling over his pale forehead , and his mouth wore his own beautiful expression . His eyes were closed , but he was evidently awake , and seemed suffering from exhaustion after some violent effort . She gently took his hand , cold and moist ; and , lowly breathing his name , was bending to kiss him , when he started , and , looking upward , his eyes glaring with frenzy , made an eII'ort to rise , his right hand clenched and stretched towards heaven , while he supported himself on the other , and exclaimed , with passionate earnestness- " Oh spare me yet a little while , good God ! Father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down with me-oh spare me " - Here he fell exhausted . Emily tried to catch his eye as she bent over him . " Will you speak to me William ? speak but one word to your own Emily-say that you know me-oh , William , do you not love me ? speak to me . " But he , not seeming in the least aware of her presence , again started and exclaimed , his eye beaming fire and his lip curling with passion- " Where is he who tempted me into this sea of hell ? "  --  and sank with a feeble cry . Emily threw herself upon his burning bosom , and wept tears of agony . When she looked up , the light shone full on his face , his eyes were strained upwards , and his lips still wore the smile of bitter derisioii-but the spirit had fled to the judgement-seat of God.
