txt THIS volume , though diversified by no remarkable adventures , is full of interest . Mr. Stearns , whose recent death in Paris has disappointed many hopes , was a man of singular purity of character and refinement of intellect . He carried into the sacred office the most ardent zeal , the most single-hearted devotion to its severe and laborious duties . He was educated at Harvard University , where the modesty of his character and the correctness of his literary taste were highly appreciated . His feelings towards that institution , and his views of the obligations of its students , are thus expressed by his biographer . // " Mr. Stearns felt a deep interest in Harvard College . He venerated , he loved , that institution with filial affection . Painfully sensible of what he conceived to be its errors in Christian ( loctrine , he could not fail to appreciate its thorough course of literary and scientific studies , its numerous and superior lectures , its large and invaluable library , its intellectual and classic atmosphere , and , opinion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is thought , would stiffer much less in comparison , with the other colleges of New England , than is sometimes imagined . He looked upon it as the noble offspring of the Pilgrims , consecrated by many a prayer to the interests of the Redeemer 's kingdom , and designed by God , to afford important aid in accomplishing the destinies of the New World , and sooner or later , in rolling the wave of salvation , by a crucified Saviour , over the Old . " July 14th , 1823 , just before he graduated , he writes to a brother , who at that moment was in great doubt as to the choice of a college , but afterwards entered Harvard ; Oh , how pleasant it would be , if I might indulge the hope that was coming here , to take my place with my books , furniture , and every little article of convenience , &amp;c . How much more pleasure I should take in visiting this seat of learning , the first-born of our enlightened and pious forefathers , - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursery of our own fat hers , - the object of their kindest regard , - of their warmest gratitude , - of their highest veneration , - of their most fervent , hnportunate , and acceptable prayers . * * * * * * God bless the sons of Harvard , and preserve our Alma Mater from the open attacks of enemies , the secret treachery of hypocritical friends , and from the baleful influence of every wrong principle to be found in her own heart . ' " Mr. Stearns was much tried while a member of college , as to the duties which he awed , relatively , to himself ; to his fellow-students , and to the officers of the institution . According to sentiments of honor which prevail in every generous breast , he despised the meanness of those who seek preferment , by the wilful exposure of another 's faults . At the same time , neither his self-respect , nor his principles of religion , would allow him to shield himself or his friends , by the greater meanness of equivocation and untruth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stoop , in any emergency , to falsehood , but always to save the character of his associates , when lie could do it , without contravening his conscience . He reverenced , in students , as well as in citizens , that manly independence which respects itself as a being accountable chiefly to God ; but he looked upon the bravadoes of assumed consequence , and the miserable ambition of notoriety in wickedness , as beneath his contempt . It was a principle with him , while a member of the university , that a college rebellion is never wise or right . If the laws of an institution , or the executors of those laws , he nrgue ( l , become so oppressive that I can no longer submit to them , let me , honorably , withdraw from their authority , and seek to correct abuses and redress grievances , by such means as the members of a free community , in common enjoy . But let me not , recklessly , resist the powers that be , ' or , without counting the cost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , and discomfiture and mortification to myself will certainly ensue . " Though a member of the university , at a time of unusual comumo // tion , he passed its ordeal without censure , and without injury to his morals or to his Christian character . He was known as a professor of religion , a full believer in the doctrines of the cross ; - as such , his sentiments were treated with delicacy , and his habits of devotion arid rigid adherence to principle , with respect . " - pp. 26 - 29 . Mr. Stearns 's physical constitution was feeble , and he was able to devote only an interrupted attention to the labors of the ministry , for several years after he had completed his professional studies . At length , in 1834 , his health was so far restored , and his anxiety to engage in active duties had become so great , that he consented to accept an invitation from Boston , and was settled over the Old South Church , as their pastor . The ceremonies of the ordination , are described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Skinner , with whom Mr. Stearns had been long and intimately associated ; the consecrating prayer was offered by his predecessor Dr. Wisner ; the charge was given by his venerable father , the minister of Bedford ; and the right hand of fellowship , by a younger brother , who had already been several years engaged in the duties of the clerical profession . The following passage is taken from a letter addressed to his parents shortly after his ordination . " I can not tell with what feelings I awoke , oii the morning after you left me , in the consciousness that I was an ordained minister of the gospel , the anthorized and responsible pastor of a numerous flock , appointed to care for their souls . Recollections of the past , and anticipations of the future , came rolling over me in strange combinations , and waves of emotion rolled through my heart , like a sea after a storm . I rose and dressed myself , and sat down at my window to muse , in silent astonishment , on the scene that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uiider my eye was a wide field of the dead , covered with the monnirients of generations past . There lay some of my own kiiidred . There lay one who was the companion of my infancy and childhood , who has often borne me in her arms , and led me to school , and amused me in my sports . There lay some of my predecessors , in the care and service of the church , - Huntington and Eckley , - and I know not how many of those who were before them . The green brass was springing up among their tombs , and over their graves , in the freshness of the morning , and the dew lay upon it , and the rising sun glittered on the drops , and the tombs and thick grave-stones threw their long shadows over the ( lead , as if to veil them from excessive brightness . In the corner opposite , Park Street Church , where I I ) reached my first sermon in Boston , stood in its grandeur , and lifted its tall spire into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty elms spread out their venerable branches . Then the thronged street displayed itself , and the noise of wheels and hoofs had begun , incessant for the day . And next the crowded dwellings of the city rose in massy piles . Aniong them , and directly opposite my window , was to be seen in modest retirement , and almost shouldered into obscurity by more recent and im // posing structures , what was probably the mansion of some great one a century ago . The towers and steeples of ten or twelve churches or meetinghouses might be discerned at a glance , and among them the spire of my own , just rising over the top of the Tremont . Beyond them lay the harbour in full display of its beauty and glory , its islands and ships , - the Castle , the very spot with which is associated tle most fascinating portion of the history of one of my grandfathers , the House of Industry and its companion , and near them the famous Heights of Dorchester , now included within the limits of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rising above all the building , were distinctly seen the hills of Dorchester , Roxhury , and Brookline . My eyes glanced over the distant and variegated scenery , and then returned , and rested on the pensive spot that lay immediately under my window . I gazed there , fixed in unremembered thought , and was lost , till the summons came for hrcakfhst. " - pp. 58 , 59 . Mr. Stearns soon found that he had calculated too much on his supposed restoration to health . The duties and excitements of his office nearly prostrated the energies of his sensitive frame , and compelled him to forego them , and seek anew , in travel and repose , a renovation of spirits and strength . He visited , accordingly , many of the most interesting parts of the United States , and finally , in 1836 , sailed for Europe , in company with Professor Stowe of Cincinnati . He travelled over England , Scotland , Germany , and France , and passed one winter in Italy , from which countries he addressed many agreeable letters to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume before us , a judicious selection from the journals which Mr. Stearns kept , of what interested him during his travels . But his constitution had been too far undermined by the advances of the most insidious and flattering of diseases , for any human means to restore it . After his return to Paris , in 1837 , Mr. Stearns sunk rapidly , and died July 15th and with him perished many high expectations of usefulness to the cause of religion and letters . The memoir , prefixed to this volume , is written by the Rev. Mr. Stearns of Cambridgeport . It is a pleasing tribute of affection to the memory of a departed brother , and is characterized by great simplicity and natural feeling . The letters of Mr. Stearns , the subject of the memoir , give us a delightful view of his moral and religious excellence , and the delicacy of his literary taste . His journals were written midst the hurry and excitement of travel ; but they abound in beautiful passages , and everywhere show the liveliest sensibility to the beauties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the remotest idea of publication , and present to us , therefore , the fresh and unstudied expressions of the author 's feelings , amidst the novelties of European capi // tals , and the historical monuments , which appealed to the most interesting associations of his early classical studies . The following passage was written the day after his arrival in Rome . " Sabbath morning , Jan. 15. - Awoke this morning in Rome , with a full sense and consciousness of being really in Rome . What a deep , full tide of thoughts , recollections , and emotions ! Nothing but weariness and lassitude , such as I felt too , could repress the flood . I sat down and read of Paul , and thought of Paul and the Cmsars . It was Paul , however , that now filled my mind ; every thing around me , every monument , obelisk , column , portico , tower , dome , seemed associated with Paul . Afier meeting , returning to our hotel , 1 spent an hour or two in reading of Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrace upon the Pincian Hill , directly hack of my lodgings , to indulge my eye and heart in solitary views and musings . Before and around me arose towers and columns and domes , - telling of the magnificence which has been , by the magnificence which still remains among ruins , and stirvives the wreck of conflagrations and wars and violence and rapine and earthquakes and floods . Above all , rose the majestic dome of St. Peter 's , fro in which deep , full , solemn tones of vesper hells swelled on the ear like sounds from unearthly temples . The whole aspect of Rome is of fading greatness , - yet of greatness still imposing , - and still putting forth anew something of its pristine strength and splendor . It is as an archangel fallen , noble though in ruins. * " Oh that I were free from the lassitude and depression and weakness and pains and encumbrances of disease , that my free spirit might go forth through this land of enchantment , and treasure up its rich remains ! One singular impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since my arrival , - an impression of being at the centre of the world , - the source of every thing great , - of good and of bad , - the centre and the source ! - pp. 134 , 135 . A part of the volume is occupied with a selection from Mr. Stearns 's Discourses . They are excellent specimens of pulpit eloquence , and breathe the purest spirit of the Christian religion . In point of style , they are remarkable for chasteness and elegance of expression , and methodical arrangement in the discussion of topics . They show careful study , and an almost fastidiously delicate taste , and prove clearly the author 's conviction , that the graces of art were by no means out of keeping with the sacred subjects which he was called upon to illustrate . But these discourses have a higher value than their worth as literary compositions . They show us how natural it is for an enlarged and cultivated mind , however strong its own conviction of truth may be , to treat others who hold different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take the volume together , it furnishes us with a portrait of a character , remarkable for fortitude , grace , and sweetness . The long protracted agonies of lingering disease , and deferred // hope , were borne by Mr. Stearns with the most submissive spirit , and the final sentence was received with Christian heroism . The book which records his trials , and labors , and virtues , will be read with pleasure and profit , not only by the sect of Christians with whom he was particularly united , but by all to whom purity of mind , and refinement of intellect are dear.
