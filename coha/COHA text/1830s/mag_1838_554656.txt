txt THE " Letters from Palmyra , " of which the present work is the sequel , is one of the most brilliant additions to American literature . r1* have fallen on a subject of such admirable capabilities , and unappropriated by previous seekers after attractive themes for works of fiction , was a piece of rare good fortune , in an age of such literary abundance as the present ; to have treated it in a manner fully equal to its demands on the imagination required high powers , persevering labor , and the keenest perception . All this was done in that beautiful work . But we have already given our opinion of its merits , at a length , which forbids us now to indulge in further commendation. * The subject of the present work , is one of a deeper moral interest , but of less variety in the incidents , and less picturesqueness in the coloring . In its general outlines , the subject has also been more or less successfully treated , by other authors . The persecutions of the early Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pens of both historians and novelists ; their sufferings , their heroic endurance , and their purity of life , have become familiar to all classes of readers . So far , then , our author has entered upon already trodden ground . But in two or three important particulars , he has given us highly original pictures . Others have delineated the early Christians too much according to their own peculiar , and sectarian opin ion . In this work , the primitive form and simplicity of our religion are kept steadily in view . Others have made all Christians nearly alike , as if their religion had an extraordinary power of destroying individuality of character , and of // fusing all the passions , hopes , weaknesses , and fears of multitudes into one indistinguishable mass of piety and constancy ; as if all the elements of character , like the items of personal property , had been thrown into one conmon stock . But this disregard of the principles of human nature , and its ever-varying phenomena , has been carefully avoided by the author of Probus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his Pagan . Each man is affected , by the operations of the Christian faith , exactly according to the original tendencies of his character . He is as much a distinct individual after his conversion as before ; he acts out his own nature in the one case as much as in the other . They all have their several excellences , virtues , and weaknesses , - the necessary condition of humanity . But they are all , at the same time , under a more exalting influence , guided by a steadier light , sustained by a more satisfying hope , than Pagan mythology and philosophy had ever conceived . Thus the extravagant representations of other writers , who have used early Christianity as a means of exciting interest , nowhere occur in " Probus " ; while all the calm strength of the sincere disciple , and the burning zeal of enthusiastic natures , are most admirably exhibited . A large part of the work is taken up with discussions of the evidences of Christianity , its claims to the love of men , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work naturally grows out of the circumstances of the times in which the scene is laid . The story runs through the last years of the reign of Aurelian . The Emperor has become corrupted by the possession of power his superstitions have been roused by the ferocious priest , Fronto , whose influence over his mind has become gradually more complete and more deadly ; the violent passions of his nature , which have heretofore been somewhat held in check , are stimulated to acts of fury and outrage . A storm of persecution is gradually gathering over the Christian churches , and every power of argument and persuasion is called into activity for the defence of their menaced religion . Thus the grounds of their faith are reviewed and scrutinized ; objections to it answered ; and its moral influence set forth with a clearness , and convincing power , with a simplicity and calmness of statement , which might be well imitated in works of a professedly religious character . These parts of the VOL . XLvII . - NO. ci . 59 // work will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gorgeous scenes and stirring adventures , that fill the " Letters from Palmyra " ; but they are strictly in keeping with the story and the times ; and they have a permanent value , as being the reflections of a profoundly thoughtful mind upon subjects of the most momentous import . The leading Christian characters Probus , Felix , and Macer , are finely discriminated from each other , and admirably executed , whether considered as portraits of individuals or as representatives of classes . Probus is the calm and judicious Christian ; ready to endure any thing , if called so to endure by his sense of duty , but never rashly provoking danger ; earnestly preaching Christian truth , but never uttering harsh denunciations ; leading a life of spotless purity , and charitably construing the faults and follies of others . Felix loves Christianity , but loves the shows and pomps of the world nearly as well . Luxury and parade have for him attractions , which he can not resist . He is , therefore , showy , pompous , and luxurious , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly its outward observances , and of the love of worldly indulgences , which we may see at the present day , in a portion of the members of more than one established church . Macer , on the contrary , is a zealous enthusiast , not merely willing to endure the sufferings of martyrdom , but earnestly courting its honors . Human weakness modifies his Christian character , just as it modifies that of Felix ; hut the effect is shown in a different manner . In the one , it is a love of worldly honor to which vanity aspires ; in the other , a love of honor at the hands of the church , and in the memory of all coming times . These characters are , and are meant to be , inferior to the first , to Probus , who is an example of almost faultless , yet quite attainable excellence , under Christian influences . He would have been a Socrates in ancient Pagan times ; he would have been the cheerful , eloquent , and consistent pastor of modern Christendom ; performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is amiable and beautiful in the character of the Christian gentleman . The style of these works can not be too highly commended . It is easy , graceful , and pure , - varying with the subject , and happily expressive of all its changes . In narrative , it is simple and unadorned . In description of external // scenery it becomes ornate , and sometimes highly colored . In presenting scenes , which involve human actions and passions , it is warm , brilliant , and animated . The plot is carried on amidst the antiquities and innumerable historical associations of the Eternal City ; all the proprieties of the time , and the august place , are observed , and indicated , in the language , with accurate knowledge and exquisite taste . It is a great excellence in fictitious composition , to make the reader see the things described ; but , in order to do this , the writer must first see himself , at least in imagination . Goethe relates of himself , that he was accustomed to make sketches with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistical light , while he was journeying ; and these sketches were used , in the description of scenes , in his novels and poems . Hence the wonderful picturesqueness and truth of his delineations of nature . This is precisely the leading excellence of the descriptive parts in both of our author 's works . They seem to be realities reduced to writing ; as if he had actually drawn them first with a pencil , and , from the pictures thus accurately stamped upon his memory , traced in clear and appropriate words , the scenes amidst which his plot is carried on . This remark applies as well to the architectural scenes as to the natural . We select as a specimen the dedication of the temple of the Sun . " At the appointed hour we were at the palace of Aurelian , on the Palatine , where a procession , pompous as art and rank and numbers could make it , was formed , to move thence by a winding and distant route to the temple , near the foot of the Quirinal . Julia repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , -I to the palace , to join the company of the Emperor . Of the gorgeous magnificence of the procession , I shall tell you nothing . It was in extent and variety of pomp , and costliness of decoration , a copy of that of the late triumph , and went even beyond the captivating splendor of the example . Roman music , - which is not that of Palmyra , - lent such charms as it could , to our passage through the streets to the temple , from a thousand performers . " As we drew near to the lofty fabric , I thought that no scene of such various beauty and magnificence had ever met my eye . The temple itself is a work of unrivalled art . In size it surpasses any other building of the same kind in Rome , and for the excellence of workmanship and purity of design , // although it may fall below the standard of Hadrian 's age , yet , for a certain air of grandeur and luxuriance of invention in its details , and lavish profusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edifice of any preceding age ever perhaps resembled it . Its order is the Corinthian , of the Roman form , and the entire building is surrounded by its slender columns , each composed of a single piece of marble . Upon the front is wrought Apollo surrounded by the Hours . The western extremity is approached by a flight of steps of the same breadth as the temple itself . At the eastern , there extends beyond the walls , to a distance equal to the length of the building , a marble platform , upon which stands the altar of sacrifice , and which is ascended by various flights of steps , some Jittle more than a gently rising plain , up which the beasts are led that are destined to the altar . " When this vast extent of wall and column of the most dazzling brightness came into view , everywhere covered , together with the surrounding temples , palaces , and theatres , with a dense mass of human beinos of all climes and regions , dressed out in their richest attire , - music from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proud and excited populace , every few moments and from different points , as Aurelian advanced , shaking the air with their thrilling din ,  --  the neighing of horses , the frequent blasts of the trumpet , - the whole made more solemnly imposing by the vast masses of cloud which swept over the sky , now suddenly unveiling and again eclipsing the sun , the great god of this idolatry , and from which few could withdraw their gaze - when at once this all broke upon my eye and ear , I was like a child , who before had never seen aught but his own village , and his own rural temple , in the effect wrought upon me , and the passiveness with which I abandoned myself to the sway of the senses . Not one there was more ravished by the outward circumstance and show . I thought of Rome 's thousand years , of her power , her greatness , and universal empire , and for a moment my step was not less proud than that of Aurelian . But after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the eye had seen the glory , and the ear had fed upon the harmony and the praise , then I thought and felt very differently ; sorrow and compassion for these gay multitudes were at my heart ; prophetic forebodings of disaster , danger , and ruin to those to whose sacred cause I had linked myself , made my tongue to falter in its speech and my limbs to tremble . I thought that the superstition that was upheld by the wealth and the power , whose manifestations were before me , had its roots in the very centre of the earth , - far too // deep down for a few like myself ever to reach them . I was like one whose last hope of life and escape is suddenly struck away . " I was roused from these meditations by our arrival at the eastern front of the temple . Between the two central columns , on a throne of gold and ivory , sat the Emperor of the world , surrounded by the senate , the colleges of augurs and haruspices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all in their peculiar costume . Then Fronto , the priest of the temple , when the crier had proclaimed that the hour of worship and sacrifice had come , and had commanded silence to be observed , - standing at the altar , glittering in his white and golden robes , like a messenger of light , - bared his head , and , lifting his face up toward the sun , offered in clear and sounding tones the prayer of dedication . " - Vol. i. pp. 96 - 99 . The story proceeds with the gradual irritation of the Emperor 's mind against the Christians , by the machinations of Fronto . The persecutions commence , and are carried on with cruel vigor , even to the shedding of blood . For a time , Piso and his friends are shielded by their high rank and the Emperor 's protection , from the dangers in which the other Christians were involved ; but , after his departure on some distant warlike expedition , the suppression of the Christian heresy is intrusted to the hands of Fronto , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepares to go to extremities . They are brought before the tribunal , and just as the torture is to be applied , a commotion in the streets puts a stop to the proceedings , and the news is brought of Aurelian s assassination by officers in his army . Under his successor the persecution ceases , and here the narrative comes to an appropriate conclusion . The book leaves an impression of completeness , just proportion , and admirable distribution of parts , which are found in perfection only in the works of great masters.
