txt I AM not one of those , who , without inquiring into the why or wherefore of any modern customs , condemn them merely because they are new ; and with equally little reason persist in preferring " the good ola way , " to which habit alone can have rendered them partial . Still there was in the primitive fashions of our forefathers , much that was striking , and grand , from its very simplicity ; much thatwas calculated to call forth the high and deep feelings of their sterner characters , and from which the puny sensibility of the present period would shrink in dismay . Amongst those customs , once universal , and still existing in most of our country villages , is one , which , in my mind , possesses a peculiar degree of fitness and solemnity , which can never be fully compensated by the advantages , however great they may be , of the one that has superseded it -I refer to the manner , in which the remains of the de* parted were borne to their last home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be surprised to learn that the office , which they have been accustomed to see performed by the funeral car , was formerly dischayed by some of the male attendants at the house of mourning , who preceded the train of relatives , and performed by turns the last sad duty of conveying , to the house appointed for all the living , the perishable portion of that friend whom they were about to consign ,  --  " dust to dust , ashes to ashes , " - to the silent tomb . in addition to the six persons who supported the bier , and who were usually from the younger and more athletic portion of the assembled group , there walked , on each side of it , the three others who were selected for the office of pall-bearers , on account of the similarity of their ages to that of the deceased . On these , in my younger days , it was customary for the mourning family to bestow a weed for the hat and a pair of black gloves , to which , if the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of gratitude for their attention was added . If the corpse was that of a young female , the l ) all-bearers were sometimes taken from amongst her youthful friends of the same sex . Ho*v solemn , how admonitory must have been . the feelings awakened in the bosoms of those thus conveying to the grave the mortal remains of one whom they had known in life Must they not have heard within their own breasts a voice loud as that of an archangel , saying , " Be ye also ready ! " What heart , however hard , but must have felt , at that time , the necessity for instant preparation ? What breast , however callous , but must have heaved a sigh over hitherto unmourned-for sin , and have breathed a prayer for l ) ardon from Him who seeth in secret ? Though , with . the many , these impressions may have been as fleeting as the light clouds of the morning , or as the dew upon the fluttering spray , when the sun salutes it , yet I doubt not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own homes , not only " sadder , " but " wiser " than they went out ; ' that many could say , and say truly , " It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting . " These thoughts were suggested to my mind , by seeing pass beneath my windo*v a funeral train of modern days , consisting of a hearse arid three or four coaches , in which , however , I could discover only gentlemen , and amongst the the clergyman , who , in former days , always led the procession , though the distance were ever so great or the *veather ever so inclement ; and as I compared it with a scene which I witnessed in my childhood , arid of which the recollection is as vivid as the events of the last hour , I endeavored , it being with me an idle moment , at the close of a long and bright summer 's day , to heighten the con'trast still more by describing in writing the image which was impressed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest hues ; but , in order to render my narration fully intelligible , I shall commence my story at a period a little earlier than that of the thunder storm , from which it derives its name . I was born about the year 1763 , in one of the larger seaports of the ' then coiony of Massachusetts . Amongst its inhabitants , there was , at that time , a prevalence of superstition , yet it was a superstition char* acteristic of the descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers of New-England // for it arose not from the want of religion , neither from its debasement , but from an excited state of mind in regard to it . The theology then in vogue in those places that retained much of their primitive character , taught , in the strongest language , the doctrine of the especial providence of the Almighty ; and though each one did not apply it fully to himself , all believed it to the utmost , in the case of their neighbor , particularly if his character were at all questionable , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story ;  --  the town , in which my childish days were spent , was built upon a cape , stretching far into the sea its ironbound coast , which , at times , projected into the waves in high and rugged prominences of rock , and again receded a little , leaving below its cliffs strips of sandy beach , upon which some poor fishermen dried their nets , whilst the smoke from their lowly and desolate-looking huts might be seen curling up against the steep crags ( barren , excepting the few shrubs , the roots of which found a hold in the crevices of their sides , and some stinted evergreens that crowned their summits , ) which shut out the dwellers upon these sands from the sight of aught else save the sky above their heads , and the immense ocean which heaved its broad bosom beneath the glowing heat of summer , or curled its foaming waves in wintry storms full before them . Here and there , at distant intervals , an opening between the ridges of rock afforded glimpses of some green and sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those stern barriers ; and at the head of a capacious bay , and gradually rising as it receded from the water , was seen the thickly.settled , though not then large town , which was the place of my birth . Of my family , it is not necessary for me to speak particularly ; it is sufficient for me  --  to mention my father , as the remembrance of him is closely inter*voven with the recollection of the thunder storm . He was my idol ; and though my eyes are dim , and my hand is tremulous with age , yet , as I write the much-loved name , I feel my pulses throb as they were wont to do , when I ran with all the eagerness of childish joy to welcome his return from a distant port-for he was the master of a vessel , which sailed constantly between the colony and the mother country . During the intervals that occurred between my father 's voyages , he often amused himself and delighted me , by taking me to walk upon the beaches , and amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pebbles ; and when , in these rambles , which were sometimes pretty long , 1 became wearied , he would stop with me at one of the scattered huts , where we were not unfrequently regaled with the simple but savory food drawn from the sea , and , at the same time , entertained by some of the wild and superstitious legends so abundant amongst the inhabitants of solitary places . But there was one hut ,  --  and well do I remember it , for even to my childish eye there was something unusually gloomy and forbidding in its appearance ,  --  which we never entered ; and when my father inquired , as he sometimes did , of those we met in our walks , after the welfare of the occupant of it , whom he spoke of as Stephen Pilsbury , a deep sigh , and a mysterious shake of the head always accompanied the answer he received , that he could not be long for this world . // I have sometimes seen from a distance , the form of the old man as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood entirely alone at the foot of a high and wholly naked rock that sheltered it on the north , but left it exposed to the burning rays of the sun , and to the full force of the storms from the ocean . The strip of beach upon which it stood , was so narrow that the hut seemed in the most imminent danger of being washed away by the tides ; nor was there any sign of vegetation near it , save the sea-weed which clung to the low black rocks at the water 's edge . Even from the view which I had of him , as he sat with his face buried in his hands , he appeared to me to be possessed of a frame much larger than that of other men whom I met , and , clothed as he was in the dark and rude habiliments usually worn by fishermen , he seemed like some aged and wasted trunk , from which the storms of heaven had stripped its leaves and branches . Once , I remember , as I was gazing upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I afterwards learned was his daughter , came from the house and appeared to address him ; he merely answered her by a slight wave of his hand , and without raising his head , and she instantly left him . At length , news reached the town that Stephen Pilsbury was dead , and was to be buried on the ensuing day . It was the middle of July , and the weather excessively hot ; the sun shone brightly through that long morning , and not a speck appeared to obscure the brilliancy of the sky ; but at noon , and just as the solemn bell tolled to announce the time for assembling at the funeral , white clouds were seen rolling up their fantastic forms in the western horizon , and occasional mutterings of thunder were heard in the same direction . All presaged a thunder storm , though not , perhaps , till after the lapse of several hours . I recollect , however , hearing my father observe , that , on account of the appearance of the sky , he should not fi*lfil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company with some old sea-captains , who , as being of the same age and profession as the deceased , had kindly offered to his daughter to officiate in the capacity of pall-bearers. 1f lie hours rolled on , and again the funeral knell was heard , mingling its note of solemn warning with the distant voice of the thunder , and the hoarse murmuring of the waves , as they dashed in sullen and seemingly constrained fury upon the beach . Yet , notwithstanding the threatening aspect of the weather , a large concourse of the hardy inhabitants of the coast were collected around the lowly dwelling : this was situated at the distance of about a mile from my father 's house , which was upon the principal street of the town ; beyond my father 's , in the opposite direction , at the distance of half a mile , stood the meeting-house , adjoining which , was the place set apart for interment . The sacred volume had been opened , and the selected portion of it read and commented upon ; the Pastor , a descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervent prayer ,  --  not for the soul of the departed , for that , he believed , beyond the influence of human intercession ,  --  but for the living , that they might repent ere yet too late the rough voices of the multitude had arisen in the dirge-like chant // of a funeral hymn ; and the procession , which , with the solitary exception of the mourning daughter , consisted entirely of men , arranged itself for the long walk . The bearers , preceded by the clergyman , and followed by a line of attendants , passed on their way the clouds seemed , at the same time , to be rapidly mustering their forces , and the thunder , accompanied by occasional flashes of lightning , and a few heavy drops , falling at intervals , came gradually nearer , till , by the tine the ibneral entered the streets of the town , the uproar of the elements was terrific , whilst the sublimity of the scene was heightened by the deep and sepulchral tone of the bell , which , as it was heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roaring of the waves , as they dashed themselves in now unbridled rage against the rocks , seemed to be tolling the knell of a ( leparting world . The mourners , as if too intent upon the performance o their melancholy office , and in too close communion with their own thoughts to heed the commotion , still passed on , and the storm still increased , till the pealing of the thunder was incessant , and the atmosphere seemed one blaze of livid flame . at the window , leaning a*ai I was standing * , nst ray father , whose arm encircled me too much engrossed by the scene without , to think of any personal danger , when , as the procession caine directly in front of the house , a flash of lightning , bright as if the universe had burst into conflagration , was accompanied by a crash of thunder , which seemed to make the earth itself tremble to its foundations . For a moment I was blinded* but , on recovering my sight , I looked from the window , and upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if actuated by one impulse , had simultaneously removed from their shoulders , and by it stood the venerable forms of the aged attendants , with heads uncovered , and bowed to the peltings of the pitiless blast that wildly tossed their white locks . The bell ceased its clang ; all stood mute , as if conscious of the presence of the Almighty in his wrath . My father , observing the daughter of the deceased to be sinking beneath a shock too great for her to support , rushed forth into the storm , and brought her into his house . Flash followed flash of blinding lightning ; peal succeeded peal of crashing thunder ; and in a few minutes flames were seen arising in no less than five different parts of the town , whilst , still , the group before us was motionless , and 1 , transfixed with horror , stood gazing at the scene , unable to move . At length , after one concussion , more violent than any that had preceded it , the storm seemed to abate . The aged men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still inhabitants of this terrestrial sphere ; the bearers , slowly , and as if with exhausted strength , resumed their burden ; the bell again gave forth its hollow note , and the dark train moved slowly from sight . When the procession returned from the grave , the sun shone as brightly as if rio cloud had ever dimmed its lustre ; the storm seemed to have wholly spent itself , and was followed by a perfect calm . The clergyman , of whom I have spoken as a descendant of the leader of that small but chosen band of the faithful , who forsook all // earthly pleasures for the sake of worshipin* their Maker in purity of heart and life , amidst the wilds of America , was a genuine disciple of his ever-blessed Master ; like him he truly went about doing good , and having learned that the bereaved relative of the deceased was at my father 's , he came immediately thither he was cordially welcomed by both my parents , for he was not only the revered pastor and beloved friend , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolent countenance and manners of the holy man were such as to en ( lear him greatly to the young , I always delighted in being present during his visits ; and upon this occasion 1 hastened after him to the room whither the afflicted daughter had been conveyed , and from his conversation with her , besides much useful instruction , I gathered the following particulars of her father 's history . Stephen Pilsbury had been formerly an inhabitant of the city of London , and master of a vessel employed in tiansporting supl ) Iies from En*land to her colonies ; upon his return from one of these voyages , he found that the ravages of a pestilential disease had reached his hitherto happy home , and swept off all the members of his family , excepting his wife and his daughter Isabella . As the epidemic still prevailed , he determined to snatch , if possible , these sole remaining objects of his strong affections from its power ; with this design , he collected all his property , which was very considerable , and , having placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and dai*ghter , for Boston . The passage was long but not unpleasant , and our emigrants flattered themselves with the hope of 500fl arriving at their destined port but , when within sight of land , there arose a sudden and violent storm , accoml ) anied by a strong gale from the east , which drove them directly towards the shore . In vain was all the nautical skill of the whole ship 's company exerted to avert the danger of shipwreck ; they were in the night dashed upon a sunken ledge , and the ship was entirely lost . Some of the crew , together with the master and his daughter , saved themselves by clinging to the wreck , whence they were taken the next day by a coasting vessel ; but Mrs. Pilsbury , from want of strength , and from the dismay with which she was seized , was unable to make use of the necessary precautions for her preservation , and was overwhelmed by the *vaves . Youth arid a good constitution enabled the daughter to recover from the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting as his life . The intense anxiety he had suffered during impending danger , and the final destruction of all his hopes , added to many successive hours of exposure to the inclemency of an equinoctial gale , produced a violent brain fever ; and when he at length regained a consciousness of what was passing around him , and learned that she whom he so fondly loved slept beneath the cold waves , his sorrow knew no bounds . Gradually his strength was restored ; but the gloom of his spirits took a still deeper and deeper hue , till it was evident to all , that , though not actually deranged , the equilibrium of his mind was entirely , and probably forever destroyed his only I ) leasure , if that could be called pleasure that brought so much pain , was to walk upon the narrow // strip of beach before mentioned , and gaze towards that spot whence vanished all his dreams of earthly happiness . The agent of the company in whose service he had been for many years , sought Pilsbury out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he endeavored , by every method , to induce the unfortunate man to engage again in business ; but finding all his efforts fruitless , he collected the sum of a few hundred pounds , and placed it at his disposal . A part of this money Pilsbury immediately appropriated to the purchase of the hut of which I have spoken , and thither he retired with his daughter , who , though still youthful , and possessing the remains of beauty , blighted more by sorrow than time , gave up all the pleasures of society and every other enjoyment congenial to her years and habits , to watch over , and soothe the sorrows of that parent who was her only tie to earth . The inhabitants of their more immediate neighborhood at first sought the acquaintance of the father and daughter ; but their total ignorance of the various forms assumed by diseases of the mind , prevented them from rightly understanding Pilsbury 's mental state , and to them he appeared to be one upon whom heaven had , for some unknown crime , set a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still the harmlessness of his life and his evident sufferings , excited in them a degree of compassion , which led them to show all the kindness in their power both to him and to his daughter , of whom all acknowledged the worth . Such was the sad story of Stephen Pilsbury . I shall close my tale by stating that his daughter , for whose fate I hope my readers feel some interest , was invited to take up her residence in my father 's house , where she remained a beloved and honored guest , till , ripe in years and usefulness , she fell asleep in death , and was laid in the spot of her own choice by the side of her father . M. W. D.@@183068632.txt We have been somewhat disappointed in reading this work . Its author is avowedly the original of that amusing character drawn so vididly by Galt the novelist , under the name of " Lawrie Todd . " It is a pity that Mr. Thorburn had not been contented with his portrait , embellished as it was by that skillful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exceeding honesty " was put to the blush when he saw himself in that flattering mirror , and he has thought it expedient to // appear before the public in a costume of his own homely manufactureaccompanied by a certificate of its genuineness , and a damnatory objurgation to all " book critics " With this admonition before our eyes , we have not the hardihood to examine the book as to its literary merits ; and shall merely attempt to give a brief analysis of its contents . It may be considered as composed of FIVE grand divisions First , an address " to the Public , " in which the author states sundry reasons that moved him to publish his life-one of which is- " so many scraps and mutilated extracts of my history have appeared in GaIt 's " Lawrie Todd , " in magazines , tracts , reviews , and newspapers , in Europe and America , that I think 1 owe it to myself to state the simple truth , "  --  and hereunto also is appended a declaration that " this first edition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only genuine copy ever published . " Secondly , the Preface , containing an amplification of the reasons for the author 's publishing an autobiography ; and containing moreover the aforementioned bull against " book critics , " illustrated and enforced by the story of . a conversation with Thomas Paine . Thirdly , the Life and Times of Grant Thorburn , divided into four chapters . J7ourthly , the " Appendix , consisting of Scenes in the Life of Grant Thorburn . " This is the longest of the five great divisions , and larger than all the others combined-comprising one hundred and sixty pages out of two hundred and sixty-four . And F*fthly and lastly , we have the " Advertisement , " which seems to have been originally a part of the Preface , or of the address to the reader with which the book opens . As specimens of the composition of this work , and the homely modesty of its author , we subjoin an extract , taken from a portion entitled " A Week in Boston* " About seven , P. M. we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , three years ago , I received many invitations from ladies and gentlemen from Boston , who had called to look at our store . I discovered by the way that I had left most of my cards behind ; reflecting on the circumstance , thinks I , should I pass the door of any of them good folks , they will think , either that I am destitute ofcommon civility , or wanting in truth , so I inserted the following in the Boston Transcript " NOTICE . Through the progress of the two years just gone by , I received many pressing invitations-bea t*ful cards  --  and made many fair promises to call on Mr. and Mrs. So-and-So , first time I was in Boston ; unhappily , however , in the notes of preparation , I came off forgeting most of my cards and part of my wits in Ne*v-York ; not wishing to be thought guilty of a breach of promise , or wanting in the common civilities of life , 1 wish only to inform my good friends aforesaid , if they will leave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will endeavor to redeem my pledge . " If spared I intend relnaining about a week . " I had another reason for publishing this notice ; I knew that among some of the fasllionable folks , they think they are obliged to practise a great deal of hypocrisy . I remember many years ago of carrying a hilt to a fashionable lady in Broadway , New-York ; she and another lady were just coining to the door-the former asked me to step in the parlor ; she was warm in her thanks to her neighbor for calling and seemed earnest in her invitations for her to call again soon . As I had never seen any thing of fashionable life , you may think I was almost confounded , when after shutting the front door with a loud slam , she returned into the parlor , and without paying any attention to me , began to harangue to her daughter most vehemently ; she wished that " hateful woman would never enter her door again , that she always gave her the headache , as her tongue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " &amp;c. &amp;c . Thinks I to myself , this is another way of doin business . She paid my bill , however , that was my business ; thef other affair was her own . So I thought about my cards ; it may be that some o those fine lad:es whose cards are so smooth and brightly polished , after all would rather see the grave-digger coming in the house than to see me : so thinks I , this notice will put all to rights ; them that are sincere will send their cards , and on them I will call ; them that are not sincere ill see the advertisement , and so take the will for the deed . * * * * * * * * * * * * * But to return to Boston and the cards . The day after my advertisement appeared , the se*ond edition of cards came pouring in like hail from a thunder-cloud in the month of July . Punctual to the hour , I ascended the steps of the princely mansion of the handsome Mrs. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of the parlor opened , the blaze of lights , dress , youth , and beauty , was something more than my senses were prepared to receive . *Be not forgetful to entertain strangers , for some liave thereby entertained angels unawares , " was the first idea that struck my mind- The lady of the manor on wlnch I now stood , once entered my store ; she was to me a stranger ; I entertained her , riot knowing I was entertaining one , in many respects , so far superior to what we usually meet in the ordinary walks of life . My thoughts on this occasion may have taken a wrong flight , ( as they have done many a time , both before and since , ) but I merely state what they were . It was the first time I had met an assembly where the sights were so imposing : the amusements of the evening commenced with what they call handing round tea , ( a thing I had never seen performed in Scotland ; ) first came a servant with tea-cup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there came cake , rusk , tongue and sweetmeats : here I was brought to a dead stand-my hands were full-I could neither eat nor drink . Says I , Madam , this tea drinking concern of yours , reminds me of the man who was going to bury his wife , in Scotland . They had three miles to walk , and were going pretty fast : Not so fast , friends , says the husband-do n't let us make a toil of a picasure . Now , says I , Madam , your tea concern is all very good , but the way in which you manage the business , makes a real toil of a pleasure-at least , to me . The lady took the hint , and very politely placed before me a small stand , when I got along very comfortably . Among the many fine eatables placed on the board , or paraded round the room , an article came in , in size and appearance resembling a seven pound ham , very neatly roasted . In answer to my question , the queen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never having seen a roasted yarn , and never having tasted a yam in usy life , my curiosity was awake . In a few minutes the heart of the yam was nicely scooped omtt , with a silver spoon , placed on pretty little china plates , neatly compounded with the sweetest of butter and essence of spice . According to order , it was handed first to the ladies ; all were loud in praise of the yam : then to the gentlemen ; nothing was heard but the delicious yam  --  the famous St. Doiningo yam . ( I thought of the man with the long nose , riding through the town of Straatsburgh . ) I took one tea-spoon full of the yarn , then another ; thinks I to myself , were it not for the sweet butter and odoriferous spice , the heart of a corn-stalk would taste better . The lady of the feast asked how I liked the yam says I , Madam , it reminds me of the story of a young countryman , whose grandmother died and left him . fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people were carried from street to s'treet in sedan chairs , he applied to the porters for a ride . They seem he was a fiat , one of the porters winked to his mate , who drew out the bottomnof the chair , on the one side , just as his fellow opened the door to let the young man step in on the other side : when he stepped in , the door was shut , and the young man stood on the pavement . Away they go , through mud and through mire , a*w ays crossing where the mud was deepest . At length they stopped in front of the hotel where he lodged ; being let out , and his fare paid , Well , says the carriers , how did you like your ride ? 0 , says he , It was very good , but , were it not for the name of the thing , a body might just as well walk . Now , Madam , says I , were it not for the name of the thing , a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the laugh which followed , done the mistress and her guests more good , than all they derived by eating the yam . By and by the music and the dance went round ; a lively widow , of forty , asked if I would waltz with her ; I told her if she would show me howit was done , and I liked it , I would try . She jumped up and threw her arm round the slender waist of a tall girl ; away they flew to the sound of the tamborine : // when done , she sat down by me on the sofa . Well , says she , how do you like it ? Says I , Madam , I think it s corning to rather too close quarters . I never , till that hour , knew exactly what waltzing was ; and I must say , 1 tremble for the sons and fathers of th next generation , if we are to go on in imitation of those vile European customs . I asked her if the lads took hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they did ; then says I , the lasses are the more fools to let them . We are not particularly pleased with Mr. rhorbun ' notions about " the doctrine of a particular Providence . " It savors a little too much of the Pharisee . There Is no harm in a man 's supposing that he is a peculiar favorite of his Maker-provided his belief is indulged only for the purpose of enlivening his own faith , humbling his own pride , and exciting his own feelings to acts of Diety and devotion ; but when he claims to be one of the choseu race , and attempts to illustrate and prove his claim by a series of incidents , which , if they prove nothing else , certainly manifest the possession of a good share of worldly wisdom-that " godliness , which hath the promise of the life that now is " - we apprehend that he has , with all his apparent humility , a little touch of vanity . Very few readers , probably , would have thought of attributing Mr. Thorburn 's success in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , if he had not credited all his good luck , and the result of his shrewd speculations to that cause . We would not be understood as denying the truth of the general proposition of the greatest moral *philosopher that ever lived- " rl " ' are is a special Providence in the fall of a sparrow "  --  and which is substantially the declaration of Him who spake as never man spake  --  but it is impossible to read this book , without imbibing an idea that its author is at least willing that men should know how often he fasts , how often he prays , and how fervently he thanks God that the purchase of the Quaker Meeting-House turned out to be a good speculation . There are a good many anecdotes in this book , interesting in themselves ; and others , which derive their attraction from the author 's quaint manner of telling them . Some of the incidents connected with the early part of his residence in New-York are affecting , and are related in a stile of simplicity which touches the feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mr. Thorburn tells us of his services in the time of the prevalence of the yellow fever in New-York . To him , doubtless , it was a particular Providence that preserved his life , while his neighbors were falling around him , like grass beneath the arm of the mower ; but were not the victims of the destroyer 's scythe equally the objects of the particular care of Him , without whose knowledge not a sparrow falleth to the ground ? Let another man praise thee , and not thinc own mouth  --  a StrW ? 6 er , and not thine own lins . There are some things in the volume , which one would hardly expect to meet here-such as the speech of Black Hawk , and some of the newspaper articles on Liverwort . And there are some others , such as the description of the meeting-house and the first religious service which the author attended in Boston , that would have taken nothing from his reputation if they had been omitted . There is a disposition to sneer at every thing connected with religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions and prejudices of the author , which is discreditable to him , and offensive to good taste and good manners . // With a good deal of ' sensible observation , there are mingled so many poor and abortive attempts at wit , that the book , if it aimed at the elevation of character , must be considered as an entire failure.
