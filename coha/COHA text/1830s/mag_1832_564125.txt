txt Is it possible that no one in these parts has seen a Gopher ? I have seen a thousand ; and some other animals , too , that are not to be found in New-England ; not even in Greenwood 's Museum . I can not bring them to you , reader , and , therefore , I must e'en carry you , in imagination , to them . Suppose yourself mounted on a good horse , and riding at my side , somewhere between the Mississippi and the Missouri , in about forty-four degrees , with a good rifle in your hand . " T is but Fancy 's sketch . " Let us ascend that hillock and look abroad upon the prairie . Did you think there was so much beef in the world ? The land is alive with the creatures that naturalists call Bisons , but which we hunters call Buffaloes . There are , at least , twenty thousand in that . herd . Hark , what a thundering noise they make ! They do not bellZ* so in other seasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull approaching . We have disturbed him , and he comes to reconnoitre . Fear not , he will not attack us ; at any other time he would have made his escape at once . His beard might shame a Janizary ; his head would be a treasure to a periwig-maker ; the hair is so thick that you see no part of his physiognomy but his nose , his eyes , and the tips of his short , strong , black horns . Satan could not look more savage . Your horse trembles , and so should I , if I did not know the nature of the beast . Give him a shot . . Ah , blockhead ! // you have hit him between the eyes ,  --  you might as well have fired at the Rock of Gibraltar . Ride , for your life ! Now he has gotten my bullet behind the shoulder , he is running in his turn . He falls . He is not more than a mile off . I will show you how to butcher a Buffalo . His flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his marrow bones are delicious . See , the ball has gone through the very centre of his heart . It is not singular that he has run so far so badly hurt . I have seen many such cases . St. Maurice , who is the fellest buffalo-runner in the country , says he once saw a bull arise and walk after he had cut out the tongue and taken off the skin . But St. Maurice is noted for his dexterity at the long bow . If this was a cow , now , I would take away the hump , and convinca you that Mr. Godman is wrong in saying it tastes like marrow . We must leave the carcass to the wolves , who , you see , have been roused by the well-known sound of our guns , and are trooping hitherward from all points of the compass . It was really a pity to slay this noble animal in mere wantonness . It is an awful waste of meat . You can not lift even his head , or his skin . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scars , that he was an old , peevish , quarrelsome , unhappy tyrant , and I begin to think it was charity to put him out of his misery . Now mount your horse and let us ride to yonder little wood ; island , we call it , and let us dress our dinner . Take care of that snake ! Hold ! do not kili it . It looks like a rattlesnake , to be sure . It is of the same size , figure and complexion , and it makes just such a noise as its dangerous relative does . For all that , a hare is not more harmless . It is known by several names . You may call it pine snake , prairie snake , or bull snake , as you please . Some say it is excellent eating . I know that rattlesnakes are . But what is the matter with the Buffaloes ? They are fleeing en masse . You can see that the females run almost as fast as deer . I have it now ; a Grizzly Bear has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antelope . Sauve qui peut ! You must put your horse to full speed , I can tell you . Pray Heaven , he does not compel us to use our guns . If he does , something like a miracle only can save us . Stop ; he does not mind us ; he follows the Buffaloes . The fellow is hungry . Now he overtakes the hindmost bull . Alas , poor Bison ! See how the bloody Herod strikes him down with one blow of his paw , and tears away three of his ribs at the same stroke . No wonder ; his claws are five inches long , at least . It is all over with the Bison now . The bear has feasted his fill , and is making off . Now the danger is over , I will tell you that it was not small . It is a good horse that outruns a Grizzly Bear , and the beast is as cruel as he is strong and swift . He ftllbws the track of a man like a dog . No danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . He braves fire ; which no other wild beast does . A ball must scatter his brains to quiet him at once , and his face is so sharp that it is very difficult to hit . Besides , his forehead is covered with a muscle so strong and thick , that three balls out of four will glance from it . So tenacious of life is he , that half a dozen shots in a body , often fail to bring him down , or to mitigate his ferocity . That gray animal , looking out of his hole , is a Badger . You perceive that he has a white stripe running from his head half way down // his back , and two more on the sides of his head , which give him a droll expression of countenance . He is incredibly strong and hardy . I have seen a strong man sieze a Badger by the brush as he was getting into his hole , and the creature broke from him , in spite of all his efforts , and escaped . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . The animal is perfectly harmless , excepting that he makes great holes in the prairie , in which horses sometimes break their legs , and throw their riders . His skin makes a very enduring upper leather for a shoe . His flesh , too , is eatable , when no better can be had . As for those rascally Prairie Wolves that you see in such numbers , it is " beneath the dignity of man , " as Colonel Bath would say , to mention them , they are so cowardly . I believe the Prairie Wolf is the only animal , with teeth and claws , that will not fight in defence of its young . They make their nests in the bare plain . I once robbed one of three cubs , before the eyes of the dam , and all she dared do for their protection was to howl . Nevertheless , when compelled , the Prairie Wolf fights desperately , and dies without a whimper . The larger wolf is quite a different animal . When pressed by hunger , he will even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travers , that we attempted to harness with the dogs . The only way we could *et the collar on was by holding his neck to the ground between the prongs of a pitch-fork , and when we had harnessed him , he was so troublesome that we were obliged to kill him . The color of this species is usually gray , but hlack and white wolves are not uncommon . The black ones are thought to be the most powerful and ferocious . Yonder goes a Cougar , vulgarly called a Catamount , a Panther , or , worse yet , a Painter . This animal is not often seen so far north . You already know the Cougar by report , and have , perhaps , even seen him in some menagerie . A lady of my acquaintance , who resides in the outskirts of one of our western cities , got a terrible fright from a Cougar about five years ago . She slept in an apartment on the ground floor , the window of whi4*h opened upon a garden . One night , as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing at the window , and was immediately aware of a pair of optics , glowing like Lehigh coals in perfect combustion . Whether the visiter to whom they belonged was brought to the glass by hunger , curiosity , or a softer passion , ( the lady is very handsome , ) she never knew , but at any rate , she had no inclination to be wooed " as the lion wooes his bride . " She kept down the woman within her , put on her thimble , and rapped smartly against the glass in immediate contact with the beast 's nose . The noise bothered him entirely , and he fled ; but the lady did not sleep in that room that night . In the morning the tracks of a large Cougar were found in the garden , and it was apparent that he had reared up to look into the window , for he had left the marks of his dirty fore-paws on the sill . In the course of the day the mangled body of a colt was found on the farm , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no favorable opinion of a place whose hospitality could only afford him horse-flesh . What you see , there , in the extreme verge of the horizon , is not a forest . Birnam wood is not coming to Dunsinnane . It is a herd of Wawashkeeko , or , to use a word you will understand , of Elks . Now they are nigher you can see that there are upwards of five hundred . // What beauty ! What stateliness ! This is not the common stag of Europe , as English writers falsely assert . They are ever willing to deny our soil the property of any thing perfect ; but Europe has no such animal as this . What horns ! How they run ! A good horse can overtake them , however . When mounted hunters surround a drove of Elks , the animals become perfectly stupified after a few shots . Instead of escaping by speed of foot , as most of them easily might do , they run round and round , till they are all destroyed . We have now come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs through it . I surmised as much while we yet far off , for wherever an island of wood is seen in the prairie , you are pretty sure to find water . That large tree has not been marked by the axe , but by a Beaver 's tooth . You see that it looks as if a squaw had been chopping it-all round . You have probably a very high opinion of the Beaver 's character for intelligence , but let me tell you , it is ill founded . Instinct , in high perfection , is all the creature can boast of . He can not adapt himself to circumstances , like the dog and many other animals . Take him away from his brook or his puddle , and he is the most stupid beast that lives . All you can teach him is , not to bite . I have seen several domesticated , and not one of them evinced the least spark of mother wit . The most that any of them could do was to waddle about , and utter a very disagreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master , but the beaver can not . That animal on yonder tree , with the catlike visage , is a Loup .. Gervier , or American Lynx . You are too late for a shot-he is gone already . Excepting that he is much bigger than the short-tailed Wild Cat of the United States , there is little difference between them . His fur is worth something , and though he belongs to the carnivora , his flesh is not unworthy the attention of the epicure . The Lynx is a cunning beast . I was once following one , when my dog was at fault at the root of a large inclined tree . I soon found that the animal had run to the extremity of the upper branch , and had thence leaped as far as he was able ; undoubtedly with a view to baffle the dog 's nose . The trick did not save him , however . Look into the near edge of the prairie a moment , and you will see a great many little animals , like squirrels , running about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill one of each . This beautiful little fellow is here called the Prairie Squirrel . Captain Franklin calls him Hood 's Marmot . He is about the size of th' squirrel we call the Chipmunk , and , like him and the Americ*n Flag , has thirteen stripes on his back . They are alternately white and brown , and the black ones are dotted with white spots from one end to the other . Though the legs of this elegant little beast be short , he runs very welL He lives chiefly under ground and his food is wholly vegetable . Thes&amp; Marmots are exceedingly numerous , and do much mischief in gardens . This other , clumsy , ugly brute , is likewise a mepsber of the Marmota family . He has nothing to recommend him , that I know of , excepting that he does not often make his ugliness intrusive , and does no harm . He is of a dirty gray , and is not much unliken rat in size and general appearance . As he can not run , like Hood 's Marmot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Hark , to that whistle ! We are lost ! That was an Indian signal . But no ; it is repeated , and I now perceive that we are near a village inhabited by dogs . You need not look so surprised . I do not mean Indian dogs , but Prairie Dogs . Come round this point of wood . Now you see them and they see you , too , for they are scolding like Billingsgate . They do not like to be disturbed . Would not one believe , on seeing them for the first time , that that group of little mounds were huts , and that the little pert rascals who sit upright beside them were , bona fide , pigmies . See with what an impudent air they brandish their tails at us ; and hark ! how they bid us defiance . Like other boasters , they do not expect that their challenge will be accepted . They think vaporing will serve their turn . Do not fire at them . Let their vivacity and innocence be their protection . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full as nigh them as they will allow us to come . They have all slunk into their burrows . Some thousands of them probably reside here , for you may observe that the mounds cover three or four acres , and each hole contains a large family . Now they have got over their first panic , they begin to peep out again , to see if the danger is over . You see that these dwellings are in the form of truncated cones , and that each has its door in the side . They serve two purposes , . - as dwellings , and as watch towers , from which the inmates may overlook the grass , and see if any wolf or fox is coming . To enable them to descry approaching danger the better , they always , as here , build their villages on a barren spot , where there are no rocks , hills , or rank herb .. age to obstruct the prospect . You need never think to get at them by digging , for their habitations are joined by subterranean galleries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear no enemies but rattlesnakes , weasels , burrowing owls and the like . Here is a rattlesnake , just about to enter the village . Take that , you reptile . Ye may now thank your supposed foe , ye little dwellers in darkness , for saving many of your lives . You think it strange , perhaps , that the rattlesnake , who *wallows his prey whole , should attack an animal a foot and a half long , but it is as true as strange . The reptile can actually gorge creatures bigger than itself . See this rascally Owl . He has been following the example of some men I could mention ; taking possession of the dwelling of one more industrious , and of a better character than himself . And he has not even the grace to keep the house in which he has so iniquitously installed himself in good order . Observe , that his mound is polluted with putrefactions , and crumbling about his ears , while those of the marmots are neat and in perfect repair . If you ask me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I answer , they go without . Yea ; and they do not suffer . In November , each rolls himself into a ball , and sleeps till March . There goes a Hare ; not one of the pitiful abortions which are called hares in New-England , but an animal weighing ten or twelve pounds . How he runs ! No dog that was ever in the prairies could catch him . This hare is gray now , but next winter , he will be pure white , not distinguishable from the snow . That Deer we will not notice ; you have probably seen a buck before ; but yonder are a pair of Antelopes . Lie down , , and I will bring them nigh enough to be observed minutely . It is only lifting up my // leg and shaking it , for no creature has a greater share of curiosity than this most timid of all animals . Any thing uncommon draws them . Now they are nigh enough for you to see that an Antelope is about as big as a common goat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also perceive that it has a single antler on each horn . Now rise , if you wish to see the utmost speed four legs can exert . Flying Childers never ran so fast as they do . I once knew a pointer to catch a female Antelope , but she stopped now , and then , to give her kid time to keep up with her . As the matter was , the Indians thought the dog must have been a special favorite of the Great Spirit . Take your rifle , and fire a shot at that Crane , who has just so foolishly put himself within reach . Well done , my marksman ! You have broken his wing . Have a care . Do not go nigh him rashly . That long pointed beak is little less dangerous than Cockahockaknocknawaga 's war club . I once knew an Indian receive a mortal wound through the diaphragma from a crane . I know another who has been deprived of an eye by such an enemy . Take this stick ; and , now that you have broken his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest of all possible Mice , who yet has no trifling resemblance to an elephant . He has a proboscis as long , in proportion , as an ant bear 's , and , what is strange , it is flexible . He sways it with as much facility as I do my arm . I do not think that this little animal is at all common . This is but the third of the species , I have seen , and it is not mentioned by any naturalist . It seems , judging from the seventh number of the New-England Magazine , that neither you nor any other Yankee , nor even Mr. Flint , has ever seen a Gopher . There are the hills raised by the Gopher , in every direction , and I will presently show you the animal , if you will be still and speak in a whisper , for the least noise alarms it . Do you see the earth moving , and a little hillock rising just there . Now the Gopher puts forth its head . Shoot it , say you * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know a trick worth two of that . I will shoot just under the vermin , and throw it , with the earth it has raised , a rod from its hole . Before it can get back we can catch it , for your Gopher is but a sorry pedestrian , above ground , however expert it may be in digging . There , it is done , and we have*him . He is about half as big as a common rat , and of a grayish blue color . Like other moles , his limbs are admirably adapted to making subterranean progress . He has short legs , a sharp head , and a tail so short and bare as to give little advantage to the enemy who attacks him in rear . The most singular part of his structure are these pouches in his cheeks , like those of some squirrels . He does not use these to convey away the dirt he loosens , as Mr. Schoolcraft , and other naturalists , on his authority , have erroneously asserted . You have seen him raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time . He wrought underground , and you could not see exactly how he did it , but you could see that his pouches had no agency in the matter . Had these little sacks been the organs of conveyance , he would have been a month about it . He uses them to put his surplus food in , after the fashion of other pouched animals . I once caught a Gopher alive , and put him into a box half filled with earth , and witnessed the whole process of his mining . He dug with his feet , as other moles do ; his pouches had nothing to do with the // work . I have seen a thousand Gophers , and never found a particle of earth in these receptacles . If you will not take my authority respecting this vastly important point in natural history , go and catch another Gopher , and the evidence of your own eyes will satisfy you . Like other plunderers , Gophers do most of their work in the night . They are very injurious to gardens . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , the gardener sees them standing as fresh as ever , but when the sun rises they wilt and die . When I lived at the Gophers were so mischievous , that owners of gardens were obliged to offer a small premium : for their heads , and thousands were destroyed in consequence . Whether the Gopher is carnivorous or frugivorous does not appear . Common opinion inclines to the latter supposition . But as the common mole has been proved to be carnivorous , and as he only removes the roots of plants to get at earth worms , &amp;c. it is probable that the Gopher resembles , him in his manner of feeding , as well as in all the rest of his habits . There is another Gopher at work , and I will treat him as I treated the first . No ; it is not a Gopher . It is a Mole that is by no means common , and which Godman and Say know nothing of . It is of the same size as the Gopher , and its color is grass green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . No velvet , no silk , should be named in the same day . Go thy ways , Green Mole ; I would not pick a hole in a coat like thine for a beaver-skin . Go not near that stump . That reptile asleep on it is a copperhead ; the most venomous , the most hideous , the most depraved , the most detestable of all God 's creatures . Now he wakes . He gathers himself sluggishly into his coil , which he intends shall be amortal coil for one oC us . He , has not half the generosity of the rattlesnake , for he gives no warning before he strikes ; nor half the courage , for he will not maintain his ground , if he can leave it . See how his head flattens ! how his skin becomes darker ! Kill him , lest he bite some other . Now we are speaking of snakes , I will tell you a strange story , and you may belieVe * or not , as you please . I was at the portage between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slept at the house of Hypolite Grignon , a Winnebago half-breed and a trader . Speaking of snakes , he told me that he had once seen a flying serpent , five feet long , whose wings resembled the wings of a bat . This anomaly in the order of nature attacked him on the wing , and he killed it . Being little curious in such matters , as few Indian traders are , he left the animal to decay where it fell . Though I thought Grignon lied , I did not tell him so , but I dismissed the matter from my mind , and should probably never have thought of it again , but for a singular corroboration of the story . Six years after this , I became acquainted with another trader , by name De Reinville , who lived six hundred miles from Grignon . They had never seen or held any communication with each other , as fie Reinville said , and both were men of good character . Speaking again of natural history , De Reinville , without any previous mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also had killed a flying serpent , which he described precisely as the other had done . The two stories were identical in every particular . // We have ridden , reader , on airy horses , into the prairies , and have shown you every thing I know about " our rare beasts " that I do not remember to have seen in print . We will , now if you please , go back to Boston , by the same speedy conveyance , and deposite our notes in the counting-room which pertaineth to the New-England Magazine.
