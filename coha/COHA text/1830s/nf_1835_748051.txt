txt pected , therefore , from this period , that they stood in an important relation to each other . After much reflection , he conceived , that if Memory for words was indicated by an external sign , the same might be the case with the other intellectual powers ; and , from that moment , all individuals distinguished by any remarkable faculty became the objects of his attention . By degrees , he conceived himself to have found external characteristics , which indicated a decided disposition for Painting , Music , and the Mechanical Arts . He became acquainted , also , with some individuals remarkable for the determination of their character , and he observed , a particular part of their heads to be Tery largely developed . This fact first suggested to him the ideaof looking to the head for signs of the Moral Sentiments . But in making these observations , he never conceived , for a moment , that the sktdl was the cause of the different talents , as has been erroneously represented ;  - -  he referred the influence , whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by observations , the principle which accident had thus suggested , he for some time eDcountered difficulties of the greatest magnitude . Hitherto he had been altogether ignorant of the opinions of Physiologists , touching the brain , and of Metaphysicians respecting the mental faculties , and had simply observed nature . When , however , he began to enlarge his knowledge of books , he found the most extraordinary conflict of opinions every where prevailing , and this , for the moment , made him hesitate about the correctness of his own observations . He found that the moral sentiments had , by an almost general consent , been consigned to the thoracic and abdominal viscera ; and , that while Pythagoras , Plato , Galen , Haller , and some other Physiologists , placed the sentient soul or intellectual faculties in the brain , Aristotle placed it in the heart . Van Helmont in the stomach , Des Cartes and his followers in the pineal gland , and Drelincourt and others in the cerebellum . He observed also that " a greater number of Philosophers and Physiologists asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the differences observable among them are owing either to education , or to ' the accidental circumstances in which they are placed . /z/ If all differences are accidental , he inferred that there could be no natural signs of predominating faculties , and consequently , that the project of learning , bj observation , to distinguish the functions of the different portions of the brain , must be hopeless . This difficulty he combated , by the reflection that his brothers , sisters , and schoolfellows had all received very nearly the same education , but that he had still observed each of them unfolding a distinct character , over which circumstances appeared to exert only a limited control . He observed also , that not unfrequently they , whose education had been conducted with the greatest care , and on whom the labors of teachers had been most freely lavished , remained far behind their companions in attainments . " Often , " says Dr. Gall , " we were accused of want of will , or deficiency in zeal ; but many of us could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the most obstinate efforts , attain in some pursuits even to mediocrity ; while in some other points , some of us surpassed our schoolfellows without an effort . and almost , it might be said , without perceiving it ourselves . But , in point of fact , our masters did not appear to attach much faith to the system which taught the equality of mental faculties ; for they thought themselves entitled to exact more from one scholar , and less from another . They spoke frequently of natural gifts , or of the gifts of God , and consoled their pupils in the words of the gospel , by assuring them that each would be required to render an account , only in proportion to the gifts which he had received . " * Being convinced , by these facts , that there is a natural and constitutional diversity of talents and dispositions , he encountered , in books , still another obstacle to his success in determining the external signs of the mental powers . He found that , instead of faculties for languages , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding to the different talents which he had observed in his schoolfellows , the metaphysicians spoke only of general powers , such as perception , conception , memory , im- * Preface by Dr. Gall to the " Anatomie , &c.; du Cerveau. " /q/ agination , and judgment ; and when he endeavored to discover external signs in the head , corresponding to these general faculties , or to determine the correctness of the physiological doctrines regarding the seat of the mind , as taught by the authors already mentioned , he found perplexities without end , and difficulties insurmountable . Dr. Gall , therefore , abandoning every theory and preconceived opinion , gave himself up entirely to the observation of nature . Being Physician to a Lunatic Asylum in Vienna , he had opportunities , of which he availed himself , of making observations on the insane . He visited prisons , and resorted to schools : he was introduced to the Courts of Princes , to colleges and the seats of Justice ; and wherever he heard of an individual distinguished in any particular way , either by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of his head . In this manner , by an almost imperceptible induction , he conceived himself warranted in believing that particular mental powers are indicated by particular configurations of the head . Hitherto he had resorted only to Physiognomical indications , as a means of discovering the functions of the brain . On reflection , however , he was convinced that Physiology was imperfect when separated from Anatomy . Having ol-served a woman of fifly-four years of age , who had been afflicted with hydrocephalus from her youth , and who , with a body a little shrunk , possessed a mind as active and intelligent as that of other individuals of her class , Dr. Gall declared his conviction , that the structure of the brain must be different from what was generally conceived ,  --  a remark which Tulpius also had made , on observing a hydrocephalic patient , who manifested the mental faculties . He , ' therefore , felt the necessity of making anatomical researches into the structure of the brain . In every instance , when an individual , whose head he had observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to be permitted to examine the brain , and frequently did so ; and he found , as a general fact , that on removal of the skull , the brain , covered by the dura mater pre- /z/ sented a form corresponding to that which the skull had exhibited in life . The successive steps by which Dr. Gall proceeded in his discoveries , are particularly deserving of attention . He did not , as many have imagined , first dissect the brain , and pretend by that means to have discovered the seats of the mental powers ; neither did he , as others have conceived , first map out the skull into various compartments , and assign a faculty to each , according as his imagination led him to conceive the place appropriate to the power . On the contrary , he first observed a concomitance betwixt particular talents and dispositions , and particular forms of the head : he next ascertained , by removal of the skull , that the figure and size of the brain are indicated by these external forms ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was minutely dissected , and light thrown upon its structure . Dr. Gall was first known as an author by the publication of two chapters of an extensive work , entitled , **28;0;TOOLONG Untersuchungen iiber Natur und Kunst im gesunden und kranken Zustande des Menschen , Wien , 1791 . " The continuation of this work has never appeared ; but , in the first of the two chapters printed , he has evinced the spirit with which his researches into the moral and intellectual nature of man were subsequently conducted . The first written notice of his inquiries concerning the head appeared in a familiar letter to Baron Retzer , which was inserted in the German periodica journal " Deutschen , M ercur , ' *in December , 1798 . In this letter he announces the publication of a work upon his views concerning the brain ; but circumstances induced him to alter his intention . In reading it , one will be surprised to find contained in so few pages , written so long ago , all the principles of the physiology of the brain . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researches ; to wit , a knowledge of the brain , in relation to the fundamental qualities of man , illustrated by that of the instincts and propensities of animals in connection with their cerebral organization . The reader will perceive in it all the useful applications which he proposed to make of his new doctrines to medicine , /q/ to morals , to legislation , to every thing , in a word , which relates to the physical , ipaoral , and intellectual nature of man . This paper is a valuable document for the history of the science , and should convince every one that to Gall alone , belongs the glory of having discovered the true physiology of the brain. * Letter from Dr. F , J , Gall , to Joseph Fr . De Retzer , upon the Functions of the Brain , in Man and Animals.f I have at last the pleasure , my dear Retzer , of presenting you a sketch of my Treatise upon the Functions of the Brain ; and upon the possibility of distinguishing some of the dispositions and propensities , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have observed , that many men of talent and learning , awaited with confidence the result of my labors , while others set me down as a visionary , or a dangerous innovator . But , to the subject : my purpose is to ascertain the functions of the brain in general , and those of its different parts in particular ; to show that it is possible to ascertain different dispositions and inclinations by the elevations and depressions upon the head ; and to preseiit in a clear light the most important consequences which result therefrom to medicine , morality , education , and legislation  --  in a word , to the science of human nature . To do this effectually , it is necessary to have a large collection of drawings and plans . Therefore , with regard to particular qualities and their indications only , I shall now submit to my readers so much as is necessary for the establishment and illustration of the fundamental principles . The particular design of my work is to mark the historical outline of my researches ; to lay down the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive , ' that the study of the real springs of thought and action in man , is an arduous undertaking . Whether I succeed or not , I shall count upon your indulgence and support , if only on account of the hardihood of the enterprise . /z/ Be 80 good as to recollect , that I mean by the head or cranium , the bony box which contains the brain ; and of this , only those parts wBich are immediately in contact with it . And do not blame me for not making use of the language of Kant . I have not made progress enough in mj researches to discover the particular organ for sagacity , for depth , for imagination , for the different kinds of judgment , d &c.; I have even been sometimes wanting precisiot in the definition of my ideas , my object being to make known to a large number of readers the importance of my subject . The whole of the work is divided into two parts , which together makes about ten sheets . Part I. contains the principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nature had conducted me. * After having collected the result of my tedious experiments I have built up a theory of their laws of relation . I hasten to lay before you the fundamental principles . / . The faculties and the propensities innate in man and animals , " " You surely are not the man to dispute this ground with me ; but , follower of Minerva , you should be armed to defend her cause . Should it appear from my system , that we " are rather slaves , than masters of our actions , consequently dependent upon our natural impulses , and should it be asked what becomes of liberty 1 and how can the good or evil we do , be attributed to us ?  --  I shall be permitted to give you the answer , by extracting it literally from my preface . You can strengthen the argument by your metaphysical and theological knowledge . Those who would persuade themselves , that our dispositions ( or qualities ) are not innate , would attribute them to education . But have we not alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate dispositions , or by edu- * The original is obscure : the author means , probably , that nature , or the natural process of induction , having led nim to certain principles , he starts from them with his readers . Tr. i /z/ cation 1 By this objection , they confound the ideas of faculties , inclinations , and simple disposition , with the mode of action itself . The animals themselves are not altogether subject to their dispositions and propensities . Strong as may be the instinct of the dog to hunt , of the cat to catch mice , repeated punishments will , nevertheless , prevent the action of their instincts ! Birds repair their nests vhen injured ; and bees coverwith wax any carrion which they can not remove . But man possesses , besides the animal qualities , the faculty of speech , and unlimited educahilily ,  --  two inexhaustible sources of knowledge and action . He has the sentiment of truth and error , of right and wrong : he has the consciousness of free-will ; the past and the future may influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with conscience , &c.; Thus armed , man may combat bis inclinations : these indeed have always attractions , which lead to temptation ; but they are not so stronjT* they can not be subdued and kept under by other and fitroner inclinations which are opposed to them . You have a voluptuous difiposition. hut , having gruixl morale , oonjugol affection , health , regard for society and for religion , as your preservatives , you resist it . It is only this struggle against the propensities which gives rise to virtue , to vicef and moral responsibility . What would that self denial , so much recommended , amount to , if it did not suppose a combat with ourselves ? and then , the more we multiply and fortify the preservatives , the more man gains in free agency and moral liberty . The stronger are the internal propensities , the stronger should be the preservatives ; from them result the necessities and the utility of the most intimate knowledge of man , of the theory of the origin of his faculties and inclinations , of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility ceases , even according to the doctrine of the most rigid theologians , if man is either not excited at all , if he is absolutely incapable of resistance when violently excited . Can it be , that there is any merit in the continence of those who are born eunuchs ? Rush mentions the case of a woman , who , though adorned by every other moral virtue , could not resist her inclination to steal . I know many similar examples among others , of an irresistible inclination to /z/ kill . Although we reserve to ourselves the right to prevent these unhappj beings from injuring us , all punishment exercised on them is not less unjust than useless : they merit indeed only our compassion . I hope some day to render the proof of this rare , but sad fact , more familiar to judges and physicians . Now that our opponents are tranquilized , let us take up these questions  --  in what manner are the faculties and the propensities of man connected with his organization ? are they the expression of a principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or is the mind connected with some particular organization 1 if so , by what organization 1  --  From the solution of these questions , we shall derive the second principle . /q/ . The faculties and propensities of man have their seat in the brain . I adduce the following proofs :  --  1 . The functions of the mind are deranged by the lesion of the brain : they are not immediately deranged by the lesion of other parts of the body . 3 . The bram Is not necessary to life but as nature creates nothing in vain , it must be that the brain has another jjistinction ; that is to say ,  --  3 . The qualities of the mind , or the faculties and propensities of men and animals , are multiplied and elevated in direct ratio to the increase of the mass of brain , proportionally to that of the body ; and especially in proportion to the nervous mass . Here we find ourselves associated with the boar , the bear , the horse , the ox  --  with the camel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man like you , possesses more than double the quantity of brain in a stupid bigot ; and at least one-sixth more than the wisest or the most sagacious elephant . By this , we are led to admit . the second principle here laid down . /q//. and IV . The faculties are not only distinct and independent of the propensities , but also the faculties among themselves , and the propensities among themselves , are essentially distinct and independent : they ought , consequently , to have their seat in parts of the brain distinct and independent of each other . Proof 1 . We can make the qualities of the mind alternately act and repose ; so that one , after being fatigued , /q/ rests and refreshes itself , while another acts and becomes fatigued in turn . 2 . The dispositions and propensities exist among themselves , in variable proportions in man , as also in animals of the same kind . 8 . Different faculties and propensities exist separately in different animals . 4 . The faculties and propensities develop themselves at different epochs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other increases . 5 . In diseases and wounds of certain parts of the brain , certain qualities are deranged , irritated , or suspended ; they return by degrees to their natural state , during the curative process . I do not imagine myself a man sufficiently great enough to establish any thing by bare assertion : I must endeavor , therefore , to establish each one of these facts by proof . Nevertheless , some timid minds will object thus : If you allow that the functions of the mind are produced by corporeal means , or by certain organs , will you not assail the spiritual nature and the immortality of the soul ? Condescend to hear my answer . The naturalist endeavors to penetrate the laws of the material world only , and supposes that no natural truth can be in contradictiopvith an established truth ; he now finds , that neither the lind or body can be destroyed without the immediate order of the Creator ; but he can draw no conclusion as to spiritual life . He consents himself with perceiving and teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporeal organization . Thus much in general : but for details , I answer in the following manner . In the preceding objection , the being acting , is confounded by the instrument by which he acts . That which I laid down respecting the lower faculties , that is to say , of the inferior organs of the functions of the uiind , in numbers 1,2,3,4,5 , takes place also with it in regard to the external senses . For example , while the fatigued eye reposes , we can list attentively ; the hearing may be destroyed , without the vision being impaired ; some of the senses may be imperfect , while others are in full force ; worms are entirely destitute of hearing and sight , but they possess a perfect touch ; the new-born i /z/ puppy is for several days both blind and deaf , while his taste is perfectly developed ; in old age , the hearing generally diminishes before the sight ; while the taste almost always remains unimpaired . Hence results the proof of the existence of the senses by themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has any one ever drawn the conclusion , that the mind ought to be material or mortal , from the essential difference of the senses ? Is the mind which sees , different from the mind that hears ? I extend the comparison a little farther : he is mistaken , who thinks that the eye sees , that the ear hears , &c; ;  --  each external organ of sense is in communication by nerves with the brain ; and at the commencement of the nerves is a proportionable mass of brain which constitutes the true internal organ of each sensitive function . Consequently , the eye may be ever so sound , the optic nerve may be ever so perfect , and yet , if the internal organ is impaired or destroyed ) the eye and the optic nerves are of no avail . The external instruments of sense have , consequently , their organs also in the brain , and these external instruments are only the means by which the internal organs are put in relation with external objects : it is for these reasons , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haller , nor of Mayer , nor even of the pious Lavater , who seeks for the qualities of mind in the head , and of character in the body , that any thing could be inferred against the doctrine of the immateriality and immortaUty of the soul , from the difference and independence of the faculties and propensities , and of their internal organs.v The same mind which sees through the organ of sight , and which smells through the olfactory organ , learns by heart through the organ of memory , and does good through the organ of benevolence . It is the same spring which puts in motion fewer wheels for you and more for me . In this way the general functions of the brain are established . I now proceed to prove , that we can establish the assistance and the relation of many faculties and propensities , by the formation of the cerebral development . By which means will be demonstrated , at once , the functions of the different cerebral parts . /q/ V , Of the distribution of the different organs and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . Among the proofs in support of this principle , I point out the differences of conformation between carnivorous , frugivorous , and omnivorous animals . Then I show the cause of the difference between different species of animals , also the cause of accidental differences of species and individuals . VL From the totality and the development of determinate organs , results a determinate form , either of the whole brain or of its parts as separate regions . Here I take the opportunity to show , that an organ is the more active , the more it is developed , without denying other exciting causes of its activity* But how is all this to lead us to a knowledge of the different faculties and the different propensities , by the formation of the skulll Is , then , the form of the skull moulded upon that of the brain ? VIL From the formation of the bones of the head , until the most culvanced period of life , the form of the internal swrface of the skull is determined by the external form of the brain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fac " uUies and propensities , while the external surface of the skull agrees with its internal surface , or so long as the variation is confined to certain known limits . Here I explain the formation of the hones of the head , and I prove that , from the moment of birth , they receive their form from the brain . I speak aAerwards of the in* flaence of other causes upon the conformation of the head ; among which causes we may rank continual or repeated violence . I show that the organs develop themselves , from the earliest infancy , until their final completion , in the same proportion , and the same order , as the manifestation of the faculties and natural propensities . I show , besides , that the bones of the head take on their different forms in the same proportion , and in the same order . I show , finally , the gradual diminution of our fac- /q/ i /z/ ulties , by the diminution of the corresponding organs , and how nature deposits in the vacant spaces new portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of the bones of the head . By these , is the first step taken for the determination of the particular functions of the different parts of the brain . Part II . Application of general principles . Establishment and determination of the faculties andpropeU " sities existing of themselves . As I suppose a particular organ for each one of our independent qualities , we have only to establish what are the independent qualities , in order to know what are the organs which we may hope to discover . For many years I met great difficulties in this research , and at last I am convinced , that , as in every thing else , we take the nearest and surest road if we lay aside our artificial logic , and allow ourselves to be guided by facts . I make known to my readers some of the difficulties which it was necessary to surmount . They may solve them , if they have more penetration than I have . I come at last to the means , which have served me most in the determination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pointing out more clearly the seat of the organs . It is necessary , first , to show and to examine the means by which we discover the seat of the organs . Among these means I cite , 1 . The discovery of certain elevations or certain depressions , when there are determined qualities . I mark here the course which it is necessary to follow in like researches . 2 . The existence of certain qualities together with the existence of certain protuberances. 3 . A collection of models in plaster . 4 . A collection of skulls . We shall find many difficulties with regard to human skulls : you know how every one fears for his own head : how many stones were told about me , when I undertook /q/ 8Qch researches . Men , unhappily , have , , such an opinion of themselves , that each one believes , " that I ana watching for his head , as one of the most important objects of my collection . Mevertheless , I have not been able to collect more than twenty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have taken in the hospitals , or in the asylum for idiots . If I had not been supported by a man , who knows how to protect science , and to consult prejudices , by a man justly and universally esteemed for his qualities of mind , and for his character , I should not have been able , in spite of all my labors , to collect even a few miserable specimens . There are those , indeed , who do not wish that even their dogs and monkeys should be placed in my collection after their death . It would be very agreeable to me , however , if persons would send me the heads of animals , of which they have observed well the characters ; for example , of a dog , who would eat only what he had stolen ; one who could find his master at a great distance ; heads of monkeys , parrots , or other rare animals , with the histories of their lives , which ought to be written after their death , lest they should contain too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every kind of genius should make me the heir of his head . Then , indeed , I will answer for it with mine own , we should see in ten years a splendid edifice , for which at present I only collect materials ; it would be assuredly dangerous for a Castner , a Kant , a Wieiand , and other like celebrated men , if the exterminating angel of David were placed under my order ; but , with Christian patience , 1 shall wait the tardy will of Providence . However , in the mean time , my dear Retzer , look a little with me into futurity , and see assembled the choice spirits of men of past ages ;  --  how they will mutually congratulate each other , for each minute portion of utility and pleasure , which each one of them has contributed for the happiness of men . Why has no one preserved , for us , the skulls of Homer , Ovid , Virgil , Cicero , Hippocrates , Boerhaave , Alexander , Frederic , Joseph II. , Catharine , Voltaire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what ornaments for the beautiful temples of the muses ! i /z/ I come now to the fifth means : 5 . Phenomena of the diseases and lesions of the brain . I have also much to iiaj on this subject . The most important , is the entirely new doctrine of the different kinds of insanity , and the means of cure , all supported by facts . If all my researches should only conduct me to this result , I should deem myself sufficiently rewarded for my labors . If men of sense will not thank me , I ought , at least , to be sure of the thanks of fools . 6 . The sixth means for discovering the seat of the orHans , consists in examining the integral parts of different brains and their relations , always comparatively with the different faculties and the different propensities . 7* I come at last to one of my favorite subjects , the gradual scale of perfections . Here I imagine that I am a Jupiter , who beholds from the heavens his animal kingdom crowding upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to pass through :  --  from the zoophyte , to the simple polypus , up to the philosopher and the theosophist ? I shall hazard , like you , gentlemen poets , some perilous leaps . In setting out I shall create only irritable vessels ; then I add nerves and the hermaphrodite nature ; then beings who merit something better , who can unite , and look around upon the world by the organs of sense . I make an arrangement of powers and instruments , and divide them according to my pleasure ; I create insects , birds , fishes , mammalia . I make lap-dogs for your ladies , and horses for your beaux ; and for myself , men , that is to say , fools and philosophers , poets and historians , theologians and naturalists . I end , then , with man , as Moses told you long before ; but it has cost me more than one reflection before I could elevate him to the rank of the king of the earth . I give you the language of signs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that if any mute should be found , there may be for him one other language besides that of speech . I assure you , that , although no one has thought of acknowledging it , I have not been able to effect this , but by putting in communication , in a strange manner , your body , and your muscles with your cerebral organs* /q/ Strictly speaking , you only play the part ef puppets in a show : when certain cerebral organs are put in action , you are led , according to their seat , to take certain positions , as though you were drawn by a wire , so that one can discover the seat of the acting organs by the motions . I know that you are blind enough to laugh at this ; but if you will take the trouble to examine it , you will be persuaded , that by my discovery I have revealed to you more things than you observe . You will find the explanation of many enigmas : for example , why you defend so valiantly your women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why there is no one so tenacious of his opinion as a theologian ,  --  pourquoi plus ( Tun taureau doit etemeur lorsqu* une Europe le chatouilh entre les comes etc . I return at last to you , my dear Retzer , like a poor author , to satisfy you concerning my work . The first section of the 2d part being here finished , I ought to beg my readers to examine all that I have said , so that they may be more convinced of the truth of my first principles , which I have explained in a superficial manner ; but I think that he who is so blind as not to see by the light of the sun , will not do better by the additional light of a candle . The second section contains various subjects . 1 . Of National Heads . Here I agree in some measure with Helvetius , whom T have heretofore contradicted . I shall , perhaps , fall out with Blumenbach , Camper , and Soemmering , although I gladly confess that I am not certain respecting it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not count more than three ,  --  why others can not conceive the difference between flieum and tuum ,  --  why lasting peace among men will be always but a dream . 2 . Of the difference between the Heads of Men and Women , That which I could say on . this subject must remain entre nous . We know very well that the heads of the women are difficult to unravel . 3 . On Physiognomy . I shall show here that I am nothing less than a physiog- 3- i // nomist . I rather think , that the wise raea have baptized the child before it was boro ; they call roe craniologist , and the science , which I discoYcred , cranioloy ; but , in tht first place , all learned words displease roe ; next , this in not one applicable to my profession , nor one which really do*-gignates it . The object of my researches is the brain . The erQBium is only a faithful cast of the external surface of tkf brain , and is consequently but a minor part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as inapplicable as would W that of maker of rhymes to a poet . Lastly , I cite several examples to give to my readfi something to examine , so that they may judge , not by principles alone , but also by facts , how much they can hope from the effect of these discoveries . You know , without doubt , my dear friend , how much strictness I observe ! in my comparisons . If , for example , I do not find in good horse , the same signification as in good dog , and if I do not find in this the same as in good cook , or good philosopher , and if it is not in the same relation to each of these individuals ,  --  - the sign or word is of no value to me ; for I admit no ej ; - ceptions in the works of nature . Finally , I would warn my disciples against a rash use of my doctrine , by pointing out many of its difiiculties . On the other hand , I shall get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch upon two important defects in my work . First , it would have been my duty and my interest to conform more to the spirit of the age ; I ought to have maintained , that we could absolutely ascertain by the form of the skull and the head , all the faculties and all the propensities , without exception ; I ought to have given more isolated experiments , as being a hundred times repeated ; I ought to have made of the whole , one speculative study , and not to submit my doctrine , as I have done , to so many investigations and comparisons ; I should not ask of the world so much preparatory knowledge and perseverance ; I ought to have mounted Parnassus upon Pegasus , and not upon a tortoise . Where is the charm or the interest of a science , 80 hard to acquire ? The premature sentences which /q/ have been pronounced , the jokes and squibs which have been let off at roj expense , even before my intention or my object was known , prove that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conclusions . I remark , in the second place , I have not sufficiently appreciated the a priori , that is to say , the philosophy which is to be founded upon the a priori , I have had the weakness in this , to judge others by myself ; for that which I have considered as well established by my logic , Ibave invariably found incomplete or erroneous . It was lUways difficult for me to reason soundly upon the experiments which I make , as well as upon those made by others , although I am persuaded , that I can collect truths only on the highway of experience . It is possible , nevertheless , very possible , that others have a more favorable organization than I have , to arrive at knowedge a priori ; but you will do me the justice not to insist upon my entering the lists with other arms than my own . " In 1796 , Dr. Gall commenced givingcourses of lectures at Vienna . Several of his hearers , as well as others , who bad never heard him lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with greater or less exactness . Among the better class , the following deserve to be noticed : Froriep.  --  Who has printed an Exposition of the Doctrine of Dr. Gall.  --  3/ Edition , 1802 . Martens.  --  ' * Quelque chose sur la physiognoraie. "  --  Leipzic , 1802 . Walther.  --  ** Exposition critique de la Doctrine de Gall , avec quelques particularites concernant son auteur. "  - -  Zurich , 1802 . Having continued his lectures for five years , on the 9th of January , 1802 , the Austrian Government issued an order that they should cease ; his doctrines being considered dangerous to religion . A General Regulation was made iH ) on the occasion , prohibiting all private lectures , unless a special permission was obtained from the Public Authorities . Dr. Gall understood the object of this ** General Regulation , ' * and never solicited permission , but rather stopped his courses . The doctrines , however , continued to i /z/ be Studied with greater zeal than before ;  --  the prohibition strongly stimulated curiosity , and all publications on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Government for issuing the ** gen* era ! order . " In 1800 , Dr. Spurzheim commenced his labors along with Dr. Gall , and in that year assisted , for the first time , at one of his courses of lectures . He entered with great zeal into the consideration of the new doctrine ; and , to use his own words , **he was simply a hearer of Dr. Gall , til ) 1804 , at which period he was associated with him in his labors , and his character of hearer ceased . " ** Dr. Spurzheim , " says Dr. Gall , ** who for a long time had been familiar with the physiological part of my doctrine , and who was particularly expert in anatomical researches , and in the dissection of the brain , formed the design of accompanying and of pursuing in common with me the investigations which had for their end the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system . " Gall and Spurzheim quitted Vienna in 1805 , to travel together , and to pursue in common their researches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gall 's lectures in 1802 , and the time when he and Dr. Spurzheim left Vienna , the doctrine had made a rapid progress , not only in general diffusion , but in solid and important additions ; a fact of which any one may be satisfied , by comparing the publications by Dr. Gall 's auditors already mentioned , with those by his hearers in the different towns in Germany , visited in the course of his and Dr. Spurzheim 's travels . The following works , in particular , afford evidence of the state of the science in /z/ BiscHOFF.  --  Exposition de la Doctrine de Gall sur le Cerveau et le Crslne , suivie de remarques de Mr. Hufeland sur cette doctrine .  --  Berlin , 2de .

From 1804 to 1813 , Dr. Gall and Dr. Spurzheim were constantly together , and their researches were conducted in common .

In these travels " I experienced every where , " says Gall , **the most flattering reception . Sovereigns , ministers , philosophers , legislators , artists , seconded my design on all occasions , augmenting my collection , and furnishing me everj where with new observations . The circumstances were too favorable to permit me to resist the invitations which came to me from most of the Universities . " " This journey afforded me the opportunity of studying the organization of a great number of men of eminent talents , and of others extremely limited , and I had the adyantage of observing the difference between them . I gathered innumerable facts in the schools , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foundlings , in the insane hospitals , in the houses of correction , in prisons , in judicial courts , and even in jaces of execution ; the multiplied researches on suicides , idiots , ahd madmen , have contributed greatly to correct and confirm my opinions . " * From November , 1807 , Dr. Gall made Paris his permanent home . In November , 1807 , Dr. Gall , assisted by Dr. Spurzheim , delivered his first course of public lectures in Paris . Uis assertions , " says Chenevix , *'were supported by a numerous collection of nskulls , heads , casts ; by a multiplicity of anatomical and physiological facts . Great indeed was the ardor excited among the Parisians , by the presence of the men , who , as they supposed , could tell their fortunes by their heads . Every one wanted to get a peep at them ; every one was anxious to give them a dinner , or supper ; and the writer of this article actually saw a list on which an eager candidate was delighted to * An account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be found in the 6th volume of this work . i /z/ inscribe himself for a breakfast , distant only three months and a half ; at which breakfast , he sat a wondering : guest. * ' * In 1808 , thej presented a joint memoir , on the anatomj of the brain , to the French Institute . We present you said they , in their memoir , ** Une description du Systeme Nerveux moins d ! aprhs sa structure physique , et ses fonoMi mecaniques que d'apres des Vues Philosophiques et Physic ologiques que des hommes habitues a des considerations superieures ne refuseront point d accueillir . ' ' The Institute was then in all its glory . In proportion as Buonaparte had cannonaded , it had grown enlightened . As the hero was the referendary of military justice , so was it the areopagus of scientific truth . The chief of the anatomical department was M. Cuvier ; and he was the first member of this learned body to whom Drs . Gall and Spurzheim addressed themselves . # M. Cuvier was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many branches of science . But what equally distinguished him with the versatility of his understanding , was the suppleness of his opinions . He received the German Doctors with much politeness . He requested them to dissect a brain privately for him and a few of his learned friends ; and he attended a course of lectures , given purposely for him and a party of his selection . He listened with much attention , and appeared well disposed toward the new doctrine ; and the writer of this article heard him express his approbation of its general features , in a circle which was not particularly private . About this time , the Institute had committed an act of extraordinary courage , in venturing to ask permission of Buonaparte to award a prize medal to Sir H. Davy , for his admirable galvanic experiments , and was still in amaze at its own heroism . Consent was obtained ; but the soreness of national defeat rankled deeply within . When the First Consul was apprised that the greatest of his comparative anatomists had attended a course of lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done against - Article published in the Foreign Quarterly . BIOaRAPHT OF DR . GALL* 23 Lord Whitworth ; and at his levee berated the wise men of his Tand for allowing themselves to be taught chemistry by an Englishman , and anatomy by a German ; sat verbum . The wary citizen altered his language . A commission was named by the Institute to report upon the labors of Drs . Gall and Spurzheim : M.Ouvier drew up the report . In this he used his efforts , not to proclaim the truth , but to diminish the merits of the learned Germans . Whenever he could find the most distant similarity between the slightest point of their mode of operating , and any thing ever done before , he dwelt upon it with peculiar pleasure ; and lightly touched upon what was really new . He even affected to excuse the Institute for taking the subject into consideration at all , ' saying that the anatomical researches were entirely distinct from the physiology of the brain , and the doctrines of mental manifestations . Of this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had declared his reprobation ; and M. Cuvier was too great a lover of liberty not to submit his opinion to that of his Consul . His assertion , too , that the anatomy of the brain has nothing to say to its mental influence , he knew to be in direct opposition to fact ; but even the meagre credit which he did dare to allow to the new mode of dissection , he wished to dilute with as much bitterness as he could . So unjust and unsatisfactory , so lame and mutilated did the whole report appear , that the authors of the new method published an answer , in which they accused the committee of not having repeated their experiments . Such was the reception which the science of Phrenology met with from the Academy of the great nation . * Napoleon was unquestionably a good judge of character , and had his favorite rules in deciding upon the motives and designs of men . It was not in his nature to be either ignorant of , or indifferent to , the doctrines of Gall . Conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not to be supposed that he would favor a system which opened to all the origin and na- // ture of human actions . In admitting such a thedry ai that of Gall , he would himself become a subject of r#* mark and investigation by his own consent ; and , howerer well he might have liked the principles of organology , for his own exclusive use , his spirit could never have sanctioned the practice of them in others . That this position majbe made more apparent , we will qnote the following conversation from the Memoires du Docteur F. Antommarchi , ou les demiers Momens de Napth l6on . He does not hesitate to express his aversion to all those philosophers who pretend to interpret the internal man by the external organization . Lady Holland had sent a box of books in which was also contained a bust in plaster , the head of which was covered with divisions and figures according to the era- , niological system of Dr. Gall . " There , doctor , " said Napoleon , " that lies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall then give me an account of it . I should be glad to know what Gall would say of me if he felt my head . " I immediately set to work ; but the divisions were inexact , and the figures misplaced , and I had not been able to put them to rights when Napoleon sent for me I went , and found him in the midst of a mass of scattered Tolumes , reading Polybius . He said nothing to me at first , and continued to run over the pages of the work he held in his hand ; he then threw it down , came to me , and taking me by the ears , and looking me steadily in the face , ** Well ! dottoraccio di capo Corso , you have seen the bust ?  --  Yes , sire .  --  Meditated the system of Gall ?  --  Very nearly .  - -  Comprehended it ?  --  I think so .  --  You are able to give an account of it ?  --  Your majesty shall judge. *  --  To know my tastes and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even without touching it ( he began to laugh. )  --  - You are quite up to it ?  --  Yes , sire .  --  Very well , we shall talk about it when we have nothing better to do . It is a * Verily the Dottoracid 's modesty was very great , and his understanding very gigantic in its dimensions . Few men , except himself , could have studied , comprehended and mastered , in as many months as he required hours , a science which , in its application and details , is perhaps the most extensive that is known . En . Jour. /q/ pisfoller , which is just as good as any other ; and it is sometimes amusing to notice to what extent folly can be carried . " He now walked up and down , and then asked , * ' What did Mascagni think of these German reveries ? Come , tell me frankly , as if you were talking to one of your brethren .  --  Mascagni liked very much the manner in which Gall and Spurzheim develop and point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their method , and regarded it as eminently fitted for discovering the structure of this interesting viscus . As to the pretended power of judging from protuberances , of the vices , tastes , and virtues of men , he regarded it as an ingenious fable , which might seduce the ge ? is du monde but could not withstand the scrutiny of the anatomist.  --  That was like a wise man ; a man who knows how to appreciate the merit of a conception , and to isolate it from the falsehood with which charlatanism would overcharge it : I regret not having known him . Corvisart was a great partisan of Gall ; he praised him , protected him , and left no stone unturned ( Jit Vimpossihh ) to push him on to me , but there was no sympathy between us . Lavater , Cagliostro , Mesmer , have never been to my mind ; I felt , I can not tell , how much aversion for them , and I took care not to admit any one who kept them among us . All these gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marvellous which the vulgar experience , and give an appearance of truth to theories the most false and unfounded . Nature does not reveal herself by external forms . She hides and does not expose her secrets . To pretend to seize and to penetrate human character by so slight an index , is the part of a dupe or of an impostor ; and what else is that crowd with marvellous inspirations , which pullulates in the bosom of all great capitals 1 The only way of knowing our fellow-creatures is to see them , to haunt them , and to submit them to proof . We must study them long if we wish not to be mistaken ; we must judge them by their actions ; and even this rule is not infallible , and must be restricted to the moment when they act ; for we almost never obey our own character ; we yield to transports  --  we are carried away by passion ; such are our vices and virtues , our perversity and heroism . This is my opinion , and this has long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to exclude the influence of natural dispositions and of education ; I think , on the contrary , that it is immense ; but beyond that , all is system , all is nonsense . ' ' Sovereigns , remarks Dr. Gall , are always deceived , when they ask advice from the ignorant , the jealous , the envious , the timid , or from those , who , from age , are no longer accessible to new opinions . Napoleon acquired his first notions of the value of my discoveries during his first journey to Germany . A certain metaphysical jurisconsult , E , at Leipzig , told him , that the workings of the soul were too mysterious to leave any external mark . And , accordingly , in an answer to the report of the Institute , I had this fact in view when I terminated a passage by these words :  --  ** And the metaphysician can no longer say , in order to preserve his right of losing himself in a sea of speculation , that the operations of the mind are too carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions or organs . " At his return to Paris he scolded sharply tanga vcrtement ) those members of the Institute who had shown themselves enthusiastic about my new demonstrations . This was the thunder of Jupiter overthrowing the pigmies . On the instant , my discoveries were nothing but reveries , charlatanism , and absurdities ; and the journals were used as instruments for throwing ridicule  --  an all-powerful weapon in France  --  on the self-constituted bumps . We should here remark , that although Gall , merely from seeing the bust of Napoleon placed along side of those of the generals of the Austrian armies , predicted the immortal victories of Italy , yet he never received from the Emperor the smallest mark of attention. * Keeping in view the strong and adverse feelings of Napoleon , in relation to Phrenology , we may account for the imperfect Report of Cuvier . The Report , it should be observed , related only to the anatomical discoveries of Gall and Spurzheim ;  --  not to their peculiar doctrines of the functions of the brain . Cuvier , however , admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that their " Memoir was by far the most important which had occupied the attention of the class . " That Guvier was a phrenologist , there can be but little doubt ; neither his Report , or any of his works , warrant us in supposing the contrary . Although political causes had a tendency to influence Cuvier against the doctrines of Gall ,  --  nevertheless , these two celebrated men were made to understand and esteem each other , and , towards the end of their career , they did each other justice . Gall had already one foot in the grave when Guvier sent him a cranium , " which , " he said , ' * appeared to him to confirm his doctrine of the physiology of the brain . " But the dying Gall replied to him who brought it , " Garry it back , and tell Guvier , that my collection only wants one head more , my own , which will soon be placed there as a complete proof of my doctrine . " * In 1809 , Gall and Spurzheim commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Physiology of the Nervous System in general and of the JBrain in particular ; with Observations upon the possibility of ascertaining several intellectual and moral Dispositions of Man and Animals , by the configuration of their Heads , 4 volumes , folio i with an Atlas of 100 p/a/65 . " Price 1000 &ancs.]; This great work was continued by the joint exertions of Gall and Spurzheim , to the completion of two and a half volumes , and was ultimately finished by Gall in 1819 . They continued their researches in common till 1813 , Mr hen Spurzheim left Paris to visit Vienna and Great Britain.t During Dr. Spurzheim 's absence . Dr. Gall discontinued his lectures . After his return , ( 1817 , ) he delivered one private course in his own house , and two public courses gratis , one hVEtcole de Medecine , and the other in a hail * ' de Vinstitution pour les Aveugles , * In 1819 , Dr. Gall , at the request of the Minister of the Interior , commenced lecturing for the benefit of the medical students in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livered gratis ; but he was provided with the use of the operation and lecture room in the Hospice de Perfectionnement , for his first course , and aflerwards , on account of that being too small , with the large examination room of the Institution des Jeune Aveugles , which is well fitted for the purpose . His audience amounted to betwixt 200 and 300 ; and so eagerly was he attended , that many more tickets were applied for at each course , than could be given , and the apartment was regularly crowded half an hour before the lecture began . The physiognomical expression of some of the English students , who were present at Blainville 's Lecture , and who probably knew nothing of Phrenology but through the English Reviews , was truly ludicrous . They appeared to relax their features for a laugh when the name of Dr. Gall first escaped the lips of the Professor ; but when they heard him spoken " of with respect , and his doctrines declared to be true , the expression changed into wonder in some , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him with the same interest as those of Germany had done , and the celebrated Gorvisart was , among others , one of his most enthusiastic admirers . But , alas ! an absolute ruler governed France at that epoch , and he held philosophy in horror . Nothing more was required to induce the courtiers , and some literary men , to declare themselves the enemies of the doctrines broached by the German doctor . Hence the ridicule and the ignoble pleasantry which degraded the Journal de P Empire and most of the secondary journals of Paris ,  --  most unworthy means , certainly , of discussing a science so important as that which treats of the powers of the mind and functions of the brain ,  --  means which never reached the elevated mind of the philosopher against whom they were employed , but which contributed greatly to prevent the study and propagation of the truths which Gall had announced . At last , however , his works appeared , and several of his eminent contemporaries hastened to do him justice , and still follow the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From 1822 to 1826 , Dr. Gall published an edition of his work , ** Sur les Sanctions du Cerveau , * c , in 6 volumes , Svo . In March , 1828 , at the conclusion of one of his lectures . Dr. Gall was seized with a paralytic attack , from which he never perfectly recovered , and which ultimately carried him off the 22d of August , 1828 , in the seventysecond year of his age , * His remains were followed to the grave by an immense concourse of friends and admirers , five of whom pronounced discourses over his grave , as is the custom in France on such occasions . His death gave rise to a succession of eulogiums and attacks in the French newspapers that had scarcely ever been paralleled , and public sentiment was warmly and loudly expressed in his favor . In proof of this , I may be allowed to quote a few lines of a letter lately received from a French friend , with whom I was intimate in Paris , but who is no phrenologist , and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations of France , he adds , * You will , I am sure , be more affected by the death of Dr. Gall , than by any political events . In truth , it is an immense loss to science . Whatever opinion we may form of the system of that illustrious man , it must be acknowledged that he has made an immense stride in the sciences of medicine and of man . You must have been satisfied with the homage paid to his memory by the side of his grave , by whatever distinguished men Paris possesses . Nothing was wanting to his glory ; not even the abuse and calumnies of our devots de gazette , " The person of Dr. Gall was well developed ; he was five feet two inches in height , with a large chest and strong muscles ; his step was firm , and his look vivid and penetrating.t His features , though not handsome , possessed a mild and pleasing expression . Every part of his head was strikingly developed , measuring , above the eyebrows and at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumference , and fourteen inches and nine lines , from the root of the nose to the occiput . Dr. Combe , Phren . Jour. vol. v. t Dr. Fossati , Paris Phreii . Joui 3tt j /z/ Dr. Gall acquired an honorable reputation as a physician , writer , and philosopher , and , independent of the respect shown him ; by all parties , he realized the additional reward of a handsome fortune. * His skill as a physician may be inferred from the fact , that , in 1820 , a medal was presented to him , executed by M. Barre , an eminent artist in Paris , by order of count Potosky , a rich Polish nobleman , who took this method of expressing his deep gratitude to Dr. Gall , who had cured him of an old and dangerous malady , for which he had in vain consulted the best medical men in Paris . On one side of the medal is the head of Dr. Gall , an admirable likeness ; and on the other is Esculapius standing at the bed-side of the patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crushing a frog , the symbol of ignorance , under his right foot . Behind Esculapius is an altar , with a skull placed upon it , to denote the particular kind of study te which Dr. Gall was addicted . Near the couch are the arms of the count himself . Taking Gall as a model of a phrenological portrait , it is proper that we should speak of all the cerebral organs , belonging to our nature.t The organs of Amativeness , Philoprogenitiveness , Adhesiveness , Combativeiiess , and Destructiveness were all very well developed in Gall . His Secretivenesswas also rather large , but he never made a bad use of it . He was too conscious of his intellectual powers to obtain his ends by cunning or fraud . He was frank and honest , but acute and penetrating . The Marquis de Moscati gives the following account of an attempt to deceive Gall , with regard to himself , and of some interesting trials of his skill , as a phrenologist. *'Dr . Gottfried of Heidelberg , with whom I was acquainted , informed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to demonstrate to me , on the skulls , the truth of what he advanced , and I disbelieved ; but I declined , and did every thing in my power to ridicule his system in society , with all my military friends , and through * Phren . Trans. -f Fossati. /q/ the German , French , and Italian periodicals . But when I saw that , notwithstanding my repeated diatribes , and the opposition of the medical faculty . Dr. Gall went on in making converts to his doctrine , I determined to see him , and endeavored to deceive him by presenting myself under the dress of a servant . Colonel Bucher , of the fifth dragoons , took me with him to the house of Dr. Gall , who was in Paris , and told him that he wished to know his opinion about my head ; that I was an Italian , had lived with him as a servant for seven years , and during that interval had been much attached and very faithful to him ; that it was for those good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that although he had given me several masters , ybr nearly three years , I had scarcely learned to read and write Italian , but had not yet acquired the French language . **I remember as it were now . Dr. Gall opened his large eyes , fixed them on my countenance with a look of surprise and doubt , and then began to feel my head . While he was making his observations , he now and then murmured , " Cc n'est pas vrai ! Ce n est pas possible ! ! " Shortly after having examined my cranium , he said to Bucher , that an individual with a head so well formed could not be oi the character he had just mentioned ; that on the contrary , unless I was blind and deaf , by the conformation of my cranium , he thought I was able to acquire general knowledge , particularly the languages , and geographical and astronomical sciences . Moreover , that if 1 had applied ac  - -  cording to the development of my organs , I must be a distinguished person and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Bucher , Ce n'est pas hien ! tu as trahi man secret . I do not wonder at the Doctor 's accuracy . Bucher swore that he had not betrayed me . Gall remonstrated against my suspicion , and assured me of his being totally unacquainted with my trick ; but I remained doubtful about the sincerity of both of them , and continued to be an adversary to Gall and his system . " However , from that day I began to study 5raniology , and made use of the skulls of the killed in battle ; but I studied as one of those who oculos habent , et non vident aures habent et non audiunt , and my obstinacy rendered me . /z/ inaccessible to persuasion . Often when I knew well the character of some of my soldiers who died , I sent the skulls to Dr. Gall , and requested his opinion ; and I must say that more than once his remarks were truly astonishing ; but I persisted in my incredulity . In 1810 , one of my lieutenants was killed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very violent temper , a bloody duellist , and much addicted to sensuality . I forwarded his skull to Dr. Gall , and in answer to my question , he replied , that it belonged to an individual very violent ferocious and a sensualist . This time I was the only depository of my secret . " We come now to another quality , on which we should like to dwell , were we not obliged to confine ourselves within prescribed limits  --  we mean the sentiment of property. * Many people in Paris have reproached Gall with being selfish . It can not be denied that he was amply paid for his public lectures ; that he was unfortunate in soliciting the sale of his work ; and that he prosecuted some of his patients who refused to pay their bills . But we should know his own remarks on this point . ** Do you see , my friend , how tiiese wealthy people treat us and other physicians 1 They spend a hundred times more for their pleasures than the health we give them , and expend enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians unpaid . Indeed , while they largely remunerate the lawyer who gains their cause , they give nothing to the physician who saves their lives . " Gall was not generous , in the common understanding of the term ; but it must be considered that in his domestic economy he failed in method , and consequently was always pressed by unforeseen and urgent wants . If he was selfish , let me ask what kind of selfishness it was 1 He educated and supported his nephews , and young people of talents , and his table was free to every body . It is true , he was not generous to all who surrounded him , but he was so towards his domestics , and people of low condition , whose services he had received . We may * Fossati. /q/ say he had a love of property , but that his intellectual powers placed him above its control . Another faculty which Gall possessed in a remarkable degree , as his organization shows , was that of Elevation , Pride , or a high opinion of one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , in speaking of that organ , he has delineated himself . " There are certain men , " says he , ' ' with minds sufficiently strong , who are so deeply impressed with a sense of their own value , and so independent withal , that they know how to repel every external influence which tends to subject them . As far as practicable , they choose the freest countries to live in , and devote themselves to an employment that renders them independent , and exempts them from the caprices and favor of the great . That domination over their inferiors , which becomes slavery under an absolute master , would be insupportable to them . The honors and distinctions that are withheld from merit , while they are lavished on insignificant men , are but humiliations in their eyes . If they prosper , it is only by their own efforts ; like the oak , they are sustained by their own strength , and it is to their own resources that they would be indebted for all they possess . " He was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for titles , and cheerfully practised the profession of medicine . As a political man , he loved liberty and good laws . There is another innate sentiment . Vanity , Ambition , Love of Glory , approaching the preceding in its nature , but still quite distinct from it , which was feeble in Gall . We always observed him to be indifferent to the praise and approbation of the multitude , as he was also to their blame and ridicule . He labored for the love of science , and under the conviction that his ideas would triumph in the end . We could recall a thousand anecdotes to prove that his vanity was not very susceptible . How many times have we seen him laugh at the squibs of the little journals , and unaffectedly despise the gross abuse which they heaped upon him . Let us cite one fact which will answer for many others . Gall had lived for some time at Berlin , with the celebrated poet Kotzebue , who profited by the occasion to learn of him the technical /z/ // terms of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best turn to ridicule . He composed his play , Craniomania , which was immediately performed at the theatre in Berlin , and Gall attended the first representation , and laughed as heartily as any of them . Caution , by means of which the effects of our actions are referred to the future , which sometimes renders us distrustful of the world and indecisive in forming our resolutions , was very strong in xall . Observe what a fulness the head presents in its superior posterior lateral region . Gall proceeded with extreme prudence in every step ; he was distrustful , and much disposed to give credit to bad insinuations against his friends and acquaintances , and would rather break with any one than live in the disquietude of doubt . He often said , that it is more difficult to sustain a reputation than to create one , and that we naust always act as if making the first efforts to render ourselves known . Let us now pass to the faculties whose organs are situated in the anterior part of the head , beginning with the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This sense is the source of educability in man and other animals . Gall possessed it in a moderate degree , but it was not one of his most remarkable faculties . He easily forgot whatever had no connection with his doctrines , or with any of his predominant faculties . It was the same with the faculty of local memory , ( Locality . ) We will once more leave him to speak for himself . " My taste for natural history , " said he , " often led me into the woods , for the purpose of ensnaring birds or taking them in their nests . In the latter object I wa8% very fortunate , because I had often observed , towards which of the cardinal points , each species were accustomed to build their nests . I should have succeeded equally well by disposing my nets properly , because I was in the habit of ascertaining the district the bird frequented , bj his song , and his movements ; but when , after a week or fortnight , I went to find what birds had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often impossible for me to find the tree I had marked , or the nets I had placed . ' ' He also forgot the residence of his patients whom he had frequent- /z/ ly visited in his carriage , and had considerable difficulty in remembering in what story of the building they lived . He was ignorant of geography , and whenever he looked upon a map he found something new , though he had observed it a thousand times before . So we may be sure , that if he traveled , it was not from taste , but with the sole object of propagating his doctrines . If it be true , as we believe it is , that there is an organ of Order , Gall was absolutely destitute of it . The arrangement of his house was a curiosity . He said it was order to him . Let one imagine to himself , huddled together in his bureau-drawers , for instance , old journals , quittances , quack advertisements , letters from distinguished men , pamphlets , nuts , pieces of gold , silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen him take up a bundle of these papers , and shake out from them the money he happened to need . In this manner he kept his records and his desk . Weaker still was his memory of persons . " This faculty , " said he , " is too feeble in me , and the defect of it has , all my life-time , caused me a thousand troubles . When I rise from the table , I can not distinguish either man or woman who sat by my side during the meal . " In verbal memory . Gall was also deficient . At school he never could learn his lessons , and when the task was one that exercised the memory , he was always surpassed by his school-fellows , whom he excelled in original composition . The organ of the sense of language , which gives the talent of philology , was a little better developed . He knew , besides his own , the Latin , and French language , which he wrote and spoke with facility , though defective in pronunciation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a strong dislike , however , for questions about mere words , grammatical discussions , compilations , and works of that kind . ( Pour les compilations , et autres travaux du meme geure , ) The sense of the relations of colors , which is one of the fundamental qualities indispensable to the painter , was absolutely wanting in Gall . He was obliged to depend upon the opinions of his friends , whenever he treated of painters or painting , and by that means was sometimes /z/ // led to pronounce an erroneous judgment which the critica never failed to remind him of . As for his taste , he was fond of those brilliant porcelain-like pictures of modern times ; and when in a gallery , he bestowed his attention on portraits , and especially on those of women when painted in a classical style . As he was a poor judge of painting , so was he as poor an amateur in music . He generally got wearied at the Opera or Concert ; but a woman 's voice in conversation , he said , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of numbers ; every kind of numerical calculation fatigued him , and we believe we never saw him go through a process in simple multiplication or division that was at all complicated . He knew nothing of geometry , nor the problems of mathematics . What a contrast to those philosophers who make this same science the basis of all positive knowledge ! In mechanics , architecture , and the arts , he was no happier than in calculation , music , and painting . We will only remark , that the execution of the plates of his great work , after Spurzheim ceased to overlook tHem , was detestable , which would not have been the case if Gall had possessed the slightest knowledge of design , or of the arts in general . Having thus finished our notice of the organs situated in the lower part of the forehead , it remains for us to examine those higher faculties whose organs are placed in the upper part of that region . It is these that gave Gall his eminence over the generality of men . That comparative sagacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agreement and disagreement between the objects of our examination , and are led to search for affinities , comparisons , and similes , was verj strong in Gall . Accordingly , you will observe that not only were all his researches but a continual comparison of organization with faculties , and of the faculties of man with those of other animals , but that he also employed this method in his familiar conversations and public lectures , whenever he was particularly anxious to impress his ideas on the minds of others . The following interesting account of an interview with /q/ Gall was published in the BirmiDgfaam Gazette , and maj serve to give the reader some idea of the hibits of the philosopher at home . * Most of us find some satisfaction in tracing on Fancy 's tablet the portrait of a person of whom we have heard much , and particularly after we have read many of the works of an author , but with whom we have had no personal acquaintance . It generally happens , however , that our portrait is not correct , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with myself . I found Dr. Gall ( in 1826 ) to be a man of middle stature , of an outhne well proportioned ; he was thin and rather pallid , and possessed a capacious head and chest . The peculiar brilliancy of his penetrating eye left an indelible impression . His ' countenance was remarkable ,  --  his features , strongly marked and rather large , yet devoid of coarseness . The general impression that a first glance was calculated to convey would be , that Dr. Gall was a man of originahty and depth of mind , possessing much urbanity , with some self-esteem and inflexibility of design . * ' After presenting my letters of introduction to him at seven o'clock , A. M. , he showed me into a room , the walls of which were covered with bird-cages , and the floor with dogs , cats , c . Observing that I was surprised at the number of his companions , he observed , * AH you Englishmen take me for a bird-catcher ; I am sure you feel surprised that I am not somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should employ my time in talking to birds . Birds , Sir , differ in their dispositions like men ; and if they were but of more consequence , the peculiarity of their characters would have been as well delineated . Do you think , ' said he , turning his eyes to two beautiful dogs at his feet , that were endeavoring to gain his attention , * do yon think that these little pets possess pride and vanity like man 1 ' *- Yes , ' said I , * I have remarked their vanity frequently . ' We will call both feelings into action , ' said he . He then caressed the whelp , and took it into his arms ; * mark his mother 's offended pride , ' said he , as she was walking quietly across the chamber to her mat : * do you think she will come if I tall her 7 ' Oh yes , ' I answered . * No , not at /q/ /z/ He made the attempt ; but she heeded not the hand she had so earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak to me to-day/ said the doctor . He then described to me the peculiarity of many of his birds ; and I was astonished to find , that he seemed familiar also with their dispositions , ( if I may be allowed the word . ) ' Do you think a man 's time would be wasted thus in England ? You are a wealthy and a powerful nation , and as long as the equilibrium exists between the two/ so shall you remain ; but this never has , nor can not exist beyond a certain period . Such is your industry , stimulated by the love of gain , that your whole life is spun out before you are aware the wheel is turning ; and so highly do you value commerce , that it slands in the place of self-knowledge , and an acquaintance with nature and her immense laboratory . ' * ' I was delighted with this conversation : he seemed to me to take a wider view in the contemplation of man , than any other person with whom I had ever conversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who approached as near as their iron bars would admit . * You see they all know me , ' said he , ' and will feed from my hand , except this black-bird , who must gain his morsel by stealth before he eats it ; we will retire an instant , and in our absence he will take the bread . ' On our return , we found he had secreted it in a corner of his cage . I mention these , otherwise , uninteresting anecdotes , to show how much Dr. Gall had studied the peculiarities of the smaller animals . After our breakfast , he showed me his extensive collection ; and thus ended my first visit to the greatest moral philosopher that Europe has produced ; to a man , than whom few were ever more ridiculed , and few ever pursued their bent more determinately , despite its effects ; to a man , who alone efiected more change in mental philosophy than perhaps any predecessor ; to a man , who suffered more persecution , and yet possessed more philanthropy than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , viz. the metaphysicali Gall was strongly opposed , when it soars into the spiritual world , and pushes its inquiries into general principles and general truths , slighting , however , the material /q/ world and the relations of cause and effect . This way of thinking , and directing one 's efforts in the search after truth , was none of his ; he was for the positive , jfiot the abstract . Another remarkable manifestation of mind , wit , which gives a kind of relief to its possessor , Gall was endowed with in no small degree . Although he never engaged in the polemics of the Journals , yet in his works , he replied to his opponents with a keenness of satire truly astonishing . To be convinced of this , one has only to read the sixth volume of his work . Observe his piquant observations on the Editors of the Dictionary of Medical Sciences in answer to the wish expressed by them , that somebody would , at last , devote himself to the physiology of the brain . He exclaims ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Fournier and Begin , which has lasted from the lime of my arrival in Paris , 1807 , to the year 1819 ! " While deriding the principles of the transcendentalists , and at the same time answering his opponents , he observes , ' It may be certainly said , with truth , that the dead kill the living . Some time or other , when I shall take it into my head to be admired , cried up , and to have even my follies sanctioned , I mean to drown , hang and burn myself , till I am well dead ; and if , notwithstanding these means of getting a reputation , my moi is still doomed to be concerned with the non moi , with the vanities of the world in space , I hope at least to have some titles and places to spare in time . Moi , space and time , you know , are the pivots on which the metaphysicians turn much of their reasoning . " While pointing out the piracies many savans had made upon his works , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When nations are at war , pillage becomes a right . Now , savans who are engaged in making discoveries , are constantly at war with one another ; therefore , they are allowed to pillage ; therefore , the little malice of M. Boisseau is eminently rational . " The result of another manifestation of the intellect , is the poetical talent . This is not enough to make one a poet , ( in the ordinary acceptation of the word ; ) for versification depends upon another faculty . Gall could ner er make verses . He even detested poetry , because /z/ had no ear for harmony ; but he possessed , in a high degree , the poetical power of invention . A fundamental quality inherent in our nature , and " which ; on8titutes the strongest bond of our species , is the sentiment of benevolence , compassion , moral sense . Gall was exceedingly benevolent ; he succored the unfortunate , and procured them the assistance of his rich patients ; he encouraged talents , and rendered them all the aid in his power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , nonchalance , was sometimes observed in his manners , all thought of it was effaced by his benevolence . In his conversation , he was not too careful to observe those Mnventional forms and verbal disguises , which civilization has introduced to cover , as with a fine mantle , the bad dispositions of the soul ; but the more intimately he was known , the more he was loved . The faculty of Imitation that which makes the actor and mimic , and is also of great use to the orator , inasmuch as it excites him to express by external signs what is passing within , existed in a very high degree in Grail . We had but imperfect means of judging of him as an or ator , in his public lectures , where , however , notwithstanding the disadvantage of speaking in a foreign tongue , he iefl a deep impression on the minds of his hearers . Let us now see what were Gall 's opinions respecting God and religion . * ' Every where , " he says , " and in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which he is completely surrounded , is forced to recognize at every instant , the limits of his power , and avow to himself that his fate is in the hands of a superior power . Hence , the unanimous consent of all people to adore a Supreme Being ; hence , the ever-felt necessity of recurring to him , of honoring him , and rendering homage to= his superiority . " Thus Gall recognized God like a phifosopher . He wfs indignant only against the abuses that men practised upon the credulity of the people ; against those who make of religion a refinement of power , of ig norance , of slavery and corruption . He was indignant against the persecutions which sectarians , of different fmths , carry on against their fellow-men in the name of God and relin . He Wfui indignant against all these /q/ abuses , because he loved the human race , and desired its happiness . It was to his Jirmnessj that Gall owes the success of his researches . Without this constancy , or rather obstinacy with which he pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same researches , it would have been impossible for him to carry his new science to the point where he left it .

In 1831 , a Phrenological Society was formed in Paris* Actuated bj the wish , " as stated in its Constitution , ** to perform worthily the task bequeathed by Gall to his adopted country , the Phrenological Society calls upon all the friends of science and humanity to communicate the results of their observations , and lend their aid by all the means in their power . " It is only astonishing that France so long delayed to profit by the labors of Gall , and to ad ? ance the impulse , which he first communicated , while already , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Ireland , in the United States , in India , and even in Italy ,  --  that land of despotism , religious and political , Phrenology has been cultivated with the greatest ardor - and the most encouraging success . " * The object of this society , as stated in its own prospectus , is to propagate and improve the doctrines of Phrenology . The society publishes a journal , " offers prises , and bestows medals of encouragement* ** The society has a council of management , composed as follows : a cabinet council ; a committee for editing the journal ; a committee of funds . " * The cabinet council consists of a president , two vice** presidents , a general secretary , two secretaries for the minutes ( proces verbeaux , ) a treasurer , and a keeper of the museum ( materiel ) of the society .

Articles sent for the journal ; 4 . A bibliographical bulletin . M. Dannecy was elected president , and Casimir Broussais , general secretary . " The Paris society , within the first year of its existence , consisted of one hundred and ten members , sixty of whom were physicians . Its members are of the highest respectability in Medicine , Philosophy , and Law , with some of both Chambers of the Legislature . We make reference to this Society , because its members have particularly honored Gall , in their constitution and proceedings . It would be interesting to notice in this place the various societies and the progress of phrenology , throughout the civilized world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That Phrenological Societies exist in most of the civilized nations , and are actively engaged in promoting the science originated by Gall , is an interesting fact  --  and it should lead those , who speak lightly of Phrenology , to reconsider their assertions , and to adopt a course of conduct more in accordance with modesty and justice . The history of science , like the political history of nations , exhibits to us , at longer or shorter intervals of time , men of a superior order , who conceive a great idea , develop it largely , apply it boldly , and who leave behind them an indelible impression. * Such a man was Gall . That great discoverer is no more ; but his genius survives in the science which he has created . We owe it to him , that henceforward we shall study the intellect and passions of man , the intelligence and instincts of animals , not entramelledin our views by blind superstitions , and metaphysical subtleties and prepossessions , but guided by the light of reason , and bound by no rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Gall , we find organic and physiological facts , which , for the first time , enable the naturalist to draw the line of distinction , between man and the lower animals , and by which man is demonstrated to be immeasurably the superior of the whole animated creation . Let us for a moment look back on the previous state of our knowledge of human nature . The abstract study of man , as pursued by the ancients , - Prospectus of the Paris Phrenological Society . See Edin . Jour . No . JLXX. /z/ has been the source of the most inexplicable contradictions , and pernicious consequences to the human race . That abstract philosophy , which , originating in the East , obtained so great a reputation in Greece , and was supported by so much zeal in the new capital of Egypt , abounded with lofty conceptions , and with the sublime creations of a poetical fancy . But to what did it lead ? The unhappy fruits of its popularity were the most intolerant dogmatism , and desolating scepticism ; while the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance thrown over it by the mad enthusiasm of its professors . It is difficult now to concei ? e , how , during the lapse of so many ages , so many attempts should have been made to arrive at a correct theory of the human mind , without the idea having ever occurred to any one of the celebrated philosophers of past times , to take the brain as*the groundwork of their labors ; that organ whose functions they were engaged in studying , but whose connection with those functions they never recognized . It is indeed true , that some of them took notice of the wonderful structure of the cerebral mass , and even undertook the dissection of the brain , to which they professed to attach a high degree of importance ; but their labors were nearly fruitless , for to them the brain appeared but a single homogeneous mass , undivided into separate organs . ' ' What is the use of observation , " said Bichat , ** if we know not the seat of the disease ? " What , in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , who not only were ignorant of the seat of the different faculties , but to whopi the idepi had not e ? en occurred as possible , that each of those facsf ulties might depend for its manifestation op a particular portion of the cerebral substance ? Thus did these great anatomists make no real progress in the study of the hn man intellect and passions . Succeeding ges were pot more successful in founding a system which should sub stitute close observation of facts forpiere arbitrary by pothesis . Down to the days of Gall , the inquirer into the nature of the human mind , began his investigations by a forced abstraction of his own faculties from the wholes external world , and then turning his intellectual powers inwards ; /z/ upon his own mind ;  --  in profound reflection , and in the total inaction of by far the larger portion of his faculties , he fixed in his memory a picture of what he fancied to be the various phenomena of cerebral activity . It was , with , a crowd of ideas acquired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that each philosopher , taking himself and his own individual constitution as the standr ard , formed his theory of the human understanding . Other philosophers , again , holding different views , sought for the origin of the human faculties in the impressions made on the senses , and these brought out ideas more distinct and positive ; but , instead of regarding external sensations as merely necessary excitements to action of the internal organs of the different faculties , they considered the latter to result from the sensations themselves , and the brain was as yet vaguely believed to be , as a whole , the general seat of intelligence . As for physiologists , they were content to ascribe , in a general way , the origin of the passions to the influence of temperament , or to various viscera or organs of the body . On the appearance of Gall , the science of mind assumed an entirely new aspect . Instead of studying the character and intellect of man in general , through the medium of himself , he began a series of observations upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventing an arbitrary system of faculties . Gall noted the relation between each organ , and the manifestations which he observed in the different individuals whom he examined ; he distinguished between the general attributes of all or a variety of the faculties , and particular faculties themselves . Instead of inquiring whether an individual was well endowed with memory , imagination , judgment , or attention , ( which are attributes common to a variety of intellectual powers , ) he observed his capacity for any , and what employment of those faculties ; whether he most easily remembered places , or words , or persons , and so on . In a word , instead of an abstract and d priori , Gall introduced an experimental or a posteriori , method of philosophising . He studied what are called morals , in the same way that we study physics ; and he gave to the physiological science of mind that happy direction , to which the other natural sciences owe those splendid results which so honorably /q/ distinguish the latter part of the last century , and , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has pointed out , is that which must be followed by all future philosophers , or they will infalhbly continue to wander blindfold amidst error and absurdity . But the system of Dr. Gall can not be properly under stood , until the inquirer shall know how to apply it with certainty . To attain this knowledge , a long and enlightened experience is absolutely necessary , and the results thence obtained are truly astonishing . Suppose that we wished to judge of the capacity of any individual , the general development of his head must first be considered , next the proportion which the anterior bears to the posterior regions , then the prominent parts in each region must be ascertained , and if a sufficient degree of experience has been acquired , the limits of the different organs should be specified . Thus , if it be known beforehand what allowance should be made for the influence of the viscera , the faculties and dispositions of the individual may be accurately determined . Such is the process that must be gone through before arriving at any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure guide throughout . By this means , it will be understood why one individual is distinguished for his success in poetry , music , mathematics , logic ; , eloquence , or metaphysics ; why another is impelled by the noblest of human passions , that of desiring to sacrifice even his life for the sake of doing good ; why another is insensible to the existence of danger ; why this man sacrifices every thing to the desire of being thought eminent in some accomplishment which , in reality , he does not possess , while that man would give up all besides to gratify his thirst of rule ; and , finally , why some individuals can never attain to excellence , notwithstanding the greatest efforts , but remain forever condemned to a humiliating mediocrity . But this is not all . When we are thoroughly convinced , that those differences of disposition are the results of organization , we will congratulate the man whom nature has constituted favorably in that respect ; and we will , on the other hand , regard with compassion him who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our feelings of indulgence towards the failings of our fellow-creature  --  // at the same time that they will show the importance of an enlightened education , which shall aim at counterbalancing the depraved dispositions of a child , by ezercisinf those organs and faculties which may tend to destroy their effects , and which may even frequently turn them to the advantage of the individual who would otherwise have been their victim . Such is the importance of Phrenology ; but , at the same time , can it be said that the man whose genius has given it birth has succeeded in bringing it to perfection ? Little attention , indeed , would , in these days , be paid to the man who should pretend to prescribe limits to any one of the sciences . No ! Phrenology , like all the branches of medicine , is still imperfect ; but , like them , it lays claim to stand on certain positive data , on fixed principles , and fundamental doctrines , which can not be called in question , as being the results of testimony a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elucidated by the simplest reasoning , and proved by the severest induction . So fully is this admitted to be the case , that uow-a-days the study of Phrenology is no longer considered to belong exclusively to the physician , but begins to be looked upon as common to all the world . Artists were perhaps the first to , perceive the importance of our science ; for it is a striking fact , that , in the models of antiquity , the forms of the head are very often found in the most exact relation to the faculties of the gods and men whom the chisel of the artist has handed down in sculpture to posterity . What sculptor will not comprehend , that , by means of Phrenology , he may be able at a single glance to obtain a key to individual character ? and that , in creating an ideal subject , he must be guided by the same principles ? Will it ever occur to him to give to the figure of a Hercules the forehead of an Apollo 1 or would he place the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent a character of pure benevolence ? Were an artist to commit such an error , he would be considered a man of superficial mind ; and though , as a mere workman , he might be more or less rewarded for his skill , he would be treated as one who had not an idea of the true nature of his art , and of accomplishing it . The same remarks are equally applicable to the kindred art of /q/ painting . The painter can not too strenuously pursue the study of Phrenology : for he has only an even surface on which to delineate his objects , and he may fail in giving them the necessary expression , by neglecting those traits , which , however slight , are characteristic and necessary to bring out the distinguishing peculiarities of his subject . Moreover , Phrenology recognises a uniform relation , an intimate connection between the habitual attitude of individuals and their predominant dispositions ; and the painter who knows how to appreciate this influence of the cerebral organization upon the movements of the body , will be distinguished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personages ; while he who is a stranger to Phrenology runs a continual risk of falling into the grossest inconsistencies . What would be thought of a medallion , in which the predominating organs of its subject were not more strikingly developed than the rest 1 In this way , to all those arts which profess to present the exact image of man to the eyes of his survivors , Phrenology is most useful , and will in future be considered indispensable . ' * ' ' It is now beginning to be perceived also , that , without physiology , the philosophy of mind can not advance a single step ; that a thorough knowledge of organization in general , and of that of the brain in particular , must he the foundation of all inquiries of that nature ; that every attempt to explain intellectual and moral phenomena , which shall not take the principles of Phrenology for its basis , will inevitably be fruitless . On this subject all are agreed , spiritualist as well as physiologist , for , even according to the views of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these principles , the ancients have , in some of their master-pieces , fallen into errors which are now considered monstrous , such a.s the extreme smallness of the head of the Venus de Medicis . From the same cause , and from fear of failing in certain arbitrary proportions , the head of Napoleon has been reduced in size , without regard to the existence of an extraordinary cerebral development , of which Phrenology alone is capable of comprehending the importance , and appreciating the beauty . The ancients , when they concealed the enormous size of the head of Pericles , had the same end in view as the modems , but were more faithful imitators of nature . /q/ i // tion necessary to the manifestation of both intellect and sentiment , while , according to the latter , it is the vital organ of the intellectual and moral powers . It were out of place here to attempt to decide upon the superiority of either of those methods of reasoning ; suffice it to say , that both are deeply interested in advancing the progress of Phrenology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difference of opinion on matters which , ever since man began to think and reflect , have divided the world . We can not at the same time help noticing here , the sure consistency of the ideas furnished by Phrenology on this subject . How unerring and elevated are the views of the philosophical observer , who , contemplating man in the midst of his fellow-creatures , recognises and traces the reciprocal actions and reactions of different organizations ! Should such a philosopher ever be called upon to give laws to his country , he will , far from setting at nought the uniform cravings inherent in certain organizations , be careful to avoid all excitements to infraction of municipal law arising from demanding of man more than his organization is capable of , and from sacrificing some of the faculties to the interests of some others : he will frame laws which shall be adapted to the real wants of the community , according to the variety of their nature , and not founded on false views of the equality and uniformity of the intellectual and moral faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , from which the differences of intelligence and resource arise . Phrenology will be consulted , also , in the preparation of a penal code ; for the nature of the punishments to be inflicted ought to bear a relation to the possibility , more or less admitted , of correcting and ameliorating the guilty . A great latitude will thus be allowed , in order that he whose organization does not indicate his propensities to be incurably strong , may one day , when their influence shall have been abated by well-directed training , be restored to his place in that society , of which he shall be no longer unworthy ; whilst the unfortunate being , in whom the excessive and fatal preponderance of certain organs over those of the intellect , or the almost total absence of the latter , shall leave no hope of improvement , will be /q/ kept separate from the former class of moral patients , and will be prevented forever from returning into that society of which he can only be the pest . But the department in which Phrenology is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that of Education . Here the extent of its application will be prodigious . How should that science fail to be of primary importance to a teacher , which should enable him to turn the studies of his pupils into the proper channel , and to have a thorough knowledge of their characters ; which should inform him with certainty that such a one has a decided talent for drawing , such another for languages , a third for calculation , and a fourth for poetry ; and which should warn him , that it would be a loss of time to urge the progress of a fifth in a particular direction ! How many tears would not be spared to childhood ! How many vexations would not the teacher himself escape ! And who will presume to foretel the results of a system of education , in which , by proper direction , those dispositions shall be turned to the advantage of an individual , which would otherwise have been the cause of his inevitable destruction ? When a child is born with a particular development of brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become cruel and ferocious , and perhaps commit murder . What does an able instructor do in such a case 1 He endeavors to place beyond the reach of his pupil all objects calculated to call into action the organs of his most dangerous propensities , and to present to him only those of an opposite tendency . He strongly calls his attention to the charms of an amiable disposition , to the affection which it generates towards itself , to the praises which it calls forth , and , above all , to the internal complacency , with which it never fails to bless its possessor . Such representations , exhibited to the infant 's mind incessantly , and in a thousand different ways , incline him to make an effort at amiability . He is praised for his first virtuous acts ; he is skilfully encouraged to persevere in the same line of conduct . Even accidentally , and as opportunity offers , he is made to feel , by some striking example , the melancholy and deplorable effects of indulging criminal passions ; and , by assiduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of perseverance , is , that he becomes a man of courage and coolness , who is not to be diverted from a useful enterprise by feelings of too great sensibility , but wlio , actuated by those principles of virtue which have gradually become his constant guide , will refrain from indulging in any act of cruelty . Such is the happy influence which Phrenology will exercise over the development of childhood ; but is not education also useful at all ages and at every stage of life 1 Youth and niJiture age are not necessarily incorrigible . The attempt is then , without doubt , more difficult , but still success is not impossible . Let us suppose a man to be of a passionate temperament : Phrenology informs him that there exists within him a dis ) osition , the result of organization , hurrying him blindly on to all the violence of ) ussion . If , besides , he be endowed with reason , that is to say , if he be not deficient in the intellectual organs , will he not keep himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing that the chief cause exists in his own constitution , will he not strive to yield less and less to the influence of causes which are external ! And will he not , consequently , succeed at last in weakening his own tendency to paroxysms ? It would require much more than our present limits , to enter fully here into the services which Phrenology will be the means of rendering to human society , as soon as it shall be universally known and appreciated as it ought ; all that we aim at , is , to call attention to the nature and importance of its assistance , in order that all those who are actuated by a desire of doing good , and who consider it a duty to contribute to the amelioration of our social condition , and of the human race in general , may concentrate their exertions in maintaining , spreading , and brings ing it to perfection . Editor . /z/ It is three years since I published my large work on the anatomy and physiology of the brain . This magnificent work soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public were sure of finding in it , the real ideas of the founder of the physiology of the brain , and it contributed its potent influence to destroy the prejudices which still reigned respecting the nature and tendency of my researches . I had come to the conclusion , that it was necessary , in the first instance , to publish a work worthy of the importance of the subject , which would make known to the learned world the whole extent of my discoveries , and at the same time would afford the means of putting them to the ordeal , and of multiplying and perfecting them . This purpose not only required many discussions on subjects altogether new , but , likewise , a great number of portraits , and designs of brains and skulls , both of men and animals . The execution of this vast plan , raised the price of my work above the means of most persons , to whom my labors ought to prove of the most utility ; and I was therefore urged from all quarters to pubUsh. aw dXssw.t /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public in general . In the fulness of my conviction , that my labors may have the happiest influence on moral institutions , in the treatment of cerebral diseases , particularly mental alienation , &c.,; I feel it my duty to neglect no means of extending the knowledge of them . Notwithstanding the great number of general views , small works , articles in journals , analyses and criticisms by many of my most distinguislied pupils , I still meet , in almost all the works of our modern authors , either erroneous and defective notions , a total ignorance , real or affected , or a singular reserve and apprehension in passing judgment on what is most essential in my doctrines  --  the in con testible value of facts . They can no longer refuse to admit the principles to which these same individual observations have led me ; but they find it too laborious to resist experience itself , and they conceive that they have done enough for the progress of the science , by suspending , with an air of complaisance or modesty , its definitive decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon the research and the multiplication of observations to the reader alone ; it is still necessary to conduct the observer by the hand , to show him the multiplied modifications of a large number of facts , and thus to initiate him in this new field of observation . I shall concede no excuse to those who , through prejudice or self-sufiiciency , neglect what is the most useful and essential , the experimental part of the physiology of the brain . It is for the same reason , that this edition does not ofier to the reader a simple sketch of my doctrines ,  - -  an extract merely from my large work . It includes the entire text , with the exception of the descriptive anatomy of the nervous system in general , and of the brain in particular , of which I propose to make a distinct work , as soon as I shall be able to profit by what has been published on these two objects of comparative anatomy , since my first edition . I shall , in this work , explain the anatomy only so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiological propositions . For this omission , however , I shall atone by several corrections ; T shall add new observations , answers to new objections , and a systematic review of the most important treatises , which have appeared since the publication of my large work . But not to leave the latter in any respect inferior to this , I shall join to it a supplement , which will be wholly devoted to these improvements . As it has been necessary to omit the plates , I shall refer to them by the same figures and the same letters with which they are marked in my great work , in order that those of my readers , who are in the vicinity of extensive libraries , may be enabled to consult them . In this manner , I apprehend , the various and multiplied materials of this whole work will be connected in the most natural manner . The object of all my researches is to found a doctrine on the functions of the brain . The result of this doctrine ought to be the development of a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in relation to the moral and intellectual function of the brain , supposes 1 . That moral and intellectual faculties are innate . 2 . That their exercise or manifestation depends on organization . 3 . That the brain is the organ of all the propensities , sentiments , and faculties . 4 That the brain is composed of as many particular organs as there are propensities , sentiments , and faculties , which differ essentially from each other . And as the organs and their localities can be determined by observation only , it is also necessary that the form of the head or cranium should represent , in most cases , the form of the brain , and should suggest various means to ascertain the fundamental qualities and faculties , and the seat of their organs . The demonstration of these principles will be follow- ed by the exposition of the moral qualities and intellect /z/ tud faculties , by the history of . their discovery , their natural history , the seat of these organs in the brain , the form which these organs give to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the physiognomy , pathognomy , and philosophy of man , and on several very important questions , the solution of which naturally flows from my doctrines taken together . When I speak in the plural number , I include with myself Dr. Spurzheim , who , having accompanied me in my travels , made a great part of the observations , referred to , in common with me. /z/ When any discovery or new doctrine is announced , the question is usually asked , how the author conceived the first idea ? Although the same experiments may not lead different individuals to the same meditations , yet when these same experiments are collected and presented in order , they give rise to ideas in the mind of the reader so analogous to those of the author , and the discovery often appears to him so natural an event , that he is ready to exclaim , " Why had I not made it long since ? " This is precisely what has happened with respect tOt my doctrine , the origin of which rests on very ordinaiy facts . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and I doubt not but most of my readers will say likewise , " How is it possible , that these truths have been so long overlooked ? " From my eariiest youth , I lived in the bosom of my family , composed of several brothers and sisters , and in the midst of a great number of companions and schoolmates . Each of these individuals had some peculiarity , talent , propensity , or faculty , which distinguished him from the others . This diversity determined our indifference , or our mutual affection and aversion , as well as our contempt , our emulation , and our connections . In childhood , we are rarely liable to be led astray by prejudice ; we take things as they are . Among our number , we soon formed a judgment , who was virtuous or indined to vice ; modest or arrogant ; frank or deceitful ; a truth-teller or a liar ; peaceable or quarrelsome /z/ benevolent , good or bad , ( fcc . Some were distinguished by the beauty of their writing , some by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire history , philosophy , or languages . One shone in composition by tiie elegance of his periods ; another had always a dry , harsh style ; another reasoned closely and expressed himself with force . A large number manifested a talent or a taste for subjects not within our assigned course . Some carved and drew well ; some devoted their leisure to painting , or to the cultivation of a small garden , while their comrades were engaged in noisy sports ; others enjoyed roaming the woods , hunting , seeking birds ' nests , collecting flowers , insects , or shells . Thus , each of us distinguished himself by his proper characteristic ; and I never knew an instance , where one who had been a cheating and faithless companion one year , became a true and faithful friend the next . The schoolmates most formidable to me , were those who learned by heart with such facility , that , when our recitations came , they took from me the honors , which I had gained by my compositions . Some years afterwards 1 changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet individuals endowed with a surprising facility for learning by heart . It was then that I remarked , that all these resembled my former rivals in their large prominent eyes . Two years afterward 1 went to a university ; my attention first fixed itself on those of my new fellow-students who had large prominent eyes projecting from the head . Such generally boasted of their excellent memories , and though in many respects by no means the first , all of them had the advantage of me , when the object was to learn promptly by heart , and to recite long passages with correctness . This same observation having been confirmed to me by the students of other classes , 1 naturally expected to find a great facility of learning by heart , in all those in whom I should remark the prominency of the eyes . I could not believe , that the union of the two circumstances /q/ t which had struck me on these diflFerent occasions , was solely the result of accident . Having still more assured myself of this , I began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eyes , and the facility of learning by heart . Proceeding from reflection to reflection , and from observation to observation , it occurred to me that , if memory were made evident by external signs , it might be so likewise with other talents or intellectual faculties . From this time all the individuals who were distinguished by any quality or faculty , became the object of my special attention , and of systematic study as to the form of the head . By deofrees , I thought I could flatter myself with having found other external characters , which were constantly met with in great painters , musicians , mechanics , and which consequently denoted a decided propensity to painting , music , the mechanical arts , ( fcc . I had in the interval commenced the study of medicine . We had much said to us about the functions of the muscles , the viscera , ( fcc , but nothing respecting the functions of the brain and its various parts . I recalled my early observations , and immediately suspected , what I was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of heads is occasioned by the difference in the form of the brains . But , I never went so far , as to imagine that the cause of the moral qualities or the intellectual faculties , resided in such or such a place in the bones of the cranium . Was it not then very natural to expect , that in discovering and demonstrating , in men endowed with remarkable propensities or talents , the existence of some external signs of their qualities , this discovery would lead me to a knowledge of the functions of the brain , and of its parts ? The hope of having it in my power to determine , one day , the relation of the moral and intellectual forces with the organization , the hope of founding a physiology of the brain , was so powerful an encouragement , that I could not but form the resolution to continue my researches , until I had either attained my end , or was convinced of the impossibility oiTeacVimVX , /z/ This beautiful enterprise would not have been difr cult , if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and to nature . But , it too often happens , that the more scientific one becomes , the farther he departs from the simple truth ; and this was precisely what I experienced . My imperfectly established conviction was shaken , in proportion as I gained new information , or rather , as I heaped up errors and prejudices . Philosophers assure us , said I to myself , that all our faculties come from external sensations , or , at least , that all men are born with equal faculties , and that the differences between them , are owing either to education , or to accidental circumstances . If it be so , there can be no external signs of any faculty ; and , consequently , the project of acquiring in this manner a knowledge of the functions of the brain and its parts , is a mere chimera . But I always returned to my first observations . I knew that my brothers and sisters , my companions and school-fellows , had received nearly the same education , or rather , that in general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of the same circumstances and analogous impressions . I also saw that ordinarily those whose education had been carefully watched , to whom the instructors had given lessons in private , were , in fact , behind others in capacity . We were often accused of aversion to study , and of want of zeal ; but many of our number could not , with the best disposition , and the most determined efforts , raise themselves in certain points , even to mediocrity , while in others , they surpassed their school-mates without effort , and almost , it might be said , without perceiving it . In fact , our masters did not give much credit to the system of the equality of the faculties , for they thought proper to exact more of one scholar , and less of another . It often happened to them to speak to us of our natural gifts , of the gifts of God ; and they exhorted us in the words of the gospel , telling us that each would render an account in proportion to the talents which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I observed both in tame and wild animals , of which I bad always a considerable number about me , diflferences of faculties and of character , as in men . . One Hog was almost of himself skilful in the chase , while another , of the same race and the same litter , could be trained only with great difficulty ; one was very cross , and quarreled with dl other dogs , while another was very niild and peaceful ; this one could not find his way back even from a small distance ; while that , on the contrary , though very young , returned , after being lost , from very distant places . Such a bird listened with great attention to an air which was played , before him , and learned it with admirable facility ; another , of the same covey , and fed and treated in the same manner , paid no attention to it , and sung nothing but his own note . One pigeon was the faithful mate of his companion , and in spite of repeated trials , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another pigeon , on the contrary , stole into all the dove-cotes , to gallant and carry off females that were strangers to him . In all these cases , I could not suppose either evil incUnations , the influence of education , or different impressions on the external senses . I was consequently obliged to conclude , that the propensities and the faculties , both of men and animals , were innate . But then arises this question : On what is this innateness founded ? Does it belong to a peculiar principle , a spiritual principle , the soul ? and.this soul , does it exercise its faculties freely and independently of organization ; or , is the exercise of its faculties subordinate to certain material conditions ? or , in fine , are these faculties the result of organization itself ? If this principle , this soul , enjoys the exercise of its faculties independently of organization , it is , together with aU its functions , beyond the sphere of the physiologist ; the metaphysician and the theologian alone will arrogate the power of pronouncing on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , who petend , that this principle is independent of organization . /q/ /z/ Is this principle the same in both sexes ? Does it change its nature in infancy , childhood , puberty , manhood , old age , decrepitude ? Is it at all - modified according to the quantity and quality of the aliments by which the body is nourished  --  according as digestion is easy or laborious ? What becomes of this independence in sleep , in drunkenness , in apoplexy , in acute fevers , in effusions , excrescences , inflammations and ulcers of the brain and its envelopes , in derangements of the functions of the liver and stomach ? Every one knows , that such circumstances interrupt , suppress , exalt  --  alter , in a thousand ways , the functions of the soul . Ought not these facts then to lead us to the conclusion , that the exercise of our propensities and faculties , whatever the principle we adopt , is subjected to the influence of organic conditions . Who then will deny , that the propensities and the faculties are within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine these material conditions , these organs of the soul ; it is for him to determine whether the greater or less perfections of these organs , induces a more or less energetic manifestation of their functions ; it is for him to seek to what point and under what conditions , the most favorable development of the cerebral organs impresses visible or palpable signs on the external surface of the head . It is , in fine , the task of the observing physiologist to examine what are the parts of the brain affected by a determined propensity , sentiment , talent . For a long period I continued my researches as I had commenced them , ured on solely by my fondness for observation and reflection . Abandoning myself to chance , I gathered for several years all that it offered me . It was not till after having accumulated a considerable mass of analogous facts , that I felt myself in a state to range them in order . I perceived successively the results , and at length had it in my power to go to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the more progress I seemed to have made , the more every thing appeared to conspire against me . Here , a phenomenon supposed something utterly at war with the dogmas of physiologists ; there , a consequence presented itself which refused to harmonize with the opinions of philosophers and here , many fancies were raised respecting the dire influence , which my researches were to exert on morality and reUgion . In this continual struggle of facts with received notions , what was to be done ? Was I to listen to the simple voice of nature , or , to the arrogant counsels of reigning doctrines ? Was I prepared to interpret rightly the language of nature ? I had so often deceived myself  --  who could answer for me , that I should deceive myself no more ? Was it not a ridiculous pretension for a young man , to hope that his efforts would reveal to him things , which for ages had escaped the researches of the greatest observers ? On the other hand , supposing that my labors were not to be totally vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppose opinions so long established in the various sciences ; to contradict the anatomists , physiologists , philosophers , metaphysicians , lawyers , ( fee . ? How many times have I probed my conscience , to determine whether a vicious propensity , unknown to myself , did not guide me in these researches ? But , as I could not have roreseen whither they would lead me , no prospect of reputation could have influenced me in pursuing them ; and beside , was it the best mode of attaining &me,; to venture to announce extraordinary propositions , destitute of probability , and which , if false , must be proved such , at no distant period ? The love of truth , and a conviction of the purity of my views , could alone have inspired me at each step with the confidence and the boldness , necessary for my task . When one has discovered by experiment a series of incontestible truths , he meets all possible doubts and objections with courage . Each doubt resolved , is a difficulty removed j each objection refuted , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon succeeded in removing the obstacles , and in peaceably pursuing my course . I especially familiarized myself , at an early period , with the following observations , which ought to be deeply engraved in the mind of all observers and of all readers . The more important a new view maybe , and the more nearly the doctrine is likely to touch the affections and interests of men , the greater care should be taken by the author to avoid every kind of rash and arbitrary assertion ; but , the moment he announces the truth , he ought to be assured beforehand , that he can produce only good . Let these truths concern the nature of man or the nature of brutes , let them unfold the physical or mental nature of Uving beings , he will be always able to appeal to the harmony and order , which reign in the universe . Is it not the saipe Creator who has made the moral and the physical world ? Can physical truth be in opposition to moral truth ? If certain men cry out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine , they render this doctrine singularly suspicious ; for , either it is false , or we may justly accuse the weakness and ignorance of the pretended interpreters of God 's works . Nothing can resist the power of tiiith . Now if the truth remains , and public writers or even governments attach to it pernicious consequences , who does the mischief ? On the other hand ; is it not at once impious and absurd to maintain that laws and constitutions ought to be founded on imposition , in order to insure the happiness and tranquillity of men ? " Let us respect truth , " you will tell me ; " but how are we to know that your doctrine of the functions of the brain , is the truth ? " Truth , as well as falsehood , has its proper physiognomy . This doctrine owes its birth to incontestable facts ; these facts have revealed the general laws , in virtue of which they take place ; they have led to principles which prove themselves , independently of the facts from which they are deduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INTRODtrCTION* 65 or called forth by a mind ear for experiment , becomes a new confirmation of it : this doctrine has introduced clearness , confidence , harmony and stability , where before there reigned only obscurity , vacillation , contradiction , versatility ; it explains moral phenomena , and the modifications of these phenomena at different ages and in the two sexes , in different states of health , and disease , and in different nations : in man and in animals , it reveals to us the secret of the diversity of instincts , propensities , faculties , as well in species as in individuals : from the polypus to man , it demonstrates to us from firagment to fragment , the material causes of the gradual perfection of their intelligence , of which , descending in the opposite direction from man to the pol3rpus , and returning piece by piece , it produces the diminution and the degradation ; the numerous propositions of this doctrine , destroying the most accredited errors , naturally sustain and strengthen each other : it is eminently fruitful in application to human affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the study of history , to medicine , to philosophy , morals , criminal legislation , 6lc , : it opens to the observing naturalist , a boundless field for meditation . If these are the characteristics of the truth and utiUty of a doctrine , I am certain , that we shall be more and more struck with the truth and utility of the physiology of the brain , in proportion as it is submitted to more rigorous and multiplied tests . Strongly impressed with these ideas and supported by these motives , I turned all my attention to the finding of the means which , in the least possible time , would enable me to accumulate the greatest number of facts . I shall speak of these means , when I treat of the propensities and faculties , and their organs , particularly . I will here give a single one , which presented itself when I least thought of it , and which greatly contributed to perfect my works . The first day of the year 1805 , my father , who resided at Tiefenbrunn , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It is late , and night can not be &r; /z/ distant : shall I see you once more . " Nothing but such an invitation , joined to the ardent desire which I cherished in my bosom of again seeing my beloved parents , after an absence of twenty-five years , could have induced me to leave my friends and my patients , for a few months . I wished , too , to avail myself of this opportunity to communicate my discoveries to the learned men in the north of Germany . That my interview with them might not terminate in propositions and discussions without proof , I took with me a part of my collection . I was always convinced that , without these visible and palpable proofs , it would never be possible to fight victoriously against so many preconceptions , prejudices , and contrary opinions , as I must necessarily meet . I experienced , every where , the most flattering reception . Sovereigns , ministers , philosophers , administrators , artists , seconded my design on all occasions , aiigmenting my collection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too favorable , to permit me to resist the invitations , which came to me from most of the universities . By this means my journey was lengthened far beyond the term , which I had first fixed ; but there likewise resulted so many discussions of my doctrine , public and private , that it arrived at a degree of maturity , which few founders of new doctrines have been able to attain during their lives . This journey afibrded me the opportunity of studying the organization of a great number of men of eminent talents , and of others of very limited capacity , and I had the advantage of observing the difference between them . I gathered innumerable facts in the schools , and in the great establishments of education , in the asylums for orphans and foundlings , in the insane hospitals , in houses of correction and prisons , in judicial interrogatories , and even in places of execution : the multiplied researches on suicides , idiots , and madmen , have contributed greatly to correct and confirm my opinions . I have laid under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted antique statues . and busts to my examinations , and have compared with them the records of history/ After having used , for more than thirty years , such diversified means , I no longer feared the danger or the reproach of having precipitated the publication of my great work . I had more reason to apprehend , that the great number of proofs I had furnished in support of each of my propositions , instead of being satisfactory , would prove to the great body of my readers actually alarming . As this volume will be particularly devoted to the exposition of the moral part of the physiology of the brain , the reader may ask , if a physician has the right to apply his knowledge to the study of morals , the improvement of education , that of houses of correction , of prisons , of the penal code , of malefactors , fec . No one disputes , that all institutions and all laws ought to have for their basis , the nature of man and the wants of society . Now , to whom does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve , than to the physician ? Who has more occasion than the physician , to see men in a state of absolute unreservedness ? Who is more obliged to study their physical and moral character , and the influence of one on the other 7 Who is better prepared for it , by accessory knowledge and by the study of natural sciences ? Finally , who remarks and knows how to appreciate , as well as the physician , the influence of food and drink , of temperature , of a critical period approaching , or already present , of temperament , climate , affections , passions , diseases , ( fcc , on the determinations of men ? The physician alone by night and day is witness of the most secret events in famiUes , and of their most intimate relations . Virtuous or vicious , the man who suffers and struggles against death , can with difficulty conceal from the physician , his real character . Who would not wish to have for a friend the man to whom he confides his wife , his children , himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand ready to devote himself absolutely to his patients , and // perhaps to meet death at their bedside ? It is to such a friend , to whom all that relates to human nature is so well known , that men unfold the hidden windings of the heart ; . they feel obliged to discover o him the weak points and eccentricities , which may guide him more surely in his judgment . Who , like the physician , can trace that extremely delicate line of demarcation which distinguishes immorality , wickedness , and crime , from certain derangements of the mind , so often masked , from imbecility , from madness ? Ought not circumstances so numerous , and so favorable , give to the physician profound and certain views of human nature ? * Let this same physician be endowed with the genius of * The truth , of these remarks must be obvious to all . The sphere of the physician is great and important , and if he would make use of his frequent opportunities to olerve nature as modified by disease , the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not mean smiply those symptoms which have reference to the phvsical system only  --  but those mental manifestations which change with the different stages of disease . The character of the mind of the patient , when in health , should be first ascertained , and his most promment phrenological developments . Eis concern , or indifference for life , or friends , or wealth , or business , should be noticed and registered . We would recommend the keepiiig of a phrenological journal for every patient ; at least , noticing the most prominent developments . The physician has often to encounter the prejudices of his patients , or their attendants  --  and a knowledge of their peculiar characteristics would enable him to provide for them . He could judge more accurately of symptoms , by Demg able to distinguish between the effects of physical prostration , or apparent improvement , and the mere affections of the mind . Large or small Hope , or Mirthfulness , or Cautiousness , would change materially , many of the symptoms which physicians uniformly regard as of consequence . When encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to those faculties which are predominant . Irritableness of temper , however , should be met with the greatest possible kindness . We can not express too strongly our disapprobation of those medical men who treat their patients harshly , and more like brutes than human beings . They administer to their bodies , not appearing to know that they have any thing to do with their minds . A cheerful communication between the physician and patient , is followed with the hapAest effects .  --  Eo. /q/ observation ; let him be familiarized with the origin and nature of the propensities and the faculties of man , with the excesses and abuses with which these same propensities and faculties continually menace him , and you will have the best qualities to furnish valuable results , in all cases where the object is to direct sagaciously , and to judge equitably the actions of men . Moses , that great legislator , fixed his principal attention on the physical character of men . Is it not to physicians that men are indebted for an infinity of excellent establishments of police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given several complete treatises on medical poUce and statistics , as well as on legal medicine , how many instructors and moralists are there , who borrow from medicine those means , which they employ with the happiest results . If all which I have mentioned , is not yet accomplished , it is because , neglecting the useful example of the ancient sages of Greece , men have separated from each other too far , physiology , medicine , education , morals , legislation , instead of appreciating their mutual relations ; and still more because there are few philosophic physicians , who can embrace the whole extent of their sphere of activity , and elevate themselves to the full dignity- of their rank . i /z/ The phenomena which take$ place in man , from the moment of his conception to that of his death , taken together , constitute the nature of man. * All these phenomena are perhaps the result of one single and uniform principle ; but they manifest themselves under forms and conditions so different , that to acquire a clear and detailed knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , as various as these forms and conditions themselves ; we must study man in all his relations , in all his points of contieict with entire nature . The greatest obstacle which has ever been opposed to the loiowledge of man 's nature , is that of insulating * The word phenomenon means more properljr the appearance of a thing or quality , thjm the principle which constitates the nature of it . To retain the word phenomenon , we should modify the sentence thus : The phenomena which takes place in man , from the time of conc tion even to that of his death  --  constitute the only data fVom which the nature of maa can be inferred .  --  Ed. /z/ him from other beings , and endeavoring to remove him from the dominion of the laws , which govern them . We may , without inconvenience , neglect the relation of man to unorganized nature . Let us leave to the cultivator of natural history , the care of determining the laws of contractility , elasticity , weight , attraction , cryi-talization , the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is impossible to avoid an endless confusion of words and notions , and not to lose ourselves in the most absurd explanations , unless we distinguish the functions which man has in common with the vegetable kingdom , from those which are peculiar to him as an animal . The vegetable kingdom offers us organization infinitely varied . We recognize in it the act of fecundation , assimilation , nutrition , growth , a species of circulation , secretions and excretions , irritability , and an elective force , or a faculty of placing itself in relation with objects out of itself ? of choosing , for example , the most suitable nourishment ; of attaching itself to surrounding objects ; of avoiding or seeking the light ; of closing the leaves or flowers by day or by night , fec . All these operations take place from the influence of a blind necessity , without sensation , consciousness , or will . For this reason we assign to the vegetable kingdom a life , but a life purely organic , automatic , . vegetative ; and as all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual takes no account of the action of external things , it has been thought proper to call it an internal life . Those who find the supposition of a soul , necessary to explain these phenomena , give it the name of a vegetative soul . The same functions are exercised in animals and in man . Fecundation , assimilation , nutrition , growth , secretions and excretions , fec. , are performed in them equally by the laws of organization , by a blind necessity , without perception , consciousness , or will . Man and animals , therefore , share the vegetative , automatic life , with the vegetable kingdom . But they likewise enjoy functions of a more elevated and essentially different order ; they possess the faculty of sensibility , of perceiving /q/ impressions , external and internal ; they have the consciousness of their existence ; they exercise voluntary movements , and the functions of the senses ; they are endowed with mechanical aptitudes for industry ; with instincts , propensities , sentiments , talents ; with moral qualities and intellectual faculties . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any being , it is considered as possessing animal life . And as men have thought , that all these laculties were the product of impressions on the senses , it has been called the life of relation , or external life . It is therefore with reason , that the parts of the body have been divided into organs of vegetable life , and organs of animal life . Those readers who are not versed in the study of natural history , wiU here ask me , What is the organ , or what are the organs of animal life ? By what means has nature effected all its phenomena , from simple sensation to the most complicated faculties , moral and intellectual /z/ These means , these organs , form a peculiar apparatus , of which vegetables and zoophytes are still deprived : it is the nervous system . The nerves alone are the instruments of sensibility , of voluntary movement , of the functions of the senses . Without a nervous system , there is no mechanical aptitude no instinct , no propensity , no sentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection , no passion . Each particular order of the functions of animal life is effected by a peculiar nervous system , by particular nerves , distinct from the other nervous systems , and from other nerves . There is a peculiar nervous system for the viscera , and for the vessels principally destined to vegetable life ; there is a nervous system , the instrument of voluntary movements ; there is one which belongs to the functions of the senses : finally , the noblest in animals and in man the most considerable , the brain , has all the others under its dominion ; it is the source of /q/ /z/ all perception , the seat of every instinct , of every propensity , of all power , moral and intellectual . In order to proceed from the simple to the compound , I shall give my readers some views of the nervous system , with which the animal character commences , but the functions of which belong even more to vegetable than to animal Ufe . In all animals placed in the scale of living beings above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , there exist one or more masses of a gelatinous substance , very vascular , of different color and consistence , which give rise to white threads , called nervous filaments . These filaments unite and form nerves , nervous cords , which go to this or that viscus and there spread themselves . These masses of gelatinous substance , called ganglions or plexuses , these sources of nervous filaments and the nerves formed from them , are more or less numerous , according to the number of parts or viscera with which the animal is provided , and for which they are destined . These nervous apparatuses exist , even in animals which have neither spinal marrow nor brain ; consequently , their origin and their action in these imperfect animals are independent of all other nervous systems . They are the type of the nervous system of the viscera , of the abdomen , of the chest , and of the vessels of animals of the most perfect organization , and of man . As long as there exists in an animal of the lower order , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous filaments , this nerve acts in an insulated manner ; but as soon as , in a single individual , the existence of several organs renders several ganglions and several nerves necessary , these ganglions and these nerves ordinarily enter into communication by means of filaments , passing from one to the other . There are then as many of these ganglions and of these different nerves , as there are different viscera ; and as each viscus is destined to a particular use , to digestion , to the secretion of bile or semen ; as each viscus has its /q/ specific irritability , these ganglions and these nerves must necessarily have their interior structure and tiieir functions , differing fiom each other . It is probable , that in animals , even of the lowest order , this nervous system is endowed with sensibility ; but in man , and the higher animals , it is , like the spinal marrow and the nerves of the senses , entirely under the dominion of the brain . In a state of health , the viscera and the vessels execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without our having the slightest consciousness of the fact : the intestines are in fact in continual motion ; they choose the nutriment which suits them , and reject heterogeneous substances ; they form the secretions and the excretions . But , we have seen that vegetables present to us similar phenomena : the capcuity of being stimulated , of reacting against stimulus , a character of irritability , ought not to be confounded , as most physiologists do confound it , with the faculty of perceiving a stimulus , of having a consciousness of it , of feeling it . The perception , the consciousness of an irritation , of an impression , are inseparable from the nerve of sensation . Sensation , or organic sensibility without consciousness , is a contradiction in terms , but a contradiction very sagely preserved and professed in our schools . Sensibility , or the faculty of feeling , constitutes the essential character of the animal . When the changes produced by an iknpression take place without consciousness , they must be considered the result of irritability , and as belonging to automatic life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception , with sensation , this act of consciousness , of perceiving , belongs to the animal life . " But , " you will say , " admitting that , in a state of perfect health , we have no consciousness of what passes in the heart , stomach , liver , &c.,; still we feel hunger and thirst , and the need of certain evacuations ; we experience trouble , uneasiness , and pains , in the intestines , &c.y; and in general it would be difficult to find a part of e body ; th boues , tendons , and oven hair , not except- /z/ ed , which may not , under certain circumstances , transmit sensations , and consequently become an organ of animal life . How happens this ? " We have seen , that the ganglions and nerves of the viscera and vessels , communicate together ; they send several filaments of communication to the spinal marrow , and this is immediately connected with the brain . It is thus that all the impressions on the other nervous systems are transmitted to the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nerves on the brain , and of the brain on all the nerves , is established . It is for this reason , that the nervous apparatus of the chest and abdomen has received the name of sympathetic nerve , or , because its branches of communication take their course between the ribs to the spinal marrow , the intercostal nerve . Besides these means of reciprocal action and reaction , several nerves of the spinal marrow and of the head , such as the hypoglossal nerve , the glosso-pharyngeal , the abductor , the fecial nerve , unite themselves with the sympathetic . The organs of both lives can only perform their special functions in proportion to their development , to their organic function . Before the liver , the kidneys , the stomach are formed , there can be no secretion of bile , of urine , of gastric juice ; in Uke manner , the propensities and talents can not unfold themselves until the brain is developed . The divers ganglions , plexuses and nerves of the sympathetic are not developed simultaneously ; and for this reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not commence and terminate simultaneously . It is the same with the various ganglions and pairs of nerves of the spinal marrow and of the nerves of the senses . Their successive aud independent development and death , explain the successive and independent perfection and failure of the various organs of voluntary motion , and of the senses . I shall hereafter prove , that the different constituent parts of the brain , each of which is destined to a peculiar /q/ fiinction , are equally subjected to successive developtaent and destruction . This explains how instincts , propensities , and talents do not all either appear or fail , at the same periods of life . As the brain will be the subject of my meditations in all the volumes of this work , I leave it now , to answer a question of high importancCj viz. Does the fetus and infant , while inclos in its mother 's womb , enjoy animal life , or , a life purely automatic ? How ought its destruction to be judged of before the tribunal of sound physiology ? Those who maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an external life , that all our moral qualities and intellectual faculties are the result of impressions on the senses , must necessarily maintain that the fetus and the newly-born infant are still only automata , whose destruction has no relation to an animated being . Prochaska says , * " In the fetus and the new-born infant , the muscles have the automatic movement , and not the voluntary , because the brain is not yet in a state to think . " Bichat likewise says , t " We may conclude with confidence , that in the fetus the animal life is nothing ; that all the acts attached to this age , are dependent on the organization . The fetus has , so to speak , nothing in its phenomena , of what especially characterizes an animal ; its existence is the same as that of vegetables . In the cruel alternative of sacrificing the child , or of exposing the mother to almost certain death , the choice can not be doubtful . The destruction is that of a living being , not of an animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sacrifice an unfortunate mother to a feeble fetus , still menaced with dangers without number , and on whose life it is still so difficult to calculate . Nothing but certain religious notions , or the /z/ reasons of an ambitious policy , could ever recommend the dire counsel of immolating the mother in the most touching moment of her life , to the precarious existence of the infant . Still , as the expressions of Bichat , " the act involves the destruction of a living being , and not of an animate being , " might lead to unlawful abuses , I consider it my duty as a physiologist , to rectify the arguments of Bichat and Prochaska . I have said that neither the organic , nor the animal life , developed itself fully at once , or enjoyed simultaneously all its activity . If the possession of organic life by the fetus , were contested , because several of the functions of the viscera have not yet manifested themselves , the conclusion would doubtless be severely criticised . Is it , then , more reasonable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possession of animal life , because his brain is not yet formed for all its propensities , all its talents , and for the faculty of thinking ? If physiologists had sooner known the plurality of the cerebral organs , and of their functions ; if they had distinguished the different degrees of consciousness and sensation , the desires and necessities , from thought or reflection , they would have been cautious about affirming , that there exists no animal life in the fetus or new-born child . The brain of these beings is not , indeed , sufficiently developed to possess , ideas , to combine and compare them ; but , if this degree of perfection were necessary in order to allow them sensation and desires , it would be very difficult to determine at what period . animal life does commence , and when the destruction of an infant becomes an act committed on an animate being , and , consequently , criminal . The infant has not yet the faculties of reflection and imagination ; he feels as yet no affection for those of a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but can we refuse to him the faculty of perceiving , that of memory , of inclinations , of aversions , of joy and sorrow ? If the noblest functions of the brain require a certain development and a certain consistence , who shall determine the degree of development , and of consistence , /q/ necessary for functions of an inferior order ? The new-bonv child manifests by the outline of his figure , by his movements , and his cries , the states of happiness and of suffering ; he equally manifests , too , the desire of nursing , and so of other sensations . At all events , this work will become an incontrovertible proof , that there exists within us a far more fiuitful source of sensations than impressions made on the senses ; and xionsequently that it is altogether false , to assert that animed life commences only with the action of the external senses . These considerations are sufficient to prove , that the laws of animal organization by no means support the dangerous principle , avowed by certain physiologists . Of the Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Animal Life in Man and Animals , In the natural order of the gradation of animals , the nervous system , which presides over the voluntary movements , comes after the great sympathetic nerve . It consists of the spinal marrow inclosed in the vertebral column . And from it , to the right and left , before and behind , issue as many pairs of nerves as there are vertebrae of which the column is composed . In caterpillars , &c.,; the ganglions and the pairs of nerves proceeding from them , correspond in number to the segments of which the animal consists . All these pairs of nerves go to the muscles , and give them the faculty of exercising motion . But all these nerves , at least in the more perfect animals , must be considered rather as conductors of the cerebral influence , than as independent agents ; their function ceases , as soon as their free communication with the brain is interrupted . As , in a healthy state , these functions are exercised with consciousness , they are held to make part of animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on the brain , are the functions of the external senses . I shall have occasion , even in this volume , to determine better than has yet been done , the functions proper to each sense . I come , then , to the noblest nervous system , the brain , and its peculiar functions* As to the structure of the brain , I refer my readers to the first volume of my large work . Suffice it to say , that the whole cavity of the cranium or head , beginning with the eyes and ending with the neck , is filled with the cerebral mass . Like the rest of the nervous system , it is composed of gelatinous substance , and of an infinity of nervous filaments , which thence derive their origin . It is this same brain which governs both the voluntary movements and the functions of the senses . It is this same brain , of which , hitherto , neither the structure nor the functions have been understood , and which yet includes ail the organs of the forces , moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to conduct my readers by a luminous path , I shall first consider these moral and intellectual forces as all philosophers and physiologists consider them . I shall then show , how they are defined and distinguished by the vulgar , and by common sense , which certainly , in this case , is good sense . The great proportion of philosophers agree in recognizing in the soul only two faculties , the understanding and the will ; the understanding , or capacity of receiving ideas ; the will , or capacity of receiving difl*erent inclinations : even when they speak of a greater number of faculties , they always reduce them to these two principal ones . According to Aristotle , the soul of man has faculties which are common to it with animals ; sensibility , appetite , and the power of motion . It has , also , faculties which belong to it exclusively ; the intellect passive , the intellect active , the intellect speculative , and the intellect practical . Bacon distinguishes two souls ; the soul rational . /q/ and the soul sensitive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reason , reasoning , imagination , memory , appetite , and will . The faculties of the sensitive soul , are voluntary motion , and sensibility . Descartes recognized four principal facuhies ; will , understanding , imagination , and sensibility . Hobbes admits only two principal faculties ; knowledge and motion . Locke admits understanding and will . Bonnet recognizesunderstanding , will , liberty , and , in his introduction , sentiment , thought , will , action . Condillac admits six faculties in the understanding , or seven , counting sensation , the common origin , according to him , of the understanding and the will , * sensation , attention , comparison , judgment , reflection , imagination , reasoning ; and all these faculties are only sensations transferred or modified . He maintains that all the operations of the soul , thought , intelligence , reason , liberty  --  all the faculties of a spiritual substance , are only sensation transformed ; that all the knowledge which the human intellect can attain , all intellectual and moral ideas  --  all , without an exception , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kant , the primitive faculties or functions , pure conceptions , and ideas a priori exist to the number of twenty-five , viz. two forms of sensibility , space and time ; twelve categories , or pure notions of the understanding , viz. unity , plurality , totality , affirmation , negation , limitation , inherence and subsistence , causality and dependence ; society ; possibility and impossibility , existence and non-existence , necessity and contingence ; eight notions which depend on these , viz. identity , diversity , agreement , contradiction , interior , exterior , matter , and form ; in fine , three forms of reason , consciousness and the soul , God , the universe . According to M. de Tracy , to think is only to feel , and to feel is , for us , the same thing as to exist ; for sensations inform us of our existence- The ideas or per- 82 lHTSIOLOGT OF THE BRAIN* ceptions , are either sensations , properly so called , or recollections , or relations which we perceive , or , finally , desires which we experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , therefore , divides itself into sensibility , properly so called , into memory , judgment , and will . To feel , properly speaking , is to have the consciousness of an impression ; to have memory , is to feel the recurrence of an impression formerly felt ; to judge , is to perceive the relations among our perceptions ; finally , to wish , is to feel desire . By these four elements , sensations , recollections , judgments , desires , are formed all compounded ideas . Attention is only an act of the will ; comparison can not be separated from judgment , since we can not compare two objects without judging ; reasoning is only a repetition of the act of judging ; to reflect , to imagine , is to compound ideas decomposable , into sensations , recollections , judgments , desires . That species of imagination , which is only a true and faithfiil memory , can not be distinguished from it . M. Laromiguiere forms the system of the faculties of the soul of two systems  --  the system of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties of the will . The first comprehends three peculiar faculties  - -  attention , comparison , and reasoning ; the second equally comprehends three  --  desire , preference , and liberty . " These three faculties are indispensable , and they suffice for all our knowledge , for the most simple of aU systems , as well as for the vastest of all sciences . Attention , comparison , reasoning ; these are all the faculties which have been assigned to the most intelligent of created beings . By attention , we discover facts ; by comparison , we seize their relations ; by reasoning , we reduce them to system . " Sensibility or the capacity of perceiving , and activity or the faculty of acting , are two attributes inseparable from the soul . " M. Laromiguiere admits the action of the object on the organ , of the organ on the brain , and of the brain /q/ on the soul ; the action or reaction of the soul on the brain ; the communication of the movement received by the brain , to the organ which forms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows , that the dit ference in minds does not proceed from the greater or less amount of sensations ; " but , " says he , " it can proceed only from the activity of some causes , and the inactivity of others ; for , in the human mind , every thing can be referred to three causes ; to sensations , to the labor of the mind on these sensations , and to the ideas , or the knowledge resulting from this labor . In fine , M. Laromiguiere proposes this question , viz. : Do the operations of the mind vary with the objects to which they are applied ; or , can we circumscribB them within bounds , and even very narrow ones ? By attention , comparison , and reasoning , we can raise ourselves to a knowledge of the structure of the universe , and , consequently , to that of its Author ; by desire , preference , and free will , we are , in some sort , the arbiters of our destiny . " " Six faculties then suffice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nature . Three have been given us to form intelligence ; we call them intellectual faculties ; three to fulfil the wishes of our hearts , and we call them moral faculties . " * Such is the manner in which all these philosophers and physiologists wander in the clouds of speculation , pointing out to their pupils , plains , mountains , valleys water , and fields , and pretending that these are the only things which exist on earth , because , from so elevated a point , they are the only ones which their view distinguishes . If they would but descend from their elevation , they would discover an infinite variety of plants and animals , and would soon find themselves forced to reject classifications , which embrace only generalities. - Leon dePhilosophie , T. I. , auatri6me legon , et p. 354. /z/ Whether we admit , one , two , three , four , five , six , or . seven faculties of the soul , we shall see , in the sequel , that the error is always essentially the same , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fac , ulties mentioned , describes either an instinct , a propensity , a talent , nor any other determinate faculty , moral or intellectual . How are we to explain , by sensation in general , by attention , by comparison , by reasoning , by desire by preference , and by freedom , the origin and exercise of the principle of propagation ; that of the love of oflfspring , of the instinct of attachment ? How explain , by all these generalities , the talents for music , for mechanics , for a sense of the relations of space , for painting , poetry , &c.; ? Let us now direct our attention to the language of common society , when the question arises respecting the moral and intellectual character of individuals . I visit a numerous family , limited as much as possible to itself , and all the members of which live under the influence of the same circumstances . I engage the parents in conversation on the qualities of their children . " Our children , " they tell me , " are not alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same father and mother . Yet , they eat at the same table , their occupations are the same . Here is our eldest son , who has always the air of being ashamed of his birth . Ever since he happened to see a coxcomb richly dressed , he despises his companions , and is ever wishing to leave us and to go to some large city : he is never content with the dress of his other brothers ; he even affects to speak and to walk differently from the rest of us . God Imows where he got this ridiculous vanity . Our second son , on the contrary , delights only in his domestic employments ; he is our turner , our joiner , our carpenter ; no trade is difiicult to him ; without ever having been taught , he shows in every thing , an address and a spirit of invention , which astonish us . Here again , is one of our daughters , who could never learn the ordinary operations of needlework ; but , would you believe it , she sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every body in the village ; at church , it is she who leads the choir ; at the sound of music she kindles up at once ; she needs but to hear an air once , or at most , twice , when she knows it by heart , and sings it better than any body else ; she will never be good for any thing but a musician . And here is another boy , a real little devil , the terror of the village ; he quarrels with everybody ; always beating and always beaten ; nothing can break his spirit ; he tells with the greatest avidity , all the news of a combat , or a battle , and looks forward with the greatest impatience to the time , when he can be a soldier . The chase is his passion ; the more animalsjie can kill , the happier he is . He never ceeises to mockhis little sister , who is troubled whenever a chicken or a pig is killed . This little girl is the child that takes charge of the poultry-yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brothers and sisters , but on the domestic animals also . - If we have to destroy a fowl or a rabbit , she has tears in her eyes . No poor man or suflferer goes from her with empty hands , or without consolation . She is exactly the antipodes of another of her sisters , who , notwithstanding her devotion , is backbiting , avaricious , obstinate , and rarely omits an opportunity of making trouble between us , and her other acquaintances . " This is the faithful picture of a family in the country , where the natural characters have not assumed the mask of a deceitful similarity . All these individuals enjoy equally , the faculty of experiencing sensation , of attention , comparison , judgment , desire , will , liberty ; but I have never heard that , in speaking of the character of any one , they made use of either of these expressions , in the abstract or general acceptation , of philosophers . Let us go into a school or house of education , where all the pupils are under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amidst the great majority of ordinary persons , you will find some wretches , who , though often corrected with rigor , and strictly /q/ /z/ watched , endanger the morals and the health of others* You will find some who steal books , who are liars , perfidious , cowards , ungratefiil , idle , insensible to distinction . In the number of those who carry oflf the prizes , one excels in the study of history , another in poetry , a third in mathematics , a fourth in geography , a fifth in drawing , fec . Some are eager for political employments , some for military glory , while others devote themselves in preference to literature , philosophy , or the natural sciences . No instructor will point out to you his pupils by any of the abstractions adopted by the metaphysicians . Thus will it also happen whenyou take a review of a collection of men of genius . You will find there musicians , painters , sculptors , mechanicians , mathematicians , philologists , travellers , actors , poets , orators , generals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no question respecting the understanding , will , comparison , desire , liberty , &c.; What are the qualities , which the biographers of remarkable men commonly celebrate ? Nero was most cruel , and abandoned himself to the most unbridled voluptuousness : Du Guesclin was a desperate warrior ; he would either wound his antagonist , or be wounded himself : Baratier had an astonishing talent for the acquisition of languages ; Pascal , fromthe simple definition of geometry found his way to the thirty-second proposition of Euclid : no science was ever carried by the labors of a single individual to the perfection that geography received from those of captain Cook : Dumenil and Clairon , those celebrated actresses , will long be the models by which our young aspirants will form themselves : Sixtiis V. has rendered his name immortal by the firmness of his government and his inflexible justice : before the culture of the sciences , Homer and Dante were the greatest of poets : Catherine de Medicis gave early proofs of her acuteness and her courage : Catherine II . together-with the graces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taste for knowledge , and for pleasure , profound /q/ ambition , fcc. : the graces guided the chisel of Praxitetes , and his genius gave life to matter . Thus history transmits to us the life of antiquaries , architects , astronomers , dramatists , geographers , historians , mathematicians , musicians , painters , designers , philologists , philosophers , moralists , poets , orators , sculptors , travellers , mechanicians , fec . But we no where find , that a man or a woman has become celebrated by the understanding and the will , by attention , comparison , desire , liberty , fec . Hov , in fine , do we designate the different characters of animals ? We say , this dog is cross , gentle , docile , courageous , affectionate , has good local memory , is a coward , has trained himself to the chase , is incapable of being trained ; this stallion is excellent for the stud ; this horse is skittish ; very quiet ; docile ; very wicked ; stupid ; this cow is an excellent mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she devours her young ; this ram , this buck , are very ardent ; we say that is a carnivorous animal , a graminivorous ; the beaver , the greater part of birds , ants , bees , &c.,; have the instinct of building ; several birds have the instinct of migrating , of singing , of living like sheep in flocks or in society ; the marten , the lox ; , are very cunning , and live in couples ; the chamois and the diver are very circumspect ; the pie is a thief ; the weasel and the tiger are sanguinary ; the cock is valiant and proud , and so on . In what species , or in what individual of animals , would philosophers and physiologists class their understanding , their will , their attention , reasoning , desire , preference , liberty ? Is it right , that , in examining the nature and the origin of the moral and intellectual faculties in man , we should take no account of the same faculties in animals ? Can man , so long as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living nature ? Can he be governed by organic Jaws , opposed to those which preside over the quaJHties and faculties of the horse , the dog , the monkey ? Do animals see , hear , perceive odors , tastes , soundc /z/ objects , otherwise than we do ? Do they propagate , do they love their young , are they courageous , mild , vindictive , cunning , otherwise than man . Is it allowable that philosophers , while boasting to penetrate into the essence of the soul , should treat of man by piecemeal , and confine themselves to making long treatises on the soul , as an insulated being ? exercising its functions by itself , making use of the body , at most , as a means of communication between itself and the world ; when , from the moment of conception to the last sigh , every thing indicates that in this world , the soul is in dependence on the material organs ? With these pretended general faculties of the soul , would not the moral and intellectual character of men and animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such indeterminate operations of the soul , could there constantly result in individuals of the same species , the same instincts , the same inclinations , the same total of determinate intellectued faculties and moral qualities ? " But you will not persuade us , " say my readers , " that the faculties recognized by philosophers as faculties of the soul , are chimeras . Who can contest the principle that understanding and wiU , sensation , attention , comparison , judgment , memory , imagination , desire , liberty , are real operations of the soul ; or , if you will , of the brain ? " Yes , without doubt , these faculties are real ; but they are only abstractions and generalities ; they are not applicable to the detailed study of a species , or an individual . Every man , except an idiot , enjoys all these faculties . Yet all men have not the same intellectual or moral character . We need faculties , the different distribution of which shall determine the different species of animals , and their different proportions of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all have extension , all are impenetrable in a philosophical sense ; but all bodies are not gold or copper , such a plant , or such an animal . Of what use to a naturalist the abstract and /q/ general notions of weight , extent , impenetrability ? By confining ourselves to these abstractions , we should always remain in ignorance of all branches of physics , and natural history . This is precisely what has happened to the philosophers with their generalities . Prom most ancient to the most modern , they have not made a step farther , one than another , in the exact knowledge of the true nature of man , of his inclinations and talents , of the source and motive of his determinations . Hence , there are as many philosophies as pretended philosophers ; hence , that vacillation , that uncertctinty in our institutions , especially in education and criminal legislation . I will not , then , busy myself with the faculties of the soul , as philosophers profess them . We shall see , when the time comes to exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes common to all propensities , and all talents . The different instincts , mechanical aptitudes , inclinations , sentiments , and talents of man and animals , will form the subject of my researches and meditations . The instinct of propagation , that of the love which both man and animals bear to their younff , the instinct of attachment and friendship , of selfidefence and courage , the carnivorous instinct , and the propensity to destruction , the sentiment of property , and the inclination to theft , cunning and prudence , pride and boldness , vanity and ambition , circumspection and foresight , educability , * the sense of localities , or relations of space , the memory * According to Spurzheim , this is eventuality , a much more proper name . " In comparing animals with men , " says Spurzheim , " and one kind of animal wit another , Qall found that tame animals have fuller foreheads than wild ones , and that animals are generally tameable , as the forehead is more largely developed ; he therefore called it the organ of educabilitr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single faculty , manifestations which depend on intellect generally . The title educability , is evidently bad , seeing that every faculty is susceptible of cultivation ; in other words , capable of exercise and direction . /z/ of words and of persons , the sense of spoken language , ot the talent for philology , ttie sense of the rdation of colors , or the talent for painting , the isense of the relation for sounds or the talent forMnusic , Ihe sense of the relations of numbers , or the talent for arithmetic and mathematics , the sense of mechanics , of drawing , of sculpture , of architecture , comparative sagacity , the metaphysical spirit or tendency , the caustic spirit or that of repartee , the talent of induction , the poetic talent , the moral sense and benevolence , or mildness , the talent of imitation , of mimicry or acting ; the sentiment of religion and of God , firmness of character ; these are the qualities and the faculties which I call moral and intellectual dispositions . It is these dispositions , these qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental forces of the soul , the special functions of the brain ; it is these forces which I hold to be innate in man , and , in part , in animals , and the manifestation of which is subordinate to organization ; it is these qualities , and these faculties , the history of whose discovery I shall - exhibit , together with their natural history , their modifications in a sound state , and in the state of aUenation , the seat of their organ in the brain , and its external appearance on the head or skull , fec . All these treatises will be accompanied with an application to human institutions , to education , morals , legislation , medicine , fec . The work will be terminated by considerations on the characteristic forms of the head in each nation , on physiognomy , pathognomony , and pantomime , on the internal sources of imitation in general , and of the imitation of each affection , each sentiment , each passion , in particular ; on universal language , thephilosophy of man , the motives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the different states ; on the perfectibility of the human race , the extent of the sphere of each species , and of each individual , according as they are endowed with organs , more or less numerous , and more or less active . - - /q/ As this first volume will be particularly deroted to the moral part of the ph5rsiology of the brain , and as the ignorant and malicious reproach the doctrine with immoral and irreligious tendency , I have thought it my duty to refute these objections , and to give assurance to those of timid minds . Before entering directly into the discussion of my pnnciples , it will be useful to remove an unfavorable impression , which my manner of proceeding in the exposition of my proofs , might produce on a certain class of readers , little accustomed to the study of natural history I often institute comparisons between men and aninaals : Is this comparison appropriate ; is it even necessary ? I am going to answer these two questions . Is it permitted , is it even necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete knowledge of his nature , moral and intellectual ? Those who make the moral and intellectual acts of men to flow from the understanding and will , independent of the body , and those who , being wholly strangers to Ratural science , still believe in the mechanical action , in the automatism of brutes , may esteem the comparison of man with animals , revolting , and absolutely futile . But this comparison will be judged indispensable by those , who are familiarized with the works of Bonnet , Condillac , Reimarus , Georges Leroy , Dupont de Nemours , Herder , Cadet Devau , Hubef , Virey , and especially by those who are ever so little initiated in the progress of comparative anatomy and physiology . Man is subject , as we have seen , to the same laws which govern plants and animals . The knowledge of man , supposes the knowledge of the elements of which he is composed , as the knowledge of the mechanism of a clock supposes that of the wheels , levers , spring , weights , balance , movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain of man , is an assemblage of particular organs , many of which are found in animals . The animals of inferior classes have , by the fact of their inferiority to others on the score of intelligence , fewer cerebral organs ; they have only the first rudiments of the human brain , and they are , consequently , easier to decipher than those animals which are provided with a more complex brain , and a more complicate animal life , or with more numerous instincts and talents . It naturally follows , that in order to attain the knowledge of man in all the parts which constitute his brain , all his propensities and talents , it is necessary to study the animals one after another , following the gradual march which nature has observed , in the succession of their cerebral organs , and faculties . This study opens to the philosophical observer , a field infinitely more vast than is supposed . The brutes , the objects of all the contempt resulting from the ignorance and pride of man , share so many things with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where animal life terminates , and humanity commences . Animals are produced , born , and nourished , according to the same laws as man ; their muscles , vessels , viscera , and nerves , are almost the same , and exercise the same functions ; they are endowed with the same senses , of which they make use in the same manner ; they are subject to similar affections , to joy , sadness , fear , alarm , hope , envy , jealousy , anger ; they have the most part of our propensities ; they are naturally inclined , as we are , to propagation ; they love and foster their young ; they have attachment for each other and for man ; they are courageous , and fearlessly defend themselves and theirs against their enemies ; like us they feed on vegetables and on other animals ; they have the sense of property , and while some are cruel and sanguinary , others take delight in theft ; they are sensible to blame and to approbation ; they are mild , docile , compassionate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indocile , way ward , ' obstinate ; they retain the recollection of benefits an.d injuries , are grateful or vindictive ; they are cunning and circumspect , - they foresee the future by the past , and take the necessary precaution against the dangers which menace them ; they correct their false judgments and their unsuccessful enterprises by experience ; they have the idea of time , and foresee its periodical return ; they have memory ; they reflect and compare ; they hesitate and are decided by the most urgent motives ; they are susceptible of a certain degree of individual perfectibility ; they even form abstractions ; by means of articulate language , or by gestures , they conmiunicate their ideas , their wants , their projects ; they acquire more sagacity and knowledge , by virtue of the circumstances which force them to be more clear-sighted and more cautious ; they balance the evil consequences of certain actions which their memory recals to them , with actually stimulating desires ; they are seen to follow a deliberate plan of conduct agreed upon between several individuals ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the harmony of music ; they have an astonishing local memory , and perform long journeys ; a great number among them build ; some even count ; very often their actions denote a sentiment of morality , of justice , and injustice , &c.; One might almost be tempted to say , with Lactantius , that except the religious sentiment , and the knowledge of God , there is no moral quality , and no intellectual faculty of which the animal kingdom , as a whole , does not share at least therst germs . Should it be thought that this comparison degrades man , I should answer with Pascal , * that if it be dangerous to show man too much , in how many respects he resembles the brutes , without pointing out his greatness , or , to let him see his greatness too much without his baseness , it is still more /z/ danfferous to leave him in ignorance of both . We shall not recognize the less , in this work , the distinguished place which the Author of nature has assigned to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves , his superiority , without having recourse to distinctions which experience and natural history disavow . The real detractors of the human species are those , who think they must deny the intelligence of animals , to maintain the dignity of man . St. Gregory of Nyssus , * and St. Augustinet long since remarked the necessity of comparing men with animals . I come , then , at length upon the question . What is the origin of the instincts , mechanical aptitudes , propensi-ties , talents ; in a word , the moral qualities and intellectual faculties of man ? /z/ SECTION It . /z/ It is impossible to treat with propriety of the moral and intellectual faculties of man , without having a just idea of their origin . Philosophers-have always regarded the following questions as the most important to be treated of in the philosophy of man . Is man born without determinate faculties , a tabula rasa , a blank leaf , entirely indifferent ? Does he bring into the world with him , the dispositions , which he manifests at a later period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relations with the external world ? To what extent are the impressions , made on the senses , the source of his sensations and ideas ? What is the origin of moral good and evil ? Is man born entirely good , or entirely wicked , or , with a mixture of contrary dispositions ? Are all men endowed , to the same degree , with the qualities essential to their nature , or , are the differences observed in this respect , due to the influence of accidental causes posterior to birth ? Are these differences , on the contrary , determined in the womb of the mother ? And if they are innate , how are we to cultivate , to perfect them , to repress or to direct them , according to the demand of individual or general good ? These questions , when they are resolved , will infallibly lead to the knowledge of the true sources of our propensities and our faculties , and , consequently , the prime motives of our actions . They therefore merit the most serious attention on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers , and physicians . The importance of these questions having been generally recognized , it will be impossible to avoid , in this work , the recurrence of some ideas which are found insulated in other authors , such as Bonnet , Georges Leroy , Reimarus , Herder , Cabanis , fcc . But , on this subject , so vast and so worthy of our meditations , we have , as yet , had only scanty materials ; we have wanted sufficient data ; those , which we seemed to have , were too cont ? adictory , to deduce from them the sure principles , Which should serve as the basis for a complete and consistent doctrine . I shall support each of my propositions with such a number of positive facts , that they will not at all present simple opinions , but will have the character of remarkable truths , which , at all times , will be able to stand the test of experience , and , consequently , will be of permanent utility . The mechanical aptitvdes , instincts propensities talents in general the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate . After having clearly indicated , in the preceding pages , the faculties which form the object of my researches , the reader can not any longer confound what I understand by dispositions , and by innate faculties , with the expressions , ideas , innate notions , and innate principles . Thus it will be superfluous to fatigue him with metaphysical discussions of the hypotheses of Plato , Aristotle , Pyrrho , Zeno , Descartes , Leibnitz , Malebranche , Bacon , Locke , Condillac , Buffon , Helvetius , &c.,; on the origin of the faculties of the soul and mind , and on the origin of ideas . It will be seen , also , that I am far from understanding with M. Laromiguiere , by dispositions and innate faculties , a simple ' passive capacity , such as that of a block of marble , which submits itself to the caprice of the . sculptor , according as he wishes to make of it a Satyr /q/ or an Apollo . I understand by innate dispositions , mechanical aptitudes , determinate instincts and propensities , determinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove in the following volumes , that each cerebral organ is impressed with a determinate tendency ; that each organ enjoys an internal perception , a force , a faculty , an impulse , a propensity , a feeling , peculiar to itself Here , there is no vague and uncertain result either of an exterior influence , or of an interior abstraction . As soon as the relative organs have acquired their perfect development and entire activity , the functions which result , are as determinate as the dispositions themselves , of which these organs are the depositaries . " Do not believe , " says M. Iiaromiguier.e , " that it is necessary to recognize and register as many faculties or capacities , as we remark acts or modifications of the human mind . In place of enriching the science , this would be to annihilate it . What would be thought of an anatomist , who , having observed that the fibre of the eyes which produces red , is not the fibre which causes blue ; or , that the fibre of the ear which gives one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should see in this observation the greatest of discoveries ? You have believed , till now , he would tell us , that you are reduced to the small number of five senses . I am going to teach you that nature has been more liberal to yoii . How many organs of sight has she given you ? I see in the first place , seven principal ones , destined for the seven primitive colors . " As M. Laromiguiere admits only three intellectual , , and three moral faculties , he alludes in this plaice to the fundamental faculties , of which I already recognize from twenty-seven to thirty , and which he would qualijfy as simple modifications of his six faculties . It is certainly not necessary , nor- allowable , to admit as many particular fundamental dispositions , as we can remark acts or modifications in the human mind . Yet , it may be maintained , that the example taken fi:om the eyes and ears , is singularly inconclusive . Bonnet be- - /q/ /z/ lieves , and it seems very probable , that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each fibre of a nervous organ modifies the action of this oran . Why , otherwise , should nature have created it ? The modifications of the functions of the senses explain themselves , in this view , in a sufficient manner ; and we can conceive , why certain persons are incapable of perceiving certain colors , or certain sounds , while they perceive others very distinctly ; why such a man finds very agreeable , what shocks the taste of another ; why the same senses in different species of animals , and even in different individuals , are susceptible of flavdrs , odors , &c.,; of a nature altogether different , and so on . A more extended development of the same conjecture , might dispose the reader to consider each nervous fibril , whether in the nerves , or in the brain , as a little peculiar organ , destined to a small part of the total function . But the question is not respecting the modifications of the functions ; it relates to functions and dispositions essentially different . All the modifications of vision are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same manner as all the modifications of digestion , and of the seminal secretion belong to their organs : but who will dare to say that sight , hearing , taste , smell , touch , the seminal secretion , and digestion , are simple modifications of the same function ? Who will venture to make them depend on one single source , one single organ ? In the same manner the mechanical aptitudes , instincts , propensities and talents , which I recognize asfimdamental or primitive forces , manifest themselves under thousands of modifications ; but every thing is opposed to our regarding the instinct of propagation , that of the love of progeny , the carnivorous instinct , the talent for music , poetry , calculation , the feeling of justice and injustice , &c.,; as simple modifications of a single faculty . Thus , as it is necessary to admit five different external senses , since their functions are not simply modified or transformed sensations , but functions essentially different and belonging to distinct organic apparatuses , so /q/ is it finally necessary to recognize the various industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications of desire , preference , liberty , attention , comparison , and reasoning , but as forces essentially different , belonging , as well as the five senses , to organic apparatuses , peculiar and independent of each other . " The innateness of the fundamental forces ; moral and intellectual , is the basis of the physiology of the brain ; for , if in place of being able to demonstrate that they are innate , we could prove that they are only the accidental product of external things , and external senses , it would be useless to seek their origin and seat in the brain . To give an extended demonstration of . this first principle , I shall first throw a rapid glance upon inanimate nature . I shall then continue to compare man with animals , when any points of analogy appear between them . It is to Philo ludaeus that we owe the doctrine , that nothing can subsist without certain properties . It is only the metaphysical theologians , that have embraced the error , that all activity and all action is owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence of matter . The weight of earths and metals , their attractive and repulsive forces , the laws of their forms , their affinities , their antipathies for other substances , &c.,; are properties which result from the mixture , form , and proportion of the integrant particles of these bodies , and which are so intimately identified with them , that the extinction of these properties necessarily involves the dissolution of the bodies : take away the properties of any substance whatever , and the idea of its existence disappears . It is the same with the nidus formativus , or the plastic soul , which the ancients admitted in the vegetable kingdom* The laws , by which the fructification of plants is produced , according to which their germ is formed , developed , and finally acquires its whole increase , their specific irritability , peculiar relations to each other , and to other beings , are properties essentiallj inherent in their nature . If we thence pass to animals , and reflect on th m /z/ stincts , on the mechanical aptitudes , which they manifest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that these instincts , these mechanical aptitudes , are innate . The spider , when hardly hatched , weaves his web ; the youngest ant-lion digs his conical hole in the sand ; the bee , before going for the first time into the fields , raises himself into the air , and turns to reconnoitre the position of his abode ; the young quail and the young partridge , from the moment they quit the egg , run with admirable address in pursuit of insects and seeds ; the duckling , and the tortoise , still dragging the remains of the egg from which they have just emerged , make their way to the nearest water ; the new-born infant seeks its mother 's breast , and presses it with its hand to force from it the nutritious fluid ; it seizes and sucks the nipple , as the young dog and the calf do the udder ; the calf alternately draws and repulses the teat ; the puppy presses by springing the udder of its dam , &c.; AU these beings act thus , not because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because nature meets their wants , and has united the knowledge of them intimately with their organization . In all these cases , there are no previous habits , no instruction , no experience . When , still later we see the insects in their metamorphoses , weave themselves an envelope ; when we see the bee , at his first coming out , seek the willow and the strawberry , construct hexagonal cells , as the bird builds his nest , and the beaver , his hut ; when we see the bird bruise the worm with his beak ; and the monkey cut with his teeth , the head of the coleoptera , ( the beetle , ) before devouring him ; the hamster lay up provisions ; the dog conceal his superfluous food ; the squirrel open the nut at the pointed extremity , and detach the scales of the cone of the savin at the base ; the hog devour , with avidity , the first acorn he finds ; the goat throw himself on the cytisus which he meets for the first time ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the /q/ boar ; the ferret , though brought up on milk and in a cask , becomes furious at the m*st sight of a rabbit ; and the rabbit , who likewise at the first glance recognizes in this animal his natural enemy ;  --  we must allow that all these actions show us the result of instincts given to these individuals , and without which , they would ere long disappear from the face of the earth . The conduct of animals in these circumstances , requires neither a previous examination by the senses , nor an innate idea of the object of their appetites , nor a comparison and choice among several objects . How should they have an idea of that , which they have never in any manner experienced ? In the same way as a dish at the first impression , pleases or disgusts us ; so animals and children choose or reject the objects of the external world , according to the laws of sympathy and antipathy which exist between these same objects , their nutritive organs , and their senses . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men term afi ' ctions . Satisfaction and discontent , pleasure and pain , joy and sorrow , desire , chagrin , fear , shame , jealousy , anger , etc. , are so many states of our internal organization , which the animal and the man do not determine , but which both feel before having thought of them . These sentiments spring from the natural disposition of the animal and the man , without any concurrence of their will ; and they are as decided , as strong , as vivid , the first time , as after having been often repeated . All which passes on this occasion , is an arrangement produced by nature , and calculated with reference to the external world , for the preservation of the animal and the man , without any consciousness , reflection , or active participation , on the part of the individual . The animal and the man are organized for anger , hatred , grief , fear , jealousy , etc. ; because there are objects and events , which , from their nature , must be detested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason , that the different states of the soul and its various aiStions , when they have a certain /z/ 103 PfiTStOLOOY OF THfi RAtHf , dree of intensity , are accompanied with peculiar external acts , such as gestures , movements , attitudes , which , likewise , take place involuntarily and without consciousness , but which always correspond , agreeably to the design of nature , to the preservation and the wants of the individual . The Umbs are drawn backwards , when one is threatened by a dangerous object , though there has been no time to think of the danger , and of the means of escaping it . Do we see an object on the point of crushing us , and which we can not avoid , we bend the back before thinking of the resistance we offer in taking this position . The infant who is still ignorant of the existence of its mother , and of the cares which she takes of it , cries when it is hungry , or when it experiences any necessity . Puppies , though destitute of hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not knowing that their cries are heard , still cry , and thus succeed in bringing their dam to their assistance . It is the same with the affections of the adult being . The expression and the gestures which accompany these affections , have been calculated to refer themselves , either solely to external objects , or to analogous beings , which surround the animal or the man , and to produce a reaction which tends to preserve them . Neither man nor the animal takes any other part in this , than to obey the natural impulse which results from their organization . When man begins to exercise his faculties with a distinct feeling of consciousness , of personal co-operation and will , each one is inclined to imagine that he produces these faculties himself . Yet , if we first confine ourselves to considering the qualities common to the animal and to man , the comparison established between them does not permit us to doubt , that these faculties are innate . Now we find in animals a number of propensities common to them with man ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care of parents for their offspring , of attachment , of mutual assistance , of sociability and the conjugal union ; the propensity to /q/ peace and war , that to mildness and cruelty ; of the pleasure found in being flattered ; of the forgetfiilness and the recollection of ill treatment ; we can not therefore imane , that in man and in animals , these qualities wholly similar , should have a different origfin . Let US ' admit , that these qualities are ennobled in man ; that the animal desire of propagating the species , is transformed in man to moral love ; that the love of the females of animals , for their offspring becomes , in women , the amiable virtue which inspires their tenderness for their children ; that the attachment of animals changes in man to friendship ; their sensibility to caresses , into ambition and a sentiment of honor ; that , from the song of the nightingale , there results in man the art of music ; from the nest of the bird and the hut of the beaver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the gradual improvement of the organization affords a measure to the elevation of these faculties , and that the employment and direction of these , acquire more dignity in proportion as more elevated faculties join themselves to the first . Man consequently presents in all this only modified phenomena , and it is doing violence to reason , to place him out of the domain of nature , and to subject him to laws essentially different from those , to which the primitive faculties , common to man and animals , are subjected . If , in fine , man has faculties which essentially distinguish him from the animal , and which give to him the peculiar character of humanity , he also offers in his brain , especially the superior and anterior portions , parts which animals have not ; and the difference of effects is thus found to be explained by the difference of causes . All anatomists and physiologists agree , that the faculties augment in animals , in proportion as their brain becomes more compounded and more perfect . Why should man alone form an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man a beinff , who compares different ideas and notions , who searches into the causes of phenomena , who deduces consequences ; who estabUshes /z/ general laws and rules ; if we see him measure the revolutions of worlds , their duration and their intervals , traverse the whole surfece of the ocean , estimate the merit and demerit of actions , bear within him a judge to which he is subjected , dictate laws for himself and for his fellow-men , in fine , xalt himself to the knowledge and adoration of a God , let us beware of thinking that these faculties are the work of his invention , or that of the accidental action of the external world . This would be to suppose that the Creator has abandoned man to himself , in matters the most important , or , that he has made his perfectibility depend on simple accident . No ; in this as in other respects , God has traced for him the circle in which he must act , and has directed his steps . It is for this reason that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same essential qualities of which he could not have conceived the idea , without the predetermination of the Creator . Every where this plan of nature makes itself known by signs so evident , that it is impossible to call it in question . " We see , " says Herder , * " that from the stone to the cryTstal , from the crystal to the metal , from this to the plant , from the plant to animals , and from them to man , the forms of the organization still go on improving ; that the faculties and inclinations of beings augment in number in the same proportion , and end by finding themselves united in the organization of man so far as this can include them . This analogy , however , is not sufficient ; it is easy to recognize in man organs of more elevated faculties ; we may indeed demonstrate their existence . Thus it is impossible not to admit , that the fimdamental dispositions of the properties of animals and of man , are innate , and that the activity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - L. c . Th. i. s. 265. /q/ jExposition and refutation of the different opinions on the origin of instinctive forces , moral and intellectual , in man and animals . The anatomical and physiological knowledge of the brain , even to our times has been so defective , that no relation could be developed between it and the ingenious aptitudes , the instincts , propensities , sentiments , talents , or , in general , the moral and intellectual faculties of man and animals . Hence it bas happened , that the anatomists and physiologists , themselves have presented to the metaphysical philosophers , as so many positive facts , fictitious phenomena , which these last have employed in order to give weight to their false doctrines . Buffon advanced that the brain of the orang-outang " does not differ from that of man ; Bichat and Sprengd doubt whether the superior parts of the brain or the circumvolutions of the hemispheres , contribute in any respect to the moral and intellectual functions : these two authors and their followers , go so far as to maintain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties being impaired . We still hear of brains ossified , and even petrified ; of brains , the half of which , was reduced to pus ; of skulls , the whole cavity of which contained only water ,  --  and it is added , with full confidence , that the will and intellect did not suffer . Willis having found in an idiot a brain five times smaller than that of a man of sound mind , pretended to say , and Sprengel has repeated it after him , that this brain had the same parts as a complete human brain . Even authors who pretend to have made a particular study of comparative anatomy , have yet recently advanced that the brain of mammiferous animals is composed of the same parts as that of man . The specious hypotheses , originated and diffused by philosophers of the first order , on the influence which the senses and education exercise on the source of ideas and faculties , must , necessarily , have contributed to /z/ facilitate the adoption of these errors , and to turn away the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual forces . Let us first examine what the influence of the senses can be on our moral and intellectual powers , whether Aristotle was correct in saying , * Nihil est in mente quod non olim fiierit in sensu . ' The senses and the sensations , received hy external impressions , can not give truth to any ingenious aptitude , any instinct , propensity , sentiment , or talent , any moral or intellectual faculty . In the first volume of my large work I have considered , not only the anatomy , but also the functions of the five senses . I have assigned to each sense the sphere of activity , which nature has allotted to it . I have rectified the numerous errors which naturalists and physiologists still commit in their works , and in their lectures . I have proved , in opposition to those who make the perfection of the intellectual faculties to flow from the delicacy and the greater perfection of the senses , that these five senses are almost all more delicate , more perfect in the different species of animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the details of each sense . As respects taste , for example , I have proved that birds and fishes possess it , as well as the mammifera . As to smell , I have shown that it is the first sense which gives to man and to animals the idea of distance ; that it is not by the sense of smell , that animals find from a distance and after a great lapse of time the place of their abode ; and that the carnivorous animals have not this sense more acute than the graminivorous . As for hearing , I have demonstrated , that we have hitherto been mistaken in attributing to this the talent for music , and to the glottis the talent for singing ; that It is not the hearing , which gives the capacity for Ianuage /q/ ; that the languages , however imperfect or perfect they may be , are not the creation oi the hearing , but of the cerebral organization ; that the irresistiUe and lawless acts of certain deaf and dumb persons should not be attributed to their want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.; I have rendered to the sight its just rights , of which the philosophers had deprived it . I have proved that the eye , without the aid of any other sense , and without previous exercise or instruction , can perceive , not only the impressions of light and colors , but likewise those of forms , size , direction , number , and distance of objects . I have established , that the eye is not the organ of the talent of painting , and I have seized the occasion to show the great difference , which exists between the passive functions of our organs and their cu:tive functions . I have also demonstrated that man and animals fix objects , see , and look actively , with one eye only . What I have rendered to sight I have taken from touch . This sense is not , as most authors regard it , the only mediator , the director , the reformer , or rectifier of the other senses ; and its degrees of perfection have no influence on the intelligence and perfectibiUty of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these objects to my large work . Here I shall confine myself to extracting what concerns the five senses , under their physiological and philosophical relation . We caU external senses the nervous systems , which , besides their internal action , receive , by means of external apparatuses , the impressions of the exterior world , and produce in the brain the sensations and ideas of these impressions . Consequently , these systems reveal to the living being the objects , which exist out of himself ; with each sense the animal discovers a new world ; thus the creation grows larger or smaller for him , according as he is endowed with senses , more or less numerous or perfect . Without the senses , animals and man would remain shut /z/ up in themselves , ctnd all their consciousness would be limited to their internal life . But , provided with senses , they enter into communication with the immensity of nature ; associate with all the beings which surround them , and a continual action and reaction are established between animate and inanimate beings . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he owes so many sensations , so many enjoyments ? Thus have they always been the object of his most assiduous researches . Yet , who would believe it ? Not only has he remained behind in the knowledge of their interior organic functure , as I have proved in my anatomical description , but farther , he has not been able to agree with himself in their peculiar functions , and the influence which they exercise in the development of our minds . On this point , the most extravagant , the most vague , and the most irreconcileable opinions , exist . It is true some errors have been corrected , from time to time , but no author has yet established principles , which , in a physical and physiological view , have offered a system carried out and complete . Sometimes it is said , that we can not , without the aid of the senses , receive any idea ; all our knowledge , all the faculties of our minds and our souls are the work of the external world ; and sometimes , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be excited without the mediation of the senses . In both cases , the perfection of the intellectual faculties of man , of the different species of animals , and of the individuals , is regarded as a result of the perfection and harmony of their senses . Sometimes , again , the senses are only instruments , and the mind , freely and independently of all organization , modifies the impressions which are transmitted to it ; sometimes there is admitted an external and internal source of our sensations and ideas , and they are both more or less subjected to the laws of organization . We continually hear complaints repeated against the illusion of the senses . Finally , some reject absolutely , the evidence of the senses and all judgment /q/ which is based upon it ; the external world then becomes the deceitful image of our internal ; the sensible world is rejected , as the least worthy object of the research of man , and it is only , when the philosopher has learned to construct from himself the external world , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths . If this last proposition be true , there is no need of our collecting such numerous facts , in order , by degrees , to deduce from them laws and principles . In a short time the spring of our own imagination will raise us to a rank higher than that , to which the longest and most active life would enable us to attain , by the path of meditation and of experience . But , if we receive our ideas and all our knowledge solely from the senses , then man and animals are the perpetual sport of external fortuitous and versatile objects ; the measure of the faculties has no other basis than the perfection of the senses ; and education , the end of which ought to be to render individuals and nations what it is desirable they should be , has no other secret than that of duly calculating the action of the external world on the senses . If the material conditions of the faculties of the soul and mind are bounded to the mere organs of the senses , it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the organs of the highest faculties . If we must seek , without any reserve , the principle of all the actions of men and animals , in their internal and innate nature , and if , in consequence , we have not sufficient regard to the influence of surrounding objects and social institutions , we are in manifest contradiction with the history of all ages and all individuals . If , in fine , we admit that the senses procure numerous materials , that the mind works by means of the most noble implements , and if we can establish that the internal man himself is endowed with a number of dispositions , we must seek for our ideas and our knowledge , partly in the phenomena of the external world , and their judicious employment , and partly in the innate laws of the moral and intellectual /q/ /z/ faculties : by pursuing these two rules we shall arrive at practical and general truths . We can not , then , under any point of view , regard , as an idle enterprise the efforts of the physiologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senses extend their influence , , mediate and immediate , on the functions of a superior order . In order to be able to deduce surer principles and more general consequences , I have laid down in my treatise on the functions of the senses , ( vol. i. 4to ed. p. 149 , etc. ) what belongs , and what does not belong , to each sense in particular . In treating of the organs of the relations of space , colors , and sounds , I shall again prove , that those have been wrong , who have attributed , the faculty of finding one 's way home from a distance to the sense of smell ; that of the talent for painting to the eyes ; that of music and language , to the hearing . Accordingly I shall say no more on this subject in this place . But almost all philosophers and naturalists have so very greatly exaggerated the merit of the sense of touch , that I deem it necessary to repeat here , what I have said on this point in my treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In treating this subject , I regret to have more to refute and correct , than to establish ; but the surest means of approaching the truth , is to remove errors and prejudices . Before speaking of the touch , properly so called , I must say something of sensation in general . It is certain that a great number of erroneous opinions on the touch have arisen and are maintained , solely because the difference has never been accurately established between the idea of perception , sensation , and that of touch , tact . The faculty of awakening perceptions or sensation is common to the whole nervous system . To perceive PUYSIOLOGY OP THE BRAIN . Ill and to feel are phenomena which we observe first and most generally in all beings endowed with the faculty of consciousness . Whatever alteration may have taken place in their interior or exterior , becomes necessarily a sensation , as soon as the animal has any consciousness of - it . To taste , feel , see , hear , and touch , are sensations ; but we likewise feel pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by internal causes ; we feel hunger , thirst , the calls of nature ; we feel joy and sadness , hatred and love , humility and pride , hope and despair , desire , anguish , fear , terror , &c.; : the acts of our intellectual faculties , thinking , desiring , and wishing , are likewise sensations . It follows , that to feel or perceive , is a function common to all the particular functions of the nervous system ; it is properly and solely the general sense , without which no being can be conscious of his own existence , or the existence of external objects . It is only in this acceptation that it is said , with truth , that the origin of all our knowledge is in sensation . But when , by sensation , we understand only the impression of the external world on the senses , as most authors do , we neglect wholly the interior man and animals , and forget that the exterior world is known only so far as our interior has the faculty of perceiving it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of numerous sensations and ideas , by which each being preserves his individuality , consciousness and peculiar nature , though all are equally surrounded by the same objects . Prochaska had already called the attention of modern physiologists to the interior sensations . Tracy more recently has done the same . Cabanis has made one step farther , by adopting instinctive tendencies . Still , most of these authors have remained behind , on these subjects , as the following remarks on the sense of touch vill prove . I have shown , in my treatise on the functions of the senses , ( large work , vol. i. ) to what extent the senses must produce the ideas of external things : I have shown to what extent the ear and the eye give an exact idea of /z/ space , form , number , figure , and the position of a body : I have demonstrated that the education or cultivation of the touch answers no purpose ; that the eye sees according to its proper laws , the relations of objects which have just been enunciated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having created senses , the functions of which would be possible , only by the aid of another sense entirely different . In this manner , I have already greatly diminished the prerogatives , which were formerly attributed to the sense of touch . But I have not yet spoken of the opinions which particularly concern this sense . Most authors regard it as the sole mediator , director , and reformer of the otlier senses . Without it , say they , there would be no external world ; for , " as our perceptions , " says Condillac , * " are not the qualities of objects themselves , but , on the contrary , areonly modifications of our soul ; it is consequently easy to conclude , that a man limited to the sense of smell would have had nothing but odor ; to that of taste , flavor ; to that of hearing , only noise or sound ; to sight , only light and color . Then the greatest difficulty would be , to imagine how we contract the habit of referring to external nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems very astonishing that with senses , which experience nothing except in themselves , and which have no means of realizing external space , men can refer their sensations to the objects which occasion them . How can sensations be extended beyond the organ , which experiences and limits it ? " But , in considering the properties of touch , it miht have been perceived , that it is capable of discovermg this space , and of teaching the other senses . to refer their sensations to the bodies which occupy it . " " The sensation of touch , " says I ) egerando , t " merit , from the philosopher , peculiar attention . They are the first which afiect the individual ; and if , before having /z/ - Traits des som sensation . Lond. 1754 . Vol . I. p. 119. t Degerando des signes as de T art de penser , vol I. p. 12. /q/ received the instruction pf touch , the individual should hear a sound , or find himself affected by an odor , he would perceive nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of referring it to a foreign cause , nor regarding it as a modification of one , whatever philosophers may say . For , in the first place , there is nothing in these sensations fitted to inform him of an object foreign to himself ; and so long as a man knows nothing foreign to himself , how should he be led to notice self ? " fson moi. ) * " A man deprived oi touch , " says Dumas , with Lecat , " would have no sensation , but what he would consider as confined to his own person , and would be absolutely incapable of distinguishing whatever was concerned in producing it . But , with the faculty of touch , he can put objects in their places , determine the extent of space which he occupies , and ascertain the distance which separates him from each . " If touch makes us know the external world better than the other senses , for the sole reason that it finds bounds and resistance to its action , I will inquire whether the eye doesnot also meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphysical subtilties on the existence and non-existence of external things , then touch , resistance , repulsion , will not instruct us better than any other sensation ; for , just as all other sensations have their seat solely in the brain , so the sense of touch , resistance , repulsion , has its seat only in the brain . No one has yet placed these sensations in external objects ; and , consequently , the pretended illusion may as well take place in the touch as in any other sense . We must , then , admit with Locke , t that the ideas " which enter the mind by more than one sense , are those of extent or space , figure , motion , and rest ; " and 1 conclude with Tracy , t that ** the sensations pertaining to touch . /z/ have not , in themselves/ any essential prerogative by nature which distinguishes them from all others . Whether a body affects the nerves cpncealed under the skin of my hand , or , whether it produces certain agitations of those spread over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a pure impression which I receive , a simple affection which I experience ; and there seems no reason to believe , that one is more instinctive than the other ; that one is more fitted than the other to lead me to the conclusion , that it comes from a being foreign to myself . Why should the simple sensation of a puncture , of a burn , of tickling , of pressure , give me more knowledge of the cause which produces it , than that of a color , of a sound , or of internal pain ? There is no reason for thinking so . " If philosophers , who , with Condillac , have reduced man to the state of a statue , had had the prudence to form this statue after the model of man , and to make it out like him , they would have presented principles wholly different with regard to the functions and the influence of the senses . I might , for esample , remind them , that man and animals are accustomed to transfer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to regard it as an accident of the world without them . A blur on the eye produces the impression of surrounding flames ; the flow of blood to the ear , make us imagine that we hear the sound of bells ; the sick man wishes removed from him the imaginary fly which he has before his eyes , the odor which oflTends his nose , and the ice-cold corpse , which lies at his side ; in our dreams , we eat the most delicious viands ; we walk in delicious gardens , bathe in tepid waters , fly in the air ; the coward is in the hands of robbers ; the gamester draws his prize from the wheel of fortune ; the tender mother throws herself into the flames to save her child . Has not the illusion of the senses invented apparitions , visions , spirits , and wizards ? The madman hears the celestial choirs ; he fears the devil who follows him with eager step ; he attacks whole legions ; /q/ dies an hundred times on the wheel for imaginary crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carefully repulses every thing which approaches him , in order not to endanger his nose of many yards injength , which he is forced to drag along the ground . Ought we not infer , from all these phenomena , that the nature of man is rather inclined to expand into a world , exterior to its own creation , than to transport to , and concentrate , in itself , the real external world , and in this manner to excuse , in some sort , the reveries of the idealists . Philosophers have not stopped at the period of attributing exclusively to the touch , the knowledge of the external world . Condillac derives from touch , as from every other sense , attention , memory , judgment , imagination . He makes of it the corrector of all the other senses , the source of curiosity , of abstract ideas , and of all desires and passions . But he has invented so romantic a fable in relation to pain and pleasure , which he presents as the only motives of all the actions of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Ackerman* thinks , that the touch represents impressions in more distinct series ; he regards it as the corrector of the other senses . According to him , the imperfect hand of animals is concealed in the nails or in the hoofs of the fore feet , so that they want this sense , the slowest in truth , but likewise the most sure . Buflfon t says ,  --  It is by the touch alone , that we can gain complete and real knowledge : it is this sense which rectifies all the others , whose effects would be only illusions , and produce nothing but error in our minds , if touch did not teach us to judge . This naturalist is so much prejudiced in favor of the advantages which result to us from touch , that , while speaking of the custom of swathing the arms of infants , /z/ he expresses himself thus : * One man has , perhaps , more mind than another , only in consequence of having made , from his early childhood , a greater and prompter use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child the free use of its hands from the moment of its - birth . " Those animals , " says he , elsewhere , t " which have hands , appear to be the most intelligent ; monkeys do things so similar to the mechanical actions of men , that they would seem to have the same series of bodily . sensations for their cause . All the other animals that have not the use of this organ , can have no very distinct acquaintance with the form of things . We may , also , conjecture that animals , which ; like the cuttle fish , polypi , and other insects , have a great number of arms or claws , which they can unite and join , and with which they can seize foreign bodies in different places  --  that these animals , I say , have an advantage over others , and know and choose much better the things suitable for them ; and that , if the hand were divided into an infinity of parts , all equally sensible and flexible , such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A single organ , " says Bonnet in his Palingenesia , t " may have been constructed with such art , as alone to give to the animal a great number of ideas , to diversify them greatly , and to associate them strongly together . It may even associate them with so much more force and advantage , as the fibres , which are to be the seat of it , find themselves more strongly united in a single organ . " The trunk of the elephant is a beautiful example , which will admirably illustrate my position . It is to this single instrument , that this noble animal owes his superiority over all other animals ; it is by the possession of it , that he seems to hold the middle place between man and brute . What pencil could express all the wonders L. c. p. 86. tL. c. p. 82 . X P. 129. /q/ effected by this sort of universal instrument , better than that of Nature 's painter ? " This frwnA : , " says he , * " composed of membranes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , a member capable of movement , and an organ of sentiment . The elephant can lengthen , shorten , bend , and turn it in every direction . The extremity is terminated by an appendage of the form of a finger : it is by means of this kind of finger , that the elephant does every thing which we do with our fingers ; he picks up from the ground the smallest coins ; he gathers herbs and flowers , choosing them one by one ; he unties knots , opens and shuts doors by turning the keys , and pushing the bolts ; he even learns to trace regular characters , with an instrument as small as a pen . " In the middle of this finger-shaped appendage , is a concavity , at the bottom of which are found the common conduits of smell and respiration . The elephant has , therefore , his nose in his hands , and has the advantage of joining the power of his lungs to the action of his fingers , of drawing up liquids by a strong suction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by applying to their surface the extremity of his trunk , and forming a vacuum by a strong inspiration . " Delicacy of touch , acuteness of smell , facility of motion , and power of suction , are found then at the extremity of the elephant 's nose . Of all the instruments with which nature has so liberally endowed her favored children , the trunk is , perhaps , the most complete and the most admirable : it is not only an organic instrument , but a triple sense , whose united and combined functions are , at the same time , the cause , and produce the effects of that intelligence and those faculties , which distinguish the elephant and elevate him above all other animals . He is less subject than any other animal to the errors of the sense of sight , because he promptly rectifies M. de Buffon Hist . Nat. , T. 11. p. 51. et suiv. de V edit . 4to  --  /z/ them by that of touch , and because , making use of his trunk , ' as a long arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uke us , real ideas of distance by this means . " The eloquent historian of the elephant , next unites in a single view the various services , which this great animal derives from his trunk . " The touch , " says he , " is that of all the senses which has the most relation to knowledge ; the delicacy of the touch gives the idea of the substance of bodies ; the flexibility in the parts of this organ gives the idea of their external form ; the power of suction , that of their weight ; the smell , that of their qualities ; and the length of the arm or trunk , that of their distance : thus , by a sole and a single member , and , to use the expression , by a single and simultaneous act , the elephant feels , perceives , and judges of several things at once ; now a multiplied sensation is equivalent , in some sort , to reflection ; therefore , though this animal be , like all others , deprived of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thie organ itself , as they are cotemporaneous , and , as it were , indivisible from each other , it is not astonishing , that he should have of himself a species of ideas , and that he should acquire , in a short time , those which it is desired to impart to him . " * Cuvier , also , thinks that the touch serves to verify and complete impressions , especially those of the sight ; and as it is , t he says the most important of all senses , its degrees of perfection have a prodigious influence on the nature of various animals . t Herder asserts that the touch has given us the comforts of life , inventions and arts , and that it contributes , perhaps , more than we suppose , to the nature of our ideas . According to the perfection of the organ of touch gives to elephants and to beavers a degree of L. c. p. 534. + L. c. p. 538. * L. c . T. p. 131. 9 Phys . T. 2. p. 87. /q/ intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which becomes , perhaps , the principle of their social character . If birds , notwithstanding . the prodigious activity of their nutritive life , have , nevertheless , an intelligence so limited , are so little susceptible of durable attachment , and show themselves so little capable of education , do not we find the cause of it , in the imperfections of their touch ? According to Vicq d'Azyr , and several professors now living , the difference between the intellectual faculties of man and the monkey , is explained by the diflFerence in their hands ; because the hand of the monkey has neither extensor nor flexor ; and moreover , the thumb is shorter and can not be opposed to the other fingers . It is thus , that , thanks to credulity , and the propensity for imitation , the old doctrine of Anaxagoras , * which taught that the hand was the caiise of human reason , has propagated itself without alteration to our age , which styles itself so enlightened . Why , then , ye philosophers , have ye not raised a temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wisdom of your life , without the hands of a Homer , a Solon , a EuclicJ , a Raphael , &c.?; What would your libraries have been without the hands of copyists and compilers ? Whatever is marvellous in the history of animals , it is to their trunks , their tails , their antennae , that you are indebted for it . It only remains for you to place their souls at the extremity of all these hands , these trunks , these tails , and to make them act according to the instructions of Lecat , Buffon , Condillac , &c.; t then will you have established the principle of the wisdom of animals and of men ; and you will have reason to maintain , that to seek other organs to form a physiology of the brain , can only be the futile amusement of idle men , a most unphilosophic design , a sort of scientific phrensy , which has hitherto escaped being sent to the madhouse. : * De usu paurtium , liv . i. p. 367. /z/ But , let us return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of touch . We may , with the aid of attention , exercise the sense of touch , more or less , by means of all parts of the body . Still , this faculty is most perfect in the hand , because the fingers are so many separate instruments , supple and moveable ; but it is not correct to say , that they are endowed with the most delicate touch . The feet , toes , tongue , and especially the lips in the horse , for example , also serve for touch in many animals . The tail of a large number of monkeys , of the beaver , the ant-bear , , &c.,; the trunk of the elephant , the snout of the hog and the mole , the beak of birds , the antennas of insects , the barbillons of fishes , the whiskers of the mammifera , serve the same use . By means of these instruments , men and animals can acquire ideas , more or less distinct , of distance , form , size , rest , or motion , solidity , heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resistance of objects , &c.; But , are the ideas acquired by means of touch , sufficient of themselves , to establish better order in thought ? Can they rectify the errors of the mind , " give birth to industry , to the arts , and invention ? Is the degree of perfection of the nature of animals a consequence of greater delicacy of touch ? Are our intellectual faculties and those of animals , as much more numerous , as the organs of touch are more in number , and more dehcate ? , Does a more perfect touch afford more precise and more extended knowledge ? And do animals choose things proper to their preservation , with so much the more certainty as their organs of touch are more supple ? Can touch produce attention , memory , judgment , imagination , abstract ideas , curiosity , desire of instruction , the appetites , and the passions ? Can we regard it as the first origin of all these faculties ? or , must we rather consider it as an instrument , as a means , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior order , and put in reciprocal relation with them ? /q/ By a natural consequence of the opinions of the writers I have quoted , should we not be tempted to believe , that the polypi , who , following the expression of some naturalists , touch the light , must have the most precise and the most extensive knowledge ? Their organs of touch , so numerous and flexible , should they not lead us to hope , that we shall one day witness their geometrical discoveries ? The crab , the butterfly , the Capricorn , ( beetle , ) which have antennae so complicated , is it through philosophic modesty , that they conceal their wisdom from us ? It is unlucky , that the greater part of insects , exercise their faculties at the pericS when they are still imperfect , and when their antennae are not yet developed , and that those who make use of their faculties in their state of complete development , such as bees and wasps , are inferior to the others in the beauty of their antennae . Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that animals possess , the more surely they can provide for the security of their existence ? Why do not naturalists take advantage of this luminous observation , to explain the extinction of severalspeciesof animals of the primitive world 1 We are , probably , indebted for the existence of oysters , iSshes , and horses , as they exist at present , to the care which nature has taken in the present worW , to change its march , by imposing on the whole animal kingdom , the condition of consulting the smell in their choice of aliments . If the tail of the beaver , and the trunk of the elephant , are the cause of their social character and of their disposition to be tamed ; if the imperfect touch of birds is the cause of their inaptitude to receive education , and their want of attachment , we may doubt whether dogs , sheep , and domestic fowls are tame and sociable animals ; we may , likewise , doubt , whether the bulfinch and the black-bird , the parrot and the raven can learn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will even be necessary to - forget the marvellous construction of the nests of birds . If the march of thought is so mechanical , that it is the . touch , which arranges the ideas in better order , becauw /q/ /z/ it acts slowly , separately , and successively upon objects , it would be to the sight , which , at a glance , contemplates the universe , that we should attribute the advantage of giving ideas the most prompt , the most general , and the most extended . If touch possesses the admirable &culty; of correcting the errors of the mind , let us be shown a single error , moral or physical , from which the touch of man or animals has delivered us . Let the maniac , who thinks that he unceasingly hears strange voices whisper in his ear , and who is continually tormented by imaginary insects , exhaust himself perpetually in useless efforts to seize the insupportable prattler and the troublesome insect ; let him , in his amorous delirium , have discovered a thousand times that he embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the insects to harass him , and he embraces a thousand times more , the phantom of his ardent imagination . If it be to the hands , that the origin of inventions and arts , is due , why do idiots and simpletons never invent any thing ? Why does the painter let fall his pencil , the sculptor his chisel , and the architect his compass , as soon as their minds become deranged ? How , on the contrary , does it happen , that men born without hands and without feet , have very just ideas of distances , forms , &c.,; and that other individuals , whose hands have been wholly amputated , execute surprising feats with the stumps ? Why have artists , up to the present time , never found the secret of judging of the talents of their pupils , by the conformation of their hands ? Although it be true , that some muscles of the hand are wanting in monkeys , yet they can hold the smallest objects between the thumb and fore-finger ; they seize the finest hairs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they untie the most complicated knots , using their finders and their teeth like men ; they even employ their hmd feet for all these purposes ; and yet they have never invented a tool or a process of art . They do not want , any more than the dog and the cat , the ability to carry ; why , then , do these animals , not- /z/ withstanding the possession of so many faculties , never arrive at the idea of carrying wood to a fire , though at the same time they are shivering with cold ? All which we have said proves , that man and animals do not perform what they execute , by means of touch , because they have this sense more or less perfect , but that it is necessary to admit , that the external organs , the senses , are calculated to adapt themselves to the internal faculties . Would there not exist a perpetual contradiction between the propensities , the faculties , and the external organs ; and would not the internal faculties be rendered useless by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted to execute what the internal ones command ? Give to the tiger , bathed in blood , the feet and the teeth of the sheep , and to the sheep , the claws and murderous teeth of the lion , and instantly , by this contradictory arrangement of apparatuses , you destroy the existence of these two animals . The degree of address , industry , and intelligence , with which an animal is endowed , has not for its principle his trunk , or his tail , which serves him for a trowel ; man does not invent because he has hands ; but the animal and the man have these organs , because their internal organization is endowed with the faculties which are in relation with these . Certain organs may be indispensable to execute certain things ; yet we can not attribute to them the thought , which leads to constructing a nest or a hut ; to the invention of printing , or weaving . It is the more astonishing , that this error of Anaxago- -n ras should have been preserved to the present moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The body , " says he , " is the organ of the soul , and , consequently , all the limbs are useful . Hence , the limbs are different , because the souls themselves are of different natures . The courageous and audacious lion has strong claws and teeth ; the bull is armed with horns ; the boar with tusks . The timid animals , such as the stag and the hare , are organized so as to withdraw , /z/ themselves from danger by a prompt flight Man , being endowed with something divine , with intelligence , has received from nature his hands , instead of weapons and tusks . These instruments serve him for all acts , both in war and in peace . There is no need of either horns or tusks ; by means of his hands he procures himself shoes ; the cuirass , the lance , his arrows : he constructs walls and houses , weaves cloths and nets , and , in this manner gains possession , not only of the animals which inhabit the earth , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skim the seas . With his hands he writes laws , erects temples and statues , constructs vessels , makes flutes , harps , knives , pincers , and all instruments needed in the arts . It is by them , that he transmits his meditations to posterity , just as , at the present moment , he can converse with Plato , Aristotle , and Hippocrates . The hands , therefore , were most suitable to man , as an inteUigent being ; for , he is not the most intelligent being because he has two hands as Anaxagoras maintains ; but , he is provided with hands because he is the most intelligent ; as Aristotle had already , with reason , advanced . It is not the hands , which have taught men the arts ; but it is his understanding . The hands are only instruments for the arts ; as it is not the harp which instructs the musician , nor the tongs which make the blacksmith , but both are artists , only , by the aid of their intelligence , though without these instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so each soul , by virtue of its peculiar nature , possesses certain faculties , though it can not manifest them without certain instruments . It is especially by observing the young of certain animals , that any one may convmce himself , that it is not external instruments which inspire an animal with timidity , couriige , or sagacity ; for , young animals are already endeavoring to exercise their innate faculties , before their innate faculties have reached their perfection . I have often seen a young bullock making at objects with his forehead before the horns had appeared ; a colt lack with his still feeble feet ; a  --  young boar without /q/ tusks cany on a combat with blows from his jaw . Each animal has the internal sense of his facultiesand knows the use of his weapons , independently of all instruction . If it were otherwise , why should not the young boar bite with the teeth which he already has , in place of attempting the use of tusks , which he has ot ? If you have three eggs hatched , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a serpent , yon will see the eagle and the duck try to fly before they possess any wings ; the little serpent , on the contrary , will roll himself into a spiral , and , however feeble he may be , will make efforts to crawl . If you bring them up in a house , and then take them into the open field , the eagle will direct his flight to the heaven , the duck will make for the water , and the serpent will hide himself under the grass . The eagle , I think , will not fail to pursue his prey ; the duck , to swim ; and the serpent , to seek for holes in the earth ; all , as I conclude , without having been taught by any master . " We see , aso , by this , that a similitude of occupation exists among several animals , although their organs may difler entirely ; or , that similar internal faculties obtain their common object by means of external organs totally unlike . The trunk is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the monkey ; the swallow attaches its nest by the means of his beak , and the thrush cements the interior of his , with clay , tempered by the same instrument , in the same manner as the beaver covers his habitation with it by means of his tail . The squirrel and the wren , the swamp-thrush , and the reed-mouse , build their nests in a manner almost similar . The eagle holds his prey between his talons , as the dog does a bone with his paws . Whatever difference exists between the hands of the monkey , and the feet of the parrot , and the Polish titmouse , fparus pendulinus , ) all three make use of these parts to hold their food in the air in the same manner ; the hoff roots the earth with his snout , the dog scratches it , and the stag beats it with his feet , to uncover the truffles. /z/ In like manner , phenomena entirely different , result from organs apparently similar . In how many differ- ent modes , and with what variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their prey ? What diversity of structure exists in the nests of birds ? Even those who construct similar ones , and which belong to the same genus , how much do they differ in their mode of life , in habitual residence , in their food , their notes , and other distinctive peculiarities ? The great tomtit , parus majors ) for example , builds his . nest in hollow Uees ; the long-tailed tomtit , parus caudattis , ) in the bifurca tions , and between the bark and the trunk ; the bearded tomtit , parus barbatus , ) in the reeds ; and the titmouse mispends his nest , remarkable for its art and delicacy , from a slender branch ; while the cuckoo , thoush pro vided with a beak and feet like other birds , builds none . We challenge those , who assert that the external organs produce the internal faculties , to form a conjecture of any faculty from the configuration of these organs . What would lead you to conclude , that the ant-lion digs a reversed cone in the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the reason why the hare has his covert in the midst of the fields , while the rabbit burrows ? What sign shows you that the rook must live in society , while the pie lives in insulated couples ? How do you distinguish the natural wildness of the cuckoo and the chamois , from the facility with which the pigeon and the goat are tamed 7 Would you not rather have attributed the faculty of building to the hands of the curious monkey , than to the feeble and palmate feet of the beaver ? Would you not make the weak wren migratory to the south , rather than the vulture ? How will you discover why th hamster lays up food for the winter , and why the bustard , crane , &c.,; set sentinels ? Thus have I demonstrated , that it does not belong to the touch alone , to give us a knowledge of the world without us ; that sensations take place , not only by means of the external senses , but likewise in the interior of the organization ; that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other senses ; that the hands , when there exists no faculty of a superior order , can not invent either arts or tools ; that the whole use of the touch is limited to procuring the ideas of distance , extent , form , rest , motion , moisture and dryness , and the degree of solidity of objects ; that , in other respects , it must be re- Sirded as the instrument of the superior faculties , * that ese superior Acuities , such as the inclinations , propensities , different modes of industry , and the faculties , can not be determined , conjectured , or explained by the organs of touch . We are , then , obliged to seek other organic conditions , as the causes of all the faculties which we can not derive from this sense . It is alleged , as the cause of the numerous advanta of touch , that it supposes a reflection in the animal that exercises it , whereas the others require none . " Light , " say they , " and sounds , strike their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches nothing without some preliminary exercise of the intellectual faculties . " * But this opinion , which embraces only one side of objects , disregards the active functions of the other senses ; and , as it excludes , at the same time , the involuntary touch and shock , and , consequently , the passive function of touch , it does not deserve any more extended refutation . We may place in the same category , the directly opposite opinion of Dumas , t who says , " the perceptions from touch do not leave after them impressions as definite , as lively , and of which the memory can so easily recal. the image . " To this objection , those may answer , who are under the sad necessity of indemnifying themselves by the pleasures of the imagination only , for the loss of those gratifications which they have formerly had from the sense of touch . - Biehat , Anat Gen. T. i. p. 117. t L. c . T. iii p. 435. // Of the Functions of the Senses in general . The impressions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or from the internal by the general organs of sensations , must , then , be considered as indispensable conditions , without which no perception and no thought can take place . But , no impression from without , no irritation from within , can become a sensation or an idea , without the concurrence of the brain . The faculty of perceiving impressions , of retaining and comparing ideas , and making application of them , is by no means in proportion to the senses either in men or animals , as is proved by the example of idiots and simpletons . Thus , could we even have it demonstrated , that man , of all animals , has the most perfect senses , we should not thus obtain the explanation of his surpassing all others in intellectual faculties . Accordingly Condillac* has been obliged to say , " that the senses do not suffice to obtain a knowledge of nature j for the same senses are common to us all , yet we have not all the same knowledge . " The authort of the treatise on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the senses have , likewise , produced the arts to satisfy , to perfect , and to guard themselves from painful impressions . What arts has not the sense of touch produced ? These dresses , these palaces , these convenient carriages , are all the creations of its delicacy . " We shall oppose to him an observation of Helvetius , much more judicious . " Experience , " ! says he , " does not show that the mind is always proportionate to the greater or less dehcacy of these same senses . Women , - ( Euvres compl . T. iii p. 6. t Lecat. p. 31. /q/ for example , wiiose skin , more delicate than that of man , gives them greater acuteness in the sense of touch , have not more genius than a Voltaire , &c.; Homer and Milton were blind at an early age ; but what imagination can be stronger and more brilliant ?

Those , whose senses of taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius than Diderot , Rousseau , Marmontel , Duclos , &c.?; In whatever manner we inquire of experience , she always answers , that the greater or less superiority of mind , is independent of the greater or less perfection of the organs of the senses . " To prove still more amply that all our ideas come from the senses , it is said , with Locke , * that the very expressions for the peculiar functions of the understanding are borrowed from material objects . " The words imagine , comprehend , attach , conceive , instil , disgust , trouble , tranquillity , are all borrowed from the operar lions of sensible things , and applied to certain modes of thought . " And with him it is asserted , that , in all languages , the words employed to express things not within the domain of sense , have derived their first origin from similar ideas . In this sense is continually repeated the maxim of Aristotle , that nothing arrives at the mind without having passed through the senses . I am , myself , convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are borrowed from the external world . But , if we have established a comparison between two sensations , does it follow that it was external impressions which produced these similar internal sensations ? It seems to us rather , that , in a great number of cases , it is difficult to decide whether a certain expression has first been invented for an internal sensation , or for an external impression ; for man is alive to himself , as early as he is to the external world , and  --  L. c . Tom . iii . p. 40. i /z/ acquires sensations and ideas from within and without at the same time . It as necessary to designate the motion and rest of the eyes , of the tongue , as well as the nK ) tion and rest of an animal ; the heart beats as well as a hammer ; a stone does not oppress us more than heavy undigested food weighs in the stomach ; the painAi feehngs of distress , pricking , dragging , tearing , and distortion , may affect us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external impressions . Who , then , will dare assert that the expressions , strain , cold , warm , chill , palpitation , trembling , &c.,; have been designed to designate rather the qualities of external things , than those of internal sensations ? There exists , also , in every language , a number of expressions , which it would be difficult to derive from material objects . Whence comes the words hunger , thirst , truth , falsehood , error , friend , enemy , hatred , love , pride , honor , sin , evil , good , wish , think , joy , grief , fear , hope , fcc . They serve to revive our internal sensations , and we employ them frequently to depict what " passes in the external world . We say that a country is sad , that a house threatens to fall , that the excessive heat does mischief to the trees , &c.; Whence come the words which do not precisely designate determinate ideas , but simply the mode of thinking ; the prepositions , conjunctions , interjections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as but , and , yet , notwithstanding , for , if , nevertheless , consequently , also , then , thus , alas , yes , no , &c.; ? Do not the deaf and dumb , who possess reason , but who are deprived of the faculty of expressing themselves by articulate language , depict their internal sensations by gestures , which absolutely have nothing in common with the external world ? If all our ideas come from the senses what becomes of the general and purely intellectual ideas , whose signification is wholly independent of the material world ? For example , " there is no effect without a cause ; " " nothing can spring from nothing ; " " matter can /q/ neither be increased or diminished ; " " a quality , contra ry to a subject , can not belong to it ; " " a tiling can not exist and not exist , at the same time . " In fine , I have already shown in my large work , in speaking of hearing , that the faculty of finding analogies between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty of a degree superior to that of articulating words . Langua , then , also proves , in all its relations , that it is not solely the work of the impressions on the senses , but that it supposes an internal and an external source of our sensations and our ideas , and , at the same time , an intellectual faculty much superior . Some authors , persuaded that the impressions on the senses do not sufiice to explain all the faculties of animals and of man , admit an internal and an external source of our ideas , and say , with Cabanis , Richerand , ifcc , that our ideas come to us from two very distinct sources , to wit , the external senses and the internal organs ; that instinct arises from impressions received from the internal organs , while reason is the product of external sensations . They also add , that " in animals , the grosser external senses allow instinct to predominate , and that in man , the perfection of the senses gives to the reasoning a marked preponderance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this mode of expression again supposes the error , that man has senses more perfect than animals ; and , as , on the other hand , we generally attribute to savage nations the most delicate senses , it would be from them that we ought to expect the most profound philosophy and the feeblest instinct ; which will hardly be admitted . But , we must first agree what instinct , properly speaking , is . If , moved by different principles , man is better able to govern his passions than the animals , it does not at all follow , that those passions or instincts are more feeble . In fine , the propensities , the inclinations , the passions , are as much objects of consideration for reason , as the impressions made on the senses ; these , also , /z/ hare need of internal organs , when they do noC rranaia simple material impressions , and must be emplo3/  --  d by the understanding for higher functions . The eye and the touch , alone , no more form geometry , than the female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the sheep is the cause of the carnivorous appetite of the wolf . It is said to have been remarked in the man of Puiseaux , blind from his birth , " that the wonders of nature and the course of the stars , did not induce in him a belief in God , because he was unable to perceive them ; that the same blind man had no aversion for theft , except for the facility with which others robbed him without his knowing it , and the difficulty he found in retaliating on others without being detected ; that he cared not much for decency ; and felt not much commiserar tion for a man whose blood was flowing . " By such examples they would make it appear , that we are indebted to the senses even for our moral faculties. * But , have those animals who possess all the senses which we do , such as the baboon , and ourang-outang , have they more decency , and are they more moved in seeing blood flow , than other aninials ? Are idiots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the man born blind ? Must not every reader perceive , that it is the interior alone which modifies the impressions on the senses , and thus leads us , by a precipitate and limited judgment , to believe their operation immediate ? It is for this reason , that external objects act very differently on men and on animals ; very differently on the hare and on the fox ; on such or such an individual , &c.; The differences of seasons , ages and sexes , produces no essential difference in the number and nature of the senses ; why , then , are the intellectual faculties and the passions so different in the child , and in the man , in the * Diderat L. c. p. 126 et snive. /q/ 3roung man and in the young woman ? How does it happen , that , in animals , it sometimes is the inclination to assemble in flocks and travel , and sometimes , the desire to propagate the species , that predominates ? Why does the same bird feed on seeds , in one season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the senses are gradually weakened in old age . According to some physiologists , this is the consequence of the senses being habituated to external impressions , so that these successively produce feebler irritations . It is even attempted to explain on the principle of habit , why we have so little feeling of what passes within us in the organic or automatic life . It rather se6ms to me that nature has designedly taken from us the sense of automatic life ; and she has probably attained this end by the tenuity of the threads of communication of the nervous systems of the chest and abdomen , with the nervous systems of the vertebral column , the senses and the brain . But in old asre , the functions of the senses are weakened , because the organs of sense themselves diminish . The nervous filaments and their nutritive substance waste , as well as the gray substance generally , and all the nerves begin to experience atrophy . This is the reason why Pinel did not find in the labyrinth of the ear of old men who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who hear . This , too , is the reason why the nerves of aged persons are much smaller , than those of persons in the prime of life . This diminution not taking place at the same time in all the nervous systems , it hence results , that all the ftmctions do not diminish equally at the same time ; which must happen if they successively become more fble , only in consequence of the repetition of impressions . The double nature of each sense does not prevent the sensations we have of objects from being simple ; the consciousness of the soul is likewise simple , notwithstanding the five different functions of the senses . Bacon , Locke , Hume , Helvetius , Condillac , have found /q/ /z/ themselves obliged , in order to compreheDd in some way , the possibility of the functions of the understanding , to have recourse , not only to the senses which some of these authors had so highly elevated , but likewise to a knowledge of the relations of sensations , or scmietimes to atteiv tion , experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradiction with themselves , they perceived that none of the faculties which we have just enumerated , could pertain to any of the senses . But if in this life , no faculty can be exercised without a material condition , as I shall show hereafter in an incontestable manner , we must necessarily suppose a material organization for the exercise of the intellectual faculties . Men have always regarded , as very important , the researches , which have for their object to determine the organs , by which animals and man receive the material impressions of the external world . Will it be less interesting , less noble , to try to discover the organs of the superior faculties of the mind ? In fine , I will ask , if the five senses , and the faculties of which we have spoken , can serve to explain the various inclinations , the different instinctive aptitudes of animals , as well as all the propensities and all ' the powers of man ; how , by this means , will you explain why the seal , the chamois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the beaver , the rabbit , the ant , construct their abodes with so much skill ? Why the quail and the stork migrate and return to the same places ? Who can explain to us the love of females for their youYig , and the indiflference of the males of many sorts of animals , while in other species , the males share with their mates , the care of the young ? Who can explain to us the sociability of the rook , and the inclination of the pie to live in solitude ? the exclusive jealousy of the cock and the bull , and the reciprocal compatibility of hens and cows ? Who can explain to us what we call cunning , courage , boldness , rectitude , 9iorality ? Is it experience ? But all these sentiments precede experience . The spider weaves , the beaver builds , the nightingale /q/ migratei , before having any experience . Is it at tention , reflection , induction ? But why do6s each species of animal direct its attention to a different and pe* cuhar object ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same object ? Why , even , does it not depend on man to acquire a high degree of attention or faculty of induction for certain objects ? Do we not see that it is in all nature , as in the example of the monkey , who has attention sufficient for filling his pouches with fruits , but knows not how to keep up a fire ? Education perfects deteriorates , represses , and directs the Innate Faculties , but can neither destroy nor produce any . Since we have ventured to regard animals no lonser as mere machines , many philosophers maintain , that not only man , but animals also , are born without instincts , propensities , primitive determination , faculties ; that they are indifferent , equally susceptible of every thing ; and , finally , that we must regard them as tabuke rasae . Their ingenious aptitudes , instincts , propensities and faculties , it is pretended , are the result of accidental impressions , received by the five senses , or of those which education gives them . Even insects , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction . The builder- wasp has already learned , while yet a larva , the masonry of his mother ; the bird learns from those who have given him life , to build his nest , to sing , to migrate ; the young fox is carried to school by his father ; and man would not become man , would remain a savage and idiot , without the means furnished by education . Let us first examine this hypothesis , so far as it concerns animals . It is true , and I shall give numerous proofs of it in this work , that the great part of animals are not limited /z/ wholly to the means of their own preservation . They are susceptible of much more extended instruction , than their immediate wants require . We teach all sorts of tricks to birds , squirrels , cats , dogs , horses , monkeys , and even swine . They also modify their own mode of action with reference to the position in which they find themselves . But , this faculty of receiving education is always proportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than man , learn things , of which they have not received the first impress from nature . I admire the setter , couching in the pursuit of the pheasant ; the falcon in chase of the heron ; but the ox will never learn to run after micenor the cat to browse on grass ; and we shall never teach the roe-buck and the pigeon to hunt . If animals were susceptible of impressions from all that surrounds them , in a manner to derive lessons from them to the degree supposed , why does not the chicken learn to coo with the pigeons ? Why does not the female nightingale imitate the song of her mate ? How does each animal , notwithstanding the intercourse of other species , difiering the most from his own , preserve his peculiar manners ? Why do birds and mammifera , even when hatched or suckled by strange parents , always manifest the character of their species ? Why does the cuckoo imitate neither , the nest where he is hatched , nor the note of the bird who has reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken blind in his nest , and who has never seen another squirrel , to climb and leap from one branch to another ? How do we in-spire the ferret with the instinct of seeking the rabbit in his burrow ? Who has taught ducks and beetles to counteffeit death , as soon as they are menaced by an enemy ? Who has given lessons to the spider , which , , hardly escaped from his egg , weaves a web and envelopes the captive flies , that they may not dry up ? Of whom has the ichneumon fly learned to attach with a thread to the branch of a tree , the caterpillar , in which J S '  --  Cf ' ri * . ' S-y*-4 /A , /q/ she has deposited her eggs ? And how do the caterpillars , as soon as they are batched , roll themselves in a leaf to escape the cold and dampness of the winter ? Iri fine , why do animals do things , which they have never 5een done ; and why do they almost always do them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without the innateness of the faculties of animals , how can we explain the differences of individuals , which have absolutely the same manner of living ? When , in a forest , one nightingale sings better and more assiduously than ' the rest ; when in a poultry yard one cock is more ardent in fight , and another more pacific ; when one hen , one cow , are better mothers than the other hens and the other cows ,  --  can we attribute these phenomena to education ? How can we comprehend why certain individuals are raised above their fellows , and become , as it were , the geniuses of their species ? Locke 's translator , Coste , speaks of a dog , who , in winter , whenever his comrades were lying about the fire , so as to prevent his approach , set himself about making a noise in the court ; and while his comrades ran thither , he hastened to enter into the house , took a good place near the fire , and let those bark whom he had cheated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet he always gained his ends , because no one of the other dogs had sagacity enough to discover his trick . Dupont de Nemours had a cow , that , to procure the whole flock a more abundant supply of food , adopted the plan of throwing down with her horns , the fence with which the field was surrounded . None of the other cows knew how to imitate her example ; and when they were near the fence , waited impatiently the arrival of their conductress . I have sometimes met mocking-birds who perfectly imitated the birds of the neighborhood , even to the quail and the cuckoo , while the others surrounded by the same birds , could only imitate a small number , or were limited to their own peculiar song . In fine , if the instincts , propensities , and faculties of /z/ animals , are not determined by their organization , how can you explain the fact , that these instincts , propensities and faculties are always found in harmony with their external organs ? What chance should give to each animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their teeth , claws , horns , &c.?; Will you maintain that nature acts without object , in giving to the beaver strong gnawing teeth and a flat tail ; to the intelligent elephant his trunk ; to the sanguinary tiger his terrible claws and teeth 1 Or , will you tell me , with those who do not acknowledge final causes , that the bear , the tiger , and the elephant employ their instruments for the sole reason , ahat they find them fitted for certain purposes ? the mole lives under ground because her eyes are too small ; the feet of the swan are natural oars , and therefore he chooses of necessity his abode in the water . Neither man nor animals have any limb , any instrument , in order to use it , but they use them because they have them . Who does not see that , on this supposition , there would be no connection between the interior and exterior , between the instruments and the active force ? And would you forget , that the boar strikes with his jaws before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid with their head , before their horns have appeared ? that the bird shakes his wings before he has any feathers ? Take from the lion his teeth and claws , and give them to the sheep , and see if by this means you will change the lion into a sheep , and the sheep into a lion . We must then admit , that each animal , in consequence of its organization , has received from nature ingenious aptitudes , instincts , propensities , proper determinate talents , and that the power of things external , of instruction and education , is limited to giving it more or less modification . The hypothesis of the tabula rasa , and of the creative power of education , is it more admissible for the human race ? /q/ To attempt to write in a satisfactory manner on the influence of institutions and of education , would be undertaking volumes . I must therefore confine myself to my object , and show , by some general considerations , how far the influence of human efforts extends over the moral and intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in saying , that man , being from his birth surrounded by men , appropriates to himself their faculties and their character . Might I not ask whence the first men , who were surrounded only by beasts , obtained their faculties , and how they created or invented them ? Even at the present time , are not many men , in their infancy , more surrounded by animals than by men ? Why do not these children receive the instincts and propensities of animals as well as the faculties of man ? If children had not the same dispositions as their parents and instructors , how could they be capable of receiving their instruction and profiting by their example ? In the first years , when children are almost solely in the hands of their mothers , of nurses , and of women , boys always distinguish themselves from girls , and one child is perfectly distinct from another . After this period nothing can give rise to a resemblance between the faculties of the man and the woman , nor between those of different in- . dividuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instructor can create in children envy , love , attachment , anger , goodness or wickedness , ambition , pride , &c.; ? Do we know how to create any talent ? This power so little belongs to man , that even when we are our own absolute masters , we can not escape the changes which the succession of years produces in our moral and intellectual faculties . Every thing confirms the tnith of what Herder says , that education can not take place except by imitation , and consequently by the passage from the original to the copy . The imitator must have the faculty of receiving what is communicated to him and of transforming it mto his nature , as he does the meats /z/ by which he is nourished . But the manner in which he receives it , the means by which he appropriates it to himself and employs it , can only be determined by the faculties of the receiver ; whence it follows that the education of our species , is , in some sort , the result of a double action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him who receives it . Thus when we see that men take the form which we wish to give them , it is not a legitimate inference , that these forms have been created in them ; they have borrowed them from other men endowed with the same dispositions . The influence of education , instruction , example and of surrounding circumstances , takes place principally when the innate dispositions are neither too feeble nor too energetic . Every sane man , having the essential organization of his species , has , in virtue of it , capacity for whatever is relative to the dispositions proper to man . It is owing to this , that nature bounds herself in the most part of individuals , with a mediocrity of moral and intellectual forces ; it is , as it were , passive in relation to the impression of external objects ; the internal faculties do not announce themselves ; they are in a state of indifference ; they seize nothing and repulse nothing strongly ; and as nothing draws these individuals toward a marked end , they have consequently no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said , with reason , that man is an imitative animal . Precepts , institutions , discussion , the severe exposition of the most interesting truths , has but little power over them . It is example and imitation which draws them , which gives a grave air , and often a grave character to the son of a magistrate , and the bold countenance to the son of a warrior ; which make the Frenchman , German , Italian , Englishman , Russian ; which make slaves , freemen , republicans , &c.; : but it will always be mediocrity which falls to their share . It is for these men that education is almost every thing , at least in the relations of social life ; it is for them that institutions must be calculated . Still , it is not admissible to conclude , that /q/ their dispositions for receiving this education , are not innate . When Helvetius maintains , that if dispositions were innate in man , education would not be able to change any thing in him , nof to give him any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals all possibility of being modified , and confounds simple modifications with essential qualities and faculties . Still , it must not be imagined , that even for this class , the impressions which come from without , have an influence exclusive , absolute , and always equal . If we succeed in introducing in a nation a certain uniformity in regard to customs , opinions , manners , professions , arts and sciences , laws and religion , it is because all these things are founded , not only on positive relations , but also , on natural dispositions . ' Without denying the influence of institutions , it is still evident that the general progress of civilization is the result of the organization proper to the human race . In the midst of these positive things , which seem to have been introduced by institutions , by arbitrary inventions , each individual diifers from another by a peculiar character , just as he difiers by the external form of his body . Such a quality is given to one , and denied to another . Each has a predilection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object . There is , then , in each man , something which he does not derive from education , which even resists all education . Accordingly , all instructors have experienced , that it is necessary to observe peculiar rules for each pupil , if they would perfect the good qualities and correct the evil ones which belong to him , and put him in a state to employ his powers in a manner usefiil to society and himself . This individuality , this character peculiar to each individual , shows itself in a thousand modes at all periods of life , without education having any part in it . From his infancy , man announces the character which will distinguish him in adult age . The moment you exalt his merit on account of some excellent quality , or censure him for a vicious one , he appears to be surprised /z/ himself , as by some new thing , of which he acquires a knowledge for the first time . Urge him still more , and he exclaims , " IVell , it is in any nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong for me . " Let us follow , then , the example of Marcus Aurelius , who holds it for a maxim ,  --  that it is not in our power , nor in that of a sovereign , to make men such as they ought to be ; but that it depends on us and on the prince , to employ men , such as they are , each according to his talent . How can we attribute to education those most decided dispositions and faculties , which are sometimes observed , even in children , and which , consequently , are anterior to all sorts of instruction . Most great men have manifested their future greatness in their early years . Achilles , concealed under the robes of Pyrrha , seized a sword from among the ifts which Ulysses brought : Themistocles , when still a child , said , that if they would give him a small town to govern , he would know how to enlarge it and render it powerful : Alcibiades , seeing that a carman was going to disturb his game of cockles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street , and cries out to him , " Come on , if you dare : " Alexander would not contend for the prize in the Olympic games , unless kings were to be his rivals : it was at the age of fourteen years that Cato of Utica developed his great character , and his horror of tyranny ; and Pascal , at twelve , gave evidence of his genius , by publishing his treatise on Conic Sections . Experience proves the small power of education , when we have to deal with energetic dispositions . Men , endowed with striking characters and superior intellect , push on and raise themselves , notwithstanding the greatest obstacles . Moses , David , Tamerlane , Pope Sixtus Quintus , had been keepers of flocks ; Gregory VII . was the son of a carpenter ; Socrates , Pythagoras , Theophrastes , Demosthenes , Shakspeare , Moliere , J. J. Rousseau , were the sons of artisans . These examples , with which history abounds , refute Hobbes , wHo holds that the diflSerence of talents , or , of mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition in which one is born . We even observe , that , in spite of the most decided opposition , and education , the most hostile to the innate character , nature , when endowed with energy , gains the victory both in the good and the bad . Tacitus justifies the instructors of Nero . This prince was cruel firom infancy , and to all the lessons of humanity which his masters gave him , he only opposed a heart of brass . Philosophers and sages cultivated the heart and mind of Commodus ; but nature triumphed over education : men saw in him a second Nero . The energy of the character of Peter the Great could neither be enervated by the corrupt principles with which he was surrounded , nor by the pleasures by means of which , at a tender age it was attempted to lead him into effeminate habits . The greatest men , it is true , bear the impress of their age , and can not entirely defend themselves from the impression of the objects which surround them ; still , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality or faculty , pursues his route , and seizes with force the object which nature has pointed out to him . Thomas , in writing the eloge of Descartes , did well not to dwell much upon his education . " For , " said he , " when the question relates to extraordinary men , we have to consider education much less than nature . There is an education for common men ; the man of genius has the education which he gives himself , and which consists principally in destroying and effacing , that which he has received . " Fontenelle , in . pronouncing the eulogy of the czar , said ,  --  " Neither does good education make the great character , nor does bad education destroy it . Heroes , of all classes , come ready formed from the hands of nature , and with uncontrollable qualities . " Almost all great men have either been educated by inferior masters , or have received no education whatever . Homer Petrarch , Tasso , Dante , Raphael , Michael Ange- /z/ lo , Racine , Moliere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are instances . It is rare , that great masters form great men . What , then , must we think of the public , that honestly consider it the bet choice of a physician , when the individual selected is the pupil of some celebrated professor ? But geniuses of all kinds , say the antagonists of innate propensities , make an exception , and form a separate class ; we can not from them conclude , that the qualities and faculties are innate . 1 answer , that genius is only the energetic activity of some quality or some faculty . If , then , in cases where the faculties have the greatest energy , the cause which produces it , and which is most striking , is inherent in the organization , we must naturally conclude that the cause of their ordinary activity is equally founded in the organization . Difference of more and less proves nothing against the common origin of obscure and decided faculties . Otherwise it would be correct to conclude , from the piercing sight of the eagle , and the delicate scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sense of smell in man , do not likewise depend on their organization . If , by a concurrence of circumstances , a man endowed with certain very active faculties , has been prevented from following his inclination , this dominant faculty or propensity determines the enjoyments and the favorite occupations of his life . Kings devote themselves to the occupations of artists and of artisans ; peasants , cordwainers , weavers , shepherds , become astronomers , poets , philosophers , actors , sculptors ! The czar Peter I. exercised the mechanical arts from inclination . Louis XIV . turned locksmith for amusement . The shepherd Hahn made watches ; and Haller , in the midst of his anatomical and physiological works , became likewise celebrated for poetry . Will it be pretended that precocious genius , or any other genius , is the result of education and of surrounding objects ? I would then be informed why certain children , who , in regard to one of their faculties , exhibit /q/ extraordinary genius , in other respects do not raise themselves above their companions ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent in every thing else ? The celebrated Betty , who at the age of thirteen , was already regarded a first-rate actor , used to play in the street with his companions , up to the moment of his appearance on the stage . William Crotch , celebrated at the age of six years , for his musical talents , was , in other respects , a child of only moderate abilities . I have made the same observation on a boy of five years , who gave evidence of complete puberty and the most decided propensity for women ; he had nothing to distinguish him from children of his age , in all his other inclinations . The same contrast is remarkable in adults . The most extraordinary faculties prove nothing in favor of qualities of a different order . Nothing could have made a Horace of Caesar , or a Homer of Alexander . Helvetius , himself , is forced to confess that education would never have changed Newton into a poet , or Milton into an astronomer . Michael AngeJo would never have been able to compose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romanus . We can only explain these various phenomena by saying , that certain organs perfect themselves sooner , and others later ; that , in certain individuals , some organs remain always in arrear , while others acquire the greatest energy . But this explanation shows again , that all the moral qualities and intellectual faculties are innate . Philosophers have recourse to small subterfuges to prove , that our propensities and our talents are the result of chance . It is , they say , by insignificant impressions on the infant at the breast , by peculiar examples and events , that sometimes one faculty is determined and sometimes another . If Demosthenes became eloquent , it is because he was attracted by the eloquence of Callisthenes . If Vaucanson became celebrated in mechanics , it was because he had seen , while a child , a clock in the ante-chamber of his mother 's confessor ; he examined its wheels , made a similar machine with a /z/ // bad knife , and , his taste developing itself , he soon constructed an automaton flute-player , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem , had he not lost his place of secretary to Cromwell . Shakspeare made tragadies in consequence of being an actor ; in place of being an actor , he would have remained a wool-dealer , Uke his father , had not some youthful follies compelled him to quit the place of his birth . Oorneille falls in love , and writes verses to the object of his affection ; it is to this circumstance that we owe this great dramatic poet Newton sees an apple ftU ; what more was wanting to enable him to divine the tews of gravitation . I admit these facts . All that can be concluded from them is , that our propensities and our talents do not always put themselves in activity ; that it is often necessary , that the impulse be given them by an external impression , or that the material object , on which they are to exercise themselves , be offered them . The cock will not fight , unless he finds a rival to thwart him in his love ; the beaver does not build , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate without a female ; without obstacle , there can be no firmness ; without hbl enemy , no generous pardon . In all ages , great events have given rise to great men ; not that the circumstances produce their intellectual faculties , but because they furnish an ample field for the free exercise of their Many men , without doubt , acquire , only by this means , a knowledge of their own genius ; but if , sometimes , certain qualities remain at first inactive , for want of circumstances , the force and solidity which these faculties afterward display , fully satisfy us that their existence had preceded their action . Is it not evident , tbatt , in the very examples opposed to me , the dbjects ( ered by chance , would not , without the peculiar disposition in question , hove been seized as they were , nor w*h the same energy ? How many are the children on wiiom works of art make little impreson , or whom 4ihe view -e &'hese; works does not render artists ? /z/ Yaucanson directs a fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examines it with much care ; first trials he makes to imitate it , with bad tools , prove successful ; now , this attention and this rapid success , prove that there existed a relation between his faculties and the mechanic arts . Thucydides shed tears of envy at the reading which Herodotus gave of his history , to the Greeks . It certainly was not this perusal , which created in him a concise , close , lively style , strong and rich in thoughts . Neither was it the reading of the poem of the Death of Henry IV . which inspired Fontaine with his peculiar talent for poetry . How many secretaries lose their places without becoming Miltons ! How many are in love , and write verses like Corneille and Racine ; yet these poets have found no equals among their successors . If the most frivolous accessary circumstances produce striking differences in propensities and talents , why does not education , which can produce circumstances at will , seize this new means of forming great men ? And why have we , and shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many establish* ments for education , great men are so rare a phenome-non ? I certainly do not deny , that good models are of great Utihty , and that the study of Ihese models ought to constitute an essential part of education ; but , if it be necessary , or sufficient , to have excellent subjects of imitation , whence have Homer , Petrarch , Dante , drawn their divine art ? Why do not the talents of Tacitus , Cicero , and Livy , find their inheritors , though so many scholars know these authors by heart ? The Raphaels , Mozarts , Haydns , why do they produce so few disciples ? And why do we always need to await a lapse of several ages , before we can see any great men shine in the an*-nals of history ? Again ; an objection is drawn from the uniformity which is found among men , on a hasty survey of all the individuals of a nation ; and from this , it is concluded , /z/ that the faculties of mankind are only a result of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , we find it in essential things , not only in a single nation , but in all people , in all ages , however different may be the external influences of climate , of nourishment , laws , customs , religion , and education . It even preserves itself in all the individuals of the same species of animals , under whatever climate , and whatever external influence . This uniformity is , consequently , the strongest proof that nothing can derange the plan , which nature has prescribed by means of organization . For the rest , these panegyrists of the creative power of education , are in direct contradiction with themselves . At one time , the uniformity observed among men , serves to prove that education does every thing ; at another , in order to explain the difference in characters , they allege the impossibility of the greater part of individuals receiving a uniform education . In fine , let us consult persons who devote their whole life to the education of men ; such as Campe , Niemeyer , Pestalozzi , Saizmann , Gedike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.; Every day furnishes them occasion to remark , that in each individual , dispositions diflfer from birth ; and that education can have no efiect , except in proportion to the innate qualities : if it were otherwise , how could these benevolent men be pardoned , and how pardon themselves , for not rooting out , in their pupils , all the faults , vices , all their fatal passions , and their base inclinations ? How should satirical authors , moralists , and preachers have had so little success against absurdities and crimes ? Why have not the great and the rich , purchased the art of giving a great capacity to their children ? Believe , then , that such an act is not entirely in the power of men . It is nature herself , that , by means of the immutable laws of organization , has reserved to herself not the only , but the first right , over every exercise of the faculties of man and animals . /q/ Cantinucttion of the exposition and of the refutation of different OpinionSj on the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate and Food on the Moral and Intellectual Forces of Man , Some naturalists would derive certain qualities from the influence of climate , from food , drink , and even from the milk furnished to the infant . This is to confess , that our qualities and faculties are inherent in our organization ; for , the milk of the nurse , food , drink , climate act only on man 's physical system . It is incontestable , that all these circumstances act with marked influence on our physical and moral nature ; but again , do we not confound the power of modifying with the power of producing ? The varieties of food and drink excite or weaken the action of the organs , but can neither produce them , nor cause their disappear ance . The nurse 's milk , like any other aUment , may be the cause of a physical constitution more or less healthy , and thus influence the character and the mind ; but it can neither give nor take away determinate incUnations or qualities . If parents have a right to impute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not we , who feed on beef , pork , mutton- , &c.,; render these ani  - -  mals responsible for our good and bad qualities ? It is equally notorious , that climate does not influence the whole constitution and the form of certain parts of the body only ; but likewise the different development of different parts of the brain , and , consequently , the different configuration of the head , and , lastly , the modifi* cations of the moral and intellectual character of different nations . But , however different , and however powerful local circumstances may be , they never have changed , and never will change the essence of an animal ox of any variety of the human species , /z/ Influence of Wants an the Instincts , Propensities , and Paculties of Animals , and of Man . Some , again , would have the necessities of man and of animals regarded as the principal source of their instincts , propensities and faculties . These necessities may be regarded under two aspects . If they come from without , such as cold , heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which rouse our internal faculties , is applicable to these . The accidents which incommode animal or man , lead them , it is true , to exercise their faculties , in order to rid themselves of the evil* ; but , it does not follow that these necessities give rise to the internal faculties : if it were go , the same external causes would produce , in all animals and in all men , the same qualities ; whereas , each animal and each man reacts in virtue of his organization on things without , and in the manner peculiar to himself The idiot tries no means to secure himself from the action of the air ; the sane man covers himself with clothing . The partridge dies with hunger sfnd cold in rigorous winters , and the swallow falls benumbed from the summit of buildings , while the nightingale and the quail depart for more temperate climates , without waiting for cold and hunger . The cuckoo has no less need to lay eggs , than the linnet ; yet he builds no nest . Are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide himself in his burrow , the other saves himself on the top of trees . Thus all that can be attributed to external circumstances is , that they put the various internal faculties in operation . If we call necessities , the internal movements , or sensations which lead both animal and man to seek something out of themselves for their satisfaction ; if , for example , we give the name of necessities to voluptuous desires , ambition , &c,,; it is evident , that these movements of the soul are only the result of the action of the interior /q/ organization ; since man and animal can have no such desires , so long as the organs adapted to them , are not in a state to act . This previous development and susceptibility of action are indispensable conditions , in order that the interior propensities may make themselves felt , and that the animal and the man may be excited to seek the objects , which find themselves in relation with their active organs . In the new-born infant , the need of the breast acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because , for the preservation of the child , a reciprocal relation has been established between him and the breast . By a contrary reason , the sexual organs of this child and their corresponding organ in the brain not being developed , there is not in him the slightest trace of the want relative to the other sex . But in proportion as these organs increase and become active , a new faculty , a new propensity is awakened in the interior man ; and it is the sense of this propensity which we call want . Does the object which is in relation with this propensity ofier itself to the eyes of the young man or the young girl ? their blood is roused ; while , on the contrary , the same objects being no longer in relation with the now worn-out organization of the old man , fail to excite him . Do the limbs develop themselves in the young animal or in the man ? the neceity of walking , jumping , running , and of exercisiuff themselves in all sorts of tricks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bird has need of a nest , the beaver of a house , that they acquire the talent of building ; but they have this talent because they are destined to build ; nature has , in a manner , impregnated their organization with this talent ; and when this organization fecomes active , they are internally prompted to build . Hence it is , that the weaver-bird forms her tissue even when encaged ; and hence the beaver builds , however well lodged he may be already . Nothing shows better that in this they follow the impulse of an internal faculty , without being determined by any external necessity . There are , likewise , men for whom travelling . /z/ music , 6cc.j are almost matters of necessity , because in these individuals , the organs which correspond to these propensities possess a predominant activity . It is , again , by the same principle , that we must explain , why men who have several organs eminently developed , experience a greater number of wants than those whose organs are less energetic . The idiot has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few desires , because few of his organs arrive at complete development , or any considerable degree of activity . As we advance in age , our internal wants diminish , because the activity of the organs is impaired . If , then , the internal wants are the result of the action of the cerebral organs , and if external things can not become the object of our wants , except by means of these same organs , the assertion of M. de Lamark* falls of itself . This author thinks , that the internal organs , ajs well as the external , are produced by necessity and by exercise . But a necessity can no more exist without a faculty , than the exercise of the faculty can exist without an organ . For the rest , as I do not believe that this strange opinion will find many partisans , I am going to present the leading idea of it , and to reply to it in a few words : Naturahsts , says M. de Lamark , t having remarked that the forms of the parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always in perfect relation , have thought that the forms and the state of the parts may have led to their use . Now this is an error ; for , it is easy to show by observation , that it is , on the contrary , the necessities and the uses of the parts which have developed these parts , which have given birth to them where they did not exist , and which , consequently , have given place to the state where we observe them in each animal . Thus , M. de Lamark supposes , that the sense of necessity exists before the internal organs and that the - Philosophie Zoolog . Paris , 1809 , T. i. ch. 7. /q/ exercise of the external or &^ans; precedes the existence of these organs : " The mole , " says he , " preserves her little eyes , only because she exercises them but little ; serpents having adopted the habit of crawling on the ground , and oihiding themselves under the grass , their body , by a succession of still repeated efforts to elongate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable length , out of all proportion to their size . " * Men , moved by the necessity of bearing rule , and of directing their vision both far and wide , have found themselves obliged to stand upright ; and this custom having been adopted , from generation to generation , their feet have acquired a conformation fitted to maintain them in a perpendicular position.t But what will M. de Lamark amswer to the following questions ? Why does not the mole make use of its eyes , and why has the serpent the foolish notion of crawling on the ground , and passing through narrow holes , as the wire passes under the drawing iron ? Whence comes in man the propensity to look " far and wide ? Aud , in the beginniug , when there existed neither interior nor exterior organ , what prevented the mole and the serpent from adopting different habits of life , and thus acquiring the eyes of the eagle , and the legs of the giraffe ? How can we believe that supreme wisdom has not placed each animal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties in accordance with the external organs ? Without this harmony , animals would be found in a violent state of perpetual contradiction , or would have perished after a few moments of existence . The tiger would have been destined to feed on flesh ; but have received neither the inclination nor the faculty to destroy other animals . The bird would have been intended to migrate from one climate to another ; but nothing in his /z/ internal organization would have warned him of it , and , perhaps , wings would have been wanting with which to fly . The bull would have been destined to pasture ; but he would neither possess scent to choose salutary plants , nor the teeth proper for their due mastication . And , into what difficulties should we not fall in fixing the limits , where the production and augmentation of external organs should finally be arrested . Man , to whom his two hands are often insufficient , would he always content himself to have only two 1 Would not eyes make their appearance on his back ? How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the neck of the swan be still more lengthened ? On the contrary , from the time of Aristotle , these parts have been as long as they now are : how is this to be explained ? Is it , as M. de Lamarksays , because birds have always remained in the same circumstances ? But , in stating this , he recognizes the principle , that nature originally prescribed to them to keep themselves in these circumstances . What cause could have prevented the marsh birds from gradually going deeper in the water , and from lengthening their feet and necks more and more by the continuance of their efforts ? Why should cats , rats , and sheep , who use their tails so little , not have lost them wholly ere this ? To what extent might not the power be increased possessed by animals , of augmenting the number of their limbs , or of being transformed from one species to another , by accidental causes , be increased ? The opinion of M. de Lamark might at least be adopted by some sects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul herself directs the formation of the body , which serves her for an investment ; while another maintains , that the species either ameliorate or degenerate without cessation , in such a manner that man might descend to the rank of the monkey , or the monkey raise himself to that of man . The reader will now be convinced , that there can not exist any necessity or natural occasion , without there /q/ existing an active organ , an impulse from within . Ifithout certain vital forces in the interior , there could be neither hunger nor thirst , nor necessity for respiration , nor necessity of the union of the sexes* Thus the esiterior necessities always suppose an interior force . Prom this we may form an opinion of the vague and obscure language of some naturalists : " The sensibility , more or less cultivated by the necessities and by circumstances , produces the different degrees of intelligence , whether in the species or in individuals . What we regard in them as the natural sagacity of instinct , frequently is only a development of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it is not to instinct , it is to the faculty of perception and its effects , that the means belong , which animals employ to satisfy the wants of their natural appetite . It appears certain , that , if cold and other external agents did not cuse the rabbit to suffer , more than the hare is affected by them , this animal , which now digs its burrow , would hardly be induced to take the trouble . " The same George Leroy , otherwise an excellent observer , wished to derive the cunning and in general the inventions and ingenious actions of animals , from a strong sense of want . The rabbits which we keep in our stables , are certainly not incommoded by the cold ; yet we can not prevent them from digging their burrows . And why does not the hare , when pursued by the hounds , feel the urgent necessity of seeking an asylum under ground ? How happens it that such different external circumstances produce absolutely the same instincts , the same inventions , the same ingenious actions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances en- gender opposite instincts , and very different inventions and ingenious actions in other species ? Why attribute to external circumstances the qualities of animals , when it is confessed , that the man of the greatest genius could add nothing to their sagacity , when it is aroused and exercised by difficulties ? /z/ Who does not see , that in all discussions on the natural wants , men have constantly confirmed the false notion that external objects create the instincts , propensities , faculties , with this other true notion , that external circumstances can arouse the faculties inherent in tfie animal , call them forth , and give them activity ? Can Attention give rise to any Instinct Pacultj/ , or Propensity whatsoever ? It has long been one of the favorite notions of many philosophers , that attention is the source of all the faculties of man ; that one may acquire such or such a Acuity , according as he directs his attention to such or such an object , according as he cultivates the faculty in question . Helvetius* has gone so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can not exercise his attention with all the force and the constancy , which would need to be employed in order to elevate him to the rank of the greatest men . Such is the eager zeal for deriving from a single principle all the phenomena of animal life ! Condillac made sensation the source of all the faculties . According to him , recollection , memory , comparison , judgment , reflection , imagination , and reasoning , are included in the faculty of perceiving . M. Laromiguiere , seeing that sensations are almost the same in all men , while their moral and intellectual faculties are infinitely different , and that the sensations are only passive , believed himself , obliged to admit attention to be the generating principle of all the faculties . The attention of Laromiguiere is the reflection of Locke . Meanwhile no one disputes that sensation , reflection and attention are innate faculties . But , do these faculties give rise to a specific propensity or talent ? De la Espirit Dumas , Physiologic , T. iv . p. 13. /q/ Let us see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reader will judge whether the faculties , instincts , and propensities , are an effect of attention , or whether attention is the effect of an innate instinct , propensity , or talent . Both men and animals are endowed with different instincts , propensities , and talents . With each instinct , propensity , and talent , nature has established determinate relations in the external world . There is , for example , a determinate relation between the silk-worm and the leaf of the mulberry-tree ; between the ferret and the rabbit ; between the duck and the water ; between the hen and her chickens ; between man and woman , fcc . It is thus , that every living being has certain points of contact with determinate external objects . The more energetic the instinct , the propensity , or the talent , the more numerous are these points of contact ; the more Ultimate are they , and the greater , consequently , the affinity of each quality to its determinate object . When an animal or a man is excited by the relation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the animal is found in a state of attention . The hungry fox scents the hare ; the falcon , gliding throuffh the air , perceives the lark ; they are then attentive ; the philosopher is struck with a happy idea ; he is then cUtentive . Now , you will explain why each animal has the habit of fixing his attention on a different determinate object , and why each different man fixes his on different objects . Tlie roe-buck and the pigeon regard with indifference , without attention the serpent and the frog , objects of the attention of the hog and the stork . The child fixes his attention on playthings ; the woman , on her children and on dress ; men , according to their individual dispositions , on women , horses , battles , the phenomena of nature , &c.; Hence , the difference which travellers make , in their descriptions of the same country and the same nation ; hence , the diversity of the judgments which different men pass on the same objects ; and , as La Bruyere says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to his fancy , every thing in a bdok repugnant to his taste , or , Trhich he judged nnworttiy his attention , there would not be a word or the autfior 's left in it . Every instinct , propensity , and talent , has , therefore , its attention . Attention is , therefore , an effect , an attribute of a pre-existing innate faculty , and any thing rather than the cause of this faculty . If instincts , propensities , and talents are feeble , their relations to their objects are equally so , and neither man nor animal will have a long or a strong attention . It is for this reason that , in infancy , when certain organs are still undeveloped , and , in old age , when the organs have lost their energy , we regard with coldness the same objects , which , at the age of manhood , excite our hveliest interest . There is no attention , not even the possibility of attention , where there is no interest , no propensity , no talent , in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention for the monuments , which we erect to glory and to immortality ? or , the ram , for our arts and sciences ? To what purpose to attribute , with Vicq d ' Azyr , the want of attention of monkeys , to their turbulence ? Show one a female , or a good fruit , and you will find him attentive . To wish to make him attentive to your lectures on neatness or decency , is to forget that his organization is imperfect in comparison with that of man , and that there exists no point of contact between these qualities , and the innate qualities of the monkey . The same thing takes place in idiots . No one , I suppose , will be tempted to derive from attention , the ingenious aptitudes , instincts , and propensities of animals . Who would maintain , that the beaver , the squirrel , the loriot , and the caterpillar , build , only in consequence of an attention , which they must have directed to these objects , when they were still unknown to them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were by instinct , without being aware of its own talent . PBTBIOLOGT OT TBB BBAItf. 190 In other respects , I leave attention and exercise , as well as education , possessed of all their rights . It is not enough for one to be endowed with active &culties; ex* ereise and application are indispensable to acquire fsucil* ity and skill . To awaken the attention of men of coarse minds , we must either make a strong impression on their senses , * or we must limit ourselves to the ideas and objects with which they are familiar ; that is to say , with which they have already points of contact . These considerations willl suffice to reduce to its just value the merit of the abstraction so much cherished by philosophers ,  --  attention . Can Pleasure and Pain produce any Moral QualUj/j or Intellectual Faculty ? Some rest on the doctrine of Aristippus , who explains , in an arbitrary and very inexact manner , the principle of his master , Socrates , with regard to the happiness of man ; to regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , not only of our actions , but likewise of all our quaUties and all our faculties . Animals , children , and half-idiots , are as sensible to desire and aversion , to pleasure and pain , as adult and reasonable men ; they ought , then , according to the opinion of Aristippus , to possess as many qualities , the one as the other . It is with desire and aversion as with attention . For what object does a man or an animal feel desire ? Is it not for the object , which is most in harmony with his propensities and his talents ? The setter has a desire for the chase ; the beaver for building , &e.; Such a man tastes the most Uvely pleasure in generously pardoning offences ; another rejoices when he succeeds in satisfying his vengeance ; this man places his hipiness in the possession of riches ; the pride of - Propensities . /z/ this man is a philosophy , which elevates him above human vanities . Desire and aversion , pleasure and pain , have , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faculties . Are the Persians and the Desire of Glory , the Source of our Qucdities and Faculties 7 Helvetius maintains , that the sources of all the qualities of the soul and mind , are the desire of distinction , and the passions ; and that , consequently , the moral and intellectual forces are not innate . Helvetius and his partisans ought first to demonstrate , that ambition and the passions , are strangers to the nature of man . If they are innate , then they must become , like any other internal impulse , excitants of the other qualities . The innate desire . of distinction , an ardent passion for a woman , will certainly animate the courage of the young warrior ; but 1 should vainly wish to shine in the first rank of poets , or of musicians ; all my efforts would be useless . Cicero never succeeded in making verses ; and Voltaire remained only tolerable in mathematics . The desire of glory , again modifies itself according to the predominant talents . The actor wishes to distinguish himself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musician , in music ; the architect , in monuments : the physician , in the art of healiijg . Whenever this desire amounts to ambition , to the love of glory , it is , at once , a proof that the actor , the warrior , the musician , &c.,; feel themselves penetrated with an energetic faculty , which sustains their activity in spite of all obstacles ; and which never fails , not only to give , but likewise to consolidate a brilliant reputation . The reasoning of Helvetius is a petitio principii . He would derive the faculties from the passions ; whereas the passions are the strongest expression of our faculties . Each instinct , propensity , each excessively active PHTfilOLOGT OF THE BRAIH . I6l talent , is a passion . Hence , the passion of love , the passion for travelling , the passion for music , building , war , d &c.; Consequently , the passions suppose the existence of the quaUties or the faculties of which they are the extraordinary manifestation . When Helvetius , to prove his assertion , advances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not render intelligent , we must conclude , that when he was in love , he found all the girls whom he met with intelligent . Does Social Life give rise to Factitious Qualities or Faculties ? Numberless works contain reveries on the natural state of man , and on the number of good and bad qual* ities which , as some say , he has acquired , only in social life . In this hypothesis we easily start with the supposition , that man was made for solitude ; that he has been led , contrary to his nature , to unite himself with other individuals , to form a family , a tribe , or nation . These new relations , for which he was not designed , have caused to spring up in him , all those vices and virtues , of which , in his natural state of insulation , he would forever have been ignorant . Let us examine , for some moments , the instinct of sociability in man and in animals . Some animals lead a solitary life , the male even separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and female remain united . In some species , the parents separate from their young , as soon as these are in a state to provide for their subsistence . In others , the parents and all the race of the year , form a little society till the return of spring , when the young ones seek to form for themselves an independent establishment ; and , finally , several species form flocks and live in common . In some , a single male couples with several females ; in others , each male joins for life with his particular mate . /z/ All these modes of living have always been invariable and are , by no means , the result of an arbitrary choice ; an evident proof that insulated existence , like social existence , are natural institutions for the different species of animals . Do not believe , what some naturalists imagine , that it is weakness and the need of mutual succor which brings together certain species in society . While so many powerless insects bring forth and live by themselves , why do the gnats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live together by thousands ? The fox is more feeble than the wolf ; but we never see him , like the wolf , associated with several of his comrades : the wren , the mockbird , the linnet , the nightingale , insulated in our groves , charm our ears by their melodious accents ; while the bold sparrow and the babbling rook , assembled by hundreds , deafen us from morning till evening . What advantage do the linnets , the sheep , derive from their union , when a single hawk , a single dog can disperse them 7 Have the headlong boar and the powerful bull more need to lend each other succor , than the timid hare , and the feeble insulated quail ? If it be social life which produces certain faculties , how do you conceive that each of the different species of animals which live in society , enjoys faculties so different , so opposite ? How should the mere plurality of individuals produce so many peculiarities , diversities of instincts , propensities and faculties ? Let us penetrate still farther into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill a void , to accomplish an end in the order of things . As soon as a species was ordained to live in society , it became necessary that all the individuals should be furnished with the qualities necessary to attain this end of the great family . Each individual must be fitted for the whole society . The qualities of each bee , and chamois , and beaver , had to coincide . According as this general end is different , the faculties of the individuals of whom a certain number is destined to form a society , are equally /z/ different . The establishment of sentinels among the bustards ; the direction of the herd by the leading chamois ; the common labors divided between several individuals among the bees and the ants ; the mutual aid which swine and monkeys give each other ; the direction of a flock of wild geese , always formed in a triangle in their flight ; all these instincts have been given to these animals , at the same time as the social instinct . It is absolutely the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in comilion . No where , and at no period , has man lived alone . As far as we can go back into history , man has been united in families , tribes , and nations , and , consequently , his qualities must have been calculated for society . The phenomena which we witness in whole races , are no more the effect of this union , than those which take place in each man in particular . Always , and every where , the human race has manifested the same propensities and the same talents ; always and every where , there have resulted the same virtues and the same vices , the same employments and the same institutions . There exists no crime against which we can not find a law in the bibld : calumny , theft , usury , incest , adultery , rape , mKroer , had already spread over the earth like a torrent . On the other hand , there exists no virtue , no moral precept , which has not been recommended , no faculty relative to human occupations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a laborer ; Abel , a shepherd ; the children of Jiibal played on all sorts of wind and stringed instruments ; the children of Tubal Cain were skilful workmen in iron and copper ; Nehemiah established regulations of police , &c.; The only changes we remark in the progress of human society , consist in this , that the same propensities , and the same faculties , are exercised on different objects , and produce modified results . The manners , customs , laws , different religious ceremonies of different nations , all rest upon the sanoe basis . Every where , men profess to do and believe what they regard as just and true ; every /z/ where , they profess to honor a Supreme Being ; every where , there are objects of vanity and glory , marks of honor and disgrace ; every where there are masters and servants ; all nations make war ; men and women are united in all climates , however different their creeds and the ceremonies of their union ; every where , there are mournings for deceased husbands and wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory honored , whether they embalm their bodies , place their ashes in urns , or place over them mounds or monuments . Sing your lines on the straw , or on the harp ; dress your chiefs with feathers or with purple ; your women , with flowers or with diamonds ; inhabit huts or palaces ; it will be still the same faculties , which lead men to act within the circle traced for him by his Creator . But some think to prove that man is bom without propensities and without faculties , and that he acquires these faculties merely by social life and by education ; by citing the example of some individuals found astray in the woods , who , having received no education , have all the brutality of animals , and appear to be not only deprived of human faculties , but even of those of the least intelligent animals . The objection falls , when we learn that these savages found in the forests , are ordinarily miserable creatures , of imperfect organization , as M. Roussel* and de Trac3rf have already remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Their heads are found to be either too large and aSfected with hydrocephalus , or too small , compressed and deformed ; almost always with a scrofulous constitution ; the eyes small , sunken , slightly opened upwards , closen horizontally ; the mouth very large , the lips pendant , the tongue thick , the tieck swollen , the pace staggering and insecure . Their primitive organization is , therefore , defective ; - M. Roussel , Syst . Phys. at moral de la fermme. t Ideologic , p. 246. /q/ they are real idiots , who can receive no instruction , and no education , and it is this fact which accounts for their being found in woods . As they are a charge to their families , and , as in certain countries , the people of the lower classes regard these unhappy beings as bewitched or as changelings , it often happens , that they expose them , or allow them to wander at their will without interference . It has even been remarked , in hospitals , that these deformed beings have a decided propensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape . They told us at the hospital at Haina , near Marbourff , that some of the idiots whom they kept there , made their escape , and that , in pursuing them , they sometimes found others who had escaped before , and who had nothing more than fragments of clothing . We saw near Augsbourg , an insane woman , who had been found in a wood . At Brunswick we were shown a woman completely idiotic ; she had been discovered in a wood , lyinff on her side , with her , eyes open , but unable to articulate . The savage of Aveyron placed in the deaf and dumb institution at Paris , is not different from those of whom I have just spoken . He is weak-minded to a great degree ; his forehead is very little enlarged laterally , ana very much compressed irom above downward ; his eyes are small and greatly sunken , his cerebellum little developed . We were not able to convince ourselves that he had the sense of hearing ; for , they could not in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sounding a glass behind his ears . His mode of existence is tranquil ; his attitude and manner of sitting are decent ; it is only remarked , that he is constantly balancing the upper part of his body and his head j he salutes by inclining his body , to the persons who arrive , and manifests his satisfaction when they depart . The sexual propensity does not seem to be active in him . He knows a few letters , and even points to the objects which the letters designate . In other respects , his favorite occupation is to restore to their former place any /z/ articles which have been displaced . Such is the result of the hopes which were formed of him , the efforts which have been made , and the patience and mildness which a benevolent woman has shown towards him . We may pronounce , with confidence , that these labors will never be crowned with any better success . The wild mcffi found in the forests of Lithuania , who is cited by many authors as an example of the powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When M. de Tracy , * in speaking of man in general , remarks that the individual who has received education has less resemblance to him who has received none , than an egg to a chicken , or an acorn to an oak , he speaks truth only in relation to these unfortunate beings ; but the experience of all times has proved , that they remain simple , whether they live in forests , or continue in the bosom of their family . The most immoderate panegyrist of the effects of education , Helvetius , is obliged to acknowledge , that a favorable organization is the primary requisite of education . It is difficult to believe , that , in our populous regions a well-organized man can wander for a long time as a savage . Should such an individual be found , who has gone astray from childhood , it is impossible that in his state of insulation he should have acquired any knowledge dependent on instruction . But even in this situation , he certainly must have exercised the faculties which belong to him as a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of society , he will be seen to develop human dispositions , not only by a prompt imitation of social usages , but by his capacity for instruction . It will not be possible to imeine , as was done in the case of the individuals referred to , that he has adopted the mode of living and th character of wild beasts . Example and instruction will soon change his mode of life ; or , if there is no change , the * Ideologic , p. 244. /q/ sabject is an idiot ; and education and circumstances can only- act upon a man so jfar as he possesses the necessary dispositions , and is prepared for them by his organization . Locke , to demonstrate that the qualities of the mind and soul have an accidental origin in social life , adduces the case of children , who , according to him , still want certain propensities and talents , and are destitute of passions . If Locke had been for a single day a mother or a nurse of children , he would have seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most evident marks of their passions , or rather of their affections . " It is useful , " says Cabanis , " to remark all those passions which succeed each other in so rapid a manner , and are depicted with so much simplicity on the changing face of children . While the feeble muscles of their arms and legs can hardly execute some uncertain movements , the muscles of the face already express , by distinct motions , although composed of very complicated elements , almost the whole succession of general affections proper to human nature ; and the attentive observer easily recognizes in this picture the characteristic traits of the future man . Where shall we seek the causes of these expressions , which are composed of so many diverse elements ? Where find the principle of these passions , which could not have formed themselves at once ? Certainly not in the impressions of external objects , still so new , so confused , so discordant . " Children possess , to a wonderful degree , the art of manifesting externally what passes within them ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are irritated by unjust treatment , and when the same accident happens without any intention of offending them ; they cry very differently to express pain , and to manifest weariness , anger , the desire to be changed , or to have the breast , &c.; And , if it be maintained , that at the age of some years , children have no passions , affections , or decided propen- /z/ sities , this is confounding the objects , on which the propensities act at different ages , with these propensities themselves . Children are not ambitious for places of honor ; they have no idea of robbing their fellow-pupib of their property by fraud ; they are not goaded by the desire of achieving conquests ; but they cheat each other for birds ' nests ; fight for playthings ; are proud of occupying the first places at school ; and the vexation at losing a kite which has got free , af9licts a boy more severely , than the loss of a fine horse would do at a later age . Who does not observe daily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , compassion , the love of gaming , avidity , ambition , and even pride , 5ruelty , extreme sensibility , &c.; ? We shall say , then , with much more truth , that children are , in almost every thing , the diminutive of adults . Let us concede to Locke That children do not yet manifest all the qualities and all the faculties proper to the adult , what consequence can be drawn thence against their innateness ? Must we not regard as innate , the . instincts of animals , the greater part of whom do not act immediately after their birth , nor even at all seasons of the year ? They do not always build their nest or their covert ; they are not always laying up provisions ; they do not emigite , or sing , or couple at all times . Locke was compelled to acknowledge , that he could not resist the proofs and the objections drawn from the animal kingdom ; but he pretends to answer them by saying , " that he did not write a philosophy of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuted , that man and animals have nothing in common between them , and are governed in all respects by opposite laws . But , not to go beyond men , will Locke and his partisans deny , that the propensity of love , for example , is allied to the organization 7 Yet we find no trace of it during their earliest years . If Locke had had more just ideas of the primitive faculties , he would have attributed to each of them a proper organ ; he would have known that the various nervous systems , and particularly the different organs of the /q/ brain exercise their functions independently of each other ; that their development and their activity are not complete in the same time ; but that they develop themselves successively , some sooner , some later ; that each organ , even when perfectly developed , may be sometimes active , sometimes inactive . Had Locke known all this , he would not have deluded himself with false observations ; and the principles which he has established , to explain the origin of the qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradiction with the nature of man and with that of animals . For the rest , many of these proofs have already struck and convinced some , both of the ancient and modem philosophers ; and they have , with me , acknowledged that there are no primitive qualities either acquired or &ctitious; ; but that , in man as well as in animals , all the dispositions are innate , and that their manifestation is rendered possible only by the organization . Plato* acknowledged that the talent of organization is innate . According to him , it is not enough , in order to be a philosopher , to join to the desire of knowledge a vast conception , good memory and penetration ; it needs , also , a peculiar disposition , which can not be acquired any more than these auxiliary faculties . He says , also , that the aptitude for mathematics is innate . He regards the desires and the sentiments of pride , courage , and sensual appetite not only as innate , but as founded on organ- ization.t Hippocrates , in speaking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that above all he needs the natural dispositions. duintillian ridicules the ancient maxim , " that any body , by means of constant application may become an orator . "  --  If precepts , " says he , " could bestow the art of eloquence , every one would be eloquent . " * De Repub. vi . t Let . Num. ii . /q/ 170 PfiYBlOLOGT OF THE BRAIK . Locke himself admits innate faculties . GondilfciC* though not consistent throughout his works , thus ex* presses himself on innate faculties : Men are ignorant of what they do , so lone as experience has not led them to take notice of what they actually do from nature only . Hence , they have never done by design , any thing but what they had already done , even without intending it . I think that this observation will always hold good ; and I also think , that if it had not escaped notice , men would have reasoned better than they have done . Men never thought of making analyses , till they found they had made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make themselves understood , till they found that they were understood . In like manner they would never have thought of speaking with articulate sounds , unless they had observed that they had spoken with such sounds ; and languages have coatmenced without any design of making them . It is thus that men have been poets and orators without dreaming of being suich . In a word , all that they have become , they have first been by nature alone ; and they have not studied to be such , till they had noticed what nature herself had led them to do . She has commenced every thing , and always well : this is a remark which we can not repeat too often . " If laws , " t says he , elsewhere , " are not conventional , they are then arbitrary ! There may have been arbitrary ones ; there are even too many , but those which determine whether our actions are good or evil , are not such and can not be such . They are , indeed , our work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have not made them alone ; nature made them with us , she dictated them to us , and it was not in our power to make others . The wants and faculties of man being given , the laws themselves are given ; and though we make them , the Deity who heis created us with such /z/ wants and such faculties is , in truth , our sole legislator . In following these laws thus conformed to our nature , it is him whom we obey , and this is what constitutes the morality of actions . " St. Paul* spoke in the same sense , in addressing the Romans . " If , " says he , " the Gentiles , who have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , they show the work of the law written in their hearts . " Hume regards covetousness , the sense of justice and injustice , the moral sense , &c.; as innate . Greorge Leroy speaks of compassion and religion , as innate sentiments . Herdert regards the sociability of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , " do not to another what you would not have another do to you , " is founded on the sympathy natural to man . He even regards ; as innate , the disposition of man to religion , and his propensity to honor superhuman beings and those of a superior order . I shall , elsewhere , completely prove these same truths . I shall , likewise , while treating of the different organs and the various primitive faculties , demonstrate that the talents for music , painting , architecture , the mechanics , imitation , geometry , mathematics , &c.,; which seem to be only talents acquired and produced by social life , are innate in man , and are indicated to him by his organization , as the laws of the hexagonal cell are to the bee ; to the nightingale , his melody ; and to the beaver , his building . I shall , also , make evident , that if the qualities of man were not determinate , society would only be confusion . 1 shall show that the determination of justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive laws of thought were not innate , there could exist neither logic nor philosophy ; in fine , that all the propensities and all the primitive faculties depend on a determinate and peculiar organization . /z/ ON THE CONDITIONS REaUIRED FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF MORAL aUALITIES AND INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES . In the section preceding , I have stated our opinion on the origin of the instincts , the propensities , the talents ; in fine , on the origin of our morialquahties and intellectual faculties . There now presents a second question , which is likewise of the highest importance to the physiology of the brain , to wit : whether these qualities and these faculties can , in this life , manifest themselves independently of material conditions ; or , whether they require for their exercise certain organs , with which they are in immediate relation . If our moral and intellectual forces can manifest themselves independently of corporeal conditions , we might in vain seek in the organization , the apparatuses of the moral qualities and the intellectual faculties . It would always be impossible to found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a physiology of the brain . Man , considered as a moral and intellectual being , would be placed beyond the sphere of the observer . If , on the contrary , I can show that there exists an essential relation between his moral and intellectual forces and his organization , it will follow , that the researches to discover these material conditions , are the most important study for the true physiologist . If , again , I can show , as I shall do in the second volume , that these material conditions are the brain and its parts , we shall then have a glimpse of the possibility of creating a doctrine of the functions of the brain , a doctrine which exhibits the organs , by means of which all our propensities sentiments and Acuities are manifested . /q/ The Manifestation of Moral Qualities and Intellectual Faculties depends on material conditions . When I say that the exercise of our moral and intellectual faculties depends on material conditions , I do not mean that our faculties are the product of organization ; this would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what can be submitted to our observation . Thus , I consider our moral and intellectual &culties; so far only as they become phenomena to us by means of the cerebral organs . The physiologist must never trust himself beyond the material world , and must neither affirm nor deny any thing but what can be proved by experience . He must not direct his researches to a spiritual substance alone , nor to this inanimate body alone ; the living man , the result of a vegetative life and an animal life is his object . Consequently , he must not enter into these metaphysical questions : What is the nature and the essence of the faculties themselves 7 Are they the attributes of a spiritual substance , or the properties of organized matter ? In a word , he must not seek to explain the union of the soul and the body , nor their reciprocal influence ; nor how the influence takes place , whether by the immediate action of the Deity , by an ethereal fluid , or by a divine emanation . Whether souls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed with different qualities in each individual , or are entirely similar in all ; whatever may be the decision of theologians and metaphysicians on this subject , my principle , that the manifestation of the moral qualities and intellectual faculties can take place only by means of organization , rests immoveable . The reader knows already , although I shall not prove it fully till the second volume , that the brain is the exclusive organ of our moral qualities and intellectual faculties . He will then be prepared to find that most of my arguments to establish my proposition , are relative to this grand and noble nervous system , /z/ 1 . The moral qualities and intellectual faculties man ' if est themselves , increase , and diminish , according as their organs are developed , increase in strength , and are impaired . What takes place in the functions of an inferior order and theii ' organs , likewise takes place in the functions and the organs of a higher order . Now , 1 have shown in sections first , second , and fourth , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different nervous systems develop and perfect themselves at different periods . It is thus , for example , that the nervous systems of the viscera of the abdomen and the chest are almost wholly formed , while the brain seems , as yet , only a pulpy mass . The olfactory nerve , and the nerve of taste , perfect themselves sooner than the auditory and the optic : we ' also see that the functions of taste and smell acquire their perfection sooner than those of hearing and sight . This phenomena especially takes place in those animals , which , when born , are deaf and blind . The same progress is remarked in the development of the brain . In newborn infants , we hardly discover any trace of fibres in the apparatuses which serve to strengthen and perfect this organ . These fibres show themselves distinctly in the posterior and middle lobes sooner than in the anterior . The fibrous structure of the cerebellum becomes visible only by degrees , and it is not till after several months , that the anterior and superior parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is formed and increases gradually until it has attained its perfection , and this perfection takes place only between twenty and forty years of age . At this last period there seems to be no sensible change for some years ; but in proportion as we advance in age , the system gradually lessens , the brain emaciates and diminishes in size , and its convolutions become less compact . /q/ This successive and gradual order of development , stationary state , and failure , is the cause , and serves to explain , why , in the new-born infant , the only functions are those of the senses of voluntary motion , the expression of the want of nourishment , and of obscure sensations of pleasure and pain , desire and aversion ; why all this takes place only to an imperfect degree ; why the infant begins , by degrees , to attend to external objects , to act on them , to manifest determinate desires and propensities ; how the impressions are preserved , and how these impressions become ideas and notions ; how the qualities and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imase of different talents as well as different propensities ; for example , love , friendship , vanity , ambition , pride ; how the infant becomes successively a child , a young man and an adult ; how , at this period , all the moral and intellectual forces of the man have acquired their greatest energy , up to the moment when they begin to fail , and to lose insensibly more or less of their permanency and activity ; in fine , how in old men there remain only blunted sensations , and weakness of mind . We see , clearly , by this succession of development , that the faculties of the mind and soul , and their manifestation follow , step by step , the state of their material conditions . The progression of the functions is the same as that of the organs . Nothing can show more evidently , that the manifestation of these faculties depends on the organization . 2 . When the development of the organs of the moral qualities and intellectual faculties does not follow its usual order , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its usual regular progress . We frequently observe in the rickets , that the intellectual faculties of children are more lively , than their age would warrant . The reason is , that one of the or- /z/ dinaxy effects of this malady , is to give the brain an extraordinary degree of development and of irritability . Sometimes , inde a particular part of the brain is developed prematurely , without there being any disease to occasion it ; and , io this case , the function proper to this part tails not to manifest itself at the same time . We nave , for example , observed several children , in whom the part of the brain appropriated to , physical love , had acquired an extraordinary development at the age of three or four years . These children were mastered by this unhappy propensity , although their sexual parts , even when they experienced sonoe excitement , had rarely acquired an analogous development . Other children , in whom the same organization was remarked , manifested the phenomena of complete virility , while the other faculties were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts relative to the organs of each faculty . Does it happen that the different parts of the brain , or the totality of the organ , acquire their maturity and their solidity only at a very late period ? The state of infancy and of half imbeciUty then prolongs itself to the age of from six to twelve years . But , at this period , nature seems to labor with new energy , for the development of the parts ; and children from whom , until this moment , no capacity had been expected , become , in a short time , remarkable for their talents . This was the case with Gesner , one of the best and most amiable poets of Switzerland . Bom of a family in which rickets were hereditary , his instructors , when he had attained the age of ten years , declared him entirely incapable of making any progress . One of the most distinguished physicians of Berlin could not , till his thirteenth year , combine his ideas nor make use of the organ of language . The simultaneousness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precocious or late . development of their organs , is therefore , a constant phenomenon which can not be ccdled in question . Now it necessarily results from this phenomenon , that the exercise /q/ of the qualities of the mind and soul depend on material organs . 3 . If the development and the perfection of the cerebral organs ha not been camplete the manifestations of the respective qualities and faculties rem , ain equally incom , plete . Although the energy of the functions of organs does not depend solely on their development , but also on their excitability , we may yet determine with confidence the degree of development of the brain necessary to its functions . The observations of all ages have established , that the brain is incapable of fulfilling its destiny , when its bony case or the cranium has only from thirteen to seventeen inches in circumference , the measure being taken on the most prominent part of the occiput , passing over the temples and the most elevated part of the forehead . Willis has described the brain of a young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of that of an ordinary human brain . I have had a copy drawn after Willis in my large work . ( PL XVIII . fig. 2 . ) M. Bonn , professor at Amsterdam , possesses two little skulls of idiots , and the brain of a simpleton who lived to the age of twenty-five years . ( PL XX . fig. 1 . ) He was so stupid , that , though born at Amsterdam , they made him pass for an African savage , and exhibited him for money . M. Pinel has a similar cranium of a young girl of eleven years , perfectly idiotic . Among the anatomical preparations of the school of medicine at Paris , is also found the undeveloped cranium of an idiot child . I have had two similar skulls drawn , taken from my collection ; both are remarkable for their smallness ; * one is the skull of a child of seven years ; /z/ the other of a girl of twenty . These two individuals were perfectly imbecile . I have observed heads equally small , in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads are from thirteen to fourteen inches in circumference , and eleven to twelve from the root of the nose to the great occipital foramen . If dwarfe , who enjoy their intellectual faculties to a certain degree , appear to form an occasional exception to this law , the size of the head has not been duly noticed , which , in these cases , is always very disproportionate to the rest of the body . Even when the head is a little larger than those which characterize complete imbecility , the intellectual faculties ar still almost entirely benumbed . In the different degrees , which characterize imbecility , the faculties manifest themselves in the same proportion as the brain becomes more perfect in its organization . Individuals , who are in this degree of development , exhibit some peculiar dispositions and propensities ; their gestures become more significant ; they go so far as to produce short phrases sufficiently well followed out . The functions thus elevate themselves together with the organization , until the feebleness of the mind betrays itself in a small number of points , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , that all individuals who are reputed simple , are not completely so . Parents and physicians sometimes have trouble in comprehending how a child , who acquits himself well in all there is to do in the house , and who exhibits exact sensations , sensibility , and even cunning , can be ranged in the class of simpletons . Such is , notwithstanding , the state of many children , who hear , but do not learn to speak . I have directed my attention to this point , while occupying myself with the functions of the sense of hearing ; t and when I treat of the articulate language peculiar to man , I shall show that this accident has for its cause an organic PI . XIX. fig. 1 and 3. t Anat. et Phys. du Cer . T. 1 . s. 6. /q/ malady of the brain , and a consequent want of power to exercise all its functions . At Hamburg , we saw a young man of sixteen , in whom the anterior-inferior parts of the head were well developed ; but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anterior-superior parts had been checked in their development ; and he enjoyed , in consequence , only the exercise of the functions belonging to the anterior-inferior portion . He learned names , dates , numbers , history , and repeated it all mechanically . But combination , the comparison of ideas and judgment , were entirely wanting . They regarded him with reason as simple , and could employ him in nothing . I shall have occasion in the course of this work , to cite several examples which confirm the proposition , that the defective development of the brain , or of particular organs , has always for its result the feebleness of their action . 4 . When the organs of the mind and soul have acquired a high degree of development a7id pe7'feciion , there residts to these organs a power of Tnanifesting their functions with great efiergj/ . I shall prove the truth of this result , when I treat of the influence of the development of organs on the excise of the corresponding faculties . I shall show , at the same time , that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a determinate quality , or when they fall into a fixed idea , propensity , partial mania , or monomania , by too great exaltation , it is almost always the extraordinary development of some particular organ which occasions it . Without now entering into these details , I shall content myself with fixing the attention of my readers on the manifest difference which every one may remark between three sorts of heads , to wit : the heads of idiots , the heads of men whose talents are only moderate , and those of illustrious men , of vast and eminent genius . The first are
