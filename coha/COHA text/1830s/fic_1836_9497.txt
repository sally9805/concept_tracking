Scene 1 : A beautiful garden belonging to Ibad 's house . Enter Davina and Lira , L.H. Lira . Lira What , sister , forever thinking of that false-hearted Mourad ? Now , if I were in your place , Davina , instead of grieving thus , I would endeavor to punish him . Dav . Davina Punish him , Lira ? Lira . Lira Aye ; treat him with the same indifference that I do his friend Salek , and I promise you , your easy coxcomb will soon become a pining lover again . Take my advice and never fret about him ; you have suitors enough besides . There is our father 's choice , the stranger Abdallah  --  Dav . Davina Oh , Lira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although I confess I admire his generous sentiments . Lira . Lira And his wealth appears unbounded ; so our father admired him also . But what say you to Alcouz , the Caliph 's jester ? Dav . Davina The coxcomb imagines every woman that looks at him is in love with him . Lira . Lira And then , when all fail , there is the old Cadi . Dav . Davina His treatment of Salek in withholding his property as his guardian has made me despise him . Lira . Lira And I agree with you ; for no one has a right to injure Salek excepting myself . Ibad . Ibad Wit hout Ho , Kazrak , carry the large vase into the hall and fill up all the lamps . Lira . Lira Hark , our father 's voice . What a bustle his intended marriage with Rozelea has occasioned ! Enter Ibad , Kazrak following Ibad . Ibad Speaking as he enters But stay , Kazrak . First , carry this bottle of my grand elixir to the old fat widow . Tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get married and have n't time to see the effect of my medicine . What , standing idle at such a busy time ! Away , girls . Stir . Stir and hearken , Davina : One . feast shall serve for two weddings . So I am determined this day to give you a husband  --  the rich , the golden Abdallah . Dav . Davina Today , sir ! Consider , he is an entire stranger . Ibad . Ibad You 'll soon be acquainted ; never fear that , and ' t is best not to know each other too well before marriage . There would be fewer marriages in the world if that were the case . Dav . Davina But , dear father  --  Ibad . Ibad Hush  --  no objections . I have determined and I 'll hear no objections . There was that knave Alcouz asked my consent for your hand this morning , but the rogue is poor and I am astonished at his assurance . Seeing Kazrak Not gone yet ! Run , skip , fly with the elixir to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . Ibad . Ibad No hurry ? Why , she 's as low as she can be . Kaz . Kazrak I suppose she is , by this time . Ibad . Ibad What , is she dead ? Kaz . Kazrak She took your elixir , sir . Ibad . Ibad Every dog has his day is an old proverb . Kaz . Kazrak Her friends are about to bury her . Will you not attend her to the grave ? Ibad . Ibad Not I. She owes me for six months ' attendance already . And on my wedding day  --  ca n't think of it . Kaz . Kazrak Indeed , sir , I 'm afraid you 'll repent of this intended marriage with Rozelea . Lira . Lira It will make us all unhappy  --  and at your time of life . Ibad . Ibad Ha , what 's this ? Kaz . Kazrak Ah , sir , I am not yet half your age , and the very name of a woman makes me shudder . Whew ! Lira . Lira And such a stepmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have considered , I tell you . Dav . Davina And , dear father , postpone my marriage for a week at least . Kaz . Kazrak And your own forever . Ibad . Ibad What , all open-mouthed upon me ? Why , ye noisy jades , have you not heard of the new law of the Caliph which obliges each honest Mussulman to become a husband , a soldier , or to pay a fine of one-third of his estate ? I am not such a fool as to part with my money . I 'm too old for a soldier , and so I 'm resolved to marry . Kaz . Kazrak Have a care that you are not too old for a husband , too , sir . Ibad . Ibad Ha ! Kaz . Kazrak But surely , sir , your age exempts you from the law . Ibad . Ibad My age ? Exempt ? Why , you caitiff , am I not an honest citizen , and do n't I pay my taxes regularly , and must I reap no benefit from their laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not be exempt . I 'd rather pay the fine than be exempt . What say ye now ? Lira . Lira But this law does not apply to Davina . Pray , spare her . Dav . Davina I shall never be happy with Abdallah , I 'm sure . Ibad . Ibad You ca n't be sure of that before trial . Any other objection ? Lira . Lira Consider the happiness of your daughter . Kaz . Kazrak Aye , pray do , and consider your own reputation . Ibad . Ibad Ha , anything else ? Dav . Davina Consider that Abdallah may be a villain . Ibad . Ibad Impossible . Did he not give me a thousand sequins by way of a nuptial present , and promise me ten times the same when he should marry you ? A villain indeed ! But have n't I practised physic these thirty years , and do n't I know that gold dust is an antidote to all scandalous reports ? So , anything else to object ? Kaz . Kazrak You 'll be the laughingstock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lira . Lira An example for all cruel fathers . Ibad . Ibad Ha ! Turning Dav . Davina The destroyer of your daughter 's happiness . Ibad . Ibad Ha ! Turning Kaz . Kazrak The dupe of a designing woman . Ibad . Ibad Clatter , clatter , clatter . I 'm deafened , stunned . Out of my sight ; away , ye rebellious plagues . Out , out , begone . As he drives them off . Enter the Cadi Cadi . Cadi So  --  preparing yourself for matrimony , I see . Ibad . Ibad Ha ! Oh , the devil ! My dear friend , I hope I see you well . Cadi . Cadi Aside That 's a lie . But to vex you , I was never better . Aloud So , you are going to be married I hear . Ibad . Ibad Yes , but I hope you do n't think I act imprudently ; you know the late law . Cadi . Cadi To be sure I do , and so I 'll take a wife myself . Ibad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse . Cadi . Cadi Yes , today I shall marry my little Davina . What say you ? Ibad . Ibad Nothing . Aside He has struck me dumb . Pulse rapid ; hum , feverish , very feverish . Cadi . Cadi Come , come , my dear friend , she has passed for your daughter long enough . ' T is my turn now , and I am determined that she shall pass for my wife . I think she has been under your hands for fifteen years . Ibad . Ibad Asid e I wish I had you under my hands for as many minutes . Hum , fluttering pulse . Cadi . Cadi And during that time I dare say you must have turned the jewels that her mother possessed at her death to some advantage . Ibad . Ibad Aside Rather consumptive . Hum . Cadi . Cadi The amount was great . Ibad . Ibad Asid e Bled freely . Cadi . Cadi And as I have as yet received nothing , I think it is high time for me to come in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e Stark mad , by Mahomet . Aloud Let me tap you , Kazrak ! Cadi . Cadi Tap me ? What the devil do you mean  --  tap me ? Ibad . Ibad Aye , trepan you or blister you . Anything in the way of my profession , with the greatest pleasure . Cadi . Cadi Tap and trepan me ? Bless me ! I was never better in all my life . Ibad . Ibad You imagine so , but I fear not . You look so shockingly , the very sight of you affects me . Go home , go home , and do n't stir abroad for a month . Cadi . Cadi Why , you old , villainous  --  Ibad . Ibad See how passionate you are . The very symptom of the prevailing disorder . Cadi . Cadi And I want to marry Davina ; I suppose that 's another symptom . Ibad . Ibad Blood feverish , brain flighty . Not in a fit state to talk of business ; a few hours ' sleep necessary . Go home , go home ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if I could persuade you to take a box of these pills  --  Aside you 'll not trouble me again in a hurry . Cadi . Cadi Come , come . This will not serve your turn . I 'm not fool enough to trust myself in your hands , for I know that you wish me out of the way that the mystery concerning Davina 's birth may still remain concealed . But when I die it shall not be by your poisons , I promise you . Ibad . Ibad My poisons ! But , my dear friend , why should we quarrel ? Remember your treatment of Salek and cease to rail at me about Davina . Cadi . Cadi Speak lower . Ibad . Ibad I dare say when his dying father left you guardian of his son 's estate he did not intend that you should enjoy the profits of it . Cadi . Cadi Speak lower  --  lower yet ! Ibad . Ibad So , if you lay no claim to Davina 's hand , I relinquish my right and title to Salek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that his dying father meant that I should share it with you ? Ibad . Ibad That 's nothing to the purpose ; I must be paid for being secret as well as yourself . Cadi . Cadi A side The old villain ! Aloud But , my dear friend , there is a wide difference between the case of Salek and that of Davina . I 'll give you the law on this subject . Ibad . Ibad You need n't explain . I know that the law would reward us both with a bowstring . True , there is a wide difference between the cases . For I brought Davina up as my own child , whereas you leave Salek to starve in poverty . Cadi . Cadi I know the cause of this compassion for Salek ; he had a liking for your daughter Lira , and you would have him arry her . But be cautious , for you know you 're in my power . Ibad . Ibad There now ! How you fly out for nothing ! But come in , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we 'll understand each other , I 'm sure . Aside An old villain . Exit Cadi . C adi All 's not safe till old Ibad 's farther in my power . He will do anything for money , and luckily I know his fearful nature and will work upon it . He shall find that I was not made Lord Cadi of Bagdad to be outwitted by an old physician . Ha , prodigal ! Enter Salek Salek . Salek Well met , my Lord Cadi ; I wished to see you . Cadi . Cadi That 's more than I can say of you , sir . Salek . Salek What , ashamed to see the man you have injured ? Then there are still hopes remaining . Cadi . Cadi Injured ? Have a care what you say . Remember , I follow the law . Salek . Salek No , sir , you far outstrip it . But deal justly by me or it shall quickly follow you . By means of your office you have kept my fortune from me many years , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cadi . Cadi Forever troubling me on this subject . Ah , boy , I fear that when the estate is settled there will be but little left ; what with discharging such numberless debts and satisfying your prodigality , nearly all is swallowed . Salek . Salek My prodigality ! As yet I 've received nothing from you . Cadi . Cadi O Mahomet , nothing ! My accounts will tell another tale , I warrant you . Salek . Salek I plainly foresee that nothing but force can bring my fortune from your clutches , and , rest assured , I shall use it . Cadi . Cadi Ha , youngster , do you wish to be married ? Have a care how you threaten me or  --  Salek . Salek But think not to affright me by attempting my happiness , for I 'll join the army and evade your malice . Cadi . Cadi Will you ? A happy riddance , for in a few days it will leave the city . Perhaps you had better pay the fine . Salek . Salek Do you ridicule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , for if I listen to you longer , notwithstanding your age , you may provoke me to chastisement . Exit Cadi . C adi Humph , this fellow grows troublesome , and to get rid of his eternal clamors I must drive him to the army , for pay the penalty he can not an marry I think he will not . So off he goes . That point being settled leaves my mind at rest ; and now for my little Davina , my rosebud , my nightingale . Exit Scene 2 : The street before Ibad 's house . Enter Alcouz with a paper in his hand . Al . Alcouz Well , Alcouz , thou'rt a deep one ; this is really a master plot . I shall become old Ibad 's son-in-law in spite of him , for Davina , poor little soul , is so fond she 'll go any length to get me . Enter Rozelea Hey , Rozelea , my little queen , I wish you joy . Roz . Rozelea Have you relented ? Al . Alcouz Relented ? Ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear cruel one . Roz . Rozelea I 'll condescend again to ask you to fulfill your promise . Will you marry me ? Al . Alcouz Popt the question , by the prophet ! Ha , ha , ha ! But why trouble me now , my dear ? We should consider ourselves as fairly rid of each other , for you are already provided for with old Ibad , and I fancy I shall suit myself before many days . Roz . Rozelea Contemptible villain ! Al . Alcouz Pshaw , do n't get in a passion about it . See , I 'm perfectly cool . Now , I daresay the old physician will make a very clever sort of a husband , though it must be allowed there 's a wide difference between him and me . Ha , ha , ha ! Roz . Rozelea Peace , or I shall despise myself for ever thinking of you ; but know , base wretch , that your situation in life alone induced me to listen to your buffoonery . Al . Alcouz Ha , ha ! pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear , just to check the license of your tongue a little ? Roz . Rozelea Does it sting you ? Well , I am justly treated for listening to such an ape . Al . Alcouz An ape , ha , ha ! Poor thing knows nothing of the fashionable world , I see . But good words , my dear , or the old Ibad may hear of your tricks . Roz . Rozelea Do you threaten me ? Al . Alcouz I merely hinted it , thinking you had forgot that you are in my power . Nothing more , my dear  --  friendly you know . Roz . Rozelea But you must acknowledge that you have treated me shamefully , driven me to the last resource , compelled me to deceive a worthy man to hide my shame . Al . Alcouz Well , my dear , since some worthy man must be deceived , I had rather old Ibad should suffer than myself . That 's all . But someone approaches , and for your sake we had better not be seen together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in love with a man they behave very foolishly indeed . Halloo ! Her house . Knocking Ibad . Ibad Entering What 's the matter , what 's the matter ? Ha , you here again ? Al . Alcouz Your very humble and obsequious  --  ha , ha . Ibad . Ibad Leave off your grinning , and to your business . Al . Alcouz Davina . Ha , ha ! Have I your consent ? Ibad . Ibad Aye , to hang yourself . Aside What does the puppy mean ? Aloud I thought you had your answer this morning . Al . Alcouz Pshaw , might have changed your mind since . I 'm the boy ; no girl can stand before me  --  piercing eye , fine leg , smiling countenance . It will do  --  ca n't fail . Touch them under the left breast  --  whiz  --  sigh , tremble , faint , plump in my arms . Bring your daughter . Show you the whole process , and , damme , give you a lesson gratis , ha , ha ! Ibad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane . Al . Alcouz Cane ? Intend to walk , hey ? Ibad . Ibad No , but I intend that you shall . Al . Alcouz Very obliging , but I never use one , sir . Look at my legs , ha , ha ; now just let Davina have a peep at them , will you ? They 'll tickle her mightily , I warrant you . Ibad . Ibad Damme , I 'll tickle you . Calling Kazrak , my cane . Al . Alcouz I should be sorry to put you to that trouble ; so hand this letter to your daughter , and I 'm off . Ibad . Ibad A letter from you ? Either you are mad or you think me a fool . Al . Alcouz Admit both  --  you a fool in grain , and I mad in love , the tender passion . Oh , sighing sentiment and all that have made me mad enough to marry Davina . Ha , ha , ha ! Ibad . Ibad Was there ever such an impudent  --  marry Davina ! Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such laughing matter and it was a long time before I could bring my mind to it , although I have the choice of all the beauties in Bagdad . Oh , I 'm the boy , ha , ha ! Ibad . Ibad Hang me , if this is n't too much , ha , ha , ha ! Al . Alcouz Stop your laughter and look at this scrawl from my friend , the Caliph . Aside Admirably executed by myself . Ibad . Ibad Eh , what ? This is directed to Mourad . Al . Alcouz You know that under the late law he superintends most marriages ; so His Highness directed it to him that my wishes might surely be fulfilled . But read the note ; ' t is very laconic , neatly penned , exquisite , ha , ha ! Ibad . Ibad Reads " As a reward for my worthy Alcouz ' services , I wish him married immediately to the bearer . Zalreka . " Al . Alcouz A strange kind of reward , that  --  always feel the effects of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give this to whom you please ? Al . Alcouz Just so . And to prove the esteem I have for you , I 'll bestow it on Davina . Ibad . Ibad On Davina ! Al . Alcouz Hey , what 's the matter ? I fear you have n't a just sense of the obligation . My making this choice , I assure you , cost me much trouble . Ibad . Ibad As ide And me ten thousand sequins . Al . Alcouz But you are a made man now . I 'll patronize you , ennoble you , raise you from the dirt , ha , ha ! Yes , it will do . Make you physician to the Caliph  --  have the honor of dosing His Highness  --  glorious . Ha , ha , ha ! Ibad . Ibad No , no . Make me your physician  --  that 's all I ask . Al . Alcouz A hit  --  soon stop my laughing , ha , ha , ha ! I see how it is with you ; but answer me one simple question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choking ! Eh , why do you ask ? Choking ! Al . Alcouz A mere trifle . Should you happen to forget to give the Caliph 's command to your daughter , a bowstring may try your patience , that 's all . Ibad . Ibad A bowstring ! Oh , I 'll not forget . Never fear , never fear : I 'll not forget . Al . Alcouz That 's right , for if you were choked the honor of your family would be gone ; they would never get over it . Ibad . Ibad I 'm certain I should never get over it . A bowstring , oh , dear ! Al . Alcouz But raise your spirits . Deliver the letter to Davina and you are safe . I 'll to Mourad and shall expect her there immediately . Ha , ha , it will do , yes , it will do . But hearki  --  a word in your ear , old dad . Ibad . Ibad Well , what now ? Al . Alcouz You 'll remember the bowstring  --  that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibad Oh , never fear , I 'll not forget , I 'll not forget . Was ever honest man so hampered ? And on his wedding day ? Exit ACT II . Scene 1 : Ibad 's house . Enter Ibad . Ibad . Ibad There is the Cadi . His knowledge of my secret may ruin me . Here 's Abdallah  --  ten thousand sequins lost ! And here 's this knave Alcouz with his terrible letter . Should I destroy it , there'sthe bowstring . Oh , was ever honest man so miserable on his wedding day ! Calls Davina ! Enter Davina , R.H. Here , take this letter . Aside as he is going But I must first seal it , for if she knows the contents , all is over with my head . Dav . Davina Stay , sir . My Lord Cadi forced this ring upon my finger and , as I have entreated him in vain to receive it again , I beg you will return it to him . Ibad . Ibad Ha , a rich jewel . Aside The very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy his silence . Davina , I have to seal this letter ; follow me . Oh , dear , what a wedding day this is ! Exit Dav . Da vina My mind is harassed with fears . My father seems determined to sell me to the stranger Abdallah , and the importunities of the Cadi make me completely wretched . O Mourad ! Enter Salek , R.H. Salek . Salek Charming Davina , I was in hopes to have seen my lovely Lira , but I find you melancholy . Nay , nay , I know your thoughts . I have lately parted with Mourad , and indeed his heart is wholly yours , notwithstanding his apparent coldness . Dav . Davina Ah , Salek , I am surrounded by evils , and should Mourad prove false  --  Salek . Salek Fear him not . I know his foible . He fears the laughter of thoughtless companions , should he submit to the ties of wedlock , now that this law is in force . But , believe me , he is still the devoted lover of Davina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am threatened with dangers which I fear I can not avoid . Salek . Salek Confide in me ; perhaps I may assist you . Dav . Davina You are not ignorant of my Lord Cadi 's love . There is a wealthy stranger , and my father  --  but may his name ever be mentioned with reverence . Salek . Salek I understand you . I , too , have everything to fear from the malice of my Lord Cadi ; for even now when I taxed him about my fortune , he threatened me with this new marriage law . Davina , if you will consent , we can do each other a mutual benefit . A day will be of the utmost importance . Dav . Davina Even an hour , for every moment I dread being forced to marry the stranger . But how can we assist ourselves ? Salek . Salek Should my Lord Cadi threaten me , I 'll report that I am married and that you are my bride . That at once will place me beyond his power , protect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps discover to me the state of my Lira 's affections . Dav . Davina O Salek , the step is dangerous . Ibad . Ibad Within Davina ! Salek . Salek Pray , consent . ' T is a deceit that our situations will surely justify . Ibad . Ibad Ca lls again Davina ! Dav . Davina Hark , I am called  --  I tremble . Do as you please ; only extricate me from my difficulties . Salek . Salek Fear not . We shall succeed . Exeunt Scene 2 : An apartment in the palace . Mourad and Salek discovered . Many men and women in the background . Mour . Mourad Thus it is every day . I 've a more crowded levee than the Caliph himself . Salek . Salek This strange law has created much noise in the city . Mour . Mourad That 's very natural where there are so many married people . Ha , more business ; I thought my morning diversion was ended . First Man . First Man Halloo , where 's the executioner ? Mour . Mourad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Man . First Man Oh , curse , all nimble-footed officers of justice ! Mour . Mourad Well , sir , your choice ? A wife , the army , or pay five hundred sequins ? First Man . First Man My dear sir , I beg you will choose for me , for I should never forgive myself if I chose either . Mour . Mourad If I were in your place I 'd pay the penalty . First Man . First Man You 'd find that a harder task than you imagine . Mour . Mourad Pshaw , a gentleman of your appearance can not want five hundred sequins . First Man . First Man No , but gentlemen of my appearance generally want five thousand . Mour . Mourad Then what say you to a wife ? First Man . First Man No , I thank you . I 'd rather war abroad than at home ; so mark me in the army list . Second Man . Second Man Coming forward Well , Mourad , I 've weighed the matter and will pay the fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow mad ? Pray , consider . Second Man . Second Man I have considered . First Man . First Man Then consider again , for five hundred sequins are worth a second thought . Second Man . Second Man I know it . First Man . First Man Then keep your money and come with me . I 'll show you how to spend it decently . Come along , my noble lad , and I 'll warrant you 'll rise in the service . Second Man . Second Man I do n't know that , but I shall take care not to fall in the service . First Man . First Man Whiz ! I 'm off . Ho , for the army . Exit Second Man . Second Man And I may as well go , too . Exit Mour . M ourad What do I see ? Alcouz ? I suppose he comes to gather food for his mirth . Enter Alcouz Al . Alcouz Ha , ha , ha ! This is the place for business . Hey , Mourad ? For most men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of their lives , ha , ha , ha ! Mour . Mourad I hope , Alcouz , soon to settle you for life . Al . Alcouz What , by marrying me ? Faith , that 's a load heavy enough to settle any man , ha , ha , ha ! But you know , Mourad , we can not be always cruel , and it runs strangely in my head that Davina will be married shortly . Mour . Mourad Married ? Davina ? To whom , pray ? Al . Alcouz I may safely say , to as handsome a lad as frequents the court . But who , in the name of ugliness , have we here ? Enter Kazrak in woman 's apparel , veiled Kaz . KazrakAside Oh , why did Miss Davina send me to this fatal place ? If I am discovered to be a man I shall surely be married . Al . Alcouz Ha , ha , ha ! What can the old witch want ? Perhaps a husband . Kaz . Kazrak A side Ah , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me even in this dress . Aloud A letter for your lordship . Al . Alcouz A side ' T is provoking that Davina should keep me waiting . Aloud What , Mourad , are you the favorite ? Mour . Mourad Reads the note Ha , ha , ha ! Al . Alcouz Let us have it . Mour . Mourad Read , Salek , for Alcouz ' diversion , ha , ha , ha ! Salek . Salek Reads " As a reward for my worthy Alcouz ' services , I wish him married immediately to the bearer . Zalreka . " Al . Alcouz Bit , by the prophet . Kaz . Kazrak A side Marry me to the little courtier ! Mour . Mourad May the Caliph 's commands ever be obeyed ! Lead your intended bride into that room . I 'll quickly follow . Al . Alcouz No hurry required . Bless me , what would you be at ? Mour . Mourad Obey the Caliph 's will , to be sure . I suppose it is intended as a punishment for your tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazrak Yes , sir  --  la , no , sir . A reward for his services as the note says , and I beg you , have this business done quickly . Aside That I may escape as soon as possible . Al . Alcouz How hot upo n't the old witch is ! What it is to be a personable man ! Mour . Mourad Well , Alcouz , lead your intended bride in ; I shall soon tie you up . Al . Alcouz The executioner sooner . You are surely not in earnest ? Mour . Mourad Yes , but I am , though I was never more inclined to laugh in my life , ha , ha , ha ! Al . Alcouz Then hang me , if I cut this joke for your diversion ; for if I do , I fear I shall never cut another . So I 'm off . Mour . Mourad Do you resist ? Ho , guards ! Al . Alcouz Ha ! What , my dear fellows , have you no compassion ? Only look at her  --  place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you have nothing to fear on that score , ha , ha , ha ! Away with him ! Al . Alcouz Oh , dear ! Harki , Mourad , ' t is a mistake , a rank mistake . I wrote the letter ; ' t was intended for Davina . Apart A joke , a joke . Mour . Mourad Though you are very impudent , I scarcely think you bold enough to counterfeit your sovereign 's name . Away with him . Al . Alcouz As he is led off Oh , Mourad , you 'll be punished yet for spoiling the Caliph 's jester . Mour . Mourad Ha , ha , poor Alcouz , it goes hard with you since you would pull your head out of the noose , even at the risk of choking yourself . Well , Salek , is the old Cadi as obstinate as ever ? Does he still retain your papers ? Salek . Salek Yes , and I fear does not intend to part with them . Mour . Mourad Do not despair . I 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order to imprison the old rogue until he makes restitution . Salek . Salek I thank your friendship , Mourad . But whilst you interest yourself so much in the welfare of others , why not do justice to her that loves you ? Mour . Mourad Because I can not abide doing an injustice to myself . Salek . Salek Nay , unless you now speak against your own feelings , your treatment of Davina has been cruel in the extreme , for it was with the greatest earnestness that you induced her to believe that you loved her sincerely . Be just and heal the wounds your levity has inflicted . Mour . Mourad Well , Salek , you are a strange physician to apply a sticking plaster to my back to cure Davina 's lovesickness . Salek . Salek Pshaw ! But since she is so indifferent to you , you must not be astonished if you shortly hear of her marriage with another . Mour . Mourad I certainly should , for I know her constancy . Now for the old Cadi . Enter Dennis Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Salek . Salek Is this the brave stranger that defended you when lately attacked in the streets ? Mour . Mourad The same . Well , Dennis , I wish to try your skill in your new office . How like you your appointment ? Den . Dennis Owhack So well that St. Patrick bless your honor for seeing that I 'm the right thing . But to be sure and I find a jailer 's office rather a confining one to so great a traveller as I have been . Mour . Mourad Have you travelled , Dennis ? Den . Dennis Owhack Travelled ! Ohone , and you may say that  --  all the world over and farther , too . Look at my manners just . Now do n't you perceive a pretty bashful behavior that bespakes the travelled jontleman and tells you that I 've observed the manners of the most polished nations , and even those that never had any at all , at all ? Mour . Mourad And what induced you to travel ? Den . Dennis Owhack A strong dislike to confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my antipathy , and so I took leave of them without as much as asking their blessing . Oh , but they were sorry to part with me . Salek . Salek And what observations have you made in your travels ? Den . Dennis Owhack A few choice ones only : First , that every man takes care of number one ; and second , that the gray mare 's the best horse all the world over . Salek . Salek I do not understand you . Den . Dennis Owhack Get married once , and it will need no explanation . I mean that the fair sex , even among the dusky gentry , rule the roost , as my old friend , the King of Pagu , found to his loss . Mour . Mourad So . In all your wanderings have you become acquainted with my Lord Cadi of Bagdad ? Den . Dennis Owhack No , nor do I wish to be . I could never agree with any of the race . De'l burn them , they are always troubling me . Mour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll find him at his own house about this hour , but , if not there , at Ibad 's , the physican . Be expeditious as you wish my favor . Den . Dennis Owhack And do you tell the law to be expeditious ?

But forget those trifles  --  at least remind me not of them now . Salek . Salek I thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for it is ever a sure mark of a base and cowardly mind to wound the fallen . Ibad . Ibad Right . But , my honest fellow , how did you manage to find me out ? Any difficulty ? Salek . Salek Not the least . Ibad . Ibad Well , I am really happy to see you here . Salek . Salek The devil you are ! Ibad . Ibad But sit down , sit down ; I want to have a little chat with you . And how did you leave my little bride ? Eh , pretty anxious for her husband , I warrant you ? But sit still , sit still ; I hope you are not going already . Salek . Salek There 's no danger of that . Ibad . Ibad That 's kind  --  I 'm glad to hear it . But why so reserved ? Why the deuce do n't you speak out ? There 's no danger of being overheard ; we are safe . Salek . Salek I do n't doubt it . Enter Lira Lira . Lira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? Salek . Salek Is it possible  --  my lovely Lira here ? Lira . Lira Yes , you may wonder at my seeking you after your perfidy ; but when I saw them tear you to prison I could not refrain from following you . Ibad . Ibad To prison ! What , are you in limbo , too ? Lira . Lira While I possessed your love no one was half so happy , but now  --  O Salek ! Salek . Salek What , in tears ? Aside I dare not speak , for Davina 's safety requires that her father should still remain deceived . Ibad . Ibad So , so very pretty , faith ! Why , you unconscionable dog , is not one of my daughters enough for you ? Very partial to my family , faith ! And you , my child , wo n't you speak to your own natural father ? Lira . Lira Oh , pardon me , dear father , I really did not know you . Ibad . Ibad Not know me ? Then come , you little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know me ?

Dennis Owhack Only a hundred bastinadoes ; so come along . I 'll be so obliging as to take you to my Lord Cadi myself and see them laid on honestly . He 's a de'il of a rogue , you know , and might be after cheating you else . Ibad . Ibad Oh , this is the work of Alcouz ! Enemies ! Lira . Lira Oh , spare him ! Ibad . Ibad Hush , hush .

Mourad Davina , my heart is agonized ; my happiness is gone forever . Until I lost you I knew not how I loved . I blush to think with what neglect I have treated your perfections , but rejoice that I alone suffer by my folly . Dav . Davina Leave me , and cease to insult me with hypocrisy . Mour . Mourad Ah , to my cost , I 've played the hypocrite too long . Dav . Davina Would you speak thus if you thought I were not married ? Mour . Mourad If there were room for such a thought , the world would not contain another being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true , O Mourad , my happiness will equal thine ! Mour . Mourad What , married , yet speak thus ? Oh , shame ! No , Davina , perish the wretch whose heart could basely harbor a thought against that purity he once adored . But to the purpose of this visit : you are surrounded by dangers ; I come to save you from ruin  --  from the stranger Abdallah . Dav . Davina Speak , what have I to fear from him ? Mour . Mourad Everything . His love is boundless and he is our sovereign . Dav . Davina Heavens ! Mourad . Mour . Mourad We must fly beyond his power or your ruin is inevitable . Dav . Davina Oh , that way leads to your destruction ! Hasten and plead for me ; he is just and good and will not injure the meanest of his subjects . Mour . Mourad Yes , he is just and good . But oh , Davina , who can answer for the reason of a lover ? He has already imprisoned your husband to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davina Is that the cause of Salek 's imprisonment ? Then he is free from danger , for we are not married . Mour . Mourad How ? Not married , said you , Davina ? Dav . Davina Even so . To avoid the dangers that threatened us both , we had recourse to this deceit . But my father , my father , Mourad ? Mour . Mourad Fear not ; he is at liberty before this . Not married ! O Davina , I breathe again . But quick , let us seek for safety before the storm overtakes us . Dav . Davina Stay . Reflect , Mourad , ere you abandon all your hopes and fortunes . Mour .

Alcouz That blundering Irishman has discovered his mistake and is in full cry upon me with all his myrmidons . Roz . Rozelea Ah , you naughty lover , how you 've kept me waiting ! Al .

Exit guarded , Lira following Den . Dennis Owhack Now to return my visit , just at the hour appointed . Nothing like punctuality . Knocks No answer . Well , that looks friendly . I hate ceremony . Walks in , L.H. Enter Hassan with Slaves bearing a palanquin Hass . Hassan Put down the palanquin . I wonder that our master , the Caliph , takes the lady away in so humble a manner , for since she is another man 's wife , I think a display of splendor would have more effect than this humility . Reenter Dennis from the house Den . Dennis Owhack Arrah now , this is mighty ungenteel  --  nothing of the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then  --  de'il burn his manners .

Hassan Well , friend , do you belong to that house ? Den . Dennis Owhack Now you would be after asking does that house belong to me . Hass . Hassan Belong to you ? Den . Dennis Owhack No , faith , but to as ill-bred a little jontleman as you 'd see in a long summer 's day . Hass . Hassan Ill-bred ? How so ? Den . Dennis Owhack Nothing of the foreign polish . To ask a man to his house to make a night of it , and then to back out of the scrape by hopping the twig without as much as saying , " Your humble servant to command . " The Hottentot ! Hass . Hassan Saw you no one else ? Den . Dennis Owhack Yes , indeed . A young forsaken bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato patch . A pretty reception , by the powers ! Hass .

And her husband 's in the same plight , too , for when by all but the Cadi 's officers  --  Och now , they are the only friends that stick to a man in distress . Hass . Hassan Her husband in custody ? So this must be the lady . Mean you not Davina , Ibad 's daughter ? Den . Dennis Owhack And how should I know Ibad 's daughter from anybody 's else daughter , gra , since every female face I see is hidden by a veil ? But she seems to be her father 's child , too , for she took good care to get out of the way when she received me . A very pretty ill-bred race of them ! Hass . Hassan Was she not married today ? Den . Dennis Owhack You may say that myself saw the ceremony , but that 's no reason for her behaving so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my travels . Hass . Hassan With all due respect lead the lady here . Den . Dennis Owhack Ohone ! And would you be after teaching an Irish jontleman how to treat a lady ? Let me alone for that . Exit into the house Hass . Hassan Married today and her husband imprisoned ? Yes , this must be the Caliph 's beloved . Although he is not here , I must receive her , for I am strictly commanded not to return without her .

Dennis Owhack Sit a little over , my jewel . Hass . Hassan To Dennis , who is getting in Back ! Den . Dennis Owhack Why so ? There 's room for two . Hass . Hassan With the bride ! Den . Dennis Owhack And who 's a properer person for a bride than an Irish jontleman , pray ? Hass . Hassan Begone ! Den . Dennis Owhack As you please . We 'll not boggle about trifles . I can walk to the wedding just as well , if it 's the same thing to the lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owhack , but you are the dandy for bothering a lady 's heart ! One look , and her heart overflows with the cream of affection . But to be sure and did n't Miss Shelah O'Flanagan try your skill a bit ? By my soul , and she did ! She had a heart as hard as a bogtrotter 's heel . Exit Scene 2 : The street before the Cadi 's house , terminating with one of the gates of the city . Time : about sunset . Enter Mourad and Davina in haste . Dav . Davina O Mourad , think of your own safety ! Fly from me before we are overtaken . ' T is now impossible for me to escape . Mour .

But I suppose you resigned your office , eh ? Al . Alcouz Aside Yes , faith , my jesting 's at an end now . Cadi . Cadi I rejoice to see you . But since the times are ticklish and Davina 's married , I must have my share of the jewels , and that speedily . Hum , by the way , where 's the will you put in your pocket this morning ? Al . Alcouz As ide Oh , the devil ! Do n't talk of wills now . Cadi . Cadi What 's that you mutter ? Al . Alcouz Only let me pass and I 'll make you my heir . Cadi . Cadi Heir ? No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please heir . I 'll be executor ; I understand that business . But , touching the jewels ? Al . Alcouz I bequeath them all to you . Cadi . Cadi What , shall Davina still pass for your daughter , and I reap the whole profits of your roguery ? Is it possible , my dear friend , that you have turned honest at last ? Well , I commend your resolution . Stick to it and you 'll do well yet . Give me your hand , you dear old rogue . Ha , you have her mother 's ring I see . ' T is mine . Al . Alcouz Well , you will not begrudge me this since all the rest are yours ? Cadi . Cadi I like not that you should abandon all to enjoy the blessings of a quiet conscience ; but you have done pretty well , pretty well , I think . Courage , courage . Al .

Here 's the sentence . Cadi . Cadi When will Bagdad be clear of rogues ? Alas ! I fear not until I am out of it . The Caliph 's will be done . I obey with pleasure . Ibad . Ibad That 's more than I do . Lira . Lira Dear sir , have mercy ! Cadi . Cadi Well , Lira , what would you have ? Lira . Lira I plead for my father . Cadi . Cadi Your father ? Ha , is it so ? Then it seems I am not his executor after all ? Ibad . Ibad My executor ? Dear me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lose the jewels , too ? A pretty piece of business , truly ! But I can swear that they were honestly bequeathed to me . So away with him to the executioner . To be disappointed thus ! Ibad . Ibad Exe  --  ! What , my dear friend , do n't you know me ? Cadi . Cadi Know you ? Never saw you before in all my life . Ibad . Ibad Not know me ? Ha , ha , but you were always so comical . Now do but look me full in the face ; I 'm sure you 'll remember my nose . Cadi . Cadi Your nose ? Ca n't possibly see it . Justice , you know , is blind . Ibad . Ibad But she need not be deaf , too . I am your dear friend Ibad , I say  --  your best friend . Cadi . Cadi Are you so ? Then you had better die as soon as possible , for he has just made me his executor . So away with him and give him the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Caliph . The Caliph I command you , stay ! Cadi . Cadi You command ? By the prophet 's beard , but this is very pretty . And who are you , pray ? Ibad . Ibad That 's my son-in-law Abdallah . Oh , he 's a noble fellow , I 'll answer for that . Cadi . Cadi He 's a confoundedly impudent one . I 'll answer for that . And I believe if you could persuade him to take half of your punishment upon himself , you would both be the better for it . Ibad . Ibad I had rather bear it all myself , but I 'll persuade him to open the eyes of justice . Cadi . Cadi Right . The rays of a few sequins would certainly throw a little light on this subject . Ibad . Ibad Son-in-law , I must tax your generosity . A purse will be of service here . Caliph . The Caliph Here is one . Cadi . Cadi Give it me . Starts Bless my soul ! Eh , what , my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rejoice to see you . Strange , I did not recollect your nose . Ibad . Ibad Ah , I perceive that justice can see clear enough now . Cadi .

Guard Commander of the Faithful ! Cadi . Cadi Com  --  ! Eh , what ? Ibad . Ibad The Caliph ! Apart to Cadi Ah , my dear friend , justice is awake now and I shrewdly suspect she 'll give you the law on this subject . Caliph . The Caliph Yes , behold your sovereign ! Throws off his disguise and appears superbly dressed Of late I have frequently been a secret witness to your injustice , but here your power to injure ends . To Cadi I degrade you to the station of a private citizen . Your hoary head protects you from all other punishment . Cadi .

The Caliph Guards , bring forth Salek , this woman 's husband , immediately . Dav . Davina Great sir , if I am the cause of this dreaded anger towards Salek , oh , spare him ! He is not my husband . Caliph . The Caliph Not thy husband ? Rise , Davina . Mourad , is it thus you repay my confidence ? Beneath the sacred garb of friendship to attempt to deprive me of my heart 's best treasure ? Was this worthy thee ? Mour . Mourad Dread sir , can you wonder at my error since the same cause led you astray ? I know that my life is justly forfeited  --  not for the attempt but for its failure . Caliph . The Caliph Audacious , you shall repent . Mour . Mourad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel what it is to love , and oh , to lose the object of my passion ! My heart 's not adamant ; I perceive her danger , for love can make a fiend and maniac of the best and wisest . Enter Dennis and Alcouz , L.H. , Rozelea following Den . Dennis Owhack I have boned you at last , honey , and a pretty chase I 've had of it , too ; but never think of excusing it . ' T was mighty ungenteel , for when you was pleased to favor me with your company against your will , I never thought of blarneying the thing . And though you was for going , I in a manner forced you to stay . But why do you shake , my jewel ? Och now , St. Vitus dance seems to be all the go here . Al . Alcouz Kneel ing Pardon , dread sir , pardon , pardon a poor being who else will never forgive himself . I assure Your Highness that I never repented of any error so sincerely .

Ha , ha , ha , ca n't live without me ! Den . Dennis Owhack Alcouz ! Upon my soul , now this is all botheration . Caliph . The Caliph Ha ! That ring , from whom did you obtain it ? Al . Alcouz A present from my old friend Ibad , sir , and I esteem it highly , I assure you , on that account . Ibad . Ibad Not from me , not from me . I disclaim any knowledge of it . Caliph . The Caliph Ibad , how came it in your possession ? Ibad . Ibad Aside Dear me , I wish I was in Pagu ! Dav . Davina This morning , great sir , I received it from the Cadi and gave it to my father to return to him . Caliph . The Caliph Whence did you obtain it ? Cadi . Cadi Aside So it has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased it ten years ago from a wandering Arab . Ibad . Ibad Aside Hum , he never failed yet at a pinch . Caliph . The Caliph An Arab ? Al . Alcouz That may be all very true ; however , this ring belonged to Davina 's mother . I have my Lord Cadi 's word for it and , moreover , that she is not Ibad 's daughter . Was it not so , my old executor ? Slaps the Cadi 's back Ha , ha , ha ! Cadi . Cadi Aside It 's time for me to look for an executor . Caliph . The Caliph What say you ? Not his daughter ? Ibad . Ibad ' T is even so . Sixteen years ago my Lord Cadi brought a Christian woman to my house , who called herself Isabella . She shortly after died in giving birth to that sweet girl , and the valuable jewels that she brought with her induced us to conceal the affair . Caliph . The Caliph Have you any of the jewels yet remaining ? Ibad . Ibad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al . Alcouz Really , so there is ! Well , I should have forgotten this , had you not reminded me of it . Caliph .

Ha , ha , ha , I 'm the boy ! Enter Salek and Guards Caliph . The Caliph Beneath a disguise I gained your mother 's affections . The wars drew me from my kingdom , and at my return I searched for her in vain , but learned that shame had compelled her to abandon her former home . Nay , doubt not , Mourad , I sent for Salek intending to be just . But as he has no claim , I thus reward your virtues with her whom you so bravely have defended . Take her ; and may she never forget that you abandoned all to save her . Mour . Mourad This goodness overpowers me . Al . Alcouz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible for me to refrain from following it  --  Aside particularly as it costs me nothing .

Never mind , my lord ; to make amends , you shall be my executor . Cadi . Cadi Rather your executioner . Ibad . Ibad Salek has his fortune again , Lira . Joins her hand with Salek 's Well , the storm is over and , Rozelea , we shall be happily married at last . Roz . Rozelea We must obtain my husband 's permission first . Al . Alcouz Oh , you have that , my dear . Ibad . Ibad Your husband ? How  --  jilted ? Roz . Rozelea It is your fault . Why did you keep me waiting so long ? Ibad .

Dennis Owhack Arrah now , here , comes the bubble of purity . Hass . Hassan Most splendid and glorious of the luminaries of the world , your orders are obeyed . I bring the star of perfection , the antelope of beauty . Caliph . The Caliph Open the palanquin . Kazrak enters from it Kaz . Kazrak Runs and embraces Alcouz My dear master , have I found you at last ? I thought I should never have seen you again . Al . Alcouz And I hoped so , too . Help ! Help ! Will no one assist me ?

My boy Kazrak ! Den . Dennis Owhack Arrah , man , dead ! The bubble of purity a boy ! Al . Alcouz Ho ! Kazrak , and not a woman ! O Mahomet , I 'm another man again ! Den . Dennis Owhack Another man ? Now hang that little fellow ! He 's not the same person ten minutes together . Who will you be next , pray ? By the powers , this is all buz to me ; I do n't know who 's who . They seem to be all one another . Ibad . Ibad Davina , my dear child , give me a kiss at parting . You are a princess now but I must still love you as my own . Dav . Davina My dear father ! Embraces him Caliph . The Caliph Though I condemn the frailty that caused you to conceal the secret of her birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bade you rear her with affection and thus carefully cultivate her mind . Complete a father 's duty : yield her to her husband . Mourad approaches the palanquin . I bad places Davina in it Finale If faults are forgiven in bounty profuse , Withhold not the smiles that we tremble to lose . Though smiles that our bosoms divest of all pain May lead us perhaps into error again , Withhold not the smiles that we tremble to lose , If faults are forgiven in bounty profuse . Exeunt in procession Back matter THE END
