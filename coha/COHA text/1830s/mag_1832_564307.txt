txt THE term CHOLERA MORBUS , or , simply , CHOLERA , 15 applied to two diseases , in many respects resembling each other but very different in their degree of violence , and distinguished by several obvious and important peculiarities . The prominent and general symptoms , which are common to both , and may therefore be considered as essential to Cholera , are vomiting , intestinal evacuations , and irregular contortions of the muscles , termed cramps , or spasms . The suddenness of the attack , the violence of the symptoms , the nature of the fluids evacuated , and the degree of mortality , are some of the circumstances by which the two forms of Cholera are distinguished from each other . The milder form of the disease , with which alone we have till lately been acquainted in our own country , makes its appearance during the prevalence of the most intense heat to which we are subjected in the months of July and August ; it most generally follows upon excess in diet , but often shows itself independently of this cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy life in the course of a few hours , while , in other cases , it is protracted by alternations of rallying and relapse to several days . In common with the disease which we have yet to describe , it has been regarded as an affection of the bilious system ; and it is from the Greek term for bile that the general appellation is derived . But while , in this form , the bile is in excess , and forms the principal part of the fluids evacuated in the other , it is always deficient , and , generally speaking , is wholly absent . It has , for this reason , been found convenient for writers to distinguish the common disease as bilious cholera . The spasms , which have been mentioned as common to both forms , resemble in this , the cramps usually induced by vomiting ; and are more or less severe according to the degree in which this symptom is present . Bilious Cholera is dangerous , and sometimes fatal ; but if seen at an early period , and judiciously treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery . The other form of Cholera , and that to which public attention has been of late so painfully directed , is a disease of far greater severity , violence , and danger . Until within little more than two years , this disease may be considered as unknown to Europe . By the natives of Bengal it is termed ? nordezim , a term which the French colonial settlers in that country conveniently metamorphosed into mort de chien . The true meaning of the term , according to the learned , is death-blow , an expression admirably suited to its character and mode of attack . The French name , however , is very generally received , and by it the disease is now known at Madras . The term Spasmodic Oholera , as a specific appellation , was first applied to it about 1807 . At this time its ravages were remarked , and its nature began to be particularly studied ; but it had not then acquired the virulence which it has since assumed . It was spoken of by writers as a new disease ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfectly described ; for of its existence many years previous there can be no doubt . The circumstances , in which the disease of that period differed from the worst form of the present epidemic , were prin* cipally the uniform presence of spasm , which , in some of the wor // cases since , is nearly or altogether wanting , and in the greater duration of the symptoms . In other respects the diseases agree , and the descriptions we obtain from the writers on Indian diseases at that period , accord , in all essential particulars , with those we read of it at the present day . There can be no doubt , then , that Spasmodic Cholera has been known in India , as a disease of the country , for a very long period . The commencement , however , of the present severe epidemic , is referred , by common consent , to the year 1817 . In August of this year the Cholera attacked Jessore , about one hundred miles northeast of Calcutta , and invaded the latter city early in September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then attacked , in succession , Benares , Allahabad , Lucknow , Delhi , and many other towns on the north of the peninsula . At length it reached the army , and spread through its different divisions , proceeding gradually over the Deccan . At fins Singabad its ravages were peculiarly severe . It subsequently attacked Nagpoor , and Aurungabad , and arrived at Bombay , in September , 1818 , twelve months after its appearance at Calcutta . From this time it proceeded south , with an apparently regular course , until it reached the extremity of the peninsula . From hence , it found its way to Ceylon ; to the peninsula of Siam ; to Malacca , and across the Straights of Sunda to China . It also showed itself in Mauritius , and much more slightly at Bourbon , in which place its progress , in that direction , appeared to be arrested . It was during its progress through India , as we have now described it , that the disease first assumed those terrible features by which it has since been characterized ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both curious and important . From these we shall quote but a fe*v striking passages , which will probably be more interesting to our readers than a detailed description of the symptoms . " The disease generally begins with a watery purging , unattended with pain . At an interval of from half an hour to six hours , follows vomiting of a whitish fluid , unmixed , in any instance , with hile. the spasms succeed at no determinate period , attacking first the toes and legs , and then extending to the thighs , and arms . There is invariably complaint of great heat at the stomach , and continual calling for cold drink . In general , all pain and spasm leave the patient before death ; and when the heart can not be felt to beat , he expresses himself easy , and says he is better . " In the severer onsets , the course was far more rapid than that just described . In many instances , vomiting , purging , and spasms , were all absent ; the powers of the system failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . Natives were struck down with the disease while walking in the open air ; they fell down , retched a little , complained of deafness , vertigo , and blindness , and , in a few minutes , expired . From these facts , it will readily be inferred , that the disease has undergone hut little alteration in its passage from Asia to our own hores . There is another circumstance , which , in this connection , it is worth our while to notice . " It prevailed to a degree equally violent t all seasons of the year ; in regard to temperature , from 40 or 50 degrees of Fahrenheit to 90 or 100 ; in regard to moisture , during the // continuance of almost incessant rain for months , and in that dry season which scarce leaves a vestige of vegetation on the surface of the earth . " From the period now mentioned to 1330 , the accounts of the disease are vague and imperfect , and scarce form the materials for a consecutive history . It continued , though not constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year appeared at Muscat , at the mouth of the Persian gulf . From Muscat it spread extensively on the shores of the gulf . On the north , it extended in 1821 , to Shiraz and Yezd , in Persia . On the south , following , apparently , the banks of the Tigris , it reached the Mediterranean in 1823 , and attacked Aleppo , Antioch , and other places . In this same year it appeared in Tabriz , or Tauris , a considerable town in Persia , supposed to contain 50,000 inhabitants . In the same year it appeared at Astrachan on the very confines of Europe , but showed no disposition to extend itself westward . From this time we know little of its ravages until 1828 , in which , and the following year , it is said to have been present in the province of Ghilan in Persia , and to have attacked Reschd , its principal town . In 1828 it also invaded Teheran , a populous town , in the province of Irak Agemi . In the two following years it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed 5000 of the inhabitants . In 1830 , it appeared at Teflis , the capital of Georgia , and , in seven weeks , reduced the population of that town , between death and emigration , from thirty to eight thousand . The most interesting fact at this period of its history was its appearance and progress in the Russian province of Orenburg . On the 8th of September , 1829 , it showed itself in the city of that name . Its development at that particular time and place is one of those many unaccountable facts , which have served to perplex and divide inquirers into the nature of this singular disease . The most diligent inquiry , by the Russian government , could discover no probable channel by which it was communicated . Between this time and the following February , it ravaged the whole province , attacking 44 villages , and destroying 865 souls . During this part of its history , the records of its progress appear to have been faithfully and accurately preserved . With the second appearance of the disease in Astrachan , commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overrun so large a portion of the civilized world . The first case in this city occurred on the 3d of July , 1830 . The period of its stay was but eighteen days , during which time there were 1299 cases , and 433 deaths . The towns in the course of the Wolga now became the objects of attack , and , on the 9th of October , the disease entered Moscow . Here it remained nearly four months , and seized 8576 individuals , of whom 4690 died . In this place , in fact , it seemed to take up its quarters for the winter ; and , issuing thence the following spring , attacked both the Russian and Polish armies in their encampments . Its ravages in Warsaw commenced the 10th of April , and continued seven weeks . During this time 3912 were attacked , and 1462 died . From this time , it raged in Poland without control ; caused signal mortality in the towns of Brodi and Lemberg , and made its appearance in St. Petersburgh on the 10th of June . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked 7567 , of whom 3804 fell victims to its fury . In the beginning of October , it appeared at Hamburg , and , in the latter part of the same month , at Sunderland , in England . Its subsequent history , to the present period , we shall leave to be supplied by the recollection of our readers . We now come to the consideration of that intricate question , To what are we to attribute the origin and progress of the present epidemic ? The most simple view that we can take of this subject , perhaps , is the following : That Cholera has occurred since the year 1817 , as it did before that year , from the operation of atmospheric heat and accidental excess , operating on bodies debilitated by a vitiated atmosphere , insufficient or improper food , and intemperate habits ; that to these causes nothing has been superadded , within the last fifteen years , except mental emotions of a depressing character , partly arising in particular countries from political causes , in which mode despondence may be conceived to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of France ; the passion common to all , having been fear and terror of its approach ; to many , suspicion , as in Petersburgh and Paris ; to a smaller number , and individually , superstition , or the persuasion of Divine wrath , and impending judgement . In this view , the cases are to be regarded as a succession of unconnected events , not acting on each other as cause and effect , except so far as the passions before mentioned are concerned , still less springing from the uniform operation of a common cause , but arising as cholic , dysentery , catarrh , gout , and other diseases , have arisen during the same period from their appropriate causes ; some being obvious to the observation of man in each individual case , others concealed from him , but equally peculiar to the case itself , and such as might exist , and have existed , with corresponding effects at all periods , since mankind possessed their present constitution , and the earth and atmosphere their actual properties . A modification of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease to atmospheric vicissitudes , solar heat , moisture , and vegetable and animal putrefaction , favored by the circumstances above mentioned , in the individuals acted upon , and by debilitating agents generally . Another and more obscure form in which the same idea is presented , is that of a specific terrestrial miasm , producing the disease in each separate location in which it has shown itself ; just as the miasm of marshes produces intermittent fever ; which doctrine , so far as it is capable of being distinctly viewed and discussed , resolves itself into those already named . We shall therefore consider all these in one , as the doctrine of the local miasmatic origin of the present disease . It is in the first place to be allowed that this doctrine derives confirmation from several circumstances , noticed in the principal cities in which the disease made its appearance . In Orenburg , where it broke out as late as the 8th of September , and where it was found impossible to trace with any degree of probability its extrinsic source , it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following immediately upon an unusually hot summer . It farther appears , by the description of the medical men acquainted with this place , that there exists a predisposition to what are called asthenic diseases , that is , diseases of // debility ; that typhus fever often prevails , and that dropsy is no unfre .. quent termination of febrile disease ; evincing a general relaxation in the system , which is in a degree accounted for by their habits . The population are very various in character , and a large proportion , idle and dissolute . In Astrachan the disease first showed itself in the beginning of July , during the prevalence of the high temperature of 950 Fahr . The situation of this city is thus described : - The Wolga pours its waters into the Caspian by numerous channels , so flat and low , that they form rather a series of marshes than genuine river outlets . On the alluvial land formed by several of these streams , and at least sixty miles from the actual mouth of the Wolga , the city of Astrachan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere is loaded with humidity , almost all the year round ; while its latitude , in 46* north , exposes it to considerable solar heat , and all the evils arising from the atmospheric changes dependent on heat and moisture . Astrachan is rather more unfavorably situated than either Jessore , Dacca , or any other of the towns in the Delta of the Ganges . In Moscow , the commencement of the disease was about the 1st of October , that is , later than the usual causes of cholera could be considered as operating . Yet we are told the weather continued warm and damp . It is also remarked that the decline of the disease dated from about the 1st of November . These facts are not very decisive . At Warsaw , the disease commenced about the middle of April , after political events which had caused great and general depression . It continued two months , and prevailed principally in narrow lanes leading to the Vistula . Both the city and the Polish camp are described by observers as abounding in causes calculated to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protracted marches , during which the troops were exposed to fatigue , privation and hardship . Those regiments suffered most which were encamped between heights or on marshy ground , and whose food consisted of salted pork . When the disease attacked the troops after the battle of Jganic , the men , heated by a long march and a severe engagement , drank greedily of the muddy water in the neighborhood . The Polish soldiers , from their mode of life , are peculiarly liable to disease . Slack-baked brown bread and salt meat form the chief part of their food ; they drink freely , are filthy in their persons , prone to excess , and , from the nature of the country , are often obliged to encamp in damp and marshy places . Of the dwelling houses in Warsaw , it is said to be impossible to form any idea without having actually seen them . They are generally of wood , small , filled with filth , sometimes built over drains which emit a horrible odor , and occasionally overflowed by the inundations of the Vistula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are small wooden houses , dark , and with no other opening than the door . The floors are never swept , and are covered with filth to the depth of several inches . These people never wash their persons , scarce ever comb their hair , have no white linen , are generally half starved , and , from time to time , are subjected to increased privation in the performance of religious penance . If from Warsaw we turn our attention to the other seats of the disease in Poland , we shall find circumstances more or less similar to the above , corresponding to the time and place of its attack . About the // beginning of May , 1831 , the disease showed itself in Brodi , a town containing *24,000 inhabitants , chiefly Jews , of whom scarce 500 were in good circumstances . In this place , no less than 3000 , or one eighth of the population , were destroyed . About the middle of this month , Lemberg , the capital of Gallicia , a town situated on the Sane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was attacked . The disease continued here nearly three months , during which time it seized 49* persons , and destroyed *584 . Equally striking examples of the presence of local causes , calculated to produce disease , will be found in the history of cholera in England . In Sunderland , we are told , there are very few streets of proper width . The bye streets are extremely narrow , several not being broad enough for the passage of a common cart ; they are rarely cleansed from the dirt , and impurities were allowed to accumulate for several days together . The houses , in these bye streets or lanes , had commonly no yards or courts attached to them ; the rooms were dark , ill ventilated , and dirty ; the passages and stairs were dirty , from the great number of persons living in each house ; very often each room , from the cellars to the attics , was the residence of a separate family . It is also said , in regard to Sunderland , that the disease was almost exclusively confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickly populated districts , not more than twelve cases having occurred in the upper and more widely built portion , though the freest intercourse existed between them . The places in England where the disease raged most severely , were Musselburgh , Trunent and Preston Pans . In Musselburgh , typhus fever prevailed among the inhabitants before and during the prevalence of the epidemic . In Preston Pans , it is said , that beggars , colliers , and dissipated persons , formed the majority of the fatal cases . Of the class of persons attacked in Paris , their situation , the previous health of the city , and other circumstances , we have no very particular accounts . It is certain that the state of alarm and suspicions in that city must have been excessive , and these , no doubt , contributed in a very great degree , to the prevalence of the epidemic . The arguments thus far have been drawn from foreign countries . Were it desirable to extend the inquiry to our own we might find not a few facts to confirm this view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible , and continue to be topics of public discussion , they would here be misplaced . For information in regard to one of the most remarkable seats of the disease , we refer to the late proclamation of the Mayor of Montreal , on the subject of nuisances existing in that city . If things are no better in Quebec , than in that city , the fatality of cholera can not be matter of surprise . It is well worthy of remark in this connection , what a degree of immunity has been enjoyed by maritime towns . While places situated in the interior and on navigable streams have been the favorite objects of attack , the sea-board , in almost all countries , has been nearly exempt . In India , indeed , this difference was much less observable than elsewhere . But from the period of its quitting Hindostan , it ceased to follow the sea-coast , and pursued almost without interruption an inland course . If we except places situate on inland seas , scarce a maritime town will be found to have been invaded subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all European countries , its worst ravages were ex // hibited , is altogether without sea-coast . In England , the escape of sea-ports was remarked , although the general mildness of the disease in that country rendered this circumstance less conspicuous . In France , Paris was severely affected , while Marseilles , the ancient seat of plague , and the whole coast upon the British channel and the Bay of Biscay , escaped . In fact , with few exceptions , the course of the disease has been along the banks of rivers , and it has been in the parts of the several towns nearest to the stream that the malady has prevailed most severely and extensively . Thus , in Sunderland , where the difference in level of the several parts of the town was considerable , the lower portions suffered most severely , while the more elevated were permitted to escape . It may also he noticed as rather favorable to the present view of the subject , that spasmodic cholera has never prevailed alone ; that cases of common cholera morbus *nd of diarrhcea have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cause , whatever it might be , which has produced it , is capable of giving rise to more than one form of abdomin 1 disorder , having more or less analogy to it , and such as , in their nearest approach , may easily be mistaken for the disease itself . But the question may he asked , Why , if the local causes which have been mentioned , of the vicinity of fresh water , crowded population , filth , bad diet , and irregular habits , are so active in producing the disease , why was the cholera so mild throughout England , and why was London so little affected ? The question has received v* rious answers according to the different views of those who have attempted to account for the anomaly . By many , the exemption has been attributed to the use of animal food , which is known to be a more general article of diet in England than on the continent . Others , who place more reliance on atmospheric causes , have noticed that England is the only country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hold it reasonable to suppose , that the sulphurous acid , emitted by this substance , and which constitutes , in the case of London , so considerable an ingredient in the atmosphere , has acted the part of a disinfecting agent , and served to neutralize , in a greater or less degree , the various emanations from other sources . As local causes , then , which appear to have favored the production of the disease , at least in its march through Europe , may be mentioned sudden changes of temperature , solar heat , emanations from decaying vegetable substances , and atmospheic humidity . As predisposing causes , in the persons attacked , are to be reckoned filth , intemperance , exposure , fear , and mental depression . But the question again recurs , whether the combination of all these can be considered as having produced the disease ? It is not necessary , in order to admit the affirmative , of this question , that similar causes should be proved heretofore to have been followed by Spasmodic Cholera , though this circumstance would constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it necessary to show , that the degree of the disease in difi&gt;rent places corresponded very precisely to the degree in which these causes themselves were present . As these circumstances are confessedly causes of disease , generally , and most of them in a peculiar manner calculated , as experience shows , to affect the abdominal organs , the fact of thei : // producing cholera , rather than any other form of disease , presents no great embarrassment . The great point , in which the local theory fails , is in accounting for the apparent progress of the disease ; not , indeed , for its progress at a particular angle with the meridian ,  --  for , with the exception of the general fact , that it has attacked , in succession , India , Persia , Russia , Poland , England , and France , and is now on this side of the Atlantic , thus indicating a general tendency westward ,  --  it would be difficult to assign any law of direction by which its erratic course has been guided . The difficulty is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been progressive at all , except so far as the causes alleged were equally so , which they certainly have not been to any sensible degree . A something distinct from the ordinary sensible causes of disease , seems to have been conveyed from place to place ; and unless it can be determined with some degree of probability what that something is , and how it has traveled , although other circumstances in respect to the disease be accounted for , its most remarkable and distinctive character remains inexplicable . This consideration brings us to the doctrine of simple atmospheric infection , or the conveyance of an original miasm , produced in India , into the different countries which have been successively affected , independently of human intercourse , and equally so of emanations from the bodies of the sick . According to this view , the miasm , which at present produces the disease , is not only similar , but absolutely and identically the same with that , which caused its appearance on the banks of the Ganges . Supposing , then , a stratum or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be conceived to have extended itself , either by a gradual diffusion , in virtue of its proper elasticity , or by the assistance of atmospheric currents by which means , singly or united , we may suppose it to have been wafted to an indefinite distance . It is obvious that this theory accords sufficiently well with many of the peculiarties which have been manifested by the disease as , 1 . Its apparent pro6ress from place to place . 52 . Its appearance in parts of the earth , to which , till within a few months , or years , it had , so far as history or tradition serve to inform us , been wholly unknown before . 3 . Its sudden appearance and equally sudden departure in some of the scenes of its attacks , the mortality reaching a maximum in the course of five or six days , and , after a shorter period , rapidly declining ; a circumstance , which no other view of the cases serves at all to explain . On the other hand , the objections urged against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , 1 . The fact so often noticed that , instead of spreading devastation through its whole apparent route the disease passes over several intermediate towns and large tracts of country , leaving them unharmed , to arrive at the place of its destination . 2 . Its frequent tendency , after pursuing a certain route , to retrace its steps to a certain extent , and thus seize on places which it had previously spared . 3 . The difficulty , on the score of diffusion , of supposing the miasm to spread over so immense a tract without losing its virulence by dilution ; and the apparently greater difficulty in regard to the communic tion by wind arising out of the fact that it has often proceeded in a track directly opposite to that of the current prevailing at the time . // Some of these objections admit of answers more or less satisfactory . That it has seized some places in preference to others may he explained by differences in the local circumstances , to which we have already referred ; the apparent anomaly of a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place could take the disease than another after being infected . Its apparent progress against the wind may possibly be explained by the supposition of a more constant aerial current in the higher regions of the atmosphere . The greatest objection , perhaps , to this atmospheric theory is to be found in the wide differences which th*. disc *se has manife ted in its rate of progress . Considered as emanating from India , it was no less than nine years in traversing the distance from Bombay to the frontiers of the Russian government ,  --  a rate of progress , which , compared with the subsequent celerity of its movements , is perfectly una countable . To attempt to escape this difficulty by assignin* to the miasm a more recent origin , would , we fear , only farther complicate the question and render its solution still more difficult . Wherever the chain is broken the reproduction of the disease must have arisen from local causes , and the union of two causes to produce the sa1* e effcct is calculated to diminish our confidence in both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that of the propagation of the disease by some substance produced by , and emanating from , the bodies of the sick . The doctrine of contagion , which this supposition involves , is known to be sustained by the example of many diseases , such as small-pox , measles , scarlet fever , and others . But , it must be allowed , that , if cholera has been communicated by contagion , the laws of this contagion must be widely different from those which it exhibits in the last named diseases . It must , in the first place , be capable of acting at far greater distances , since we find that in a large proportion of instances , in which the disease has appeared in a town or city , no action could have taken place from the bodies of the sick , except at a distance which much exceeds the sphere of action of any known contagion . When the first case of cholera occurred in Orenburg , it is not certain that there existed an individual affected with the malady , within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out near Quebec , we have no proof that there existed a patient within four times that distance . Still this does not absolutely prove the negative of contagion . The miasm might have diffused itself through the atmosphere to this vast extent ; it might have been conveyed in both cases , through a higher stratum of the air , by the wind , as we have supposed , in regard to an original infection ; it might have attached itself to the goods of the caravan merchants in the one case , or to the clothing of the emigrants , in the other . In regard to the introduction of the disease into Canada , if any case can be shown to have occurred on board the last-arrived vessel , the miasm thus produced , might have been enclosed in the hold , and wafted to the shore on her arrival . Or , finally , the emigrants , though apparently well , might have carried the elements of the disorder within them , which became active on their arrival , and capable of communicating the disease to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppositions in regard to contagion ; and others might be named-such // is the pliability of the doctrine , to suit the circumstances of every case . But , it must be observed , that one circumstance of some importance is common to all these suppositions . They all attribute to the contagious principle a very great degree of intensity ; that is , they suppose that a very small portion of the miasm , such , for instance , as might be contained in a few hundred feet ofatmospheric air , or held in contact with the surface of as many articles of clothing , might , after being exposed for many days , or even months , to the diluent and dispensive action of a pure atmosphere , retain sufficient energy to cause the disease in an individual , with whose skin or lungs it should happen to come in contact . But the supposition of so intense and penetrating a miasm , is apparently at variance with facts which have been observed during its prevalence at all places on the globe . How , indeed , with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians , nurses , and hospital attendants , have so generally escaped the disease , that its occurrence , in persons so situated , can only he regarded as exceptions ? that in many places , as in Warsaw , and the towns above named in England , the freest intercourse existed between two parts of a city , in one of which the disease raged with great violence , while the other remained universally healthy ? that populous towns on high roads , connecting infected places , have been wholly exempt , while , perhaps , daily communication for weeks together was maintained between them ? What are we to think of the numerous experiments performed by the F ench physicians , who exposed themselves in every form and manner which ingenuity could suggest , to both fluid and gaseous matters produced by the disease , yet without any injurious effect ? It has been said that these experiments were not satisfactory , because we know not through what avenue the poison may enter the system . Had they been limited to inoculation with the fluids produced , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach , there would be some reason in the objection ; but as the skin and the surface of the tongue were both freely and sedulously exposed , it is difficult not to regard these experiments , however reprehensible in themselves , as constituting a strong argument against the theory of contagion . But it is said in reply , that , in the cases where the cause failed to take effect , the predisposition was wanting on the part of the individual exposed . The miasm then may be compared to a spark , which ill inflame phosphorus or gunpowder , while on ordinary combustibles , it produces no effect . This will serve , no doubt , for the expression of a law , which may apply to the phenomena of the present disease ; but , we again observe , that it is not the law of contagion , as we are acquainted with it in measles and small-pox . In this view the contagious principle of cholera affords a solitary example ; the example of a miasm , so feeble as not to produce its specific effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , yet capable of acting , after almost infinite diffusion , on those whom circumstances render the subjects of the disease . On the doctrine of contagion , as thus modified , we shall make but two remarks : 1 . That it affords no reason whatever to believe , that the disease can be effectually excluded by means of quarantine regulations , from any city or country in which are to be found those , who , by // the circumstances in which they are placed , their habits of life , and the state of their constitutions , are the subjects for its attacks . 2 . That it furnishes no apology for the desertion of the sick by friends , or for any backwardness on the part of any to perform their ordinary domestic , social , and political duties , because such duties may lead them into the vicinity of the sick , or oblige them to venture within the supposed range of their morbid influence . In fine , we are obliged to confess , that , in regard to many circumstances attending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has pursued in its progress over one half the globe , neither of the explanations proposed afford us any satisfaction . We are equally left in doubt , whether , during the remainder of its capricious course , it will pursue the same general direction which it has hitherto done ; whether , after traversing from East to West the civilized part of the American continent , it will plunge at length into the obscurity of our western woods to emerge on the eastern confines of Asiatic Russia ; or whether , after some more desultory course , it be destined to lose itself in the waters of the Pacific . One thing is certain ,  --  that so far as the laws of cholera are necessary to be known , just so far have they been revealed to us . The measures of individual prudence to guard against its attacks and those of police regulation to remove the local causes which favor its diffusion , are practically the most important subjects iii relation to the disease ; and while , in regard to these points , the experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obscurity which involves the origin and nature of the malady is comparatively unimportant.
