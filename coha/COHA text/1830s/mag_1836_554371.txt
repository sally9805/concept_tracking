txt THIS beautiful work is entitled to a very high rank among compositions of its class . For the combination of truth , eloquence , and the fine expression of natural feeling , we should be at a loss to point to its equal . The introductory remarks are simple , dignified and elevating ; and they breathe that lively sensibility to moral greatness without which no one could do justice to the subject of the discourse . The narrative portion is written in a clear and flowing style , with rather more of a tendency to wander aside into episodical digressions , than a severe criticism might approve , though perhaps , it would not be possible to give a correct view of the life of Chief Justice Marshall without including a good deal of contemporaneous history ; his own share in the leading events having been so prominent , and he having been so conspicuous a member of one of the two great parties which divided the country . It is marked by a copiousness and minuteness of detail , arising both from intimate knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough acquaintance with the general and political history of the country , during the period of his active services . Many of the facts and statements are such as could have been derived from no other source than the lips of Chief Justice Marshall himself , and we may esteem ourselves fortunate that the duty of writing his Eulogy has fallen to the lot of one , who , for so many years , enjoyed his confidence so fully , and who had such ample opportunities of becoming familiar with the inmost workings of his mind , and the least obvious manifestations of his character . But the most valuable part of the Eulogy is that , in which the commanding moral and intellectual lineaments of Chief Justice Marshall are so justly and glowingly depicted , and the ruling principles of his life are educed from the events of his biography . In the narrative of facts , one accomplished writer will not vary essen // tially from another ; but in the analysis of character , in giving us the form and feature of the inner man , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in which the individual under consideration differs from others , and which constitute his identity , it is here that a leading mind manifests itself most clearly . Every one who recognises the moral beauty of great powers devoted to good ends , will feel grateful to Mr. Justice Story , for the life-like hues in which he has painted his revered associate and friend . The venerable form of that great and good man , whose character , so wonderfully tempered and so exquisitely poised , soars above the reach of common epithets , rises up before us as we read ; we catch the glance of that wisdom-beaming eye , and hear the tones of that voice , upon which men were wont to hang , as upon the responses of an oracle . The author pours out his soul with that fervor and glow , which spring from strong personal attachment and deep veneration for the man , as well as the magistrate ; and yet there is the discriminating touch of one who loves the truth too well , to sacrifice it even at the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with none of those rhetorical flourishes which are the fruit of literary vanity , and none of those cold , antithetical phrases , which , as we read them , suggest the impression , that the writer kept them ready made in his brain , to make use of on the first occasion he could bring them to a good market . It is plain that the subject and nothing else , was in the author 's mind , when he wrote , and that his only consideration was , how he should do justice to that . With the exception of the historical digressions , there is hardly a sentence which could be taken out and inserted in the Eulogy of another man ; and there are very few productions of this sort , of which the same remark can be made . In his comprehensive grasp of the whole character , while gathering up the individual traits that illustrate it , there is something that reminds us of the inimitable portraits of Clarendon . While we admire the skill and fulness of the delineation , merely as a literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with which the writer speaks out , and tells us that he loved his friend . We use the word , courage , advisedly , for in these days , when the nil admirari doctrine is fashionable , and weakness is esteemed so large an ingredient in enthusiasm , it requires no little courage to let the liquid heart flow out with such self-forgetting fulness . No paltry considerations of official dignity have fro // zen the genial current of his soul , and checked the strong expression of natural feeling . Youn* writers , who are most in danger of doing injustice to themselves by morbid self-restraint , xviii do well to observe how much is gained in point of true power , by a generous abandonment of ones self to a fine impulse , and how necessary it is for an author to forget himself in his subject , in order to write truly well . Knowing this discourse to be the production of a most learned lawyer , and a highly distinguished judicial writer , we can not but be struck with observing how little the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how much of energy , freedom and grace there is in its movements . We perceive no marks of a bigoted and absorbing devotion to one science , which regards poetry and ornamental learning as mere surplusage ; nihil hoc ad edictuni Prcetoris ; but the reflections and allusions reveal a mind enriched by tributes from every department of literature . The style , though it wants that fastidious finish , which can only be attained by an exclusive attention to scholar-like pursuits , and by selecting words with that slow deliberation with which a painter chooses his colors , has nothing of the dryness and huskiness of the mere lawyer ; on the contrary , it has a richness and fulness , which show a familiarity with the best models of English writing , and a literary spirit , which has lived and flourished in the close air of legal studies , and in spite of the austere frowns of jurisprudence . We notice this with much pleasure , and are glad that we have among us , so striking a refutation of the old maxim , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a scholar , and ( as Mr. Fearne is said to have done , though we question the truth of the tradition , ) throw the poets and classics into the fire . We are persuaded , not only that literature and law are not incompatible , but , that other things being alike , he who is the better scholar will be the better lawyer . Nay more , we believe that none but a good scholar , can be a first rate lawyer ; and that the highest attainments in jurisprudence can only be made by a mind which is expanded , fertilized and invigorated by general reading and liberal studies . Our intention in the present article is , not so much to enter into a critical analysis of a production , which must be familiar to most of our readers , and to which the high reputation , both of its author and of its subject , must secure an extensive circulation , and a permanent place in our literature , as to avail ourselves // of its assistance in a few remarks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Justice Marshall . We approach the task with diffidence , and a consciousness of our inability to do justice to the theme . Though it seems difficult to say too much , yet any thing like extravagance or exaggeration would be peculiarly unworthy of one so remarkable for his simplicity and truth , who was as much above concealing his own nature , as affecting one which did not belong to him . The rough strokes and glaring colors in which the characters of the vulgar herd of great men , so called , may be struck off , can not express the serene equilibrium of his virtues , and the exquisite temper of his mind . His greatness was unpretending , and little likely to impress a careless observer , or to be felt by a vulgar minded man ; and we may safely state it as a general principle , that the trihute of admiration which a man would pay to Chief Justice Marshall , would be in proportion to his own moral and intellectual nature , and that his character could only be fully appreciated by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . One is often led to remark upon the peculiar adaptation , which certain individuals manifest for the stations which , in the course of events , they are called upon to fill ; an adaptation , in many cases , so very striking , as to press upon us the conviction that Providence , from time to time , raises up and specially endows men , for the performance of grave and high duties , making them important instruments in the promotion of its plans , for the improvement and happiness of the race . The most superficiaL observer , for instance , must have been struck with the admirable harmony between the mind and character of Washington , and the arduous tasks assigned to him to do ; and it is hard for a serious , not to say religious mind , to escape from the feeling that he was a peculiar gift of Heaven , reared and trained to be the deliverer of his people ; fitted " to perform justly , skilfully , and magnanimously , all the offices both public and private , of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he was placed , how easy it is to see , that a change even in the proportions of the elements which make up his matchless character , would often have made him unequal to the exigency ; and who could have weathered the storm , had he been obliged to quit the helm ? The same extraordinary adaptation is remarkable in the case of a man , in whose nature there was more of alloy , than in that of the spotless // commander-in-chief , and who entered into the political disputes of his day , with so much warmth as to make it yet hardly time enough for full justice to he done to his services and his motives ; we mean Alexander Hamilton . He appeared to have been expressly created to relieve the country from those desperate financial embarrasments , before which patriotism itself seemed to fold its hands in mute despair . His practical and theoretical skill , his self-confidence , his power of forming the largest plans , and at the same time of grasping the minutest details , and his comprehensive genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new government a going , and give it a fair trial of its powers . A political arithmetician , such a one as in ordinary times would make a very good Chancellor of the Exchequer , or Chairman of the committee of Ways and Means , would have been unequal to the Herculean task . We wanted a creative mind , rich in resources , fertile in expedients , that knew the hidden springs and sources of wealth , and whose magic voice could call it from the earth , the sea , the mountain , the forest and the stream ; and such a one was found in Hamilton . The late Chief Justice of the United States , in like manner , seemed to be so exactly adapted to his high station , that one could hardly help thinking , either that the office was made for the man , or the man for the office . Its duties , always arduous , were peculiarly so at the time when he assumed them , his own original and comprehensive genius haying erected many of those guides and landmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed , and their labors and responsihility lessened . It was easy to foresee that questions would arise , in which little assistance could be derived from municipal law , the decisions of courts or the dicta of judges ; but in which truth was to be elaborated by the severest exercises of reason , and the most patient analysis of logic . To be learned merely , was not enough , for learning , however accurate or profound , would furnish no guiding clue in those new and untried paths of investigation , in which progress could he made only by the selfderived and self-sustained energies of an intellectual pioneer . The constitution also devolved upon the Supreme Court , duties of the most delicate and embarrassing nature . It was to sit as arbiter in questions , which , considering the great and continually increasing extent of the sphere of their influence , may be fairly esteemed the most momentous and important that // ever came before a human tribunal . It was not to settle merely trivial disputes about lands and money , but to establish great principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line was pregnant with vast consequences , to check inferior tribunals , to cross the path of legislative assemblies ; and to hold aloft the even-handed scales of justice between conflictin* states . Men 's strongest hopes , their most deep-rooted b prejudices , their most vital prepossessions were the mighty combatants that struggled in its arena . To preside over such a court , wisely and well , required an extraordinary , almost an unprecedented combination of moral and intellectual powers : a mind clear-sighted and original , patient in the discovery and luminous in the exposition of truth ; a dignity and elevation of character to give weight to every opinion ; and a moral courage , to speak out boldly the convictions of the understanding , without fear or favor . The mere force of authority could not have established the decrees of such a tribunal , unless they had been aided by the irresistible championship of truth , and sustained by arguments extorting the assent even of prejudiced minds . It was necessary too , that there should be the most entire confidence in the purity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotedness to justice ; and the suspicion even of a stain would have been fatal to the influence of the most gifted individual , and cast " ominous conjecture " over all his judicial acts . Nor would a violent political partizan have met the reasonable expectations of the public ; nor would the decisions of such a man , however learned , eloquent and well reasoned , have been received with silent deference ; in those cases in which the political feelings of the people were concerned , and there are few questions of general interest in our country , which do not become party questions . When we also bear in mind how important a part of the government , the Supreme Court is made by the constitution , and how much its success , and consequently the prosperity of the country were to depend upon the manner in which it discharged its functions , and how much too , the cha* racter of the Court would partake of the character of its head , we shall be prepared to feel the vast , the overwhelming weight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of our history , consented to be clothed with the dirn Chief Justice of the United States . ity of That this responsibility was deeply felt by Chief Jus // tice Marshall , is an unavoidable inference from bis modesty and his conscientiousness , though the favor with which the appointi*ient was received by the country shewed that the community , which rarely forms a wrong estimate of the powers and gifts of a public man , was aware of his eminent qualifications for the office , and expected that the man would not be inferior to the place . He thus entered upon his judicial life with no prejudices against him , but on the contrary with impressions in his favor ; and this confidence suffered no diminution , but if possible , was continually on the increase , from that moment to the hour of his death . The primitive arid elemental structure of his mind made him peculiarly fit for the station of a judge . It was calm , contemplative , and profound . He was patient in the investigation of a subject , and able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him had been thoroughly examined in all its bearings , and every argument deliberately considered . He bad that strong common sense which lies at the foundation of intellectual greatness . He was , to an extraordinary degree , free from those infirmities of mind which beget distrust in the conclusions arrived at . Sophistry could not darken , nor brilliant rhetoric dazzle his understanding . His vigorous logic unravelled the most tangled web , which a metaphysical advocate could weave , and stripped every question of all those adventitious appendages which were intended to disguise its real shape and feature . He had , in great perfection , that power , which Sir Isaac Newton said was the only thing in which he differed from other men ; the ability to keep a subject constantly in his mind , and contemplate it steadily , and apart from every thing else , till the dawning truth by degrees brightened into the perfect day . This calmness and soberness of mind are only found in men of a high order of greatness . A restless mind may be acute and ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Coleridge said , that lie had known very few men who loved the truth for the truth 's sake ; if he had known Chief Justice Marshall , be would have included him in the select list . He loved the truth for its own sake , and because his mind could find satisfaction and repose in nothing else . Lord Bacon , in one of those pregnant sentences , which condense a world of thought into a few words , remarks , that " the light of the understanding is not a dry and pure light ; but , drenched in the will and the affections ; and the intellect forms // the sciences accordingly . What men most desire to be true , they are most inclined to believe . " Chief Justice Marshall was a most striking exception to this general rule . Pure reason seemed to be the element in which his mind lived and moved , and the will and the affections offered no disturbing impulse . His was not one of those minds , which suddenly form an opinion and then cast about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept himself open to conviction , and came to a conclusion only because he could not help it , and the arguments he used to convince others were precisely those which he had previously used to convince himself . He was not , in any sense of the word , a learned man . " It is due to truth , " says Mr. Justice Story , " as well as to his memory , to declare that his judicial learning was not equal to that of many of the great masters in the profession , living or dead , at home or abroad . He yielded at once , to their superiority of knowledge , as well in the modern as in the ancient law . He adopted the notion of Lord Bacon , that " studies serve for delight , for ornament and for ability , in the judgment and disposition of business . " In his purely legal opinions , we do not find that exhaustinb fulness of discussion , and that copious flood of illustrations from every department of jurisprudence , which characterise those of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship , which gives such grace to the judicial style of Lord Stowell , whose eloquent lips flow with the sweetest honey of the Attic bee . The original and meditative cast of his mind , made him more inclined to reproduce a subject in a new form , and stamped with his own intellectual image , than to seek foreign aid in the pursuit of truth , and to adopt at second hand the impressions of another intellect . The natural tendency of his understanding to grow by observation and reflection , rather than by study , had been increased by the circumstances of his life . The time which most men , who are destined to the learned professions , pass over their books , he , in obedience to the call of patriotic duty , had spent in vigorous action , and although his mind and character were greatly developed by the crowded life which he lived , it certainly was not favorable to the acquisition of learned lore of any kind . Instead of passing from school to college , from college to a lawyer 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his books a dozen years or more , with few calls of business to interrupt the even tenor of his // studies and speculations , we find him , after an irregular and desultory elementary education , at the very dawn of manhood , throwing aside his Blackstone , buckling on his knapsack , and plunging into the dangers and excitements of our revolutionary struggle . From that time he is constantly sustaining active duties , either of peace or war , and is never the solitary student . He is in the Legislature of his own State , in Congress , or absent in a foreign country on a diplomatic mission . He is the confidential friend of Washington , and the decided , though not the violent defender of his administration ; he lives in stirring tines , when every conspicuous man is called upon to take a part in political measures , and maintain his opinions with all his might . He was made by the force of circumstances , a " public creature , " to borrow Mr. Burke 's expression in regard to his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the calm retreats of private life , he was too disinterested and too conscientious not to make the sacrifice at the bidding of duty , and prefer the serving of his country to the gratification of his own tastes . As we have hinted above , we think that the whole course of his life was eminently favorable to the growth of his mind and character . In the highest of all forms of education , the education of circumstances , he was fortunate to an uncommon degree . Providence assigns to every human soul its own peculiar method of culture , and one mind starves in the midst of what is intellectual abundance to another . Some men are meant to study books , and others , things ; and Chief Justice Marshall was one of the latter class . His mind drew its natural aliment from observation and reflection , and the various responsible offices which he sustained supplied it with constant food . He was enabled to bring his opinions to the test of experience , and lay strongly the foundations of his intellectual being . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpened , the lines of discrimination were more nicely drawn , his masculine logic was wielded with more efficiency and skill , and his understanding acquired that force which springs from symmetrical development . The extensive field of his observation helped him to acquire that rare and inestimable gift , which he had in great perfection , and which is nine parts in ten in the composition of a wise man , the power of seeing things exactly as they are , without confusion , distortion or discoloring . A familiar acquaintance with practical life and with vor4. xLIs. - No. 90. 29 // the sayings and doings of men under the excitement of hopes , fears and wishes , is an indispensable ingredient in the education of the mind that is to exercise an important influence over others . The advice which a great living poet gives to his bookish friend , " Come forth into the light of things , " is as important to be followed by those who are to sustain the great duties of life , as by the bard who desires to translate the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore regret the hours which Chief Justice Marshall spent in the camp and the senate , or wish that he had rather devoted them to solitary communing with the sages of the law . The wisdom which the former course gave him , was of more importance to his country , than the learning with which the latter might have furnished him . When we say that he was not a learned man , we are speaking relatively not absolutely . His learning did not bear the same proportion to his original powers , as is generally the case *vitb men who devote themselves successfully to a learned l ) rofession ; but there was no deficiency in it , on the contrary an ample store . He was incapable of discussing any subject superficially , and when it was necessary to investigate it by the aid of books , he would do it thoroughly . But when his mind was made up he would pursue the inquiry no further . Hence we find in his opinions , no superfluous learning , none of that affluence of legal lore , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His logical and discriminating un derstandin0 enabled him to grasp the essence of a case , and to disen*are from a crowd of authorities , the ruling principles of the law applicable to it . He studied with a definite object in view , and because he wished to apply its results to immediate use , and not because he had a predominating love for the employment . He read for the purpose of exercising his reflection , rather than storing his memory , and was more familiar with principles than cases . We should naturally infer from the character of his intellect , that he would be desirous of having every question that came before him , thoroughly argued , and that his powers of analysis and intuitive perception of truth , would give hini the mastery over even an unfamiliar subject , when the oJ ) posite authorities and conflicting decisions were spread before him . On this point , the testimony of Mr. Justice Story is full and explicit . // " He was solicitous to hear arguments ; and not to decide causes without them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , whether the subject was new or old ; familiar to his thoughts , or remote from them ; buried under a mass of obsolete learning , or developed for the first time yesterday ; whatever was its nature , he courted argument , nay , he demanded it . It was matter of surprise to see , how easily he grasped the leading principles of a case , and cleared it of all its accidental incumbrances ; how readily he evolved the true points of the controversy , even when it was manifest , that he never before had caught even a glimpse of the learning , upon which it depended . He seized , as it were by intuition , the very spirit of juridical doctrines , though cased up in the armor of centuries ; and he discussed authorities , as if the very minds of the Judges themselves stood disembodied before him . " - p. 70 . His opinions are remarkable for nddressing themselves rather to the common than the legal mind . They seem like the reasonings of a powerfid understanding , applying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the solution of the particular problem under consideration , and as a general rule , they can be followed and understood by any strong minded man whether in the profession or not . Those who take pleasure in such speculations , and are interested in observing by what different processes , two superior minds arrive at the same results , will be gratified in reading the opinions of Chief Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Story in the Dartmouth College Case , reported in the fourth volume of Wheaton 's Reports . The character of his mind , its patience , its calmness , its power of analysis and generalization , and the steadiness of its movements , made him peculiarly fitted for the exposition of constitutional law . Whatever rank may be assigned to him as a common lawyer , in this department he stands confessedly alone and without a rival . Indeed , he can not with so much propriety be said to have mastered constitutional law , as to have created it . He found it in its rudiments , and left it a beautiful and matured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own commanding intellect . He was in the vigor of manhood at the formation of the constitution , and one of the ablest advocates of its adoption in his native state , and his desire to vindicate it from the objections urged against by its opponents , no less than a conscientious love of truth , made him study it profoundly . And as he understood it well , so he valued it deeply , and he pressed its acceptance with that unbought // energy and power , which nothing but affection could minister . His convictions of its excellence increased with his years , and when he was called upon to expound it in his judicial capacity , he approached the task with the most devout wish to give to every line its true force , and to interpret it in such a manner as to secure to his fellow-citizens , every advantage intended by its founders . His constitutional opinions hear the stamp of deep meditation and the most pains-taking search after the truth . Every word seems to have been pondered before it was written , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is laid down , till the force of argument could no further go , and every conclusion follows irresistibly from the premises . This single-minded devotion to truth was seconded by unexampled powers of analysis , interpretation and reasoning . His logic was of the most searching kind , and detected sophistry , however ingenious , with unerring instinct . He was equally acute in anticipating and meeting objections , and clear in the exposition of his own views . His argument is indeed so clear and transparent , that one is apt at first to underrate its strength . His manner of reasoning is very strict and compact , and his constitutional opinions are an unbroken chain of inferences and positions , with but little help from analogy . They are close-woven and impenetrable as iron net-work . They are so complete , that nothing could be added to or taken from them , without disadvantage . The premises may be denied , and that is the only way in which they can be answered , for no flaw can be found in the reasoning , and the conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their value as expositions of an instrument , which is the highest law of the land , might be advantageously studied as models of clear and profound investigation , and of the application of vigorous logic to the elucidation of truth . When we regard their originality , their depth , their clearness , and their adamantine strength* we look upon them as among the highest efforts of the human mind . We behold in them , the animating spectacle of a great intellect grappling with a great subject , not from love of display , or the praise of men , hut from the highest of motives and for the noblest of ends . Here , he was thrown hack upon himself , to make precedents without precedents to aid him , and without authorities. , to establish rules and principles , which were to exert an influence upon increasing multitudes of men , hitherto unknown to the decisions of courts of justice . // His way was a dim and perilous one , and he had no lamp to his feet but the inward light of reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was to launch boldly upon an untried sea of speculation , with no guides but those primal principles of truth and Justice , which " shine aloft like stars . " The admiration which one feels for the intellectual powers displayed by Chief Justice Marshall in his expositions of the constitution , is not to be confounded with assent to the results to which he came . it is well known that many distinguished men have differed , and still differ from him in his views of constitutional law , and that his learned associates upon the bench have not , uniformly , all gone along with him . He loved the constitution and he loved the union , and the desire of preserving and maintaining both , was uppermost in his mind . He was in favor of interpreting the constitution largely and generously , and giving to it that liberal construction which would leave no line , or letter inoperative , and which would , by its greater efficiency , draw more closely the cords which bind us together . He was not a States-rights man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently more fearful of the centrifugal than the centripetal force in our system . Lie was consistent in his political opinions , and made no disguise of them . His views of constitutional law , whether right or wrong , have received the approbation of a large majority both of the profession and the community at large . in looking back upon the extent of his labors in this department , and recollecting with what patient intellectual toil , the simplest constitutional opinion must be elaborated , " we are lost in admiration at the strength and stretch of the human understanding. *** We are struck not only with the superiority of his decisions , when considered separately , but with their unity when combined . They constitute nearly a perfect system of constitutional law , as almost every constitutional question , requiring a judicial decision , came before the court , during the perod in which he presided over it . An analytical examination of these opinions does not form a part of our plan ; indeed it would not be possible to include it within the limits of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a most valuable one might be made out of it , equally important // and interesting to the statesman , the patriot , and the constitutional lawyer , in which full justice might be done , not only to their high rank as productions of the human mind , hut to the indirect influence exerted hy them , in giving stability to the government and permanence to the Union . We know of no one better qualified for the task , than he , who in this Eulogy has shewn so perfect an acquaintance with the mind and character of Chief Justice Marshall , and in his Commentaries on the Constitution , has displayed so clear an understanding of that instrument and so minute a knowledge of its history . May we venture to hope that he may he induced to undertake a work , which he could do so well , and for which the country and the profession would he alike so grateful to him ? It was fortunate for Chief Justice Marshall 's own fame , as well as for the happiness and prosperity of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court at such a period , and remained upon it so long , as made it necessary for the most prominent constitutional questions to he suhjected to his examination and decision . We perceive the same coincidence between his powers and his opportunities , which strikes the reader of the history of English law , in the case of Lord Mansfield . This great man was made Chief Justice of the King 's Bench at a time when the commercial operations of Great Britain were rapidly extending themselves , and it was a matter of necessity that her meagre commercial code should he expanded , to meet its new requisitions , by the principles of natural equity flowing from a mind of large views and comprehensive grasp , and hy the incorporation of materials horrowed from foreign sources . Lord Mansfield , from his vigorous and original mind , and his acquaintance with civil and continental law , was precisely calculated for this duty , so that he was enahled almost to create the commercial law of modern England , sometimes drawing from the pure sources of justice in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common law , rules and principles drawn from Roman and European jurisprudence , which the exclusive spirit of Westminster Hall would have rejected , had they been offered with their origin upon their front . In like manner , had Chief Justice Marshall gone upon the bench a quarter of a century later , his own fame must have suffered , as he would not have had it in his power to exercise his faculties so much in that line of discussion in which he shone so preeminent . He would have been an admirable // judge , would have ennobled and dignified his elevated station ; his country would have honored him while living and mourned him when dead ; but we should never have known the extent of his powers . To constitute greatness , there must be not only a great man , but great opportunities . The moral constitution of Chief Justice Marshall was in perfect harmony with his intellectual nature . In this respect , he was one of those rare beings that seem to be sent among men from time to time , to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alloy as ever entered into the composition of a human creature . From the very first , he seemed to do nothing wrong , and to leave nothing undone which it was right for him to do . He wore the yoke of duty , without being conscious , apparently , of its weight , and seemed to find pleasure in those toils and self-sacrifices , to which most men bring themselves , only by dint of severe struggle . He was never betrayed by the exuberance of his temperament and the xvarmth of his passions , into those errors which wise men pardon , while they lament , and during the course of his long life , he had nothing to look hack upon with regret , or to wish forgotten by others . " He needed not the smart of guilt to make him virtuous , nor the regret of folly to make him wise . " The qualities of his character were so admirably tempered , and with so happy a mixture of the moving and controlling principles , that be rose at once , and spontaneously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the refining exercises of sufferinc , and by perpetual self-victories . From the moment that he assumed the office and functions of manhood , he was an object of peculiar interest to all discerning persons . It was plain that here was a man of stern virtue , of uncomprising integrity , who had a natural affinity for every thing honorable and of good report , and upon whose character , any expectations might be rested with unlimited confidence . That John Marshall could ever be the sordid slave of money , the devotee of vulgar ambition , the time-serving sycophant , the mercenary politician , selling his gifts in the market-place , the treacherous enemy , the faithless friend , no more entered into the minds of men , than that the fiery wheels of the sun would roll back in their course , 01 the streams wind their way from the ocean to the mountain-tops . This purity and strength of moral nature , gave him an influence which talents alone , however eminent , could not have ensured , and which , ( as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most convincing proofs of the existence of a moral sense among men . It bound his friends to him with links of steel , crowning their regard with that reposing confidence which is never granted to men of no moralnerve , however rich in accomplishments , sweet in disposition , or attractive in manners . It tempered the opposition of those who differed from him in opinion , with high personal consideration . It gave him a rich harvest of opportunities , at a period when most men are in the midst of aimless efforts and crude fancies , abridging to a span the season of promise , so thickly did his duties crowd upon nim , so soon did the fruits take the place of the blossoms . How remarkably his moral organization adapted him for a high judicial station , is evident to any one who remembers how much a man 's character affects the manner in which his opinions are received , and how powerful it is , either as an ally or an enemy to his mind . He went upon the bench at an age when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the conduct and conversation of men , not totally abandoned , are varnished over with an outward show of decencies and gravities , which is hardly distinguished by superficial observers , from the form of authentic virtue . Men , moreover , of a glowing and exuberant nature , must work themselves clear , by a sort of fermentation , in which the fiery and fervid elements pass off , and the pure and strong ones remain , and of such , the finest and noblest beings are often made ; but most men have either too little philosophy , or too little charity to understand and feel all this . In a model judge , a judicial beau-id*al , we want no superficial , skin-deep goodness , but a moral system , sound to the very core , and a character so happily moulded , as to begin right , and not merely come right . Mankind , and perhaps it is best that it should be so , respect most highly , him who has had nothing to alter , and nothing to repent , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done . There are reptiles in human limbs , whom no lapse of time can persuade to bury in oblivion , the weakness , the error , or the sin of a fellow-creature , and whose delight it is , to drag even from the dread repose of the grave , the forgotten frailties of the good , the wise and the just . Against the attacks of such creatures , Chief Justice Marshall was cased in an armor of proof . Though he had lived in the public eye , from his very boyhood , his life defied the scrutinizing glance of envy . It was a pure // arid cloudless summer 's day ; a strain of music , perfect to the close , with not one rude note to grate upon the ear . He had laid his first fruits upon the altar of duty , and his last breath was spent in its service . It is not too much to say that this spotless virtue enforced every opinion that he gave , and that his country felt the advantage of it , to a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition , which might have swelled into a torrent-like roar , die away in faint whispers . It disposed candid men to believe that he who had always acted right , must also , of necessity , think right . The manners of Chief Justice Marshall were marked by that unaffected dignity and simplicity , which so well become a great magistrate . That calmness which gave so much strength to his mind , imparted itself to his whole nature . His temperament was of that placid kinc* , which is most favorable to wisdom , and without which a man can hardly be a practical philosopher . Nothing bad power to disturb his equanimity , or ruffle the smoothness of his temper . He had none of that nervous excitability , which good men often find such a " thorn in the flesh . " Neither vain repetition , nor frothy verbiage , nor declamatory nonsense , ( and how much of all , must have been inflicted upon his " naked ears , " ) ever wrung from him a peevish remark , or an irritable gesture . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweetness ; the gravity of the judge tempered with the courtesy of the gentleman . His moderation was known in all things . He was a stranger to the extremes of excitement and depression , and the even flow of his cheerfulness betokened a perpetual sunshine of the breast . His conversation never dazzled by its brilliancy , or eloquence , or exuberance , but was characterized by quiet good sense , more than any thing else . He was never engrossing or obtrusive , and rather required to be drawn out . He was no social tyrant , trampling on opponents , with that overhearing intolerance which so often disgraces men who are conspicuous for their talents and station . Many who met him , were disappointed in not finding in his conversation , those striking qualities which they bad anticipated ; but no one left his presence , without carrying away the most gratifying recollection of his kindness , his sincerity and his entire want of pretension . His simplicity was indeed proverbial . It seemed sometimes to puzzle and disconcert those who saw him for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , so very plain and unpretending . // They expected to see the Chief Justice oC the United States , keeping up a sort of official state , even in private . Bt4 he was ah 've this poor affectation , which is generally the disguise of conscious weakness , fearful of detection . He never desired to pass for any other than what he really was , and did not wish that the Chief Justice should receive a consideration which was not due to John Marshall . No man ever bore his honors more meekly . His dignity was not of that flimsy and unsubstantial texture , which can not bear a near approach or a rude touch . He had none of that uneasy self-consciousness , which is ever on the watch to see that every one pays the exact amount of deference which is due . He sympathized readily and cordially with others , and was warm and constant in his affections . In particular , he felt a livehr interest in the young , and seemed to grow young himself , in watching the glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had nothing of that austerity and moroseness which , in old a , e , sometimes blight the genial charities of the heart . He did not feel cut off and apart from the generations that came after him , nor think that the glory would pass away from the earth , with that to which he belonged . As his youth was tempered with the wisdom and serenity of age , so his age was graced with much of that unworn freshness of feeling , which is so lovely in youth . Not only his early attachments , but his early tastes , even in amusements , were retained by him unimpaired , and he might he seen , in the very last years of his life , engaged with the keen relish of boyhood , in a game of quoits . His fondness for this exercise is one of those characteristic traits which ought to he preserved , and which mark the manly simplicity of his character and his disdain of affectation . If there be any one who thinks this an undignified amusement for a Chief Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spartan king , who being engaged in some cheerful sport , and observing a solemn coxcomb approaching , remarked to his companions : " My friends , we must he grave , for here comes a fool . " There are some interesting points in the private and domestic character of Chief Justice Marshall , which are given with so much beauty and feeling , by Mr. Justice Story , that we can not deny ourselves the pleasure of transcribing the passages in question . " He was a man of deep sensibility and tenderness ; nay , he was an enthusiast in regard to the domestio virtues .. He was endowed // by nature with a temper of great susceptibility , easily excited , and warm , when roused . But it had been so schooled by disci* pline , or rather so moulded and chastened by his affections , that it seemed in gentleness , like the distilling dews of evening . It had been so long accustomed to flow in channels , where its sole delight was to give or secure happiness to others , that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitate or sudden in its movements . In truth , there was , to the very close of his life , a romantic chivalry in his feelings , which , though rarely displayed , except in the circle of his most intimate friends , would there pour out itself with the most touching tenderness . In this confidential intercourse , when his soul sought solace from the sympathy of other minds , he would dissolve in tears at the recollection of some buried hope , or lost happiness . He would break out into strains of almost divine eloquence , while he pointed out the scenes of former joys , or recalled the memory of other days , as he brought up their images from the dimness and distance of forgotten years , and showed you at once the depth , with which he could feel , and the lower depths , in which he could bury his own closest , dearest , noblest emotions . After all , whatever may be his fame in the eyes of the world , that , which , in a just sense , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberality , and devotedness of his domestic life . Home , home , was the scene of his real triumphs . There , he indulged himself in what he most loved , the duties and the blessings of the family circle . There , his heart had its full play ; and his social qualities , warmed , and elevated , and refined by the habitual elegancies of taste , shed around their beautiful and blended lights . There , the sunshine of his soul diffused its softened radiance , and cheered and soothed and tranquillized the passing hours . " May I be permitted also in this presence to allude to another trait in his character , which lets us at once into the inmost recesses of his feelings with an unerring certainty . I allude to the high value , in which he held the female sex , as the friends , the companions , and the equals of man . I do not here mean to refer to the courtesy and delicate kindness , with which he wasaccustomed to treat the sex ; but rather to the unaffected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their talents , their virtues , and their excellencies . The scoffs and jeers of the morose , the bitter taunts of the satirist , and the lighter ridicule of the witty , so profusely , and often so ungenerously , poured out upon transient follies or fashions , found no sympathy in his bosom . He was still farther above the common-place flatteries , by which frivolity seeks to administer aliment to personal vanity , or vice to make its approaches for baser purposes . He spoke to the sex , when present , as he spoke of them , when absent , in language of // just appeal to their understandings , their tastes , and their duties . He paid a voluntary homage to their genius , and to the beautiful productions of it , which now adorn almost every branch of literature and learning . He read those productions with a glowing gratitude . He proudly proclaimed their merits , and vindicated on all occasions their claims to the highest distinction . And he did not hesitate to assign to the great female authors of our day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifted and polished of the other sex . But , above all , he delighted to dwell on the admirable adaptation of their minds , and sensibilities , and affections to the exalted duties assigned to them by Providence . Their superior purity , their singleness of heart , their exquisite perception of moral and religous sentiment , their maternal devotedness , their uncomplaining sacrifices , their fearlessness in duty , their buoyancy in hope , their courage in despair , their love , which triumphs most , when most pressed by dangers and difficulties ; which watches the couch of sickness , and smooths the bed of death , and smiles even in the agonies of its own sufferings ; - These , these were the favorite topics of his confidential conversation ; and on these he expatiated with an enthusiasm , which showed them to be present in his daily meditations. " - pp. 53-56 . Among the qualifications which were possessed by Chief Justice Marshall , for an office as laborious as it is responsible , we must not overlook a healthy physical organization and great soundness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be permanent vigor of mind , and great intellectual efforts require great physical energies . He was capable of uncommon exertions , both of body and mind , and his habits of exercise and temperance preserved his powers unimpaired to the last . He was very athletic in his youth , fond of field sports , and excelled in all exercises which require strength or agility . The mountain breezes filled his veins with health , and braced his frame with that robust energy , which carried him so triumphantly through the exhausting duties , alike of the camp and the forum . His arduous judicial labors he discharged with an ease which seemed unconscious of their weight . Without doubt , much of that uniformity of health which he enjoyed was due to the calmness of his moral temperament , to his pure and simple tastes , his self-command , and to his never having been , at any period of his life , the slave of wasting passions . Still , without an uncommonly favorable constitution of body , he could never have gone on , nearly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laborious office , without the least // decay of his faculties , and with a vigor of mind which burned clear to the last . Nor is it one of the least remarkable facts about him , that his ablest opinions were written after the age of sixty , when , by the laws of the largest State in the Union , a man ceases to be qualified for a judicial office . We have been considering Chief Justice Marshall exclusively in his judicial capacity , and have endeavored to shew how admirably the whole constitution of his nature was adapted to the place which he occupied during the last thirty-four years of his life . In doing this , we have by no means overlooked his previous career , nor been insensible to the merit displayed by him as a legislator , a diplomatist , and a statesman . Had he died at the age of forty-five , he would have left behind him a most honorable name , and been gratefully remembered by his country , as one of the most able and high-minded of her sons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the other efforts of his intellect , imposing as these appear , when contemplated singly . His mind , his character and his temperament were so well calculated for the Bench , that we have preferred to consider all that he did , previous to his appointment , rather as a course of preparatory exercises to educate him for that great station to which he had received a sort of native bias , than as constituting by themselves any considerable portion of his fame . Indeed , his speeches , his arguments , and his writings were all imbued with a kind of judicial character , and in his whole course as a public man , he appeared more like a wise judge , seeking after and announcing the truth , than as a reckless partizan , who wanted to know only on what side he was to fight . His speech in the legislature of Virginia on the occasion of Mr. Jay 's treaty with Great Britain , in which he maintained the constitutional right of the Executive to conclude a commercial treaty , ( and which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also all the effect of a judicial opinion , it caused a most important modification in the resolutions of the Assembly , which silently abandoned the constitutional objection , though it had been previously pressed with great warmth and confidence . His well known argument in the House of Representatives of the United States , in the case of Jonathan Robbins , has been preserved . It enjoys an authority almost unknown to any judicial argument . It settled the question under debate entirely at // the time , and has ever been esteemed unanswerable ; and in a point of constitutional law , it would be cited as readily , andbe entitled to nearly as much weight , as any of his constitutional opinions . Had he remained all his life at the bar , he could hardly have occupied the imposing station before his country that he now does . Eminent as he must have been in the very highest ranks of the profession , he would have had comparatively few opportunities of displaying that kind of intellectual power in which he was so richly gifted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is not the quality most important to an advocate ; indeed , it would sometimes stand very much in his way . It is hardly consistent with the fervid eloquence which addresses the minds of men through their passions and feelings ; for this seldom exists without a taint of exaggeration , and a certain facility of understanding , which makes it the slave of the impulses and affections . That pure reason , - that mens sine affectu , which is so essential to a great judge , is not , and can not be combined with that vividness of feeling and susceptibility of organization , which are ingredients so necessary in the composition of an orator or a poet . We can not have at once the strength of the oak and the flexibility of the willow . The splendid forensic eloquence of Lord Erskine did not prevent his being an indifferent Chancellor . Chief Justice Marshall could no more have spoken Mr. Ames 's speech on the British treaty , than Mr. Ames could have pronounced his opinion on the constitutionality of the United States Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent with that intellectual dexterity , versatility , and power of doing one thing about as well as another , which our English brethren call cleverness . He would have argued a great legal question with irresistible power , and his exalted character would have given to his simplest statement , a force unknown to the passionate exuberance of rhetoric . But in many points of an advocate 's duty , he must have been surpassed by men , who , in intellectual stature , were pigmies to him , and his love of truth , no less than his strong moral sense , must have prevented him from manifesting much ardor , where he felt himself to be clearly in the wrong . Nor could he have reached his present eminence , if he had // devoted himself to the graver departments of literature , in which he would undoubtedly have been eminent . His Lifeof Washington is remarkable rather for its judicial than its literary merit . It wants the vividness , the eloquence , the glowing narrative , the picturesque sketches , and the lively details , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a high degree , those qualities of accuracy , fidelity and truth , which give permanent value to a work . It is not an easy book to read ; nor will it be read by those who read merely for the sake of reading ; but it will be always consulted as the highest authority in the subjects of which it treats , equally correct in details , and just in its general views . It is almost unexampled for its candor and firmness , when we bear in mind that the author is narrating events in which he himself took an important share , and has occasion to make frequent mention both of political friends and foes . Let any one compare it with Clarendon*s History of the Rebellion , for instance , and he will be prepared to perceive its superiority in these respects , and to understand how important it is that a historian should he a man of stern moral sense . It is as a judge and a magistrate , that his claim upon the remembrance of posterity and the gratitude of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to rank side by side with the most exalted models of judicial excellence that the world has ever seen ; with Sir Matthew Hale , Lord Mansfield , and Chancellor D'Aguesseau . In looking back upon his long life , so crowded with the efforts and sacrifices of duty , so spotless , so perfect , beaming with so serene a lustre from every point and period , we can not but think it a cause of national gratitude , that Providence has given us such a man , and crowned him with such store of useful years . That he was one of our fellow-citizens , is a reason for feeling more proud of our country . A nation is twice blessed in such a being . He exerts a great indirect as well as direct influence upon the community . We are accustomed to speak of the inestimable services which Chief Justice Marshall has conferred upon his country , by drawing more closely the bonds of our Union , and by exercising over the various departments of the government that conservative and directing power , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated a system as ours . And this is just and proper . // But we must not overlook the debt of gratitude , which we owe him for his example , and the effect produced by the daily beauty of his life upon all who approached him . He was a man , " Whose powers shed round him in the common strife , Or mild concerns of ordinary life , A constant influence , a peculiar grace . " To converse with him was like beholding virtue in a visible shape ; and no susceptible person could leave his presence without feeling every good resolve strengthened , and every weakness rebuked . He was a memorable instance of a man , who , having been always in public life , contracted no stain upon the whiteness of his soul , and never parted with one jot of his own stern self-respect . Did any one wish to cite an example of one , in whom intellectual greatness was combined with unslumbering devotion to duty , and the healthiest moral sense ; did any father seek to point out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitated , and to make him love that light from Heaven , which shines round the good man 's path , the name of Marshall came spontaneously to the mind and the lips . Other conspicuous men had obvious flaws ; their public virtue was easily entreated ; they acted under the influence of the selfish , animal appetites ; they hungered after the loaves and fishes of office , or their private characters were stained with debasing vices , or they neglected the lesser moralities of social life . But here was one , in whose whole nature there was nothing upon which detraction could feed , or over which friendship could seek to cast a mantle of oblivion . How beautiful is the contemplation of such a life , while passing before our eyes ; how beautiful its recollection , when no longer seen . The memory of such men constitutes neither the smallest nor the least valuable portion of a nation s wealth . How superior is it to the trophies and banners of a thousand battle fields , and the laurels and cenotaphs of a thousand mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sheds sweet influences . No generous-hearted Englishman can , at this day , pronounce the name of Alfred , without a throb of mingled gratitude and admiration . The lapse of time but deepens and hallows the feelings , with which the truesouled patriot contemplates such men as these . Short as has // been our own national existence , the page of our history is thickly studded with bright names . " Great men have been among us ; hands that penned , And tongues that uttered wisdom ; better , none . " The wise , the good , the faithful have toiled and watched and died for us . There is no dreary dearth of men to chill the patriot as he looks hack upon the past . if we are insensible , it is not because there are no objects to awaken sensibility . The fault is in our own indifference . It is an ominous sign , when a nation no longer cherishes , with the liveliest fondness , the memory of its great men . When the languid pulse of patriotism shall cease to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Washin* , ton , Jay and Marshall , the grave of our prosperity will have been already dug.
