txt WHILE eloquence and mental philosophy , in almost every form , had reached a high degree of perfection , and poets had set examples for all coming ages , the healing art had made but slow progress in those branches of science , so important to the profession of medicine . Correct codes of laws had been formed , which had , in a good measure , settled the great doctrines of property and personal rights ; some of the arts had nearly attained their perfection , nice discriminations had been suggested in morals , and sublime views of hope and faith in religion had been promulgated to the world , before Vesalius had turned his acute mind to an examination of the human frame ; and the settlement of this country had commenced before Harvey had demonstrated the fact , that the blood circulated in the veins of man . From the earliest ages , human blood had been poured out like water in every battle , but no observer of nature had discovered that it had a regular tide through his own heart . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who performed wonders in the advancement of medical knowledge ; but their names appear , in the distances of Time , like pyramids in the deserts , grand and imposing , but of little utility to the world . Many mighty minds , from iEsculapius to Galen , had been brought to hear upon physic and surgery , and ponderous tomes had been written on every branch of the healing art ; but the age of inductive philosophy had not come , and nature had only been partially unveiled . The aphorisms , laid down by Hippocrates and others , have often been misunderstood , and their prescriptions misapplied . Whatever rays of medical science there were scattereil through the world , they had not been concentrated , and but few efforts made to bring them to a focus , until a little more than a century ago , when the eclectic school of medicine was founded in Scotland , which was followed by others in London , France , and other places ; yet , in justice it should be stated , that these philosophers of the " House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Padua . In this university the Greek and Arabic works on medicine had been studied . Much earlier than is generally imagined , the accounts of what was doing in the old world were promulgated in the new . Soon after the establishment of these medical schools in Europe many physicians of this country were desirous of drinking at their fountains . Those , who could not cross the Atlantic themselves , frequently sent their most promising pupils to drink inspiration from the pure waters , which were rolling from these springs . If a fortunate few only enjoyed these privileges , the number was sufficient to give a new impulse to the profession in this country . Even before the commencement of the revolution , Rush , Bard , Warren , and Hunter began to collect pupils , and diffuse medicalinstruction in their respective circles . The political struggle , if it suspended their individual efforts , for a while , increased the general knowledge in medicine and surgery throughout the country . After the peace of 178:3 , they renewed their efforts ; the place of General Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their paths were full of difficulties , but they were men of genius // and firmness of purpose , and would not yield to any obstacles thrown in their way . Before these pioneers in their profession were called to depart from the scenes of their labors , they saw others , better educated than themselves , filling the chairs of the schools they had founded . This first generation of professors had no ordinary share of fame , when they were living ; and their pupils , who now wear their mantles1 have , in gratitude and affection , taken no small share of pains to preserve materials for the biographies of their masters . These materials have greatly assisted the Nestor of their profession  --  the venerable Dr. Thacher-in making up his valuable volume of the lives of medical men who have been lights in their day , and deserve an ample page in our records . No man of historical information will , for a moment , question the assertion , that there is as good a share of learning , acuteness , and perseverance , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other walk of life . A noble rivalry has taken place among the medical professors , and youthful aspirants for distinction are every where found . This emulation not only abounds in the cities , and larger towns , but there is scarcely a village throughout the land , that does not contain a respectable practitioner of medicine , and often , in the same person , a good surgeon . Where quacks and charlatans once swarmed , - " creatures , " to use the language of Hippocrates , " whom no law can reach and no ignominy disgrace , " - respectable physicians now administer to assuage the pains that flesh is heir to , and cure the maladies of the mind . Prominent among those , who have labored hard for the benefit of mankind , and for the honor and advantage of the healing art , may be ranked Professor JOHN W. FRANCIS , M. D. a practitioner of medicine in the city of New-York-his birth-place . He was born in the year 1789-that eventful period of our national history , when the constitution of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a German from Nuremberg , and known in New-York as an enterprising , upright trader in groceries , possessing a very liberal and charitable spirit , whose career of usefulness was suddenly cut short by the yellow fever , which , in those days , often visited the city . The mother of Dr. Francis was born in Pennsylvania ; her family , by the name of Sommer , were originally from Berne , Switzerland . 1-ler children were young when her husband died ; but she was left in circumstances sufficiently easy to give them a good elementary education , which opportunity , as a good mother , she improved . John was continued at an English school of no little reputation , under The charge of the Rev. George Strebeck ; by particular arrangement he studied the Latin language then , for a while , but afterward pursued his classical studies under the instruction of the Rev. John Conroy , a distinguished graduate of Trinity College , Dublin . By the aid of this excellent scholar he was enabled to enter Columbia College in an advance standing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his medical studies with great zeal and success ; this was effected by a capacity , an ardor , and perseverance , which have marked his whole course of life . He had not only mental energy , but a vigorous constitution , which sustained him in intense application in the acquisition of knowledge . // In 1807 , he commenced his professional studies with David Hosack , M. D. who was then professor of Materia Medica , and Botany , in Columbia College , and among the most extensively engaged in the practice of physic and surgery in New-York . Under this distinguished preceptor , Dr. Francis had excellent opportunities of seeing practice . During his attendance on the lectures , he never absented himself from one of them , nor suffered one to pass without making notes or abstracts on the subject taught by the lecturer . Every moment of his time was engaged ; he never looked to society around him for amusement or recreation ,  --  finding both in the variety of the subjects under his consideration . About this period , several laws for the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of New-York . County medical socieaies had been formed the year before , and promised to be auxiliary in promoting the cause of medical science . " The College of Physicians and Surgeons , " under the regents of the university , was organized in 1807 . From this institution , in 1811 , Dr. *Francis received the degree of M. D. This was the first commencement of that body , under the presidency of Dr. Samuel Bard . The inaugural Thesis for that honor was a dissertation on Mercury , embracing its medical history , curative action , and abuse in certain diseases . It was a fine subject , and admirably handled . His researches were extensive , and many of his views were novel and profound . This hundred-armed giant , Mercury , in the Materia Medica , had never before found so discriminating an historian . This production gave him great fame at once , amon b his fellow-graduates , and the Faculty in general , both in this country and in Europe . It has been repeatedly noticed by different writers in various languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Francis had been in practice a few months only , when his late preceptor proposed to him a copartnership in business . This proposition , from the high standing of his friend , was too flattering to be neglected . This connection lasted until 1820 ; from that period he has exercised his art on his own responsibility . No man ever reached the head of his profession until he had ventnred to act solely for himself . The mind , to attain its utmost energy , must poise itself on its own strength and decision , and take all the consoquences of action . We have mentioned the establishment of the College of Physicians and Surgeons , in the city of New-York , under the regents of the university . From the organization of the institution , the chairs of every department were filled with men of distinction . Alterations were soon after made in the charter , and Dr. Francis was appointed , by the trustees , a lecturer in the Instituteof Medicine and the Materia Medica . Shortly after this period , a union was effected between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Physicians and Surgeons , " and Dr. Francis , in 1813 , received from the regents the appointment of professor of Materia Medica . He delivered the first public course of instruction to a class of one hundred and twenty students , declining all compensation for his services . The consolidation of two schools of medicine into one , brought together so numerous a body of professors , that the price of education was necessarily enhanced to those , who wished to attend all the courses of instruction. ; but Dr. Francis // was not among those who sought for pecuniary rewards alone ; the flattering manner , in which his conduct was estimated , was such a return as he desired for his exertions . About this time he published an LIis* torical Sketch of the College . Delighted at the prospect of this rising school , and fairly estimating the intellect of those engaged in building it up ; impressed , at the same time , with the ample resources , that the city of New-York possesses , of supporting such an institution , he at once made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that related to the subject so near his heart . The vision of a medical school , second to none on the American continent , that should , from its superior advantages , draw together the students from all parts of the country , was constantly in his mind . While in London , he became a pupil of the illustrious Abernethy ,  - -  attended the lectures of Brand , at the Royal Institution , those of Pearson , of St. George 's Hospital , &amp;c. &amp;c . Between Abernethy and Francis there sprung up a strong attachment . They possessed the same cast of mind , the same decision of character , the same openness and directness in uttering opinions , and the same scorn of dawdling ceremony and grave pretensions in the healing art . Such was Abernethy 's regard for Francis , that he offered hin a share of his business , which was then oppressively extensive . The mention of an anecdote , which the American physician has often related , will show that the proud Englishman loved honest fame . Dr. Francis presented Abernethy with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the former left his native shores . Abernethy had not anticipated such a testimonial of his professional merits from the United States . He seized the two volumes , cast his eye over them , and exclaimed , as he placed them on the mantle-piece of his study , " Stay here , John Abernethy , until I remove you . Egad this from America . " From England , Dr. Francis went to Scotland , Ireland , France , and Holland . With an eager curiosity , he examined all that was rare and prominent in these countries . His letters gave him access to all the savans and literati , wherever he traveled . In Scotland he shared the liberality of the great professors , in their schools , which has been proverbially extended to all , who come to drink of the wells of knowledge , which they have , by their sagacity and industry , sunk to produce healing waters for the benefit of mankind . Here , too , he witnessed the early experiments of the philosophic Brewster , in his private study , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received with true Irish cordiality . In France , he found the sweetest courtesy . With Denon , he viewed , in his cabinet , and in those institutions under his care , all that was magnificent in the arts . With such a guide , he could not mistake what was worthy of examination . Gall displayed to him the rich materials of his collection , on which he founded his system of Craniology . With Cuvier he noticed that which was more intimately connected with his own profession . Such a mind as Cuvier 's , so full , so holy , so abounding in love to God and man , must have imparted a magnetic influence to the minds of others . Dr. Francis is warm in his admiration of those lights of knowledge he any where met in his travels . He went forth to learn , to gather up matters worth pre // serving ; and a mind so disciplined to receive information , treasures it with wonderful facility . The amount of a year 's labor is almost incalculable . The mind , on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " with all the avidity of Aladin in the wizard 's cavern , after securing the lamp of the genii in his bosom . Dr. Francis was enamored with the learned men he met in different countries ; but his political affections were wedded to his own , and in the midst of his admiration of European learning , he was still a republican . Upon his return , he brought out with him a curious and valuable library , collected with taste and judgement , which has ever since been open to those who are engaged in writing any thing to enlighten the public . When he reached New-York , he found that the chair of Materia Medica had been added to that of Chemistry ; but he was at once appointed by the regents to that of the Institutes of Medicine . In the year 1817 , Dr. Francis filled the chair of Medical Jurisprudence , which had become vacant by the death of Dr. Stringhom , in connection with his other duties . In 1819 , by reason of the resignation of a professor , another change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was added to that of Practice , and the regents appointed Dr. Francis Professor of Obstetrics , with his former branch , Medical Jurisprudence . These chairs he held until 1826 , when he resigned , at the same time with Doctors Hosack , Mott , Macnevin , Mitchell , and others . The causes , which led to the course pursued by the professors of the Medical school , are not minutely within the writer 's knowledge ; but whatever they may have been , the friends of medical science must have deplored the event . The regents , while they accepted the resignation of that old established Faculty , bear testimony to their able and faithful services , in the discharge of their duties . It must be evident that the faithful discharge of duties in teachers , when the respective departments were so repeatedly changed , must have required the exercise of much labor and trouble . The professor had hardly engaged in one branch , with means to teach , before he was transferred to another . Nothing daunted with his task , while remembering the maxim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things to industry , " - he put off or put on the harness of his chair , without any complaint , and in every department proved his merits by the number of his pupils , and by the satisfaction and gratification they constantly expressed in regard to their teacher . The school , with these professors , was second to none in merit in the United States , and inferior in numbers , only to that of Philadelphia , notwithstanding the singularly formed constitution of the college was , from its foundation , unfriendly to its proper development and advancement . The celebrity of the professors was such as to command students from every part of the Union ; and these , wherever scattered , have borne testimony to the talents , intelligence , and zeal of their instructers . Soon after the resignation of the professors of the College of Physicians and Surgeons , they founded and organized chairs in Rutger 's College . They erected a most convenient building for their purposes , and entered on their respective duties with spirit , and continued their exertions for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // school ; but there were such difficulties thrown in their way , by legislative enactments ,  --  particularly in the revised statutes of the state ,  - -  that the Faculty gave up their school with a large number of students . Dr. Francis partook largely both in the labor and losses of this undertaking , and the latter was of no small amount . In this institution , Dr. Francis was Professor of Obstetrics and Legal Medicine ; and his success was very flattering . In amount of pupils , his classes were second only to those of Anatomy , which always commands the greatest number of pupils in every xvell-arranged Medical School . The close relationship , which exists between many parts of the physiological portion of a course of instruction on midwifery , with numerous topics discussed in forensic medicine , enabled the professor to enlarge , with practical advantage to his auditors . The professor had a rich museum , to illustrate his various and learned disquisitions . In Dr. Francis 's edition of Den man 's Midwifery , a large amount of facts and opinions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His history of the art , from the time of the ancients to that of the latest writers on the subject , has received the approbation of the most erudite and practical . lie had devoted from four to six hours a day to private and public instruction , for many years , and at the same time had been engaged in the labors of practice . The number of students under his care , while he was connected with the institutions above named , was , probably , greater than that of any other profession in New-York. lie now made up his mind to confine himself to practice alone , refusing to engage in private or public instruction . Even an extensive practice and the duties of instruction did not absorb all the time he devoted to labor ; for his pen had a share of his attention . Before he received his medical doctorate , while a student , he united with his preceptor , Dr. Hosack , and issued a prospectus for a new medical journal ; it was called the " American Medical and Philosophical Register . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled almnost entirely with original materials , and contains a large amount of informatiomi on medical subjects . After the completion of the fourth volume , the editors assumed the responsibility of the work , and announced their names . This journal has been held in high consideration , and is often had recourse to , for matters of deep interest or curious inquiry . Dr. Francis , in conjunction with the late Dr. Dykman and Dr. Beck , was for somne time editor of the New-York Medical and Philosophical Journal , which they projected ; he continued with them until the termination of the third volume . This work contains a number of his medical observations and records ; it has ceased to exist . Dr. Francis has written papers in many different medical arid scientific journals , in the United States , on subjects connected with his profession ; among the most prominent of these , and of a practical nature , are his observations on the Use of Vitriolic Emetics in Cramp , with details of cases , in which this novel remedy was effective , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , remarks on the Goitre , as it prevails in the western part of New-York , and elsewhere , drawn from his tour of observation in 1823 ; on Sanguinarea Canadensis ; Cases of Morbid Anatomy ; on Phlegmatid // dolens ; on Elaterium , and the Croton oil ; to which potent agents he was the first , in this country , who invited the attention of practitioners . He gained great credit for a paper on the successful treatment of cases in Ichthyosis . The last tractate which we have seen , from his pen , is one on the Mineral Waters of Avon , which he recommends as possessing valuable medical properties for several physical infirmities . His Letter on Febrile Contagion , dated in London , June , 1816 , addressed to Dr. Hosack , contains the exposition of the views of certain British writers on the insusceptibility of the constitution to a second attack of yellow fever . This curious fact concerning the disease , which was pretty fairly demonstrated by various writers of Great-Britain and the West-Indies , received additional confirmation from the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians , who had observed the pestilence in different parts of the United States . Dr. Francis was not only distinguished in the chair of Medical Jurisprudence , for collecting a mass of facts and arranging them in a clear and satisfactory manner , and for explaining them to the comprehension of his humblest pupils ; but for the promptness of his expositions when called upon in courts of criminal jurisdiction . During his whole professorship , and almost ever since , in every case , which involved a principle of medical jurisprudence , he was present ; seldom were his opinions controverted , and never overthrown . He was in attendance for the municipal authorities , in these courts ; but his integrity was above all bias , and it was seldom that the advocate of the accused summoned any other medical man . In the opinion of the writer of this article , no branch of science , taught in our schools , requires more careful investigation , or greater acuteness and strength of mind , than that of medical jurisprudence . Comparative views and analogical reasonings , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little service in juridical medicine . To obviate difficulties of this nature , Dr. Francis invariably availed himself of the information , which the morbid anatomy and pathological investigation of the case afforded . There is not a middle-aged lawyer in the country , whose memory does not furnish him with cases of gross injustice done in criminal trials , by reason of defective medical jurisprudence . A sagacious advocate , thinking that he is justified , in favor of human life , to entangle the physician , if he can , bends all his strength to the object , and not unfrequently succeeds in throwing him into a state of confusion . In cases of supposed death by poison , the most contradictory opinions have been given by medical men on the stand . The doings of death are , indeed , singular , and it is difficult for the wisest physician , at all times , to decide upon the causes of a sudden and unexpected instance of the extinction of human life ; and how can a common observer among the Faculty , tell whether it was accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine so fearfully and wonderfully made , or from suicidal frenzy , that " the silver cord of life was loosed , or the golden bowl broken , or the pitcher broken at the fountain , or the wheel at the cistern . " Long and deep reflection , with all the helps of science , can only reach an approximation to the exact truth , so many are the avenues to the courts of death . It is with pride , the friends of Dr. Francis re // view his testimony given in difficult cases . His opinion was always clear and decided ; for he always gave the subject a thorough examination . His fondness for science has not led him to neglect polite literature . His biographical writings are quite extensive ; not confined to those of his own profession ,  --  hut in that department they are more numerous than have come from the pen of any other physician in the country , if we except that of Dr. Thacher , of Massachusetts . These biographical notices are drawn with a free and manly hand , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the standard biographical works in our country . His sketch of the distinguished philosopher , Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell , with whom he was long associated in collegiate labors , is an honorable testimony to the memory of that remarkable man , whose genius and character will grow more luminous the longer his merits are contemplated . The occasional addresses of fir . Francis are written with t*iste and spirit , and evince , like his other writings , great research . His address to the New4ork Horticultural Society is a specimen of his style and manner-flowing , sweet , and unaffected . The oration before the Literary Societies of Columbia College , in May , 1831 , presents an intrepid and masterly outline of the life and services of that distinguished patriot , the late Chancellor Livingston . The venerable President Madison could not withhold a letter of approbation to the author , for the service he had done bio*raphy , by his interesting account of the revolutionary patriot . Dr. Francis is a member of many societies , and a liberal friend to all ; his intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them owe their continuance to his great exertions . A liberal physician is taxed severely for the poor ; his property is assessed for them the same as that of other men , and , in addition , his time and professional skill are at their service . In the latter visitations of the yellow fever , Dr. Francis was at his post , , and in constant attendance on the sick . In 1832 , while the cholera was raging in the city of New-York , and the citizens were flying into the country , and many physicians and divines with them ; when one , at noon-day , might see a mile of Broadway without a person in it ; or , if any vehicle was seen , it was a curtained bier , hiding the deathstruck visage of some patient for the hospital ; - if you , at such a time , crossed into narrow streets , you might see the subject of this sketch , and a few other humane physicians , with a moral bravery that far surpasses animal courage , entering into the abodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , and to combat Death in the most furious form in which he ever strode the earth . And , for the honor of human nature , it should be known that , in their wake , and directed to the same abodes of anguish , holy men were seen , carying the consolations of religion to the dying ;  --  a Schroeder , a Wainwright , a Powers , and a few other kindred spirits , when half their brethren had fled from the contagion , were as constantly exposed as the physicians themselves . During the period of ten weeks , Dr. Francis had hardly an hour 's respite , day or night , so incessant were the calls for his professional services . vrhe history of that period should be written , and credit given to those who deserve it . Nearly four thousand fell vic // tims to the pestilence . In the midst of these labors , Dr. Francis took notes of the most prominent cases of the cholera , and gave his observations to the press , which have spread far and wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had not been conversant with the disease . The authorities at Havana , when the cholera was there , had the work translated into the Spanish language , and widely distributed throughout the island of Cuba . Dr. Francis is an honorable practitioner ; he has no petty disputes with his professional brethren . He gives his views of a case with openness and candor , but avoids all collision , by leaving the field to those who are pertinacious in a difference of opinion . He indulges in no envious feelings at the success of others , and takes no airs at his own . Free to advise , he is surrounded by the junior members of the Faculty , who consult him when any difficulty is found in the course of their practice . He unites courtesy to independence , and flexibility to determination . Mature in judgement , firm in health , and accustomed to incessant labor , he finds a field sufficiently large for vigorous action and liberal inquiry ; - that he may long live to cultivate it , is the earnest wish of all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our readers to a subject of the highest importance , but which , when viewed in the light in which we wish to hold it up , may be dry and tedious . We do not ask them to listen to a discussion of the relative merits of the great parties , which divide our country , or to an examination of any disputed question in national politics ; but to an inquiry into the nature and character of all parties . We know that the present is a time when readers are least disposed to attend to speculations upon general topics ; but still , it is one when the guidance of correct principles is most needed . When the passions have been lashed into fury , the steady and safe voice of principle should be sounded forth , to warn the rushing mariner of the rocks , which lie in his path . A political contest is corning on , which will stir up such a commotion in the hearts of our citizens , as nothing but the waves of the sea , beaten by a tempest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of that contest with false notions and a wrong spirit , it will matter little which party is victorious . The result , in either case , will be disastrous to social order and *vell-regulated freedom . If , when the contest has closed , the American people are found the devotees of a party , there will be little hope , henceforth , of a good and rational government . Our object , then , in the few remarks we shall make , will be to show that parties are a necessary evil , and , therefore , to be confined within reasonable limits , and that no good citizen is to give himself up to an unthinking obedience to their mandates . While we hope that every man will exert his powers to their utmost stretch , in the maintenance and the furtherance of the right in the great struggle which is approaching , we wish to see him temper his zeal with discretion . If this be not done , we expect little substantial advantage from victory itself . Neither experience nor reason lead us to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usual to declaim against the evils of party and party-spirit , especially with the unsuccessful . It will be seen afterwards that we do // not think lightly of ' these evils ; but shall we therefore abolish parties , supposing it possible ? We think not . In the present state of public virtue and intelligence , we believe them necessary , indispensable . If we could and should dissolve all the old parties , and prevent the formation of any new ones , we doubt whether the administration of our government would be practicable . The majority of the people have too little forethought , or are too indifferent to the public interests , to attend at all to public affairs , unless they are led on to do it by the excitements of parties . They would be wholly engrossed by their own interests and pleasures , if these incentives were taken away . We find that now , in ordinary times of quiet and harmony , the majority of every class , whether rich or poor , educated or uneducated , know little and think little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make to the feelings and understanding , were wholly removed , the affairs of government would be forgotten . We are frequently told , by a certain class of writers and speakers , that the remedy of this evil may be found in general education and the diffusion of knowledge ; but we have little confidence in their assertions . For , we find the learned and wealthy nearly as inattentive to , and as ignorant of , public concerns , as any other classes . The evil , we suspect , lies deeper , in the imperfections of human nature . Change this , and freedom will be easily preserved ; but , till then , you must be content to rely upon worldly , and , perhaps , corrupt , means of security . In the second place , it is to be remembered , that while , by dissolving parties , you make men indifferent or heedless , you will still have a set of liarpies , in the shape of political aspirants , who will struggle to get their bread in some other way than by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public domain . There will be little rivalry in the strife for infamous elevation except between themselves . Their contention would not be chastened and corrected , as now , by the occasional interposition of real patriots , or of business-men , roused to a temporary exertion by party zeal . Parties , then , are necessary , first , to rouse the people from the lethargic indifference , into which they would otherwise fall ; and , second , to restrain the cupidity and folly of corrupt politicians . If rulers were all and always virtuous , they would govern safely and well without any restraint from the people ; if the people were always wise , they would remove bad rulers without any aid from parties . But neither are perfectly wise or virtuous ; neither so much so as to secure freedom without other guarantees . We establish a government to protect us from the bad ; and , when we have done that , we are obliged to erect other informal governments to protect us from the first . We must suffer some evil patiently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for liberty , it is said ; we might rather say , it is the price we pay for social existence . Parties are necessary , but still great evils . This should produce caution in our conduct as members of a party . These evils we shall endeavor to point out by observations upon the nature and effects of parties . We shall confine our attention to those , which are almost inseparable from their existence . Our object is to awaken men to a sense of their danger , when they allow themselves to be borne , without restraint , along the current of party . // The theory of parties is very simple . A number of men think alike upon some question , and are anxious to propagate their sentiments : they can not do this in the most effectual manner without combining ; they therefore meet together , exchange opinions , pass resolutions in conformity with their opinions , and choose officers to manage their affairs . This makes a party . Their resolutions are their principles ; their officers are their organs . Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great object is the election of public officers from the party . If a party be really intent upon the application and enforcement of certain principles in the administration of public affairs , they still direct their efforts to the election of men of their own party , because it is by the election of such that their principles can be carried into practical effect . Public opinion is addressed in order to gain votes , since with us the ballot-box is the test of political truth . The need of combination is much greater in politics than in other party questions . A single individual may maintain a literary controversy with as much success , perhaps , as a hundred ; but a political contest requires numbers . One man may write essays in the newspapers in support of his views , but he can vote for himself only . We have no law , which permits us to weigh votes according to the solidity of the voter 's mind , instead of counting them . Since its numbers are the best arguments , which can be used in advocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly composed of a multitude . A few seem to he afraid or ashamed to be found alone , as it were , as if they would measure the correctness of their principles by the number of those , who had ranged themselves under their banners . The effect of this is to make a complete organization and strict discipline necessary . A large party can no more govern itself , than a nation can govern itself , without the intervention of constituted authorities . Leaders are , therefore , chosen , or else assume that station , who perform for their party all the duties , which are performed by a government in behalf of a nation . They represent it . All those measures , which purport to be the doings or wishes of the party , are really the determinations of the leaders . The principles are frequently , perhaps commonly , selected by those who undertake to be its organs , and are changed by them as often as expediency , in their opinion , requires it . A party resembles an army more than any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders plan all the movements , and require an implicit obedience to their directions , just as a general in an army exacts from his subordinates and soldiers an unthinking execution of his orders . There is the same secrecy practised ; the same fe*nts and false pretences employed . There is a double set of objects ; one open arid avowed , but , in fact , little regarded ; another concealed and disclaimed , but yet *nxiously desired and labored for . The latter is kept out of the sight of the uninitated multitude . So , in an army , the soldiers and inferior officers know nothing of the real purposes of the commander . He keeps them to the silence and secrecy of his own bosom , or else confides them only to the discretion of the select circle , who approach him in rank and share in his responsibilities . A party resembles an army , too , in this respect , that it proposes to conquer the opposite party , and not merely to save the // country from misrule . Its plans are laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as a campaign is arranged in order to overthrow the enemy . You see this resemblance again in the language , which party combatants employ to describe their plans , hopes , and successes . Their terms are all taken from the vocabulary of war . " We have met the enemy and they are ours , " is ever in the mouths of these political warriors . You see it again in the manner , in which it is thought right to wage political warfare . You may use , without censure , the same methods of overreaching , deceiving , and entrapping your adversary , which the barbarous origin of war , and nothing else , has sanctioned in its case . An artifice , which misleads or injures your adversary , is praised , if it help your own side . Party morality is a most accommodating and liberal system of ethics ; and , in this respect , more closely resembles that of war than is honorable to either . Great mistakes are frequently made from not understanding or not regarding the real nature of parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in practice , but in argument , of the maxim , " Principles not men . " In its original meaning , it was an important truth . By it , people formerly intended to say that you should not change your conduct or professed principles , because a favorite leader had done so ; - which was quite correct . But it is forced to mean , in later applications , that it matters not who are the members of the party , provided their professed sentiments are true . This is a very dangerous principle in practice . You must accomplish your object of introducing a favorite principle into public affairs through the means of men and those of your own party . Your whole efforts will be directed toward their elevation . Now , if they are bad or unsuitable men , whatever may be their principles , your party 's success will be a public calamity , and you will be as much the authors of it , as if you and they had professed sentiments or principles , which led directly to the same results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their opinions . Abstract principles require much judgement , and generally some modification in their practical application . They give out their directions too much at large , as Lord Bacon expresses it , to be applied to the regulation of a nation 's concerns without any qualification . This consideration should induce us to attend to the character of the men , who are to reduce our principles to practice , as well as to the principles themselves . But it has been commonly found , in the history of parties , that the great changes and reforms , which have been promised while the party was canvassing for public favor , have been forgotten and omitted when success has crowned their efforts . This is no " doubt partly to he attributed to the exaggerations , which party-men , some from mistake and some from policy , put forth ; but it is not all exaggeration . There are sometimes some real abuscs . Yet they are seldom corrected , particularly when their continuance conduces to the ease , interest , or popularity of those , who ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defects , not of " principles , " but of " men . " If parties had been as anxious to have none but honest and sensible men in their ranks , especially in their van , as they were to have none but taking principles in their political creed , they would have been saved the mortification and disappointment of accomplishing , by their zealous // exertions and loud professions of patriotism , nothing but the elevation of a few prominent leaders : And patriotism would have been saved from the cruel mockery of being esteemed nothing but the cloak of hypocrisy and selfishness . The treachery of leaders has at all times been the curse and disgrace of almost every patriotic effort toward improving the condition of mankind . He , who shall hereafter under-. take to accomplish any important and especially any patriotic object hy the aid or through the means of a combination or party , will do well to attend much more to the general character and much less to the professed opinions of the principal members of such party , than his predecessors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must not complain or expect pity , if he is not exempted from their fate . Another mistake , growing out of our ignorance of the real nature of parties , is , the idea that they are popular , that their opinions may be taken as a fair index of those of the people . This idea has had extensive influence , and has been employed to accomplish purposes of the grossest deception . We are perpetually bidden by the interested to look to party resolutions as the expressions of public sentiment . The process of manufacturing public opinion has become a common and regular operation , which ought to deceive nobody . But the idea itself is utterly false . The composition and government of parties has very little in it that is purely republican ; they have more of the monarchical principle , but are , in fact , aristocracies . We have already referred to this feature in the character of parties , and recur to it again , because of the extensive use , which has been made of this deception . Every party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess all the power and transact all the business . All the officers and legislators , who are chosen by the votes of the party , are , in fact , appointed by a small conclave , called a committee . Frequently , there is a pretence of appointing committees and selecting candidates by public meetings , but it is , after all , but a pretence . The whole is prepared beforehand . It does not always happen that those , who are exhibited to the public in the most prominent positions , are the real leaders ; but leaders , open or concealed , there always are . Often more powerful men , hidden behind the curtain , move the wires and secret springs . Thus , the rulers of parties are few in number , probably fewest where pretensions to democracy are loudest ; and such are the real claims of parties to be esteemed popular in their character , and their resolves to be taken as the expressions of the people 's will . Those , who rely upon newspaper statements of the operations of parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is open and unpremeditated . Committees are appointed , reports made , resolutions passed , and candidates nominated with a deliberate formality that mimics the solemnity of a Senate . But he , who has been behind the scenes , knows that these reports and resolutions have all been enacted , and these nominations all decided upon , long before , in secret session . It is important that these things should be known ; for , through ignorance of them , much deception has heretofore been practised upon the honest and unsuspecting . One of the evils of parties , is , that they are in opposition to the principle , on which government of every kind is founded . That principle is , that it shall be the representative , the organ , as well as the ruler of the people . The theory of every government , from the abso // lute despot to the temporary and limited agent of a democracy , so far as there is any acknowledged theory , is , that he acts for , and in the name of , the whole country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints , and from him expect redress , if it be deserved . There is a peculiar and private relation existing between the government and each subject , from which result mutual rights and duties , and in consequence of which , a direct and immediate communication is opened between them , by means of which , each may and should make known to the other its wants and wishes , and call upon him for his aid in supplying them . Now , parties or party organization interrupt this intercommunication between rulers and subjects , by forcing all correspondence between them to be carried on through third persons , that is , through party leaders . In a majority of cases , the government is composed of the leaders of one of the parties . When its own party is predominant , it can adopt what measures it pleases , avoiding , however , with all due caution , such as would endanger that predominancy ; when its own party comprises a minority only , it must accomplish its purposes by compromises with the other leaders . But , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and a part , and sometimes the whole of the people , is stopped up , and the stream of mutual *vants , interests , and dependent feelings is made to pass through the hands of others , who are frequently interested in preventing it from ever reaching its destined point . This weakens the power of the government for national defence , and for the promotion of domestic* good . It makes the nation feebler , in comparison with its neighbors , and invites aggression from them . It disables the government from benefiting its subjects when it has the inclination , because its time , strength , money , and zeal , are exhausted in conciliating or making arrangements with the great men of the hostile parties . The inclination , too , to engage in schemes for the advancement of the wealth and happiness of the people , is lost in the long contests , which are waged with opposing factions , and a passion for suhduing adversaries takes its place . Parties , then , in this respect , are a great evil ; hut what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistency with the fundamental principle of all governments . Unqualified obedience must be paid to the legal commands of the government , unless , indeed , you propose a revolution ; but parties , in fact , if not in form , set up another power , and thus create a divided authority . The inevitable results are dissension and weakness . True , most laws , which are actually enacted , are obeyed ; but the fact is , that governments are obliged to temporize and compromise in the very enacting of its laws . They are obliged to go about and feel the pulses of the party leaders , before they attempt to take any important step . They do riot venture to make any law , which they are not confident will obtain the acquiescence , if not the approbation of the powerful party-men . There may be advantages in this mode of procedure ; it may produce greater deliberation and prudence ; but it is certainly a very round-about method of managing public affairs . All history shows the evils arising from divided states . Whenever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be found they have been split into parties . The government , if it keep // aloof from them all , is sometimes placed in the awkward predicament of having no supporters , no real subjects ; and if : , as commonly happens , it take si ( les with one , it makes the rest its enemies , or , at least , cuts itself off from all hope of a cordial support . When parties have grown inveterate , no considerations of country are often strong enough to induce them to lay aside their differences , and turn their weapons from each other 's breasts to those of their country 's enemies . Party honds are stronger than those of patriotism . This is not because party men cease to love their country , but because they forget it . Hatred of opponents swallows up every other sentiment . It is jealous , and will admit of no rival . It takes up the whole heart . These remarks may serve to show the contrariety of parties with the fundamental principle of governments of every kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ours , we are often told , is a government of the people ,  --  a democracy . And so it is , but of a peculiar kind . Our people govern only through the intervention of delegates . Those , who exercise the powers of sovereignty , are chosen by them at stated times ; but still these , and not the people themselves , must actually exercise these powers , uncontroled by any thing but the constitution . The practical result , is , that the people are the legislators and governors in part only . So far as they are governed in their selection of officers , by the votes they know these will give , and by the acts they know these will perform , in reference to particular questions , so far the people are the government ,  --  the sovereigns . But so far as they are guided in their selections by a consideration of the personal character of the candidates , and trust to their judgement as to the course they will pursue , so far , not the people , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereigns . It was a favorite principle with the framers of our constitution , that the officers of government should be independent in their deliberations arid actions . They have made them free from all interference with their conduct , and responsible to their constituents , only at the period of re-election . It seems to have been their design that the people should elect such men as they confided in , for their character , for wisdom , honesty , and patriotism , rather than for their coincidence with themselves in opinion upon points of legislation , practice , or abstract principle . We see this in a great variety of forms . Nothing is any where said , which recognizes in the constituents of any officer , whether legislative , judicial , or executive , the right of instruction , as it is familiarly called . The members of Congress are not so much the ambassadors or agents of particular districts and states , as the trustees of the whole . Their office most resembles that of a physician , who has been indeed selected , but yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . We see the same principle in the constitutional provisions for the choice of President . We are not called upon directly to vote for a President , but to select a body of men , who , as the constitution supposes , are better qualified to judge of the merits and capacities of prominent men , than we ourselves . It was never intended by them that electors should be mere echoes , who sent up to the capital the sounds , which had been directed toward them . This is evident , from the bare fact of requiring electors to be chosen . or , if they had so intended , why should they provide a round  --  a out method // of doing that , which might have been done directly . No ; their design and expectation was , that these electors should be such men as their respective neighborhoods or states most highly esteemed for their judgement and honesty ; and that they should assemble at an appointed time and place , and there deliberate upon the fitness of individuals , with as much freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to decide a dispute between neighbors , or a legislative body , discussing the merits of a new law . Such was plainly their intention . How little has it been carried into practice ! If an elector should vote differently from what those , who chose him , supposed he would , he would be ruined forever as a politician ; he would be called at once a traitor to his duty . Indeed , in times of excitement , and when men 's opinions or fidelity are in the slightest degree suspected , a pledge is required of them . The very people , who , by their constitution , have plainly indicated their will , that electors shall exercise their own discretion , do in practice require of them a pledge that they will not exercise it . They call upon them to vote as they are directed , without a single inquiry into the propriety of the vote . The reasons ) on which the makers of the constitution proceed in thus giving to officers the right and duty of consulting their own judgements , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority , from the nature of things , always have been , and always must be , busily occupied in attendance upon their own affairs , and , consequently , have little time , and less inclination , to understand thoroughly the great interests and wants of an extensive country ; that their information is mostly confined to the affairs of their own district , which incapacitates them more or less from looking at all the effects of measures upon all parts of a great nation ; which is necessary , in order to do injustice to none , and yet good to many . They considered that the mass of mankind are subject to great excitements , and liable to be imposed upon by popular declaimers , who make use of superficial , yet plausible arguments , and mislead those , whose habits of mind , defective education , and limited information , prevent them from discovering the cheat that is practised upon them . They knew that in free governments , where talent and interest of all kinds are developed , that wily and selfish demagogues would abound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that they were their peculiar friends ; they knew that such friends of the people were the spontaneous growth of the soil , and would spring up , like Jonah 's gourd , in a single night , so as to darken the whole region of politics . These were evils they wished to guard against . On the other hand , they knew that the majority , although engrossed with their own busy interests , and having little taste or capacity for the discussion of dry questions of legislation , were yet well qualified to judge of the merits of their neighbors . Upon this idea they formed the constitution , and hoped for its fruits . How different the practice ! Men are seldom selected for office on account of personal fitness , but nominally , on account of their opinions , though really , on account of their party . Party has been one of the chief means of introducing such a practice . It has done it in this way . Parties were first formed on difference of opinion , and mew were elected for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no inclination to act differently from their party . A // man holds his office because he belongs to the party , and , consequently , it is easy to introduce an idea that he ought to obey the party . He ought to be responsible , it is thought , to the party who gave him power . If he do not conform to party orders , he violates this obligation , and justly forfeits , it is said , their support ; yet he can not fairly claim the support of the other , since , if he were honest in his first attachment to his own party , his general principles must be diametrically opposite . A man , who follows independently his own opinion , is liable , therefore , to be left alone . Few , consequently , undertake the risk . All , or nearly all , are party-men . The effect has been to make Congress and the state legislatures either party arenas for political gladiatorship , or else a mere office of record , where the decrees of party leaders are registered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular , or are likely to be . The members of Congress support them because they are party measures and themselves party men . The result is , that we have a party government . It is directed to the end of advancing the interests of the party rather than of the country . Perhaps this is inseparable from the nature of a party . It is usual to attribute to opponents hostile designs upon the liberties or welfare of the country . This is a mistake ; there is no party of any tolerable size or influence , that ever meditated evil to their country . But there have been many , who , in their zeal for their party , have utterly forgot their country . We have said this may be inseparable from the nature of a party . It is true . For , if our only object be to serve the country , why submit to the government of a part only ? Perhaps , it will be answered , that the support and establishment of a party is deemed necessary to save their country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole interests of the nation should be made to depend upon the interests of a few . No doubt that the mass of the party , who do little but vote as the leaders direct , really think that the honor and happiness of the nation hang upon the fate of their party ; but the leaders can entertain no such opinion ; certainly they do entertain none such , for their party labors and hopes allow them no time to think of their country . Men of honesty will always , when the interest of their country presents itself to their mind , wish to advance it ; but interests of so much nearer concern , relating to the party they lead and govern , are constantly pressing upon them , that thoughts of country can seldom find admittance to their pre-occupied hearts . If we affirm that party-men commonly direct their efforts to advance their party rather than to profit their country , we do not intend to attribute to them any peculiar viciousn ss . It is only a proof of the imperfection of men . Party government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attended to before the public welfare . A party , which is already in power , must reward its chief and most earnest partisans . There is no business , in which the laborer esteems himself worthier of his hire . If it be not paid him , he will soon revolt . And it is not the loss of one active supporter merely ; there is no knowing what secrets he may reveal . The throne of a party is not only a lofty and dizzy , but a toilsome and perplexing height . The legislative measures , which are proposed by a party in power , must be of a popular nature , or they *viil endanger the influence of those who support them . Men , of great // minds and comprehensive views , are often obliged , by party necessities to advocate temporary , inefficient , and foolish schemes , by superficial and unsound arguments , because they are recommended by these qualities to the popular approbation . No measure of permanent utility is likely to be adopted under such circumstances . It seldom happens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not liable to many objections , which sound well to the ear at least , whatever may be their effect upon the judgeinent . Now a party leader is fearful of exposing himself to attack by coming out manfully and sustaining such laws . He fears to give opponents the advantage of having popular objections to urge against him and his measures . Neither does the party in opposition effect much of substantial good . They oppose the measures of the administration , right or wrong . What can be hoped from such a course ? Party success ; and that is all that is hoped or aimed at . All the energies of both parties are thus wasted in struggles for supremacy . It is the natural result of parties . We do not mean that parties never do any thing else , or that all are equally fruitless of good . There are differences in the value of their services ; but still all are liable , more or less , to the charge . The reason is found in the very nature , the inherent constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expect to benefit the whole , at least to the greatest amount . Parties repress all individual effort . A few minds lay out the path , in which all others are obliged to tread . It puts back , disheartens , or disgusts high-minded men , who scorn any other human shackle than their own unbiassed judgements . Such men are unfit for parties , except you make them leaders . But all can not be leaders. * A few of the most fortunate and least scrupulous in the means they employ reach this lofty but responsible station . The rest either join other parties or retire into the back-ground . But such men are those most likely to propose useful and ingenuous measures . They have habits of independent thinking , which lead them to make many useful and intelligent discoveries . These men are dangerous in a party , because they are apt to be restive and rebel against the authority of leaders . They are , therefore , watched and kept back , at least so much so as to be safe to the higher powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are put into their mouths . They will not submit to that military kind of subordination , which is almost as essential to success in a party as in an army . The effect of parties is not merely to repress individual men of independent minds , but also to repress all exertions on the part of individuals , by representing such exertions as useless , by throwing a shade over them . They are accustomed to see all political movements and all political plans accomplished by large and organized associations , and they are led to think that every thing else would be unavailing* A most dangerous idea . There are other difficulties , which beset the paths of parties . They must be formed on the ground of a support of a single point , or of several points . If the former be the case , then in an undivided attention to , and pressure of it , they are almost necessitated to neglect others , perhaps equally , and , even in their own opinion , nearly , as important as that which is made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this in daily experience . One party , for example , thinks the suppression of Freemasonry the most important political object toward the accomplishing of which they can direct their efforts . Yet there are others , which they deem of high importance . Such , for example , as the overthrow of the present administration . To effect this latter obje ct , a union with others who will not join in operations to suppress Freemasonry , is necessary . they are accordingly , in some instances , obliged to sacrifice the one or the other . They , of course , choose to let go that , which is , in their judgement , least important . We do not take this instance for the purpose of praising or blaming it , but as a convenient illustration of the difficulties of parties . Different men will differ as to the question of choice ; but all must admit that , in some case , a choice must be made . The inevitable consequence is , that one mLIst be sacrificed . To avoid this evil , parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its advantages and its disadvantages . It removes the difficulty of being obliged to sacrifice what are thought to be important principles , on the ground that there are " minor considerations ; " yet its common effect is to sacrifice all . It is not in the nature of the human mind to be zealous upon many questions at the same time . Feeling is never very strong unless concentrated . This would he enough to dampen the zeal and weaken the efforts of the members of such a party , were they united . But they are not united . One holds to one principle , and another to a different one . They are prevented from dissolution , only by opposition , by hatred of some other party , or prominent individual . So long as this opposition continues , they may act together with unanimity , and some energy . But when this is removed or overcome , they either lose their spirit or turn it against each other . They are effective only in destruction . Coalitions destroy their adversaries , but seldom save themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public profession of a number of principles and doctrines , which are commonly considered sound , yet have other objects in view , such as the elevation of a favorite politician . Indeed it is necessary that such combinations should have some object of this kind to keep them together , since they have no natural principle of cohesion in the similarity of actual sentiments . Opposition sometimes supplies this object ; but when this is wanting or inexpedient , it is necessary to get some other . In fact , most of the parties , which have existed in our country , of late years , have been of this kind , and we believe that they will continue to be . It is often made a matter of complaint , that parties are formed now-adays , not upon principle , but upon men . It is useless to complain of it ; it will be so , perhaps it must be so . It is not every thing that will make a principle for the formation of a party . It must be general in its nature , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular in its character , easy to be apprehended , and capable of being advocated by superficial , though plausible arguments , or else the majority , who will not submit to mental labor , will never embrace it . But it is easy to find all these requisites for the formation of a party principle in the support of a man , or set of men . Every body and every section can he made to feel an interest of some kind or other in a popular character . It is as general as the country itself . There is not a district , from // Canada to the Gulf of Mexico , and from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains , that may not be made to devote themselves to the support of a popular idol , by the application of the proper means . This sort of party has all the other requisites . It requires no great depth of mind to make or understand the most extravagant eulogy , though there may not be a word of truth in it . Principles sometimes have an inconvenient rigidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no such difficulty need weigh down a popular character . If he have at any time professed doctrines , which seem now to be in the way of his promotion , he may readily divest himself of them . There is no reason that his mind , as well as others , should not yield to conviction ; it would be very illiberal to deny the right of changing his opinion , especially where the light of reason is reflected from a popular source . But this difficulty of having expressed unpopular doctrines is now rare ; our leading politicians fully understand and justly appreciate the advantages of " non-committal . " We have no doubt that our parties , in future , will generally turn upon the support of men , and that such principles will often be even publicly avowed . Let the future reveal itself . Such are some of the evils , which result from parties . They are not all , but the most prominent , or those which have fallen under our observation . We have not endeavored to present a frightful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but to lay before him such a plain statement as should induce him to reflect upon the tendency of such combinations , before he enrols himself in their ranks , and rushes madly into their strifes , when little calm reflection can be expected . We hoped to engage his attention by our calmness and our candor . H.@@183068827.txt To awaken an abhorrence of all falsehood and duplicity ,  --  by depicting , on the one hand , beautiful images of truth and honor , and presenting , on the other , the disastrous consequences of sacrificing veracity to the interests or the caprice of a moment ,  --  is the object of several new and popular works of fiction . The subject is an old one , and has been the theme of moralists without number , for hundreds and thousands of years . Still it is not exhausted ; or , if all has been said , which the various topizs of argument will furnish , it must be repeated till it has been heard ; till it has been attended to ; till it has produced something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors have been mingled in representing the beauty of truth and the deformity of falsehood , the application is to be continued . The images of both are to be multiplied . They are to be presented in every scene and situation ; in the parlor and the kitchen , the public office and the private workshop . Till society in general are brought under the influence of inviolable faith and veracity , we should never say nor think that the subject is exhausted , and no more is to be said or done . On the contrary , we should welcome every judicious attempt to waken the dormant feelings of those , who confound right and wrong , truth and falsehood , and to raise them to the proper level of rational existence . The subject requires different modes of treatment , according to the different tastes and characters of those , who are principally in view . Many there are , who must be influenced by feeling and imagination , so far as they are influenced at all . They are not in the habit of reflection or meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may read what is entertaining ; and , like birds or insects on the *ving , they may perhaps be pierced by some of the light arrows , which are flying around them . Others , who are more alive to the realities of a future state , may derive deeper or more lasting impressions of the importance and obligations of truth , from the expostulations of the preacher , standing in the holy place ; and a third class may find entertainment , as well as moral benefit , in those argumentative discussions , which trace the great duty of veracity to the unchanging principles in which it is founded . The philosophical view is so seldom given , that something of this kind will , as we trust , be regarded as not altogether unseasonable here . Why are we required , in all our communications one with another , to speak the truth ? Why is this so positively enjoined in the Scriptures ? and why is it urged with so much zeal by those , who do not avail themselves of the authority of Divine inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , because the very being of society depends upon it . Society could no more live and prosper without mutual truth , than material bodies could exist without the principle of cohesive attraction . Though liars may associate for temporary purposes , there must be some truth between them ; some ground amid the general ruins of falsehood for them to stand upon , or they can maintain no friendly intercourse whatever . Without something of that confidence , which can rest on no other foundation than // that of habitual veracity , man could feel no complacency in man . A horse , a dog , a sheep , a tree , a stone , or any thing , which was not positively inimical , would be a more acceptable companion than one of his own species . He could depend on no benefit from his presence ; he would have much reason to dread some machination against his life or comfort . Admittinr however , that society could exist without habitual truth , how little of prosperity could we anticipate ! There would be an eternal stagnation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of former ages would be unknown . The voice of history *vouId never be heard , or , if heard , would be nothing better than fable . If monuments were reared , or useful inventions produced , they mLht , or might not , survive the age that have them being ; but the names of their uthors , however deserving of fame , could have no better record , than the memory of their short-lived neighbors . Under the benumbing influence of falsehood and distrust , indeed , it may be doubted whether the arts of printing or writing would ever have existed ; whether there would have been any such thing as instruction ; whether , in f* ct , the tongue itself , as an organ of speech , would not have fallen into disuse . In this state of things , every individual would be limited in his knowledge to his own immediate experience ; to the facts , which have been presented to the scrutiny of his senses . In the extent of his knowledge , he would be inferior to the beasts and birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own species , by which they communicate important information . The maternal hen , for instance , tells her chickens when a hawk is threatening ; and , as she never lies , her little ones never disbelieve her ,  --  thev never fail to profit by her admonitions . If mutual truth and confidence be of such importance to the intellectual improvement of the world , it is equally essential to moral advancement . There is a natural and necessary connexion between the one and the other . It was said by Solomon , " A man of understanding is of an excellent spirit . " Weak minds may indeed be affectionate , but so far as they are deficient of intelligence , they can not be distinguished for those virtues of feeling or conduct , which belong to reasonable beings . To render any human virtue what it should be , it must be founded in principle , as elI as feeling ; it must be performed with the spirit and with the understanding ; " and , in a state of things , in which the understanding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life would be fruitful . Besides , there is a repugnance between habitual falsehood and most of the virtues , which forbids the expectation of any thing noble or generous in one who indulges in this sordid vice . Lying is generally , if not always , the offspring of a selfish spirit . If we attend to the occasions , on which it is manifested , we shall be satisfied of this . What is the object of the common cheat , who extols , beyond the bounds of truth , the articles he offers for sale or exchange ? Is it not to put a paltry penny into his own l ) ocket ? Why does the false politician blazon his own merits , or those o.f his party , while he vilifies the highest worth , which may be opposed to him ? It is the spirit of selfish meanness , and not of expansive patriotism , which dictates every word . In difficulties and embarrassments , why does any // one resort to falsehood as the means of escape , . without considering whose character or happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of moral courage , some may say ; others may give it the harder name of cowardice . We say it is that memness of soul , which is immutably selfish and un* generous . If there be any thing , in which 1yin* can be reconciled to a generous spirit , it is , perhaps , the entertainment afforded to companions by fictitious stories , passed off for real ities . Still , we have reason to doubt , whether this be an exception to the general principle . It remains to be proved , that those , ho indulge themselves in such viol* tions of truth , are actuated chiefly by retard to the happiness of others , and not to the gratification of their own vanity or desire of applause . As falsehood is generally , if not always selfish and ignohle , inconsistent in its very nature with generosity or disinterested friendship , . so it is nearly allied to every species of dishonesty , . without the exception of theft itself . It is actual injustice to *ociety and to individuals . Every lie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has an interest in common language , and especially to those who are exposed to ( leception by it . As already observed , the birds and beasts expect truth and sincerity from their dams , who undertake to instruct them . The brutes require the s me from man . In many an instance , the elephant , who h s stretched forth his 1 ) roboscis to receive the proffered biscuit , and been de*iied , he s executed sumn* ry justice on the deceiver , by knocking him down . Children , too , as we have said , expect the truth , and nothing but the truth , from every one who speaks , till experience has taught them different lesson . This expectation is the inspiration of nature . It is inspired by the God of natu.e , who at the same time gave the unalienable right of hearing and knowing the tri th , whenever ddressed in the language of men . Where the rights are of equal value , the infringement of one involves the same degree of injustice with that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonest in word , can give you rio adequate proof that he will not defraud you in business , or secretly pilfer your property . The state of public opinion , or the operation of the laws , may hear unequally on vices of equal turpitude in themselves ; and , from these considerations , the liar may be restrained from other vices , to which , as such , he must be strongly inclined . If , then , the habit of falsehood counteract the most express designs of nature ; if it be reproved in man by the sincerity of brutes ; if it tend to annihilate all the advantages to be derived from speech , and to put an eternal check on the mental and moral improvement of mankind ; if it subvert that confidence , on which all mutual complacency must depend , and infuse into the heart that distrust , which must either drive man from man , or expose him to hostile attacks ; if , in a word , it is apt to debrade the soul , to chill every generous emotion , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for every species of meanness and dishonesty ,  --  it is certain we can not keep too much aloof from such a vice . We should avoid it as we would a mortal infection . We should take heed to our words ; weigh and measure them , by the standards of truth . Not only is the habit of deception to be avoided , but every instance . He , who utters a single lie , sins not only against society , but against himself ,  --  against soul and body ,  --  against his temporal // no less than his eternal interests . Of this sin it may be emphatically said , " There remaineth no place for repentance , though one seek it carefully with tears . " A single lie , clearly detected , will do more to ruin the character , than a thousand truths will to repair it it will render it suspicious for years , though every other word were punctiliously true . The irascible or peevish man may change his morose looks arid petulant tones , to those which are agreeable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's name ; the intemperate man may break off from his habits of indulgence ; and the reformation of each , to a considerable degree , at least , will be immediately apparent ; but , as the greatest liars tell a multitude of truths for one falsehood , what pledge of this kind can they give , that they will never falsify again ? Their word will be of little avail . It has lost its value . Nothing but time , or costly sacrifices to the truth , freely made , will restore their claims to credit . Some , perhaps , by way of objection , may ask , where is the rigor of this doctrine to end ? or , who will escape condemnation ? In what does the essence of a lie consist ? and where the effect is the same , what is the difference between speaking and acting ? Is every voluntary deception a virtual lie ? These questions deserve an answer , though it may not be an easy thing to reconcile every difficulty with the doctrine laid down above , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To take up the preceding queries , then , in the order which may be most convenient , we would maintain that , where the design is th' same , and the whole effect the same , there can be no moral difference between speaking a lie and acting a lie ; in giving a false direction to a traveler , for instance , by a word , or by a motion of the hand . The essence of criminal falsehood is intentional or careless deception ; and it is of little moment , how that deception is effected . Still , it is hard to follow this principle into all the extremes , to which it may be seen to lead . It is hard to say , that the countenance shall , in all circumstances , be a true index to the heart , expressing all the indifference or dislike , which , either justly or unjustly , we may feel to those with whom we meet , and , perhaps , are required to pass much of our time ; that , when we enter the chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persons of weak nerves , we should put no disguise on our own feelings . It would be cruel to forbid those who were threatened with destruction by a ruthless army , to make their escape by the stratagem of kindling fires , or leaving other tokens of their presence , which would keep the suspicions of the enemy guiet , till the peaceful object were effected . rro remove the difficulty in part , we may observe , that where the object is the same , there is often a difference in the effect between words and actions . Words are the more appropriate indications of thought ; the more usual means of affirming or deny inr ; the last resort in all inquiries and assurances about matters of fact . We may be deceived by looks or motions ; but the deception is neither so inevitable nor so great , because it is always considered , that the language of the countenance and the limbs is allowed by &amp;neral consent to be somewhat ambiguous . A smile on the countenance , for example , may indicate compla* cency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the habitual vor. vim . 39 // courtesy and benevolence , which are characteristic , at once , of the gentleman and the Christian . It is usually said , there may be cases , in which it will be lawful for us to deceive by any means in our power that a mortal foe , in particular , has no claims upon us for the truth , and that he is an exception to the general rule . If public wars be ever just , or , in other words , if ; in any case , it can be right to slaughter the subjects of a hostile sovereign by hundreds and thousands , it must be right to effect the objects of war by stratagem or deceit . On the same principle , if it be right to take the life of a pirate , an assassin , or robber , in defence of ourselves or others , it can not be wrong to save ourselves from such an assailant , by any act of deception ; since it is a greater harm to kill a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of any ordinary fact . Of the rectitude of public wars , however , we give no opinion further than this ,  --  that very few of them are undertaken from such necessity , on either side , as alone would be a sufficient apology . As to private robbers and assassins , some have justified deception in regard to them , on the ground that they have outlawed themselves ; that they have put themselves out of the pale of society ; that they have renounced all privileges of civil life , excepting only that of a fair trial , on condition of arrest ; and that , in other respects , they are hardly to be considered as human beings . It must be confessed , that the rights and obligations of truth have a principal , if not a sole regard to society , and that all , who voluntarily put themselves out of the social state , forfeit all rights of this kind . Still , there may be reason to doubt , whether it be expedient to treat these outlaws with rigid justice of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , be favorable to the peace of society , or the moral character of those by whom it is practised . Dr. Paley has told us , " there are some falsehoods which are not lies ; " or , in other words , which are not criminal . Among other instances , he mentions that of a servant denying his master ; that of an advocate asserting his belief in the justice of his cause ; and the falsehoods , which are told to madmen or insane persons , for their benefit . The reason he gives for the innocence of untruths like these , is , that there is no deception . Many have regretted , that an author , of Dr. Paley 's deserved reputation , should have given these exceptions to the obligations of truth the sanction of his name . Is there no deception in the assertion of the advocate , when , ag ' inst his own convictions , he declares his unwavering belief in the justice of his client 's cause ? Does he not expect , does he not wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , then , does lie make the assertion ? Is it for the mere purpose of forming , or continuing the habit of uttering untruths ? The fact , we believe , is , that where an advocate with a sober countenance declares himself convinced of what he does not , indeed , believe , he does it with the hope of beguiling the man of plain common sense to favor the cause of his client ; and this , undoubtedly , is a frequent effect . The like interrogatories might be urged with the gentleman or the lady , who gives the false orders to a servant , to say " not at home . " If it is understood to mean nothing more nor less , than too unwell , or too much engaged to see company , why not use the words , which mean that , and nothing // else ,  --  words which are not liable to be misunderstood ? By a great part of the world , the phrase , " not at home , " xviii be construed in its literal sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie , if it be not a literal truth . In addition to this , we might urge , that the head of a family , in giving such orders to a servant , sets an example of insincerity and falsehood , which will be likely to spread its infection much farther than he intends . Lie has reason to expect a reaction , to which he can set no bounds . lie encourages the servant to lie to bimselg xvhenever convenience or caprice shall dictate ; and , as lying is intimately connected with every species of dishonesty , lie puts every thing he has at the disposal of those , whom he h s virtu ally released from the obligations of truth , the best security for his person or reputation . From the usual intercourse between servauts and children , the infection is likely to spread among all the subordinate members of the family , and from them to communicate itself to other houses arid other regions , till there is a general corruption of that class of persons , on whose fidelity the domestic comfort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those unfortunates , who are bereaved of a common understanding , as well as those , which , with a similar view , are sometimes played upon children , differ in some respects from those mentioned above . here falsehood is intended to deceive though for a short time , and for the benefit of those on whom it is imp9sed . It may be questioned , however , whether the imposition be so readily forgotten , either by children or lunatics , as some may imagine ; or whether the momentary advantages may not be followed by very lasting evils . The child may remember the falsehood , by which he has been cajoled , or fri*htened into a salutary submission , and he may continue to reap and to sow the poisonous frtiit , long after the parent or the nurse shall have been lodged in the tomb ; and the adult , who is partially insane , may be still more bewildered by his endeavor ' to reconcile contradictions , xvhile the falsehood , which , even , in the twilight of reason , he discovers in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the last ray of light will be extinguished . One thought , suggested above , may naturally excite the inquiry , how far the guilt or the innocence of deception may be ffected by the consideration of time . Some may think it excusable to counterfeit emotions , which they do not feel , or express opinions , which they do not hold , provided the false apprehensions they excite in others be seasonably corrected ; and , perhaps , it may seem excessively rigid to maintain that we are never to argue , with apparent seriousnes* , in favor of what we believe to be error , or that we are never to amuse ourselves and others by fictions of hope or fear , admiration or anger . Still , it is safer at least to deny ourselves a little amusement , than to seek it in such indulgences . If the criminality of falsehood be supposed to depend on the len*tb of time it is allowed to remain uncorrected , the question will , of course , arise , where shall we fix the point in duration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , a month , a week , a day , or an hour , convert a harmless untruth into a lie ? Beside the impossibility of fixing any such point , every thing of this kind involves the risk of our credit with those with whom we converse , as they may detect the fallacy before xve have an opportunity to explain , or we may otherwise fail of the means , // or lose the disposition to correct the false impressions we have made , and bring ourselves under strong temptations to multiply falsehoods in defence of that , which at first we did not mean to persist in . Let every one beware how he swallows poison , though in small portions . It may be more insinuating , and more tenacious of its hold on the vital system , than he ever imagined .
