txt the magazines show us up under no very brilliant colors in imaginary travels and journals from Kentucky ; - even the poor bookseller 's drudge , who gets up that humblest of all periodicals , the Literary Gazette , can afford to be merry at the cx- that journal in regard to the United States . We hardly know whether to admire most the elegance and correctness of the language , or the liberality of the sentiments . The British Consul was honored with fifty cards , to be filled up with the names of such of the respectable merchants and their familios as he should select . The Portuguese , Sicilian , and other foreigfi consuls , were complimented with tickets for their families ; but in this liberal distribution of favors , by some oversight , the Consul for the United States was unluckily forgotten . The Republican Eagle was all in a flutter , at the unintentional indignity . On a representation to the committee by the Consul , an apology was made for the omissioii , and cards of invitation , in blank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands as the amende honorable '  --  but Jonathan made it quite a national ' affair ; insisting on an equal number of cards as were bestowed on the Consul of Great Britain . We were just then on the eve of a war with the States of stripes and stars , ( and slavery . ) Some private discussions took place , during which it is believed the wishes of the hero of the fite were consulted , and which ended , for the sake of harmony , in complying with the American Consul 's requisition , ( rather than request , ) and fifty cards were officially , or at least more ceremoniously than cordially presented . This concession ( which was , I believe , the subject of a report to the States , ) had the effect of introducing a mob of sleekheaded gentlemen from the Western world , ( chiefly captains and supercargoes from Philadelphia and . New York , ) in long skirted coats , and nankeen breeches-all redolent of tar and tobacco-among the embroidered crowd !

Should he be disposed to indite another work of this description in honor of the conqueror of Waterloo , we would venture to suggest to him , that as the nearest connexions of his hero have condescended to select their wives from the families of some of us sleek-headed gentlemen of the West , it is hardly agreeable to the rules of the art to make us the villains of the plot . It would also not be amiss , should the scene be laid in Spain , to consult the court calendar , so far as to ascertain the title of the Duchess of Benavente ; and we would further express our doubts , whether the kind of triumph , which the hero is represented as achieving over the Duke of Frias and the Prince of Anglona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimental poem to appear in a loyal and religious magazine .

If in reply to this continual attack , an American writer happen to venture upon a few words in the way of recrimination , or even simple self-defence , we are forthwith proclaimed by the same general chorus of voices to be the most susceptible and thin-skinned of all the dwellers upon earth .

Such is , and has been for many years past , the habitual tone of the British critics in regard to this country . In the mean time the real head and front of our offending-as is perfectly well understood on all sides-is nothing more than this , that we happen by the act of God , and the valor and virtue of our fathers , without any merit or fault of our own , to be placed in such a situation , political , geographical , and statistical , that we are more likely than any other power to rival or surpass Great Britain , first , in those commercial and maritime pursuits , which have hitherto constituted the chief elements of her greatness , and at a more remote period in population , wealth and national importance .

It has lately signalized itself by an attack upon Washington , whom the wildest of our foreign traducers had hitherto respected , but on whom this miserable tool undertakes to fasten the foul and odious charge of irreligion .

Finally , is it a matter of indifference to the Christian-this is not , we are aware , an argumentum ad hominem , when addressed to the writers in the Edinburgh Review  --  but is it , after all , a matter of indifference to the friend of pure and undefiled religion under any of its forms , that the beautiful feet of those that bring good tidings , that publish peace , that say unto Zion , Thy God reigneth , are already traversing in every direction the sandy shores of the Atlantic , the blue summits of the Alleghanies , and the green savannahs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocky Ridge , and will soon reach the distant borders of the South Sea ? Is all this world of wonders , this magnificent display of the full bloom and glory of civilization , bursting forth , as it were instantaneously , from the depth of barbarism , like a Lapland spring out of the icy bosom of winter , to be held as nothing , and worse than nothing , not because it is not the work of Englishmen-for that in the main it isbut because it is not performed by the Englishmen , who inhabit a little island on the eastern side of the Atlantic ? Is it not a burning shame , a crying sin , that under the influence of this paltry motive , the greatest achievements and characters are to be habitually depreciated , the purest and most amiable sentiments mocked and jeered at , and this too by men of high pretensions for talent , education , and philosophy ? We know not what others may say in answer to these questions , or what doctrines and sentiments may be fashionable in the mother country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of the day : but for ourselves , we must avow without hesitation , that we consider the tone of criticism , to which we have here alluded , as very strongly marked by bad principle , bad feeling , bad taste , and bad policy . We believe that our transatlantic // 32 July , brethren , who adopt it , are great losers by it , on the score , not only of honor and conscience , but of national advantage , as well as mere persona comfort and pleasure . We really think that an Englishman of right feeling and good understanding , instead of exhibiting a miserable jealousy of the progress of this great offset from the parent stock , ought to take as much pride in it as in any of the more direct developements of the resources of his country . We conceive that the victory over our western wilderness , which has been won by English hands and English hearts , ought to fill his mind with as high a satisfaction as the blockade of the whole coast of the European continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view the marvellous increase of population that is going on among us , the hitherto unexampled multiplication of human life and human happiness , which is taking place , for instance , in the State of Ohio , with even more delight than the glorious waste of blood and treasure at Trafalgar or Waterloo . Of the various attacks that have been from time to time directed against this country in the British journals , few , if any , have been more offensive to the public feeling than the article upon Nmerican Literature , which appeared in the ninety-ninth number of the Edinburgh Reviexv . The works of the Rev. Dr. Channing , form the immediate subject of it , and its principal aim appears to be to depreciate the talent and destroy the reputation of this justly eminent divine . Several other writers of great merit are also shewn up under a ludicrous point of view , and an attempt is made to cast a general slur upon the intellectual character of the country . The spirit in which the article is executed corresponds very well with the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than usual portion of the malignant and cold hearted flippancy , which has always been one of the leading traits in the style of this , in many respects , valuable journal . We are not of opinion , that it is necessary to the honor of the country , or the reputation of the individuals particularly interested , to repel every attack of this description . The best and only sufficient reply to foreign calumny , is annually and hourly given in the constantly progressive greatness and glory of the United States . There are , however , some cases that seem to form an exception to this remark , and we have been given to understand that a notice of the article alluded to , would be acceptable to many of our readers . We could have wished , that the task had // fallen into more competent hands , but shall cheerfully execute it to the best of our ability , and shall endeavor , if our limits should permit , to point out the errors in one or two other articles of a similar kind , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commences by remarking , that the only American writers who have hitherto been heard of in England , are Irving , Brown , and Cooper , to whose names must now be added , that of Dr. Channing . On farther tasking his memory , it occurs to him that there lived half a century ago such a man as Dr. Franklin , who , as the Quarterly had previously informed us , possessed some skill in grinding his electrical machine ; that Jonathan Edwards wrote some rather remarkable treatises on metaphysics , and finally , that there appeared in the United States , just before the revolutionary war , an anonymous work , entitled A Farmer 's Letters , ' which gives a tolerably correct description of certain local scenes and incidents . The works of these writers compose , according to the reviewer , the whole body of American literature . Now we have no hesitation in pronouncing this to be a very poor and silly piece of affectation . It is much as if an Ainerican , in giving a summary account of British literature , should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern writers of much distinction excepting Scott , Moore , and Southey , and more recently , Dr. Chalmers ; but that we had reason to suppose , that Newton had made some important discoveries in astronomy at the beginning of the last century ; that one Locke , ' as Lord Sunderland called him , had published about the same time , a pretty valuable essay on the human understanding ; and finally , that there appeared in London , soon after the close of the seven years ' war , a very agreeable little collection of letters on miscellaneous subjects , published under the feigned name of Fitzosborne . ' This caricature , though somewhat more extravagant , is in point of taste and correctness , precisely parallel to that of the Review . To attempt to remove an ignorance , which is obviously affected , would of course be superfluous , and we shall therefore spare ourselves the trouble of completing this very elaborate catalogue of American authors . We may remark , however , that at the moment when the reviewer was telling us , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of JEFFERSON was ringing through the newspapers of his country , and filling the // mouths of men of science , taste , and liberal curiosity throughout the civilized world . The memoirs and correspondence of this illustrious statesman , philosopher , scholar , and author , were probably on his table at the time when he wrote the passage in question . Does the reviewer mean to tell us that the name of Jefferson will not be ranked hereafter among the principal ornaments of the literature and philosophy of the present day ? Does he really suppose that the author of the declaration of independence of the United States , the Notes on Virginia , and the vast body of political , literary , and scientific works , which emanated from the same prolific pen , will be eclipsed in the judgment of posterity by Hector St. John , or by either of the four writers , justly distinguished as they all are , whom the critic has thought proper to mention ? He ought to be aware , whether he is or not , that Mr. Jefferson will occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the one of which Cicero and Burke are the great exemplars in ancient and modern times-writers , who by combining literary and active pursuits , and exhibiting in both a first-rate talent , furnish in their works the most complete reflection that can possibly be given , of the finished man . A person , who could forget the name of Jefferson in the present noon-day of his glory , and go back half a century to rake out Hector St. John from the dust of his barn-yard , would not feel the difference between Tacitus and Tom Thumb , and would have talked to you of Goody Two Shoes the morning after the first publication of the Reflections on the French Revolution . By the side of the Memoirs and Correspondence of Jefferson lay , or should have lain , upon the table of our critic , at the time when he was writing , among the other new publications , the first volume of the American translation with an accompanying commentary of the M6canique Celeste . Is the name of BowDITdH unknown to the countrymen of Napier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fault or theirs that they are ignorant of the existence and labors of one of the first mathematicians of the age ? It will not answer for the critic to tell us , that he intended to limit his view of our literature to the departments of poetry and romance , since the very publication which was immediately before him belongs to that of moral philosophy . Charity itself requires that we should compliment his memory and understanding at the expense of his honesty , and believe that his pretended ignorance is , as we have already intimated , a mere piece of silly affectation. // We shall not , as we have said before , undertake to complete the catalogue which this writer has left in so defective a state , but will mention a few other names which would naturally have occurred to any person disposed to do us justice , and moderately versed in our political and literary history ; and continuing to look at the same great department of science , to which the works of Dr. Channing and those of Mr. Jefferson belong , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal knowledge of men and things , past , present , and to come , he ever heard of two such persons as JOHN ADAMS and JOHN QUINcY ADAMS ? If not , we have the honor to apprise him , that the former , who under a coincidence of singularly beautiful and affecting circumstances a few years since terminated his earthly pilgrimage  --  and the latter , who is still living in the full vigor of his powers and brightness of his glory , have occupied successively , during their long and brilliant careers of half a century each , the highest places in philosophy , taste , and learning , as well as in the administration of the government of their country , and the esteem of their fellow citizens ; that though they were constantly engaged in the most urgent and momentous political affairs , creating constitutions , representing the people in legislative halls and foreign courts , encountering , in short , responsibility and toil of every description , until they finally stood before the world as the elected Rulers of our great and rising empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquity  --  to cultivate letters in the intervals of business-published voluminous works , the results of thorough researches into the most intricate branches of political philosophy-taught in our colleges the noble arts they practised in the Senate , and maintained an extensive correspondence with most of the distinguished individuals of the age . Of them and their works the reviewer , according to his own account , is profoundly ignorant . Whether his ignorance , real or affected , be more discreditable to himself or to them , is a question which we may safely leave to the reader to decide . Again ; did our critic never hear of FISHER AMES ? If not , we recommend to his perusal the Speech on the British Treaty , and the Eulogy on Hamilton . He will soon perceive that the views they set forth are similar to those that are generally taken in England on the same subjects ; and having thus ascertained that he can praise them with a good conscience , we have little doubt that he will admit them to be fully equal to // the most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his illustrious fellow laborers , MADIsoN and JAY , the joint Numas of our modern Rome ; did the reviewer never hear of them , or does he suppose that their works will be winked out of the view of the world by the voluntary blindness of an anonymous Scotch journalist ? To take a more modern instance , ' has our critic , in the singular shortness of his memory , forgotten the name of ROBERT WAL5H , who has been several times noticed with extraordinary favor in the Edinburgh Review itself , has contributed to its pages , and was pronounced by its conductors to be one of the best writers in the language , until he undertook the task of defending his country against British slander , after which it was pretty soon discovered , that he did not write so well as he did before ; who now publishes a review that would be disparaged by being placed on an equality with most of the leading English journals of the same description ? We will mention but one more name , and only further ask , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a general view of American literature , in connexion with a particular notice of the -- works of Dr. Channing , to revive the recollection of his friend and colleague in the ministry of divine truth , the beloved , the admired , the lamented BUcKMIN5TER  --  a miracle of genius , cut off indeed in the early morning of his brilliant promise , but not till he had produced works which may well be compared with the mature efforts of the highest talents in the same departments of learning ? His discourses , of which a volume was published soon after his death in 1813 , and a second has just passed through the press , are among the most elegant , finished , and really valuable productions of their class to be found in the language . They combine the powerful thinking of the English divines , more directly applied to practical life , with the fervid eloquence of the French school , chastened by the purest and most delicate taste . With all their merit they give us , no doubt , as we read them , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the impression was aided by the charming intonations , the graceful movements , and the radiant visage of the accomplished speaker ; but considered simply as written sermons , they are undoubtedly superior to any that have appeared in England since the beginning of the present century . To say this , is giving them , indeed , but scanty praise , and it would be easy to show , if we // had room and opportunity to make the comparison , that the standard of pulpit eloquence , and we may add , of biblical criticism and most other branches of theology , is higher in this country than it is in Great Britain . In these respects , we are at least sufficiently advanced to know what has been done and is doing on the continent of Europe , which does not appear to be the case with our worthy brethren of the fast anchored isle . ' If the object of the reviewer , in reducing the number of American authors of any reputation to three or four , were to do the greater honor to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his proceeding , if not justifiable , would be rather more natural . We all have our favorites among the various pretenders to different kinds of distinction , and are apt enough , in our partiality for those we prefer , to overlook the just claims of others . Such , however , is not the motive of this writer . After limiting in this way the number of our authors , he next proceeds to a malignant and studied depreciation of the merit of those whom he is pleased to enumerate . Messrs . Irving , Brown , and Cooper , and Dr. Channing , are successively noticed in a tone of insolent and contemptuous levity , which would suit well enough with an inquiry into the merit of a doubtful rope-dancer or the rival pretensions of the two Fire-Kings , but which really seems to us to be out of place in a discussion that involves the honor and interest of some of the most highly gifted and respectable individuals of the day . Messrs . Irving and Cooper-although not precisely of equal pretensions-stand , as our readers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of polite literature . Their reputation and popularity are not confl.ned to England and the United States , but extend through the civilized world . With the exception of a few veterans in the wane of their powers , though still in the fulness of their fame , such as Goethe and Ch*tteaubriand on the continent , and Scott , Moore , Southey , and some others in England , that propcrly belong to another generation , we really know no writers , who , in the line in which they labor and excel , can come in competition with our distinguished countrymen . Their eminence is not the passing effect of an accidental burst of popular favor , obtained by low and unworthy arts , hut rests securely on the labors and successes of a series of years . Dr. Channing , on the other hand , though at present somewhat less extensively known , possesses claims to respect of a still higher order , resulting from a still more marked // superiority of talent , and enhanced by the sacred nature of his calling and the exemplary purity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper to observe in speaking of a living character , a neighbor , and a personal friend , prevents us from dwelling so much as we should otherwise gladly do upon the merits of this divine . Suffice it to say , that if first-rate powers , directed with a steady , unwearied , and enthusiastic effort to the promotion of the noblest ends by the noblest means , can entitle a man to the gratitude of others , Dr. Channing has a fair right to claim that distinction . We are happy , for the honor of our country , to add , that the public favor has , in this case at least , been awarded with discernment , and that few , if any , of our citizens , are more admired and respected by all classes of the community . Such are the persons , whose literary merits are the subject of discussion in the article before us . Let us now see the manner in which they are treated . Mr. Irving , who had hitherto been petted , and , as it were , clapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient in nerve and originality , ' he brought nothing with him from home , ' and his sketches , taken in England , are only copies of our favorite authors ' - ' patterns , taken on silk paper from our classic writers . ' The applause bestowed upon his works* was not so much a tribute to his merit , as an acknowledgment of the assiduous homage , with which he courted the favor of the British public . He gasped for British popularity . ' The national politeness ( ? ) owed him some return , for he imitated , admired , deferred to us , and was ready to sacrifice every thing to obtain a smile or a look of approbation . ' Such is the liberal construction put by the critic upon the amiable and romantic , but perfectly honest and even natural delusion in regard to the refinement and generosity of the British aristocracy , under which Mr. Irving appears to have labored on his arrival in England , and which certainly gave a false coloring to many passages in the second series of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is the drudge of his materials , ' he labors under an epilepsy of the fancy , ' he is not aware of the infinite divisibility of mind and matter . ' Is the reviewer , by the bye , quite certain himself of the truth of this principle as respects the former substance ? He anatomizes his subjects ' - ' he runs riot in an account of the dishes at a boarding-house , as if it were a banquet of the // gods , and recounts the overturning of a stage-waggon with as much impetuosity , turbulence , and exaggerated enthusiasm , as if it were the fall of Pha*iton . ' One of his works is , however , a masterpiece , but the merit even of this appears to result in a great measure from the circumstance of its containing a single fine description . And what , gentle reader , do you suppose to be the subject of this description , which has the effect of elevating one of these abortions of an epileptic fancy into a literary chef-d'aiuvre ? Neither more nor less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The description of the guiding of the vessel by the Pilot through the narrow strait left for her escape , the sea-fight , and the incident of the white topsail of the English man-of-war appearing above the fog , where it is first mistaken for a cloud , are of the first order of graphic composition . The rest is commonplace . ' Our critic traverses in the wake of his adventurous author a thousand leagues of laud and pathless ocean-numberless incidents and changes of many-colored life invite his attentionwithout success . T is all barren because t is all foreign . But no sooner does the white topsail of an English man-of-war ' rise upon his fancy , like the welcome vision of the Heavenly Twins upon the weary eyes of the tempest-tost mariners in Horace , than all is well , and he is ready to exclaim with honest Larry in the Absentee , There spoke the true thing-now my own heart 's satisfied . ' The rest is commonplace . ' This we think excellent . We know nothing better in the same way , unless it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents himself as having heard or said beforehand all the good things in Dr. Channing 's Essay on Milton . Our author 's criticisms seem to be in a great measure borrowed from our own lucubrations . ' All this we have heard or said before . We are not edified at all , nor are we greatly flattered by it . It is as if we should convey a letter to a friend in America , and should find it transcribed and sent back to us with a heavy postage . ' Our reviewer , whatever may be his other errors , can hardly be charged with hiding his light under a bushel . Montesquieu tells us in one of his Persian letters , that on a visit to a friend 's house in the country , he met with two persons who talked more than the rest of the company . The conversation of one resolved itself into this phrase , Cela est vrai parceque je l'ai dit- ' that is true , for I have said as much myself ; ' that of the other into the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l'ai pcts dit- ' that can not be true , for I never said any such thing . ' The former was considered a pleasant fellow , while the other passed for an insufferable coxcomb . Our critic employs the converse of the first of these forms . Cela est vrai , donc je l'ai dit- ' that is true , therefore I said it myself . ' He has not the most remote conception that any body else in the world can originate a good thing . If there be a bright thought in Dr. Channing 's Essay on Milton , it was of course borrowed from the article on the same subject which appeared about the same time in the Edinburgh Review , although the latter unluckily did not reach this country until after Dr. Channing 's was published . Talleyrand , upon reading one day in a newspaper some new repartee , which was attributed , as usual , to himself , is said to have exclaimed , Voila encore un bon mot , que je suis bien aise d'avoir dit . The reviewer , we think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , for Dr. Channing 's article , wherever it may have come from , is the better of the two . With equal simplicity he firmly believes , that all the books that are published throughout the world are intended soleily and exclusively for the perusal of his fraternity , and if they contain any allusion to , or extract from the Review , ' they are thus far in the nature of a letter , which returns to its writer with the burden of double postage . With all this , our critic can talk very pointedly and properly in the same article on the folly of selfishness . This paltry self , looking upon itself as of more importance than all the rest of the world , fancies itself the centre of the universe , and would have every one else look upon it in the same light . ' We entirely agree in the doctrine here stated by this writer , which is so distinctly expressed as to relieve us from the trouble of seeking epithets , to characterize his pra&amp; tice . So much for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part Dr. Channing , are treated in the article before us . As respects the last of these writers , he not only borrows all his good sayings from the Edinburgh Review , hut endeavors to trim to all opinions and unite all suifrages , ' - . calculates the vulgar clamor and venal sophistry of the British press for the meridian of Boston , ' - ' keeps an eye to both worlds , kisses hands to the reading public all round , and does his best to stard well with all the different sects and parties . ' He is a Unitarian , but disclaims all connexion with Dr. Priestley as // a materialist ; he denounces Calvinism and the Church of England , but to show that this proceeds from no want of liberality , makes the amende honorable to Popery and Popish divinesis an American Republican and a French Bourbonist-abuses Bonaparte , and observes a profound silence with respect to Ferdinand . ' He likes wit , provided it is serious . ' Because he speaks of Milton , Bacon , and Shakspeare , as superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Admiral Nelson , lie is compared to Abraham Adams , in Fielding 's novel , who thought a schoolmaster the greatest character in the world , and himself the greatest of all schoolmasters ; ' and is represented as gravely dividing greatness into different sorts , and placing himself at the top . ' Finally , he is a pretender of the stamp of those , who think that there is no reason why they should not do all that others can , and a great deal more into the bargain . ' Thus much for his personal character . As to his writings ; - We like his sermons best-his criticisms less-his politics least of all . ' It would seem from other passages , that the best is bad enough . Even as a preacher , his style is tedious , and his arguments trite . ' He is prolix without suspecting it-lays a solemn stress on the merest trifles-repeats truisms and apologises for them as startling discoveries-plays the sophist , and conceives that he is performing a vacred duty . ' The general feature ' that distinguishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newest and most plausible opinion at the turn of the tide , or just as it is getting into vogue , and would fain arrogate both the singularity and the popularity of it to himself . ' His account of Milton is a mere imitation or amplification of what has been said by others , ' which others are , as we have seen , afterwards explained to be the critic himself . His style is good , though in general too labored , formal , and constrained . All is brought equally forward-nothing is left to tell for itself . In the attempt to be copious , he is tautological-in striving to explain every thing , he overloads and obscures his meaning : The fault is the uniform desire to produce effect , and the supposition that this is to be done by main force . ' His politics are borrowed from others , and are grounded on misrepresentations and falsehoods . ' The ugly mask , ' which once concealed from the world the true character of Bonaparte , has , it seems , been taken off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mask in preference to the head . ' // Now we must assume that every journal of the character and pretensions of the Edinburgh Review , has for its object , in profession at least , if not in practice and reality , to promote good taste in letters , and good principles in the conduct of life . This being supposed , we would venture to ask whether the prevalence of good taste is promote ( l by a studied depreciation of the merits of the best writers of the time , or that of good principles by treating the ministers of religion and the most enlightened , active , and ardent friends of humanity with open insult , merely because they happen to reside in a foreign country . It is not our purpose to attempt to fix on this occasion the precise value of the literary labors of the distinguished persons alluded to , and we shall therefore not undertake to examine whether there be or be not any real foundation for some or all of the charges here made against them . They doubtless have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this critic would have proved himself to be as stupid , as he is malignant , which is not exactly the case , if he had not selected these as the basis of some at least of his caricatures . Others , as we shall presently see , are so entirely destitute of any resemblance to the features of the originals , that they must necessarily pass for mere fancy-pieces . But without pretending to refute , or even examine in detail any of these objections-without wishing to exempt these writers from the full severity of a just and lecritimate criticism ,  --  we confine our view at present entirely to the tone and temper of the article ,  --  about which , after the extracts we have given , the reader will perceive that there can be no dispute ,  --  and we ask again what advantage results to the cause of good taste and good morals from assailing the best writers and the best mcii with wanton outrage ? Is it fair , just , grateful , or honorable to reward in this way , the labors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident to the literary profession ? The principle of genius is a keen sensibility , which renders its possessor uncommonly susceptible to all impressions , and incapacitates him , as it were , from bearing up with equanimity under the toils and troubles that enter so largely into even the common lot of humanity ,  --  and are those whose occupation it is to cultivate and encourage letters , to add to these troubles the slings and arrows ' of unprovoked calumny ? The delicate texture of a poetical imagination is not proof against such treatment , which has often been fatal to the peace , the happiness , the life itself of those who have suffered // it . It was said by Racine , that he had received more pain from a single unjust criticism , than pleasure from all the praise that had ever been bestowed upon him ; and it is commonly reported , that he died of the effects of a reprimand from his sovereign . A modern critic remarks , that it was a great piece of folly in so wise a man , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause ; but he did not recollect that if Racine had been so constituted as to support with indifference the attacks of critics and the displeasure of Louis XIV . he could not possibly have written bis exquisite tragedies . Did our reviewer remember when he aimed at the probity of Mr. Irving , the false and wanton insinuations , or rather assertions , which we have quoted above , that , coming from such a quarter , they would necessarily poison for a time the peace of one of the purest and most amiable , as well as ingenious men now living ? Was this a natural return for the pleasure which he has given to us all-including his cynical calumniator-by the charming creations , with which his fine genius has for so many years peopled . the monotonous pathway of every-day life ? Or even if we choose to consider the whole business of polite literature as mere sport , and those who cultivate it , as voluntarily exposing themselves to be treated with a wanton arid insolent levity , which they are to receive as mere pleasantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the taste and principles of those who sport in the same way with the sacred subject of religion and its teachers ? These may be supposed indeed to be comparatively indifferent to unjust attacks . Their objects are of a loftier and purer kind than those of the merely literary man , and raise them above the sphere of popular applause and censure , in which the other lives , and moves , and has his being , - above the ordinary accidents of life . Like their sublime Master , when fixed to the cross in the fatal hour of his last agony , they can pray for their spiteful and malignant persecutors , as mistaken wretches , who know not what they do . But the same reasons , which render the minister of religion , who truly feels the spirit of his calling , superior to the influence of calumny , impose upon others with tenfold force the duty of treating him in the interest of society with marked respect . We are willing to believe , and do in fact think it probable , that the critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of Dr. Channing , when he ventured to assault him in this unmanly style , but it is obvious that the reverence , // which is habitually cherished by all right-minded persons for every thing connected with religion , in the absence of any more particular motive , ought to , and would , if he had felt it , have restrained his petulance . It is not our intention , as we remarked above , to discuss in detail the objections that are made to the literary and moral characters of our distinguished countrymen in the article before us , but we will here barely mention , without enlarging upon them , one or two very extraordinary inconsistencies between the statements of the critic , and the real facts of the case . Mr. Irving is represented as entirely deficient in images and feelings of American origin- ' he brought with him no new earth , no sprig of laurel gathered in the wilderness , no red bird 's wing , no gleam from crystal lake , or new-discovered fountain , neither grace nor grandeur plucked from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cradled infancybut he brought us rfacciamentos of our own thoughts-copies of our favorite authors . ' Now all this , which is prettily , though somewhat affectedly , expressed , happens to be exactly the reverse of the truth . The best parts of Mr. Irving 's works are those in which he has drawn his inspiration wholly from American sources , and those of which the scene is laid abroad , though often beautiful , are uniformly feebler than the former . Such has been and is the general opinion of competent judges , and , what our critic will consider as more to the point , of the writers in the Edinburgh Review . I'n a very favorable notice of the Sketch Book , which appeared in that journal , some articles were recommended , and in part quoted , as more particularly interesting , of which the prominent one was Rip Van Winkle . It appears , therefore , that the first bouquet which Mr. Irving presented to the British public , contained a sprig of laurel , ' which he had brought with him from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics , to be the prettiest thing in the bunch . In their notices of his subsequent works , the passages founded on American scenery and manners , have always been selected as the most striking and spirited . So obvious indeed is the superiority of these to the rest , that we have no hesitation in regarding them as the life of the collections in which they appear , the attic salt as it were , that gave vitality , freshness , and taste to the otherwise somewhat insipid compound . Mr. Irving had gathered on his native soil , and before he ever saw Europe , not merely sprigs of laurel , ' but garlands // far more healthy and more likely to endure than those which he afterwards plucked in the conservatories of England . His Knickerbocker , on the whole the most powerful and original of all his productions , is wholly American . Every line of it is new earth and red bird 's wing . ' In Salmagundi there were occasionally imitations of Addison and Goldsmith , and the plan was copied from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of native origin . The Little . Man in Block is not , as far as we recollect , described in our stock-books of a century ago , ' nor have we seen any account of the American logocracy , the Tunisian ambassador 's wardrobe , or the pleasures of a tour to Saratoga Springs by the wits of Queen Anne . ' WL.3n Mr. Irving went to Europe , he carried with him , as we have just seen , sundry sprigs of laurel , a little nursery , in fact , of wild flowers , which he mingled in somewhat sparing proportions with those of foreign growth , that he collected on his way , but which were constantly noticed as the pride of his nosegay . The red bird 's wing was always the most conspicuous plume in his bonnet . But we did not find him putting forth all his power until he employed himself again in his Columbus upon a subject exclusively and strictly American . Does our critic find no gleam of crystal lake , or new-discovered fountain , neither grace nor grandeur plucked from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradled infancy , ' in the charming descriptions which Mr. Irving has given us of the indolent , luxurious Paradise of the natives of Haiti ? Why , this very writer , or one of his frateriiity , employed , but a short time since , almost the same language in telling us what Mr. Irving 's style is , that he now employs with the insertion of a negative in telling us what it is not . This is really too bad . Mr. Irving 's sketches in England are , as we have hinted above , comparatively feeble . By affecting to represent these as the only things which he has done that are worth attention , and throwing out of view the whole of his best and most spirited productions , the reviewer is able to make him out a mere tame copyist of the British classics , with some degree of plausibility ; with how much candor , we leave it for our readers to judge . An inconsistency with fact , not less glaring than that which we have just noticed , occurs in the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to this writer , is a disposition to trim to all opinions , and keep well with all parties at the same time . ' Such is the picture ; but how // stands the fact ? Dr. Channing , as our readers are generally aware , is the acknowledged leader of the Unitarian sect , as far as there can be leaders in a communion of which the officiating clergymen are all on a footing of perfect equality . Far from making a secret of his opinions , he habitually declares them with a degree of fearlessness , which some of his friends consider imprudent . Now the Unitarian sect-although it includes perhaps , in proportion to its numbers , as large a share of the talent , virtue , and respectability of the country as any other , - is doubtless among them all the one , which has the least pretensions to popularity . It is in fact one , which , as all who are capable of looking at the subject philosophically well know , from the nature of its tenets never can be popular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and editions-balances the authority of conflicting passages , and consequently addresses itself to a very limited portion of the community : for such a portion only have the means and leisure to pursue these inquiries . We may go further , and affirm with safety , not only that the Unitarians are not a popular sect , but that they are decidedly the most unpopular of all . They are habitually denounced , both here and in England , by those who respect and love them individually , as unbelievers , deists , and sometimes atheists . The state of the case is therefore simply this : Dr. Channing stands forth openly and fearlessly before the world as the leading champion of a decried , suspected , and unpopular class of Christians . It is no part of our business to inquire into the justice of the suspicions entertained of the Unitarians , which may or may not have a reasonable foundation . The fact is undoubtedly as we have stated it . What , then , does the reviewer mean ,  --  what can he mean ,  --  by representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , and keeps well with all parties ? Is it trimming to all opinions to espouse a particular one , and maintain it with so much energy , eloquence , and consistency , as to be considered the leader and champion of those who hold it ? Is it keeping well with all parties to oppose and defy them all except a particular one , and that the smallest and most unpopular among them ? In his controversial writings , Dr. Channing has no doubt uniformly observed the decorum , which belongs to his character and feelings , as well as to his position , and has treated his opponents with perfect liberality ; but we venture to hope that the observance of the ordinary courtesies of life does not make a man out to be a // time-server and a trimmer . If it did , by the bye , we think we could safely assure the writer of the article before us , that he would never be considered as obnoxious to those qualifications In short , the charges here made against Dr. Channing are so obviously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they attribute to him a character so entirely the reverse of that which he notoriously bears , that it is somewhat difficult to imagine how the idea of them could have gained admission into the reviewer 's mind in connexion with his name . The making of them supposes , no doubt , an almost complete ignorance of the reputation and standing of the author whose works he undertook to cut up , as well as a criminal readiness to scoff at things and persons which all good men regard with reverence ; but it also supposes , we think , the existence of some particular motive which operated in this case , to give a bias to the mind of the reviewer , which , under other circumstances , it could not well have taken . It appeaYs , in fact , from the tenor of the article , that there was such a motive , the nature of which is indicated with sufficient clearness in the closing sentence of the extracts given above . rrhe ugly mask ' which for a time concealed from the world the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England ; but Dr. Channing continues to lecture on the mask in preference to the head . ' Dr. Channing , has published , under the form of a review of Scott 's Napoleon , a powerful analysis of the intellectual and moral character of that personage , which , according to the notions of the reviewer , is not sufficiently favorable to the Man of Destiny . ' The supposed injustice done to his favorite hero , seems to be the source of the particular disgust which the reviewer has taken towards our distinguished countryman ; and the supposed inconsistency between a love of liberty and a dislike of Bonaparte , appears to be the real foundation for the charge made upon him , of trimming between opposite opinions , and keeping well with all parties . Now , supposing even that Dr. Channing had in some degree mistaken the character of Bonaparte , we can not admit that this would at all justify the critic in his outrageous attack ; but , independently of this consideration , we must also remark , that , according to our judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , is on the other side . We can not perceive that any material injustice is done to the celebrated Corsican in // 48 July , the Doctor 's article . We greatly doubt the fact , so positively affirmed by the reviewer , that the ugly mask , ' which was formerly supposed to be the face of Bonaparte , has been taken off in England . We have seen no authentic account of any such operation . The meaning of this language in plain English-if it mean any thing-is , that Napoleon was at one time considered as a tyrant , a usurper , and an enemy of liberty , but that the public opinion on this subject has been since changed , and that he is now better thought of , perhaps approved , lamented , and admired ; for we are not informed how far the reviewer means to proceed in his hero 's apotheosis . Now we are free to confess , as respects ourselves , that we have no knowledge of any such revolution in the public opinion upon this subject , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our countrymen . On this side the water , Napoleon is still the same tyrant , usurper , and enemy of liberty , that he always was ; and Dr. Channing , in representing him under this point of view , has expressed the feeling of the great mass of his fellow-citizens , as well as his own . We know that a mask was removed from his character some time before his death-not , however , by any means an ugly mask , but , on the contrary , a brilliant and dazzling one , like the silver veil of the Prophet in Moore 's poemwe mean the false glare , the prestige , to use an expressive French word , with which the possession of imperial power and unbounded wealth had so long surrounded him in the imagination of the world . When this was removed , he did not ,  --  such at least is our impression ,  --  rise in the public estimation , but on the contrary was thought to have lost much of his heroism , without gaining a great deal on the score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles  --  the modern Charlemagne-forgetting the real , in a vain concern for the imaginary and conventional , dignity of his character , and disputing with a paltry colonial governor about the style in which he was to be addressed , and the number of bottles of claret he was to be allowed for dinner , with as much apparent interest as he had before contended with Alexander for the empire of Europe , our estimate of his qualities was in some degree lowered , and we recollected Rousseau 's well known ode , Le masque tombe-1'homme reste ,  - -  Et le hIros s'Jvanouit . Since that time , and especially since the death of Bonaparte , we have had in rapid succession a series of publications , filled // with the most minute , curious , and instructive information respecting his character and opinions , prepared in general by friendly hands , and compiled , in part , under his own direction and even dictation . We have had the scientific and military details of his campaigns by himself and his favorite generals ; the diffuse memoranda of his conversations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a few months the authentic narrative of his private life while in power , by his favorite secretary , of which we hope in a future number to lay some notice before our readers . In addition to this , we have had a hundred collections of memoirs , some of them in the highest degree curious and interesting , by various personages , who figured in his armies or at his court , from his brother to his butler : and we may safely say , that there is now , as the Spanish proverb runs , very little at the bottom of the inkstand . The strain of most of these works is on the whole decidedly panegyrical , as might naturally be expected , when we recollect that they were almost all written by creatures and dependants of the Ex-Emperor , who looked back to the period of his reign as the golden age , which for them no doubt it was . Every thing has been said that could be said , to exalt , embellish , explain , justify , excuse , or palliate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life under consideration . His encomiasts endeavor to make him out the wisest , virtuousest , discreetest , best ' of men , as well as the most entcrprising , skilful , and successful of commanders . We have been told how he pinched the Abb6 de Pradt 's ears , extemporised love-tales for the entertainment of the Empress and her ladies , and played bob-cherry with the King of Rome . All this may be true , although we must own that we receive it in part with some grains of allowance . But supposing it to be all true , it does not much affect the political and moral character of the personage , who , we fear , must still remain what he was before-sedet eternumque sedebit  --  a usurper , a tyrant , and an enemy to iberty . Our critic takes it very much amiss that Dr. Channing should elevate Milton , Bacon , and Shakspeare in the order of intellectual precedency above Wellington , Nelson , and Napoleon , and in general should consider philosophy and poetry as higher applications of talent than the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and war undoubtedly are . He affirms that the latent object of the Doctor in making this division , is no other than to place himself at the top among // those who talk about things , and commanders at the bottom among those who only do them . Now this , which is doubtless in the opinion of the reviewer very excellent pleasantry , is unquestionably very inaccurate , and we must add , very unfair when considered as a statement of the theory of our countryman . Dr. Channing does not place himself , but Milton , Bacon , and Shakspeare at the top , and he does not place the great commanders , such as Napoleon , Wellington , and Nelson , at the bottom , but only below the very few persons who have exercised equal or greater powers in a still more comprehensive and general way . The difference between these two versions of his theory , however unimportant the critic may consider it for other purposes , is at least very material to the reputation of Dr. Channing for modesty  --  a quality which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge by the practice of the reviewer-we should suppose it to be in Scotland . As respects the principle , we incline to think that it will bear examination , and do not consider it so much at variance with the common opinion of the world as this writer evidently does . If he had not treated it as a paradox , we should have been rather disposed to regard it as a truism . In Europe , ' it seems , we think that Ca*sar , Alexander , and Charlemagne were no babies . ' Has Dr. Channing , then , intimated that he considered Napoleon as a baby ? Is every man a baby who could not have written the Paradise Lost , the . TVovum Organon or King Lear ? If the reviewer 's object be caricature , we can understand what he means ; but his representation , or rather misrepresentation , is obviously wholly foreign to the merits of the question . We think in Europe that to move the great masses of power , and to bind opinions in a spell , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a homily . ' Does the reviewer then mean to tell us that it is the commander , military or naval , who moves the great masses of power and binds opinions in a spell ? Is it not perfectly obvious , that no individual , by a direct application of even the highest talent to practical business , can produce any very extensive effects , excepting so far as he may have the advantage of a favorable state of opinion , prepared , spell-bound , ' as the reviewer is pleased to say , beforehand ? No illustration of this remark can be more complete and conclusive than that which is furnished by the example of Napoleon himself . The conqueror of Arcole , Austerlitz , and Jena , undoubtedly possessed a military genius // of the first class ; but what would he have been under other circumstances-had he lived , for example , fifty years earlier than he did ? He would have been under Louis XV . what Dumouriez  --  a person of auch the same character-was , a brigadier-general at forty , with the reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principle of his great success lay in the fact of his appearance at a critical epoch . The revolution had electrified public opinion , and throxvn the great living masses of power , not only into motion , but into convulsions . Bonaparte , with his prodigious military talent , electrified himself by the same causes that acted upon all the rest , was able , under the favor of circumstances , to give these masses for a time a direction towards any particular object which he happened to prefer . Here was a golden opportunity for displaying the very highest order , not of intellectual , but , what is a still nobler quality , moral greatness ; and had Napoleon done justice to it , he would undoubtedly have placed his name above those of Milton , Shakspeare , or any other that is named among men , excepting only that of Washington . To what object then-. having as he had the full liberty of choice-did he direct the almost boundless power which was placed at his disposal ? The good of the world  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country ? Oh no ! All these might have been promoted together , and by the same efforts ; but these noble objects , and with them the lives and happiness of millions of his contemporaries , were sacrificed to a direct regard for his own paltry self , as the reviewer has it . When the universe was all in alarm , ready for any thing , and thrown by accident under his command , he could think of nothing better to employ it upon than the mighty adventure of changing the style , title , and mode of living of a little French corporal and his family . Such were his pretensions to moral greatness ; and where a man is deficient in this particular , there is much reason to fear that his mind is not of the highest order . The heart , ' says Vauvenargues , is the true source of intellectual power . ' Toutes les grandes pens6es viennent du ca*ur . But to return to the question , as stated by the reviewer himself-Who electrified public opinion , and set in motion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Obviously the authors of the French revolution . And who were the authors of the French revolution ? The military , we know , were the last portion of the community who had any concern in it . // Those who gave the impulse and carried on the work to its completion at the taking of the Bastille , were the orators , thinkers , and writers  --  to go no higher-of the two preceding centuries , from Luther to Mirabeau . How did they effect their object ? Precisely by the means which the reviewer speaks of with so much contempt- ' by turning periods ' and winding up homilies . ' An obscure Augustine monk , by his powerful preaching , wrought in such a way upon the feelings of his contemporaries , that they burst all bounds-rent in twain the sacred veil that had before concealed from the public the mysteries of religious belief , and commenced a series of wars that lasted a century and a half , and opened an epoch in the history of Europe . But as Luther only wound up homilies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic , a very small man . Calvin and he were mere pigmies in comparison with Gustavus Adolphus and Wallenstein , who did the things , which they only talked about . Locke , Montesqu.ieu , Voltaire , Rousseau , and the rest , by their powerful speculations in moral and political philosophy , effected the change in the public opinion of Europe , which immediately determined the occurrence of the French revolution , and thus unsettled all , and overthrew the greater part of the governments before existing in the civilized world . But as these persons only turned periods , ' their agency was , of course , a very secondary one , and they are not to be named for importance on the same day with Dumouriez , Pichegru , Moreau , and , finally , Napoleon and his generals , who actually did what they only talked about . Such is the system of the reviewer . We in America-very foolishly perhaps-consider the kingly-crowned head ' and the counsellor heart , ' as nobler members of the body , whether politic or natural , than our steed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Without pretending to depreciate the importance of the functions of a military or naval commander , which are among the noblest that belong to practical life , we conceive that thc philosopher occupies the same situation in the great action of human affairs , and in relation to the whole human race , that the general does on the field of battle in reference to his own army . The skilful commander , who knows his business , does not place himself in the front rank , and lay about him with his own hands . He takes his station on a neighboring height with a telescope by his side , and gives his orders to his aids , who in turn convey them to the inferior officers , until they reach the subalterns and privates . These are // the persons who actually cut down the enemy . They do what the commander-in-chief and the superior officers only talk about , and on the system of our critic are the real heroes of the day . In the same way , the philosopher takes his stand on the intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are able to hear him-jpwnir*a dvvsi5Wtv . By them his judgments of men and things are communicated to the many , and having thus wrought out a change in public opinion , begin at last to exhibit their practical effects , whether for good or evil , by determining a new order of political events . Thus far all is done by talking , and the talk is entirely upon ge , peral principles . At this period , a new scene opens in the progress of the action , and a new set of characters make their appearance . The practical statesman and commander are now the prominent persons , but still , as before , all is done by talking . The only difference is , that the conversation , instead of turning upon general principles , now turns upon the application of them to the business of the world . The representative and diplomatist talk in Congress and in Parliament  --  the commander talks and writes in his cabinet or at the head of his army  --  and they thus produce effects upon a somewhat inferior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merely passive mortal machine begins to perform its functions . The tax-gatherer , the soldier , the sheriff , the surgeon , the attorney , the cultivator , get into motion . Sword and lancet , pill and cartridge-box , plea , plough , and printing-press are set to work : the talk is over , and the real action , as our critic considers it , is at last in progress . It is needless , of course , after what we have said , to dwell any further on the nature of his mistake , which is obviously the vulgar one of considering the pride , pomp , and circumstance , ' the sound and fury , signifying nothing , ' which attend the appearance of a certain class of the performers in this great drama , as proofs of their superior importance in comparison with the rest . A man who wears a laced coat with epaulettes on his shoulders , occupies the largest house in the city , is attended , when he goes out , by a multitude of others , and perhaps saluted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously a much greater character than another who merely sits down in his morning-gown , to write by his fire-side . The plausibility of the statement , so far as it has any , lies in confounding the faculty of writing and speaking with grammatical correctness and rhetorical elegance , with the intellectual power which is required for // liJuly , writing and speaking with effect . In the former sense the art of turning a period or winding up a homily is undoubtedly a very trifling accomplishment , although we could wish that , trifling as it is , it were not quite so much neglected by some of our great men . But to turn a period or wind up a homily with effect , requires , in addition to all that Lowth and Blair can supply , a head-with good effect  --  a heart ; and these are tools which , whatever the reviewer may think of it , are not to be found in every man 's workshop . As respects the latter , at least , we believe that his own stock would not be the worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion entertained by Dr. Channing of the character of Napoleon , as not only unjust and incorrect in itself , but as entirely inconsistent with the liberal principles , which our countryman professes in regard to other matters . This supposed inconsistency is , as we remarked above , the real foundation of the charge made upon him by the critic of trimming between opposite parties . It is impossible according to this authority , to love liberty without loving Bonaparte , and one who pretends to love liberty , and at the same time to hate Bonaparte , must necessarily be a hypocrite and a time-server . We are surprised , that staunch republicans , who complain that the world bow to rank and birth alone , should turn with redoubled rage against intellect , the moment it became a match for pride and prejudice , and was the only thing that could be opposed to them with success , or could extort a moment 's fear or awe for human genius or human nature ! ' Now we must needs say , at the risk of appearing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inconsistency here , as the error before , seems to us to be on the side of the reviewer , and not of Dr. Channing . We really can not discern the identity between the cause of Bonaparte , and that of well-ordered and rational liberty , which is so perfectly pbvious and palpable to the sharp optics of this Scottish seer . We in our turn are surprised that staunch whigs , nurtured in the principles of Sydney and Russell , brought up at the feet of Fox , enemies by creed , feeling , habit , and inheritance , of the slightest approach to arbitrary forms of government , should deem it consistent with their character to grovel at the footstool of a despot , and kiss the rod of iron oppression , simply because it is wielded by the hand of one who rose from the lower walks of life , possessed great talents , and had once been , or pretended to be , a // friend of liberty . Does tyranny lose its proper character , and cease to be odious , because the tyrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an upstart ? If the situation and disposition of a ruler be such , that be will certainly do me all the injury in his power , is it a rational source of satisfaction to me , that he pos .. sesses great talents , and that his power to injure me will of course be nearly co-extensive with his will ? Can I be blamed for turning with redoubled rage , ' if the reviewer like the expression , upon intellect , when the only use that is made of this intellect is to invent and put in practice new and more effectual methods of depriving me by force or fraud of all I hold dear ? Did the Romans of the time of Caesar , who , as Cassius tells us in the play , were compelled to Walk under his huge legs , and peep about To find themselves dishonorable graves , feel much pride in the large dimensions of the political manmountain , that was trampling them down in the dust ? For ourselves we are devotedly attached to liberty , and would mak* any sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mit to it , we have no hesitation in saying that we should much prefer a good , easy , hereditary , gouty despot , who would ask for nothing but a skilful cook , and a well-stocked deer-park , to a fiery usurper of first-rate talent , who would be always on horseback , wasting the blood and treasure of his people in vain attempts to gratify his wild and wanton ambition . Tyrant for tyrant , we should certainly prefer King Log to King Stork , Louis to Napoleon ; and we consider this preference as not only not inconsistent with , but as the natural and necessary result of a love of liberty . We must even venture to suggest to this critic , with all the deference due to so high an authority , that the intelligent friends of liberty on this side the water have not been edified by the tone of adulation which has generally distinguished the speculations of the Edinburgh Review on the character of Bonaparte . We have seen with regret , and a sort of indignation , the journal which claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe , the leading periodical organ of sound political principles , lavishing its warmest expressions of applause and admiration upon the bitterest and most effective enemy to such principles that has yet appeared . We can not admit as a sufficient excuse for this , that the Edinburgh Review is or was , as respects the party divisions that prevail in Great Britain , an opposition journal ; and that it was neces // sary to defend at all hazards , and with every sacrifice of consistency and principle , the chief of a nation with which the ministry were at war . This might answer as an apology for a humbler class of writers , who profess no other rule of conduct than attachment to their party ; but can hardly be received as a good plea in behalf of the Edinburgh Review . Or even if we consent to allow to this consideration somewhat snore weight than it is fairly entitled to , what propriety is there in expecting that we in this country , who are not under the influence of the same party feelings , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject ? Because the British whigs deem it politic to rush through thick and thin in pursuit of what they no doubt regard as patriotic objects , are the citizens of the United States , who have no immediate concern with those objects , to affirm that black is white , and sanction the wildest excesses in conduct* and the grossest errors in principle , merely for the sake of keeping them company ? We can assure the reviewer , that it is as much as our consciences will bear us out in , to follow up the hue and cry of our own parties , without intermeddling in those of other countries a thousand leagues off . In short , if the critic will but coolly consider these things , he can not avoid seeing , that the inconsistency complained of is really on his side , and not on that of Dr. Channing ; that the friends of liberty are not , as such , bound in honor and conscience to bow down before the brazen image of a ruthless and bloody military despotism ; and that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little of his friendly feeling upon the young , flourishing , growing , glorious , English republic of the United States , instead of wasting it all upon an Italian soldier , merely because he was a man of talent , he would have acted much more consistently with his professed principles , and done himself a great deal more honor in the opinion of judicious men . The general result seems to be , that the attack of the reviewer upon the literary and moral reputation of Dr. Channing , and our other distinguished countrymen , is not less unjust than it is indecorous . We had intended , after replying to the article immediately before us , to have alluded to some other attacks , which have recently been levelled by the British press against this country , but have only room at present to notice the manner in which one of the more respectable weekly journals has been pleased to comment upon our own labors . We shall first quote entire the article to which we allude , and // which appeared in the Edinburgh Scotsman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , No. 65 , for Octo6cr , 1829 . We have no great respect for this periodical , of which a casual number now and then strays into our hands . We give the writers cred*.t for considerable industry , talent , and extent of information , and for a large portion of that worldly shrewdness which disposes prudent men to sail with the tide , and keep to windward of all doctrines which are not already in general favor ; but they are woefully deficient in intellectual courage , in profound and original views , in lofty aims , and in that love of truth and of mankind , which atones for many errors , and sanctifies the best efforts of the understanding . The journal wants true American feeling ; it wants heart and it wants soul . The writers creep in the train of our reviewers , and take upon their shoulders from choice , the load of prejudice and sophistry which is forcibly entailed upon us by our old establishments , and the feelings and interests which have grown out of them . There is but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every question that interests mankind ; and that , owing to a happy combination of circumstances , exists in North America . But the periodical writers of the first class there , voluntarily renounce the high functions which thus devolve upon them , and , instead of heading the tide of liberal speculation , and boldly proclaiming truths which must either be suppressed in the old world , or uttered in whispers , s*nd us back a feeble echo of the false doctrines and antiquated opinions , which are , or were current among ourselves . For any thing that appears in it on politics , morals , law , religion , or philosophy , this review nuight be edited under the censorship of a Burgomaster of Frankfort , or an Amtman of Carlsruhe ! If it was ( were ) published in either of these towns , we should say it was a respectable journal but as the organ of opinion in free republican America , nothing can be more pitiful . It is as innocent of rivincr countenance to innovation , as if Prince Metternich were the editor ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prejudices , of which enlightened men in Europe are beginning to be ashamed . The writers have not the slightest conception that their country exemplifies a new and happier order of society , which ought to become a source of light to the world . Were Locke and Sydney living in our day , they would regard the American government as a beautiful and successful experiment , which has solved difficulties that had perplexed the wisest of men from the beginning of time , and unfolded truths of incalculable value to mankind // Not so the sages of the North American Review . In their eyes , the republican institutions of their country are merely one of the accidental modes or fashions of government to which the varieties of national taste and genius give birth , having much in common with the pauper-loaded and priest-ridden systems of the old world ! To transplant its forms , or apply its principles to any state of continental Europe , would , in their opinion , be a presumptuous and visionary attempt , fit only for the Radicals of England , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one country-their chins in another  --  and wear both their hair and their beard in a third-so there is a diversity of taste and usage among nations upon the subject of government , which no wise man should disturb ! The American loves to make his own laws , assess his own taxes , and appoint his own parsons and magistrates . The Englishman 's pleasure is to grumble at the aristocracy , to whom he commits these functions ; the Spaniard rejoices in the dominion of his rey absoluto and his priests ; the Turk is delighted with the bow-string of his sublime Lord , and the conscience of the Russian is satisfied provided his back is well flayed with the knout ! All these are equally happy under their several systems ! To transfer the institutions of one of these nations , in whole or in part , to any of the others , would unsettle old associations and venerable usages , as Burke sagaciously observes , and be in fact like an attempt to fit the jacket of the Laplander upon the shoulders of the gigantic Patagonian ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their doctrines , though we can not quote words or passages , we are not intentionally caricaturing the American reviewers , but describing what we honestly believe to he the scope of their principles ; and our opinion is formed after perusing , at one time or another , a considerable portion of their lucubrations . It does indeed rouse our indignation to see them , with such unequalled means of doing good , play false to the cause of mankind , and lend their aid to prop up the most pernicious errors and the worst dogmas of the old world . Let him who doubts our statement , try the American reviewers by " any constant question . " Let him examine their opinions as to the effect of church establishments , the utility of classical literature as a part of general education , the value of the English unpaid magistracy , and of the technicalities , cumbrousness , and expensiveness of the English law , the advantages of codification , &amp;c . On all these points he will find the reviewers ranging themselves on the side of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , who are distinguished as the enemies of every rational reform , and the upholders of every // old abuse . Though living in a country where improvement is advancing at the gallop , " on the car of time , " they have no faith in the future fortunes of our race , nor indulge in any aspirations after unattained but possible good . Such as man has been , such they think he ever will be , a poor , benighted animal , groping his way from one error to another , the prey of priests , and the victim of tyrants , abusing liberty where he has it , and often more happy as a slave than as a freeman ! The weight of their authority , such as it is , is employed to inculcate political maxims , which are shallow and grovelling . Their labors tend to repress true independence of thought , to bring derision on a generous and enlarged philanthropy , and to teach the Americans to undervalue those institutions which constitute their chief glory . Fortunately , the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literary men . Truth in our days has , like the ocean , ten thousand avenues , and its course can be but little impeded by closing up one or two of them . America will produce men who can appreciate the moral grandeur of her institutions , and when these appear , her literature will become a fountain of light to the world . In a literary point of view , the present number is respectable . It contains twelve articles , the last and longest of which is a review of Captain Hail 's Travels . We have seen a writer cut up in a more masterly style , but the critic does exert no contemptible degree of skill , in showing up the Captain 's prejudice , rashness , and inconsistency , and he has imitated the subject of his criticism in combining the suaviter in ruodo with the fortiter in re . So much of the discussion , however , is devoted to special points , that we can not find a passage fit for quotation . Of the other articles , there are not many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insert an extract from an article on Modern Greek Literature , for the sake of the information it contains . ' It is plain , from the tenor of this article , that the mind of the writer has been severely exercised by something which he has met with in some preceding number of this journal , but with the aid of the little 1i*ht which he has thought proper to throw upon the subject , we are rather at a loss to conjecture what particular part of our speculations it is , by which we have been so unfortunate as to give him offence . To the charges of ignorance and dulness , we of course , plead guilty with great cheerfulness . Independently of the general presumption against us , which results from the well-known degeneracy of the race on this side the water , we are quite // aware of our personal incapacity to carry into effect to any con .. siderable extent , our very honest intentions to entertain and instruct our readers . We know , that in both these respects , they are too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fully acquit the worthy editor of any intention to caricature or misrepresent our doctrines . His positive denial of any such intention would of course be quite sufficient ; independently of which , the honor he has done us by reading the casual numbers of our journal that now and then stray into his hands , ' or , as he is afterwards pleased to explain himself , by perusing at one time or another a considerable portion of our lucubrations , ' is an ample guarantee that he bears us no ill-will . When , therefore , we find him asserting that we are woefully deficient in intellectual courage-profound and original views-lofty aims-love of truth and mankind-heartsoul-and true American feeling , ' - that we take upon ourselves from choice a load of prejudice and sophistry , ' - ' send back to the old world a feeble echo of the false and antiquated doctrines that are or were current there , ' - that we play false to the cause of man , ' - that as an organ of opinion for republican America , nothing can he more pit*fal ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train of our reviewers , ' - with the other gentillesses of the same description , which the reader will have met with in the above extract , we are bound to presume that all these pretty compliments are in the nature of confessions , reluctantly extorted by the force of truth from a warm and real friend , and if the manner appear to be somewhat unceremonious , it must be owing to a want of taste in us , and not of good breeding in the Scotsman , who is , of course , thoroughly imbued with the national politeness of his country . But even if we allow to this writer all the credit which he seems disposed to claim for a friendly and respectful feeling towards us , as well as for a strict observance of the forms of civility usual among gentlemen , to which his pretensions are equally well founded ; and if we also concede to him the general inferiority of every product of cisatlantic origin to the corresponding one of European , and especially of Scottish growth , we may still venture to intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he charges us , there may possibly be a mistake in fact . While assuring his readers that he has no intention to caricature us , he candidly admits // that he can not quote words and passages in support of his view of our doctrines . Here , then , is a book , in thirty volumes , lying open before him , and , according to his account , full of the most dangerous and heretical principles , written-within and without-like the roll in Ezekiel , with lamentation and mourning and woe ; but when he comes to file his bill of exceptions , he can not , by his own admission , quote an objectionable passage-no , not so much as a single offensive word . This , we confess , does seem to us a little extraordinarybut let it pass ; for we have not room to treat the subject in detail . In defect of evidence to support his charges , our accuser undertakes to bring us to confession , forgetting the humane rule of the common law , which declares that no person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own phrase , to try us by any constant question , ' and accordingly suggests two or three , which we are expected to answer . Independently of the rather inquisitorial character of this method , we must be permitted to remark , that the Scotsman is a little unfortunate in his application of it . Of the problems which he states , all , that are of any importance , have already been solved in this journal , in a manner which would probably be satisfactory to him . As to the unpaid magistracy , and the value of classical literature , they are matters of comparatively trifling consequence , on which , if we recollect rightly , we have not had much occasion to descant : but as respects the weightier subjects of cod*fication and an established church , we have repeatedly expressed opinions decidedly in favor of the former , and against the latter , so that we really do not know what this writer means by accusing us of heresy on these points . In treating the question of codification , we have not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever may be the value of the thing , we heartily detest and despise the name , which , though patronised by the Edinburgh Review and the Scotsman , ought , as we conceive , to be utterly eschewed , with all the other abominable inventions of the same author , by every lover of pure English . Supposing , however , that we had in fact said somewhat less upon the subjects of the established church and codification , than the opposition journals in England habitually do , does not the critic perceive , that our position in these respects is entirely different from theirs ? We in America have no church establishment , nor are we embarrassed with the technicalities , cumbrousness , and expensiveness of the English law . ' We // have given , long ago , the best and most decisive evidence of our sentiments on these points , by simplifying the law , and avoiding altogether the plan of an established church . The battle is fought and won . What merit would there be in railing at the enemy after he is fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ScDtsman wishes us to be always talking about , we have already done : and this , according to his neighbor of the Review , is by far the more important part of the business . He has fallen into a similar error in charging us with a disinclination to innovate . We deny that we have ever shown any indisposition to real improvements of any kind ; but the Scotsman should remember that we have already attained most of the objects which the friends of liberty in Europe regard as desirable . He tells us himself , that our country exemplifies a new and happier order of society , which ought to become a source of light to the world ; that if Locke and Sydney were living in our day , they would regard the American government as a beautiful and successful experiment , which bas solved difficulties that had perplexed the wisest of men from the beginning of time , and unfolded truths of incalculable value to mankind . ' Such is his opinion of our institutions ; and , although he has thought proper to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American Review have not the slightest conception of all this , ' we can assure him that he is quite mistaken , and that our opinion upon the subject is exactly the same with his . But since he has been pleased to put us to the question , we would venture to ask him in turn , why , if our government be already perfect , we are called upon to encourage innovation ? Does not he recollect the old Italian epitaph , I was well , I wanted to be better , and here lam ? We are well-we do not want to be better-we conceive that the best thing that can happen to us is to remain as we are ; and this being the case , we can have no motive for wishing to innovate . Does our Scotch friend think that , after reaching the top of the bill , we ought to descend rather than not keep moving ? Does he wish us to change for the worse , rather than not change at all ? Or does he-as is more probable-only wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by words or passages , must of course be of a very loose and general character . When the Scotsman has endeavored to present those which he prefers against us in a shape at all tangible , he has failed of giving them // the least appearance of plausibility . He tells us , for example , that we want true s5lmerican feeling . On this point , we must refer him again to his neighbors of the Edinburgh Review , who , at an early stage in our progress , pronounced that we were abundantly national , ' and that there was no want of patriotic feeling . ' The intimation evidently was , that there was a slight , perhaps excusable , excess of this quality ; and we think we may affirm , without the danger of being contradicted , that there has been no diminution since . Again , we creep in the train of our reviewers . ' As a full defence against this count in the indictment , we appeal with confidence to the articles which we have had occasion , at various times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day , to address to our reviewers* in reply to their strictures upon the United States . However feebly executed in other respects , our readers will do us the justice to allow , that they have not exhibited any disposition on our part to truckle to foreign arrogance , or kiss the rod of unjust criticism . We defy the Scotsman to produce a single sentence in which we have shown an inclination to court the favor of the British press , or of any other portion of the British public . We are quite aware , on the contrary , that the tone we have uniformly maintained in this respect , is not fitted to conciliate the good will of our transatlantic brethren ; and if this were the object we had in view , we should of course adopt a different one . A few compliments to their national pride  --  a few sacrifices to their national interest  --  and we should soon cease to be a pitiful organ of republican America . ' XVe have lately seen one of our countrymen raise himself to the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying that the British have eight million tons of shipping employed in the coasting trade . Had he carried his calculation up to ten or twelve millions , he would have equalled the fame of Adam Smith . For ourselves , we look exclusively for encouragement and support to the home market . We court no favor from foreigners , and our only ambition is to merit the approval of our own intelligent countrymen . Far from creeping in the train of our reviewers , ' we have always regarded it as being , in the present state of the intercourse between the two countries , one of the most interesting branches of our editorial duty , to repel the attacks , and to guard our fellow-citizens against the misrepresentations of the British journals ; and we have uniformly acted , and shall continue to act-as far as occasion may appear to require-on this principle . // As the charges of the Scotsman , whenever they assume a tangible shape , are thus palpably , and even ludicrously inconsistent with fact , the general accusation which he deduces from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain exploded errors and abuses , of course falls of itself . The truth is , that it is very difficult for us in this country to give satisfaction to our transatlantic brethren , whatever bias xve may happen *o take . Nothing will answer but direct homage to their grossest prejudices , and even then , we must expect to be told that their approbation of us is merely the result of the national politeness . The reproach which has heretofore been generally made against the American press , is that of a tendency to exaggeration in the expression of sentiments favorable to liberty . We have been told that we confounded monarchy with slavery , that our notions of government were narrow and intolerant , and that we could see nothing good or great out of the circle of our own institutions . We have been charged , in short , with being ultra-democratic in our political opinions , and this heresy is undoubtedly much more common among us than the opposite one . But if it happen by accident that a journal which appears at long intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more reflection , expresses the same opinions in a rather more deliberate form than the rest , our censors forthwith attack us with redoubled rage , ' for the want of the same quality , of which we were before reproached with the excess . So delicate is their taste , that it is next to impossible not to offend them in one way or another . If violent , we are blind and bigoted democrats-if considerate , we are lukewarm in the cause of liberty-at all events , we are always in the wrong . This kind of criticism is so easily seen throuhh , that it would be superfluous to expose the injustice of it . We yield to none , as we have already remarked , in attachment to liberty ; but we are also aware , with every body else of the least reflection , that liberty , like other good things , may be abused , and that the name is often assumed by false pretenders for unworthy purposes . We may remark here , since the occasion presents itself , that we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time upon this subject on respectable authority in the mother country . We are told for example , in the article of the Edinburgh Review , upon the prose writings of Milton , to which we have once before alluded , that liberty , like a certain beautiful fairy in the poem of Ariosto , sometimes // puts on the form of a hateful reptile-that she grovels , and hisses , and stings ; but that we must admire and cherish her in this degraded and frightful shape , if we mean to he rewarded by her in the time of her beauty and her glory . ' All this means , if it mean any thing , that the real friends of liberty are not only bound to approve , to concur in , and to sympathise with the rational and well-directed exertions of the honest and intelligent lahorers in her cause , hut also to applaud and aid every charlatan , who chooses for any purpose , however vile , to wear her mask . But a few moments since we were invited , as friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are now called upon , always in the same character , to take counsel with Robespierre  --  to yell with Marat for two hundred thousand heads  --  to listen with delighted attention to the orator of the human race , ' and to bow with reverential awe at the shrine of the unveiled Goddi*ss of Reason . however highly we may value the approbation of the Edinburgh Review and the Scotsman , we have no hesitation in saying distinctly , that we shall not purchase it at such a price ; and since these writers express their opinion with so much freedom upon our conduct , we would ask them in turn how it happens that they do not set us the example as well as give us the precept ? How happens it that they pay no court themselves to their goddess , in her grovelling , hissing , stinging shape ? Why is it that we do not find them clamoring with Hunt and Cobbett-blaspheming with Carlile ,  --  and outraging decency with Mary Woolstonecraft and Fanny Wright ? All this and more they are bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see little or nothing in their writings , to judge at least from the casual numbers of the Scotsman that accidentally stray into our hands , ' and from perusing at one time or another a considerable portion of the lucubrations ' of the Edinburgh Reviewers . The simple truth appears at last to be , that at the very moment when they are ridiculing and abusing us for lukewarmness in the cause of liberty , their own language is much less liberal than ours . So much for the consistency and decency of these would-be dictators in the republic of letters . As respects the system they recommend to us , and the allegory by which it is illustrated , we may add , that they involve a mistake in fact , which was long ago pointed out by the great English apostle of the rights of man . The degraded and frightful shape , which in days of trouble has often appeared under the // name and character of Liberty , is not , as we are told by Milton , the sweet mountain-nymph herself in disguise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the foul spirit of License  --  a malignant demon , tormented by a continual thirst for human blood . Like the Vampyre Bride in Goethe 's poem , this loathsome figure puts on specious looks , and uses honied words-wears perhaps upon her brow the golden round of military triumph , or the red cap of deliverance from bondage ; but her only delight is to suck out the life of her victims . Her touch is fatal ; there is no remedy for it ; those who take her to their bosoms shall surely die.
