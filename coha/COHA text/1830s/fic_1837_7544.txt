Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : THE SPELL OF LOVE . from The spell of love ( 1837 ) By Mrs. Osgood . A thoughtless , happy , blooming boy , With dimpled cheek and laughing eye , Had stayed his bounding step of joy , And hushed his voice 's melody , And knelt down by his mother 's side , To breathe his prayer at eventide . Her gentle hand was lightly laid Upon his curls of sunny hair , And heart and cheek and eye were made Calmer beneath the pressure there ; Softly the prayer went forth , and blest , He sank to his sweet dreaming rest . Years had gone by :  --  still wore that brow The laughing light of childish years , Yet something on it told that now Life passed not all undimmed by tears ;  --  She who had cherished , loved him , died , And left him without guard or guide . And there were hours when manhood , truth , All that can light our wayward lot , All that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ;  --  But that soft hand amid his hair  --  Its thrilling fingers rested there ! And there were hours of passion deep , When the proud heart would rise . Oh ! then Nought could have bid the tempest sleep , Saving that hallowed touch again ;  --  Still fancy felt it lightly press  --  Still wept beneath the dear caress ! And sometimes he would kneel and pray Amid those deep repentant tears  --  And there his mother 's hand would play , Like some sweet dream of earlier years ; Guiding him , with its " spell of love , " To her own blessed home above !
