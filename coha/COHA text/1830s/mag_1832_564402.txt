txt Pet . In what tongue speakest thou ? JWat . Marry , I think in my mother tongue . IT is somewhat amusing to take up a work professing to contain specimens of what the authors are pleased to consider Yankee dialect ; that is , I presume , the customary use of language among the Americans . Such exhibitions out-Caliban Caliban himself in their deformities , more especially when drawn by foreigners ; as , for instance , by GaIt , in his novel , entitled Laurie Todd , or in Matthews 's representation of " Brother Jonathan at Home , " to say nothing of the choice specimens embodied in the elegant and veracious work of the accomplished Mrs. Trollope , and in those of other writers of sitnilar characters , whose unblushing mendacity seems to entitle them to at least the first half of the motto of the renowned Chevalier Bay ard ; for they appear indeed to be " sans peur , " though instead of the " et sans reproche , ' . ' we should be inclined to substitute " et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentence . What should we thInk of a painter , who , in endeavoring to make a portrait of Tully , surnamed Cicero , from an unlucky wart on his face , should represent his face as all wart ; or , in the same way , should give a huge proboscis as the likeness of the illustrious Ovid , to whom , in like manner , the prominence of his nasal organ had the honor of giving an additional and distinctive epithet ? Surely the world would laugh , not at those thus depicted , but at the extreme folly of the painter , who should thus go beyond all bounds of probability , even in the region of caripature ; for such things would no more be caricature , than the boy 's saying that he saw an apple that weighed twenty pounds , was an instance of hyperbole . No , they are but downright stupid lying and misrepresentation , and evince neither it nor humor . Even some of our own writers do not seem to know when they have got to the proper limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of a good thing , cram into the mouth of one man , all the queer , cant phrases they ever heard , either at first or second hand , from all the uncouth fellows , idiots included , that they ever met with in the course of their lives , doubling the stock to boot out of their own invention , and then send the crambo out to the world , as a caricature of Yankeeisms ; witness , for instance , Joe Strickland and Enoch Timbertoes . One error , however , is usually avoided by our own writers , into which foreigners fall very readily ; that , I mean , of confounding together the peculiarities of different sections of the Union , for these peculiarities are extremely well marked in many instances , and the cant and slang , as well as the simple local idioms of the centaur of Kentucky , are as different from those of the sly , civil jockey , or tin-ware vender of New-England , as the Ohio flat-boat of the one is from the pedlar 's cart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle states , that are any thing but vernacular on either tl.ie north or south of them , while these regions have each their own Shibboleth , by which their natives are betrayed . In saying this , however , I do not mean that , which every one , who knows any thing about the matter , can not but know to be untrue , that voi*. us. 48 // there is any marked discrepan3y in the general use of language between the inhabitants of these different portions of our country , particularly among those constituting the more intelligent and educated part of society . Among such it is only a single word used occasionally in the freedom of unrestrained conversation , or a figurative phrase growing out of local usages and pursuits , that , in language , merely serves to mark the distinction , or to betray to an observer the place of residence of one with whom he may be talking . It is chiefly among the more illiterate ,  --  for among the eastern population , want of letters is but comparative ,  --  arnong those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who converse but little , except with those immediately about them , occupied like themselves , that these peculiarities are observable in any very great degree ; and they do not affect the general use of language , but are merely little phrases of comparison , and the like , now and then making their appearance , and not serving as a garnish to every speech and utterance as the caricaturists represent it . In almost every nation , and certainly very conspicuously in the different races that compose the population of Great-Britain , besides what may be considered the current language of the realm , there is a coinage of words , peculiarly their own , among the lower classes of society , adapted to their peculiar wants , customs , and callings , and forming an unwritten variety of the tongue . This , among certain classes , those particularly that hang loose upon society , and whose home is everywhere , any-where , or no-where , becomes more and more distinct ,  --  in fact , a dialect or gibberish of its own kind , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be intelligible only to the initiated , and familiarly made use of , for all sort of nefarious intercourse ; the language , in short , of rogues arid vagabonds ,  --  legitimately , that is , and sometimes extending its ramifications to those who are not particularly members of these two worshipful divisions of the human race . The efforts of some writers , in their zeal for representing all the various siruples that form that motley compound , called by the generic term , man , that is , all the different biped ingredients that constitute society in its various phases , have of late brought some of these idioms into more general - display , under the title of the Language of the Fancy , &amp;c. in the delineation of various characters of blackguards and ruffians . The subject had indeed been treated of before , in a philological point of view , by other writers ; thus Pegge , in his " Anecdotes of the English Language , " mentions the dialect under the classical appellation of " St. Giles 's Greek , " and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossary of it , published , we think , by Cross . Such notices , however , were , by their nature , confined pretty much to that class of scholars , who amuse themselves with researches into points of knowledge , that have little , either of use or beauty to recommend them , but , like flies in amber , excite curiosity only by their strangeness . The modern writers , before alluded to , such as Scott and Bulwer , have , however , brought this dialect into the cognizance of those classes of society , that otherwise might not have been aware of its existence , and , as it were , transplanted the flowers of speech that naturally bloom in the environs of the dunghill and the sewer , to the more agreeable , though perhaps less odoriferous , atmosphere of the // boudoir and drawing-room . We trust that they will never become naturalized there , and can not but wonder at the taste that should ever have sanctioned their introduction merely as curiosities . We have , however , deviated from the current of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar employment of language , whether that of the simple kind first spoken of , the technicalities of crafts and classes , or the cant and slang of the felon and his consorts , is by no means to be considered as making a part of the legitimate language of a nation ; that is , in speaking of it generally , or entitled to a place among its peculiarities . The nautical phraseology of a sailor , is only to be regarded as a part of the language in its application to maritime purposes and subjects ; his transfering of it to objects and occurrences on shore , is the peculiarity of the class to which he belongs , and does not entitle it to be considered among the idioms at large of the country . Such is the case also with the slang of the boatmen on our great western rivers , and their intimates ; it is but the peculiarity of the race , and not deserving of the appellation of an Americanism . It is on the same footing with the slang of the smugglers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when put into the mouths of those to whom it belongs . The only kind of phraseology that can be properly spoken of , or used as designating a real national peculiarity , is that which is used by the people at large , independent of their peculiar pursuits . Making this the ground of distinction ,  --  and it seems the only legitimate one ,  --  the peculiarities of the Yankee dialect will be wonderfully narrowed down . Certain modes of speech we shall , indeed , find not uncommon among the illiterate and unrefined , which serve very well to mark the distinction between them and those more cultivated in mind and of better taste ; but still , very many of these modes of speech belong to the language , and are to be found on both sides of the Atlantic . The great difference between the similar classes in England and this country seems to be , that here the peculiar modes are fewer , and more generally used ; and , therefore , by frequent repetition , more likely to attract the attention of a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than in England , where they are so much more numerous , and vary so much in different counties or districts , and , from the mixture of their inhabitants , are so often presented to the ear in different varieties , that few appear very particularly prominent . This is all easily to be accounted for . The English , as to their origin , are a very heterogeneous race ; Britons , Saxons , Danes , Normans , Jutes , and Angles , established themselves at various times in the island , holdinr , more or less sway , and at times concentrating themselves more particularly in one or two districts of less or greater size , where they gradually settled down , imparting a preyailing provincialism to the language then spoken , not even to this day obliterated . The dialects of the peasantry of Yorkshire and Somersetshire , and so respectively of some of the other counties , if we may trust to the specimens given by Pegge , are almost as much unlike to each other , and to what may be considered the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the Spanish and Portuguese , or the Dutch and German . Now , the early settlers of New-England , in particular , and of the United States generally , came mostly from one or two counties in England , and were of a class by birth , education2 and habits , A* // vated , at the least , considerably above the mere peasantry of the country , and very many of them were scholars and gentlemen , speaking the language in its best form as then used . They established this as the prevailing mode of speech here , and their descendants constitute by far the greater portion of the people , in New-England , at least , certainly , and we think even in all of the states , throwing out the slave population . From some of the more humble of them , certain peculiarities , those of the counties from whence they came , have been propagated and retained , perhaps , increased in some degree , in after times , when a more motley class of emigrants found their way across the Atlantic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , after all , such as these are but few in number , and , excepting some of local origin , legitimate coinages , or borrowings to express new circumstances , for which no established word was to be had , they may be traced back to the native soil of our forefathers . This is the case with the cute , the sleek , or slick , the handsome , the mighty , and almost all similar words employed by Yankees ; two , however , in their ori* , inal garb were zijek and moighty , and so far , have improved in Yankee usage ; cute is genuine Yorkshire , and handsome is only applied more generally , as a term of commendation , than in polished English usage . Such is the case with the most part of the words set down as Yankeeisms , and even many of the phrases , as , the " well , " the " why now , " the " you do n't say so , " the " well said , " the " look here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are all legitimate English , and not only so , but several of them have their *orresponding phrases in French-in good polite French ; witness the Eh bien ! the Voila , the Voici , the Vous ne le ditespas , &amp;c. &amp;c. some of which are used by that mercurial race , even where a Yankee would not think of doing it , as in the Voici des e ; cmples , " in a book of arithmetic , which we well recollect once extorted from a learned friend , a high encomium on the great fitness of the French language , e for matters of science , from its peculiar liveliness and dramatic effect , though we in vain assured him that , in our opinion , the voici , in the above citation , had no more dramatic effect upon the mind of a Frenchman , than rJ7** following are examples " would convey to us in our plain vernacular . All these kinds of things , though they fitly make their appearance at times in representations of common Yankee talk , do not by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the illiterate . One of the most marked peculiarities of the real Yankee , that is , the New-Englander , is in some few instances of the compromise between the disposition to rap out an oath in a moment of excitement , and the check of his conscience telling him it is not right so to do , which compromise is effected by the production of some anomalous exclamation , sufficiently near to an oath to ease the distemperature of the speaker 's mind , and serve as a vent to his passion , of whatever kind it may be , while , at the same time , it avoids the guilt of pronouncing words of holy , sacred , or solemn import . Thus , for instance , we have " I swan " and " I swanny " for I swear ; " Gosh " and " Gorrih " for By G-d ; " tarnation " and " darnation " for damnation ; " Gaul darn you " for G-d d-n you ; with their various compounds , and other like creations of the union of wrath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Igad , ecod , sbuds , sblood , &amp;c. of the English , which are traced back , by their etymologists , to various forms of profane oaths . In justice , however , it should be observed , that , for the most part , these uncouth expressions among us are to be found only in the mouths of school-boys and the decidedly coarse and vulgar . Among what may be considered the features of Yankee phraseology , as exhibited among the commonalty , though for the most fr*quent only with those professedly wags , are various curious similes and metaphors , many of theIn by no means wanting in a kind of dry humor , if rightly understood , and not unfrequently possessing an allusion to scripture as the basis . Thus the comparison , " as hungry as a graven image " is founded upon the apocryphal story of Bel and the Dragon , and is a joke upon the description given by the priests of their idol 's appetite and consumption of provision . So , too , a wag observed of a neighbor who was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a good deal of pig-corn in his garret , and of another who was stupid , that " he would cut up thick under the hat ; " this last is only a figurative version of the English cant expression for stupidity , " fat in the forehead , " and the pig-corn in the garret is certainly as polite an expression as that in use among our trans-atlantic brethren , viz. " that a man has maggots in his brain . " Such kinds of phrases are in fact indigenous to all countries , though more or less local for the most part , originating in some individual whimsicality of expression , amusing those that hear it , and by them repeated in familiar and jocose conversation , till it gains a sort of circulation as a by-word or proverbial phrase . It is no more to be expected that we should have the same.assortment of these as the English have , than that we should have the same household furniture . Different sections of all countries have many different phrases of this kind , while others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some of universal application , by translation or the like , find a home in foreign lands , rising to the dignity of proverbs . It would be an amusing matter to one who had leisure and opportunity for such things , to take the peculiar proverbs , phrases , and words , or what are esteemed such , of one language , and compare them with similar ones in other languages , or in the same language as spoken in different countries having people of the same origin . Many curious resemblances would thus appear , and many things would be traced to origins , and usages now forgotten . A work before cited , that of Pegge , contains many entertaining researches of this kind on English phrases , some of which are used in this country ; and had we a more full collection of such , we doubt not that very many Yankeeisms might be found to be legitimate blaatings of the calves of John Bull@@183068410.txt T is education forms the common mind ; Just as the twig i bent the tree s inclined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the public are generally aware of . We speak not of the miserably poor , of drunkards , intemperate politicians or poei*s ; but of a class which no one who has lived long in any of our large cities can have failed to observe . We allude to the offspring of poor persons ( though many of the children of the rich are equally objects of pity ) between seven and sixteen years of age , the spring of life , during which the twig may be bent any way . Marry of them have no parents , and a great many might better be orphans , than be under the jurisdiction of those they have . Some see no examples at home but of vice ; others are abandoned to their own evil guidance , but by far the greater number are made candidates for the penitentiary by parental indulgence . There are probably some hundreds of these little wretches in Boston . Almost every ward is infested by a gang of them . Most of them sin by impulse , but a few , who consider themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized in bands , and frequent all the purliens of vice , of which the entrance is attainable by the payment of a fee not exceeding twenty-five cents ; that sum being , generally , the extent of the means of each individual . These are they who may be seen in the galleries of the theatres , the minor ones especially , and about the doors , where they squabble for checks ; others sometimes venture to break a window , or dilapidate a watchman . The more vulgar sort are contented with pilfering in a small way , draining the glasses set down by older tipplers , cursing and swearing , abusing every boy better dressed than themselves , throwing stones and filth , Sabbath-breaking , ringing door-bells , and a thousand other enormities . No one , who has lived in a neighborhood cursed with the presence of a swarm of these promising young hopefuls , can deny the truth of the doctrine of innate , original , total depravity . All this little rabble are , no doubt , susceptible of much good , were they taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may use such an expression . Indeed , very many of these unfortunate boys have in them the seeds of extraordinary excellence and usefulness . Those who have the capacity to distinguish themselves in any thing , even in wickedness , must be capable of much good also . Extraordinary malefactors are generally found to be possessed of courage , perseverance , fortitude , ingenuity ; but their minds are like the garden of the sluggard . Early neglected , the rich soil but sends np a luxuriant growth of weeds , which strike their roots so deep , that nothing less than a half inch rope can pull them up , which brings away soil and all . These remarks have been suggested by a visit to the House of Reformation for Juvenile Offenders at South-Boston ,  --  an admirable institution , and admirably conducted . We would advise every one , who feels an interest in the rising generation , to pay it a visit . The ride , or walk , is short and pleasant . Trhe house itself is remarkably neat and quiet ; the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , it is worth a walk of two miles to see so many happy faces as it contains . The writer was told , a few weeks since , that something worth seeiug was to be done at the House of Reform , and was advised to witness // it . He went , not knowing what kind of an exhibition he was to see , and arrived some hours too soon . Immediately after his entrance , a boy of about ten years , neatly dressed in blue jacket and white trowsers , stepped up to the superintendant and asked , " Sir , may I eat a bit of pie that - has just given me ? " The superintendant stated that it had been found necessary to regulate the boys ' diet , and that he had given orders that no one should eat any thing not in the regular bill of fare without his express permission . We asked how such a prohibition could he enforced , and how a violation of it could be detected . He replied that there was seldom need to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobeyed , unless through carelessness ; there was no need to employ means of detection ; because , probably , the offender would voluntarily come forward and confess his fault , as soon as he should become sensible of it . Another boy , who wore a bright steel chain over his shoulder , as a badge of office , was very busy about the room , to every part of which , and to every thing it contained , he had free access . We were afterwards informed that this lad was sent to the house , from the Police Court , for an inveterate habit of pilfering . It seems that he had become a most trustworthy person . We went into the garden , where a score or two of boys were busily at work with hoe and rake , under the direction of the assistant . We were rather surprised to see that when some of them had occasion to communicate , they did so only by signs and gestures . They belonged to one of the lower grades ; and , having abused the gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for a time , that they might do better in future , and at the same time be a warning to others . The lads sat down to dinner  --  a plentiful one-of baked beef , and vegetables of their own raising ; but there were two or three who did not take seats . It seems , that they had violated the regulations in taking food away from the table after the previous meal , which they had wasted . They were therefore deprived of a meal , whether as a punishment , or that they might make good the loss they had occasioned , we know not . But they were not sulky ; on the contrary , they appeared as cheerful as any of those whose molares were in action . In one room a large boy was reading aloud to several smaller ones . He had a badge , and was a monitor . One of his auditors had a bandnge over his eyes , which he did not offer to remove , He had abused the use of his vision in not attending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We learned that the system of privations , practised in the house , is an improvement on the Jewish law of " an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . " If a boy make an improper use of his hands , they are confined ; if his eyes depart from their proper object , they are bandaged . One little culprit struck us more than all the rest . He sat apart , with a visor over his face . He spoke to no one , and no one spoke to him . The disposition and practice of this boy , was " positively , regularly , and continually to do wrong . " It is but justice to the super. - intendant to say , that this lad was a new comer , and that he , as well as the other offenders , belonged to the lowest grades into which the young reformados are divided . // The hour of the exhibition arrived . The writer , together with about two hundred other visiters , repaired to the chapel , a large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . The superintend ant blew a whistle , and a door opened ; tbe superintendant sang a hymn suited to the occasion , and a company of about a hundred boys , right in front , marched in , joining in the hymn as they entered . They were in uniform , and made a much better appearance , marched the lock-step much , much better , than any militia or volunteer company we have yet seen in New-England . As they arrived at the centre of the apartment , they broke off by files to the right and left , and moved to their appointed places , where they halted and remained motionless . Thus brought into something like a solid column , their appearance was finely soldier-like . The exercises then began . Several questions were asked respecting the fundamental principles of arithmetic , chemistry , botany , and moral and natural philosophy , in all of which studies , it appeared , they had made a respectable progress . The boys answered simultaneously . We can not pretend to recollect the precise terms of the questions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What are the ground rules of Arithmetic ? Boys . ( simultaneously . ) **55;759;TOOLONG . Super . What are the terms of Numeration ? Boys . **34;816;TOOLONG of Thousands -- Hundreds of Thousands-Millions , &amp;c . Super . How is Addition performed ? Boys . The numbers to be added are set down , units under units , tens under tens , hundreds under hundreds , &amp;c. &amp;c . The boys answered together , and without hesitation , till they came to compound addition . The first questions were readily answered , until they were asked why they divided the number of pence by twelve and carried the result to the next denomination , when there was first , hesitation , and then a pause . " Can you tell , or you ? " asked the superintendant . There was silence . " Can any of you tell me " Yes , Sir , " replied more than half of them . " Tell me then , " and the correct answer was immediately given . They were also examined on moral and religious subjects , and their answers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no levity , no whispering , no inattention . The boys stood upright in their places , without showing the slightest sign of displeasure or fatigue . It is true , that at proper intervals , they were required to perform certain gymnastic exercises , by way of relief . One was to bend their bodies and stamp in various postures , another to raise their hands simuhaneously to a level with their ears , then to extend them above their heads and clap , then to bring them down to their sides , then to clap them behind their hacks , all of which they did with a unanimity that would have done honor to the Prussian parade at Potsdam , or the Military Academy at West-Point. indeed , some of the spectators laughed at the sin*ularity of their gestures , but it was by no means a laugh of contempt or disapprobation . When the exhibition was half over , the boys were ordered to form and march to the gymnasium , which they did in the same manner as // they had entered the chapel . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other exercises , all of which the boys performed in a style that put the writer in mind of a company of apes in a forest . After having indulged in these severe , sinew-stretching sports for about a quarter of an hour , the lads were again marched into the chapel , and the exhibition was concluded . Previous to breaking up , the Rev. Mr. Tuckerman addressed the school . He congratulated the boys on their situation , which , he told them , they ought to consider an inestimable privilege ; and truly , after what we had seen and heard , we were fully disposed to concur with him in opinion . This visit induced the writer to make two more , and to give some attention to the history and government of the institution . The results of his observations and inquiries follow . This is the first , and we believe the only public institution of the kind in the United States , perhaps in the vorld . There are Houses of Reform , indeed , in some of the more southern cities , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is sustained by the city of Boston . This was opened in Septei* her , 1S*6 , and during the first year about *eventy patients , tainted with moral leprosy , were received . At first , if we are rightly informed , it was intended that the labor of the boys should defray the expense , or a part of it , of which they were the occasion . Tradesmen were introduced into the institution , such as basket-makers , shoe-makers , &amp;c. and the boys were required to work under their superintendance . But the object of the hospital being radical moral cure , these measures were found inadequate to the end proposed . Either the boys received no instruction , or these tradesmen became angry with the depravity and indolence they were expected to overcome , scolded their involuntary apprentices , and some even beat and swore at them . This certainly was not the way to call sinners to repentance . Things were in this state , when a different system of discipline was adopted . Since that time , ( November , 18*27 , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Very few , ( not a fifteenth part of the whole number who have been discharged as cured , ) have relapsed into evil . The boys are and ever have been , since 18*7 , under the sole absolute control of the superintendant . The evil of " too many masters " has been avoided . The extent of their subjection , we might say devotedness , can be conceived by those only who have witnessed it . All that has been done has been effected , not by severity , but by kind , yet firm , moral discipline . Each boy knows that whatever he is commanded to do , he m* st do , and , the necessity being apparent , he does it . He does it , too , though he may not know precisely why , because experience has taught him that whatever is required is for his own good , and agreeable to the laws and will of God as declared in the Christian volume . Here are the three strongest motives to virtuous exertion , that can be imagined ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the best means of preserving order , exact discipline , is rigidly enforced . There are three meals per diem , at stated regular times . Three periods are allowed for play and recreation ,  --  two hours and a quarter in all . Two more divisions of time are allotted to instruction , and two to labor . These rules are only varied as the weather or the season may require . On Sundays , the boys are required to attend // divine worship , at least twice , and hear two discourses , peculiarly adapted to their singular situation . We are wrong here , to use the word required ; the boys esteem it a privilege to enter the chapel , and exclusion from it as a privation ; or , if the reader likes the term better , as a punishment . Whipping was once a form of punishment used in the institution ; now it is scarcely known . It has been found that the system of " privileges and privations " answers all purposes better . Confinement , deprivation of sight , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , of work , and of food , have been substituted in its stead . Emulation has been dispensed with , it having been found that it engenders envy and ill-feeling , to a degree , incompatible with the grand object of the institution , viz , moral reform . The object of emulation is , in some sense , selfish-selfishness must be , as far as possible , rooted out , before a hardened sinner can be brought to address himself steadily to the work of reform . No boy is permitted to tell tales-no boy is punished for a fault not prohibited in express terms by the laws of God or man , and not even for such fault , unless it appears that he knew it to be one . A frank confession exempts an offender from punishment in the first instance . No boy is punished for disrespect or irreverence to his Maker . Thus , if one is inattentive , or displays levity during divine service , his only punishment is exclusion from the chapel , till he gives proof of repentance ; and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is told , " You take no interest in the worship of God ; you have no sympathy with our feelings . You are not fit to share in what we assemble to do , and therefore you shall not be present . " Seldom or never has this course failed to produce amendment . An account is kept with every boy , in which his faults are noted . If , at the end of the week , his conduct proves to have been bad , he is subjected to privations and deprived of privileges , according to the nature and degree of his offences . If his behavior has been extraordinarily evil , which rarely occurs , the boys are called to vote on his case . Their votes are not influenced ; hut he is expelled from the community as unworthy to hold a place in it , and forthwith placed on the footing of an initiate . Excepting the general supervision of the superintendant and his assistant , the government is wholly committed to monitors , who are chosen monthly from among the boys themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and open and shut the doors . Some take charge of the lower grades . A monitor , who is also a steward , takes charge of the marketing . The monitor of police , with assistants , keeps the ' house in order , excepting the dormitory and dining-room . The monitor of the dormitory does the duty his name implies . There are various other officers , whose duties are distinct and distinctly understood , so that " this is your duty , " " this is not my duty , " are never heard within the walls of the house . The result is , that order is never interrupted for a moment . The community is divided into three good and three had grades . The privileges of the first are , to walk without the bounds , sail and swim without an attending monitor , to go to their rooms and into the dining-room without permission , to leave their seats in the assembly // room , and to have the use of the recreation room without permission , each grade to have a preference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted with keys , to be believed on all ordinary occasions , and some other immunities of minor importance . The privations to which the mal-grades are subject , include the want of all the privileges above enumerated , and the lowest two are not allowed to converse , unless on absolutely necessary occasions , to speak to the superintendant without permission , to have regular seats , to be without the jurisdiction of a monitor , unless in bed , to eat cake or any extra food . They are also liable to all the deprivations or punishments elsewhere mentioned , to solitary confinement , to a bread-and-water diet , and to many more tokens of disgrace and disapprobation . These privations and privileges are apportioned properly to the several grades . The following are among the things prohibited : to use bad language , to use tobacco , to disfigure , in any way , any of the furniture , or any part of the fences or buildings , to engage in any sport not specially permitted , to go out of the paths in the garden , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring any thing into the house without permission , to converse with the mal-grades , and to use the clothes of others without permission . The boys are required to do their own washing , cooking , and chamber-work , and to scour the floors and stair-cases once a week . The most scrupulous cleanliness is exacted . Each boy 's hair is cut once a month ; all are required to bathe in salt water thrice a week , weather permitting , and their heads must be combed every day . As these things , and many more , are done by method , the boys find ample time to do them all , and to study , play , and sleep beside . When the initiate first arrives at the House of Reform , his person is cleansed , and he is then examined by the superintendant , respecting his habits , principles , and passions . The object of his coming , and the probation he must undergo before he again goes abroad into the world , are next explained to him . If he comes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Court , he is kept in a solitary apartment for one or more weeks . if he proves obdurate against advice , his eyes are covered , he is not permitted to work , or play , or converse ; he is constantly kept seated under the eye of a monitor , his fare is no better or worse than bread and water ; in short , he must not and can not do any thing but sit still and reflect on his vices , their consequences , and the advice he hears from the superintendant . If he recalcitrates at any part of this course of probation , he is whipped . It is only at this stage of his probation that he is liable to be whipped ; very few novices are so refractory as to need it ; indeed , scourging has for many months been almost unknown in the house . The system of privations has entirely superseded it , having been found much more , and more speedily , effective . The novice is then presented , by name , to the as8ernbled boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a printed copy of the regulations of the house , he is placed in such of the mal-grades as his case may require . By this time he is tractable , obedient , sensible of the error of his ways , and of the necessity of amendment . After this , he is capable of promotion , and subject to precisely the same treatment as the rest of his grade . The course of initiation has never , in any instance , failed to produce the effects we have stated . // The writer asked the superintendant what means he was wont to employ to subdue the refractory and obstinate . He answered that he had been often asked the question before , and that he was at a loss how to answer , as cases of the kind it implies had seldom or never happened . He had known instances of temporary disobedience and disrespect to the monitors , but no such thing had ever happened to himself . We shall give the rest of his answer in his own words , as nearly as we can recollect them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ason will not enlighten it , if it be discreetly urged . I take the boy as I find him , which is always bad enough , and sometimes much worse than you can have any idea of . He is a complete creature of the senses ,  --  amere animal : as suchlmustdeal mith him ; hutlalsotreat him as a moral and immortal being . I tell him , as a friend , that he is in the hands of God ; under his government in all things ; but that he , egardless of this , has become a grievous sinner , degraded , an outcast in the eyes of God and man . I tell him that the pains and privations he suffers are the necessary consequence of sin , and that these pains are inflicted , not in anger , but in love , that he may be admonished to turn from his wickedness and live . I ask him if he does not wish to return to his .1 aker 's favor , and become respected and respectable . He says that he does , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises ; he can not yet perform them if he would ; before he can be trusted he must be put on probation . He has the rough , steep hill of repentance to climb-I help him all I can , and he must exert himself also ; but all is insufficient , without the help of God , whom he must propitiate by penitence and prayer . What he is to ask in the name of his Savior , will be granted , provided it be asked in a proper spirit . He is then put on his probation . If his conduct is satisfactory , his restraints are gradually removed . When his week 's novitiate is ended , he is proposed to the boys as a candidate for a place in their community , and they vote for or against him . If he should relapse , his probation must he commenced anew ; but this very rarely happens . " There is little trouble , cut off as the novices are from all external evil impressions , in bringing them to a proper state of feeling ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes gained for weeks and months , but that little is so much clear gain . Reform is sometimes very slow , but it is always sure . But two or three of the boys , who have been discharged as reformed , have relapsed. rrhe mild system of discipline , for which the city of Boston is indebted to Mr. Wells , has had extensive and blessed results . Hundreds , who have come to the house of Reform , sensual , brutish , ignorant , smeared from head to foot with the mire of vice , stained with every sin of which their years were capable , have gone forth sober , amh ble , intelligent , virtuous . Nothing is more commo* in the House of Reform than instances of integrity and honor , which , in the eyes of the world , would seem romantic . The following is a letter which we take from a newspaper , from a hoy committed for pilfering , voluntarily written to a pel*son he had vronged House of Reformation , Good Friday , 1832 . Mrs.  - -  I suppose you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You did not know exactly who took it // Your son - was going a fishing with me , and he had a book with him . He said that he would sell it to me . I looked at it , and there was the money . I took it out , and told him I would go and get a line , and went off with it . I have felt very sorry for what I have done , and I hope the money enclosed ( five dollars ) will make some amends . I hope that you will forgive me , and I pray to God that he will forgive me also . Your friend , - So far is the discipline of the House of Reform from oppressive , that many boys who have been discharged have voluntarily gone back to seek admittance . All the inmates look happy , and they evidently look up to the superintendant as to a father . The following instance of the reformation of a very hardened sinner may not be unacceptable to the reader A lad was sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of total depravity , if there ever was one . His habits were so notoriously infamous that he went by the name of the " Nuisance of - " in the neighborhood where he resided . His disposition was diabolically malignant ; his temper was singularly turbulent ; he scoffed at all things good and holy ; he was a liar , a thieg a drunkard ; and his ruling passion seemed to be supreme delight in mischief . His habits were written upon his face , in the most legible and revolting characters . There seemed to be nothing in his mind or heart of which the reformer could take hold . It was seen at once that he would cost a great deal of trouble , and it was no less evident that , unless that trouble should be taken , he would soon become a most dangerous member of society . A means of awakening him to a sense of his condition was found . This wretched boy , had yet in his bosom one small spark of affection for his excellent mother , and the discourse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often wasted on him . The right chord was struck ; a powerful impression was made on his heart through this medium . He made rapid progress in virtue , and the effect was manifest even in his person , to such a degree , that one who had known him well , did not recognize him , a mouth after he entered the house . This youth had , naturally , a strong mind . He had been eminent in evil , but when his heart was once touched , it was seen that he was likely to be as eminent for good . He watched his outrageous passions with a careful eye , and held them in command with a tight rein . He even voluntarily put himself in bodily pain to remind him of the necessity of keeping them in constant check . His mind was inaccessible to ordinary motives and reasons ,  --  it heeded them not . What awakened him to exertion was the cultivation of the seed sown by his mother . lie had learned to pray , and prayed with his whole heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that no means of reform used at the house have proved so immediately and generally e c*cious as this . The youth was several times appointed to the highest offices in the institution , and behaved unexceptionably in them all . He was and is decidedly and emphatically a refers ed boy . He has long been apprenticed , *nd has shown no sign of a return LO his former habits . This is the only thoroughly reformed drunkard we have ever known or heard of . He is now doing well and likely to do so . The majority of the lads , who have been resc ed from inevitable ruin by the House of eform , were the victims of parental indulgence . The only son of a poor widow was commtted for theft . He had been // the idol of his mother , her whole being was bound up in him , and this very love was nigh having been fatal to the boy . Never was affection more intense ; she lived for him and him alone ; she lived but in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His committal wrung her heart.strings to the extent of their power of tension ; she remained wholly desolate . She exhibited a most melancholy picture of distress . She did not complain ; on the contrary she was convinced of the necessity of what had been done , but the blow was too hard for her . She did not weep , but her hearth remained as cold as the weather without ; her furniture was strewed about her house ; her clothes , the last thing a woman ever neglects , were not as clean or as neatly worn as before ; - what had made these things valuable to her was gone , and life had for her lost its salt and its savor . The shaft had entered her very soul . Hearing of her extreme distress , Mr. Wells visited and invited her to pass a week with her son in the house . This indulgent kindness revived her , for her spirit was that which said , 0 do but let me breathe that air , That blessed air , that s breathed by thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , t is sweet to me . The boy himself , was of the make most likely to be injured by such conduct . His character was ordinary , or rather , he had no character at all . There was nothing in him decisive ; neither virtue nor vice could take deep root in him . His faults were rather follies than vices ; in short , he was the mere creature of circumstances , and it was fortunate for him that he was snatched from his perilous situation in time . He went through the course of reformation tolerably , was apprenticed , and is now doing well.
