txt The author of this pamphlet , who is a member of the Corporation of Harvard College , has undertaken to defend that institution against certain charges which have lately been made upon it in the newspapers . The work is written with great ability , candor , and vivacity , and has been , we believe , very generally satisfactory to unprejudiced readers . OU the charges alluded to , the most important is that of sectarianism in religion ; and the reply to it occupies a pretty large portion of Mr. Gray 's pages . We can not , however , follow him in this ( discussion , which is too closely connected with the theological controversies of the day , to suit the purposes of this journal . The two points , to which we shall chiefly direct our attention , are the economy of the college , and the state of its library . The Corporation , it seems , have been accused , on the one hand , of excessive prudence in the husbandry of their resources , and on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augmentation of the library . These charges are not , on the face of them , very plausible , nor even very consistent with each other ; and if the enemies of the college can find nothing worse to against it , its friends public have , perhaps , allege and the reason to suppose that its concerns are pretty well managed . It is the singular and peculiar fortune of Cambridge College to he connected with the earliest history of the country , and identified with the progress of its liberties . Its influence was national ; pervading not New England only , but all the Colonies ; co-extensive with the firm maintenance of piety and the general regard for the interests of science . It may he questioned , whether it was not an important element in the formation of the character , which terminated in the struggle for independence . Other institutions may , perhaps , come to be more munificently endowed , more numerously attended : but none can ever rival it in the crowd of grateful and deeply interesting associations which belong to Harvard College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its age , almost coeval with the landing of the Fathers . // The whole country has a continued interest in the permanent success of an institution , which was commenced under such auspices . We may all claim that it should be administered in a spirit of just liberality , that its benefits should be dispassionately distributed , that its principles should be elevated above the control of political factions or religious parties , and that its steady advancement should be promoted in proportion to the rapid increase of our national wealth , population , moral influences and responsibilities . And we hold it to be a self-evident maxim , that all this can not be accomplished without the exercise of a vigilant economy . Where there is no spirit of thrift , generosity is sure to defeat itself ; and an inconsiderate enthusiasm works its own ruin , however pure and exalted may be its purposes . It is a beautiful fable , which tells us of the bird that freely strikes wounds into its breast for the nurture of its brood ; and , we doubt not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her child . But our alma . Maler is in the custody of her sons ; and their piety would surely never allow her to languish from the thoughtless excesses of her liberality . Dollars and cents are , after all , the main instrument of efficient action ; and thrift is the main support of temporal prosperity . Without thrift , private charity would run rapidly to the condition of the unavailing exercise of a barren good will ; and there could be no large expenditures for public charities , no munificent endowment of the sciences , no careful and sufficient provision for the infirm , the aged , and the insane ; no continued and untiring appropriations for the diffusion of religion . it is the thrift of New England , which has enabled her thus far , in proportion to her numbers and resources , to contribute to public uses more than any portion of the world ; to contribute voluntarily and steadily ; to contribute cheerfully and lavishly ; and yet to retain her energies unimpaired , or rather to find them refreshed and invigorated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good has sprung from our barren soil . It was in our Eastern sky , that the star of missionary enterprise first arose ; it was here , that the universal establishment of common schools was wisely designed and most happily executed ; and it is here , that new associations are perpetually forming for diffusing the blessings of civilization and the influence of religion . We can not perceive why the same duty of economy is not von . xxxiii. - No. 72. 28 // binding upon those , who are the organs for administering the funds , that are devoted to the public exigencies . The ' general advantage seems rather specially to require the wise and discreet administration of its resources . A lavish expenditure would rapidly impoverish . It forces an individual to humiliating condescensions or downright rneannesses , and , by the operation of corresponding causes , it brings public irrstitutiQns to a pinching piirsimony , or ,  --  and we have had an example in America ,  --  to a declared and hopeless bankruptcy . Tf*e unrestrained expenditure which we condemn , is twice aceursed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deters the benevolent from intrusting their contrihutions to hands which will scatter their munificence . A wise economy , on the contrary , tempts to co-operation . Men readily assist , where a little only is required for the accomplishment of a great purpose ; and thus the governors of a public institution ' are enabled to foster and sustain every important interest intrusted to their watchfulness , to provide for unforeseen contingencies , to prepare resources against the wastes and the hazards of time . All their movements are marked by freedorii and cheerfulness . Under such an administration , the prospect is constantly enlivened by the consciousness of present success and increasing improvement . There is no sinking of the heart before the darkening scowl of anticipated want . We do not advocate that narrow saving , which chills the expanding efforts at improvement ; and , like a season of drought , destroying excellence in the germ , prevents the developement of that , which , in the issue , would itself have been productive . Such saving is not economy , but a wasteful timidity , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wise husbandry of resources , a perpetual vigilance , admitting neither want nor waste ; a constant reference to the enlarging circumstances of the country ; and a resolute determination to transmit the College to the next generation in as good a situation as its present one , and , if possible , in a situation somewhat better , not abstractly only , but relatively , not merely in the aggregate of its endowments and its fixtures , but in reference to the multiplied resources and demands of the country . A. sinking fund is a common idea when a nation is in debt . There must be at the College an accumulating fund , or , otherwise , the rapid progress of the rest of the nation will leave Cambridge largely in arrears . The income of that accurnu // kiting fund might then be invested , and the annual proceeds of it appropriated to contingent expenses . In this way the College would , as it were , make to itself out of its own revenues a new donation annually , and as the Corporation lives forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it would eventually be placed on a basis suited to the dignity of the State , and the demands of the community . There is no danger , that the College will have too much money to appropriate , unless it is led astray to found scholarships and set a bounty on literary indolence . Heaven preserve us from such a consummation ! But there will forever remain modes of appropriation consistent with the necessity of personal exerlions , and directly beneficial to the sciences . Centuries and centuries will roll away , and the task of perfectly organizing a University with all its appropriate fixture.s will remain incomplete . There will be enough to do , before its observatories will rightly spell Of every star that Heaven doth show ; before its garden will contain every flower that sips the dews of our northern climate , and its green-house hold specimens of all the splendid herbs of the tropics ; before its cabinet will have gathered from every sea-shore , and along mountain and every mine . What need of many idle words ? The works of God are infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable inquisitive minds , each in its selected branch , to learn all that Heaven has condescended to reveal , all that the powers of man permit him to acquire , all that the accumulated intelligence of previous generations has discovered , all that the keen eye of science has brought to light in any part of our globe . If the system pursued in the government of the College should steadily aim at enlarging the usefulness of the Institution , and at rendering it the great University , or one of the great Universities of the country , we venture to predict , that the other points in dispute will give rise only to transient disaffection . The increasing concentration of the sources of intelligence will confirm public confidence and claim public respect . The curious and the ambitious will necessarily throng , where there is the greatest union of abili // ties and the means of culture* It may , in this connexion and with due reverence be affirmed , that where the carcass is , thither will the young eagles gather . Shall the Corporation , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a University , is of all fixtures the most essential ? On this subject , we quote from Mr. Gray 's pamphlet , a passage in which the question is fairly stated , and the true doctrine clearly and ably enforced . I have just now mentioned buying books as one fit mode of spending the College funds . There is nothing , which has been more complained of , than our appropriating so much money to the Library . There is nothing , which I am more ready to defend . The Library , great as it is , is still deficient , very deficient in every department . Few of the Professors , I believe , can find in it the books necessary to enable them to perform their duties to the College . It has been stated , that till within three or four years , nothing has been appropriated to the Library from the general funds of the College , since the American Revolution . When , therefore , we are asked , " why spend the enormous sum of five thousand dollars in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I ask , in turn , why not rather twenty thousand ? The only answer I can give to my own question , is , that I thought five thousand the most we could appropriate to that object , with a due regard to all the other interests of the Institution . If the books bought are all good books , selected so as to be best adapted to our present and most pressing wants , highly and permanently useful , and cheap in proportion to their real value , I can hardly find any other limit than our means , to my willingness to buy them . ' But it has been gravely and repeatedly said , " what need of more books ? You have more books now than any body wants to read . " - That is true ; but not more than every body wants to read , or to consult , or to refer to . - A man does not go into a Library to read the volumes in order , as they stand on the shelves , or to count them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have ever been written upon the subject , on which his mind is then engaged . To find exactly what he wants , exactly when he wants it , may save him the labor of a life , or make that life a blessing to mankind . Give to Dr. Bowditch thirty thousand volumes , and it would not compensate him or the public for the loss to him of his one La Place . In a country , where any value is attached to science or to letters , there ought to be at least one great library containing the means of excitement and improvement for talents of every kind , food for all tastes , weapons for every hand ; and // wherever that Library shall be , there will be the centre of instruction for the whole country ; there will be the great establishment for education . Moreover , nothing will tend so effectually to build up such an establishment and attract to it efficient teachers as a Library equal to their wants ; and we must not be content to have only books , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the common reach . Let me suppose , or rather let me state , for I believe it is a fact , that a most accomplished Professor wishes a particular edition of a book , which is not to be found in the country , and desires us to send for it , to enable him to explain to his pupils more fully the meaning of the author he is required to teach them , the charm of his sentiments , and the graces of his style . It is one of those classic writers , who have been regarded for more than two thousand years with admiration and delight by every man of cultivated intellect and refined taste ; who have been his teachers in youth , his models perhaps in manhood , and , his comforters in age , his companions at home , his guides abroad , shedding light on every path , and breathing consolation in every sorrow . Will it be a sufficient answer to tell him , that though we have not the book he wants , we have a great many that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bid him study them ? If the only use , of books were to teach us our letters , the argument would be a good one . Any book would do for that . But it can not be listened to for a moment by any one , who ever entered a library for the purpose of instruction to himself or of benefit to others . ' The propriety of increasing the College Library is here placed upon its right basis . What is the object to be held in view in administering the College ? The old fashioned mode of training young persons was doubtless a very commendable one . We approve highly of digging , construing , and parsing ; ' especially of digging , ' since nothing strengthens the mind like diligent exertion . But is this all ? If it be , then it is quite useless to make great foundations of any kind ; a grammar , a dictionary , and a Latin or Grcek book or two , are all the instruments requisite for the very laudable purposes just mentioned . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attain to that variety of information , which alone can lead to enlarged and comprehensive views , if the professors are themselves to rise above the mechanical portion of their occupations , and to advance the sciences which the*jr profess , if the mass of learning , which centuries have develope // books and dictionaries may be required . Immense literary resources are not requisite for success in drilling ; and a great library is demanded only for an institution , which aims at the accomplishment of higher purposes . The governors of the College , therefore , in determining to increase the collection of books , have given an earnest of their views respecting the obligations incumbent upon them . They have decided wisely , with a just reference to the condition and rapid progress of the country , to the honor of New England , more especially to the honor of our Commonwealth and its capital , to the best interests of intelligence , to the responsibilities resulting from the accumulated respect , which nearly two centuries of usefulness have conciliated for Harvard . The character of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in appropriating to our use whatever of excellence has elsewhere been produced . The stranger is welcomed to our shores , from whatever portion of the world he may come ; the rights of citizenship are made common to any , who will reside in the midst of us . It is the prerogative of those , who are distinguished by liberal culture , to rise in an eminent degree above the restrictions of prejudice . Let us , then , make a home in our public seminaries for whatever excellence the world may produce ; and receive into our depositories whatever contrihutions may be offered to the general stock of human knowledge throughout the world . If the existence of a separate class of men , as instructers , he requisite to render the foundation of libraries desirable , then we may say , that our country eminently demands them . Where will you find so many devoted to the interests of the rising generation ? Our numerous colleges are well provided with instructers ; schools and academies are scattered broad-cast over the land . The literary class , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acquiring instruction for the sake of imparting it to the young , is with us , relatively , quite as numerous as in any part of the world ; and if we count all the brotherhood of reviewers , and all the choir of editors , and the long list of those who have been editors , and the few writers of hooks , and the more numerous contributors to Souvenirs and magazines , we shall find that these United States count their thousands of writers . The sixty millions who speak the German language are said to have about ten thousand authors ; our twelve or thirteen millions have more than a fifth part of that number . As we // love good sense , as we abhor ignorance , let us give them books . Let them have an opportunity of becoming learned . Let there be one place at least , and many more if possible , where the tone of accurate knowledge is firm and elevated ; and since the press is the great moral power of our country , let us have a press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet exact and profound . No objection to the establishment of large libraries can be found in the want of a class of men who should use them . To the professor , books are essential for the attainment of excellence . It would be as idle to require of him the most finished scholarship in any department , without offering access to a large library , as to require of a mechanic the construction of some piece of nicest workmanship without the employment of the appropriate instruments . The very idea of erudition implies the existence of vast collections ; and high attainments can not reasonably be expected of the teacher , when the means for making those attainments are not within his reach . If we try by this standard the present Library at Cambridge , we shall find it doubtless to be a respectable one ; yet rather as exciting good hopes , than as realizing them . In many departments it is not yet even tolerable . Its catalogue of books on civil law , for example , makes but a sorry figure ; and in modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency is appalling . It would be impossible to verify or correct , by means of it , the history of any nation of the European continent . A fine library will naturally attract men of good abilities and of a fondness for intellectual researches . As surely as the bees in spring will find their way to the largest flower-gardens , so surely will there be busy inquirers where the materials are abundant . And this is one of the chief hindrances at present to the rapid progress of American literature , the want of a point of union , a common arena , where accomplished minds are justled in close proximity . It is quite as evident , that the vicinity of a large collection of books will tend to develope the talents of those who have access to them . The passion for acquisition may display itself as well in nursing a restless craving after accumulated knowledge , as in any way . The fondness for distinction will naturally rouse to exertion , and public expectations are wont to rise , in proportion to the opportunities , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one circumstance , which merits consideration , as illustrating the claims of the Library to public favor , that it is equally open to all . The poor and the rich may equally lounge in its alcoves ; and the orthodox and the heretic , Christian and Pagan , Jew and Gentile , the defender of Babylon and the advocate of prelacy , may each resort to it for instruction and reproof . There can be no favoritism there ; and he that brings the strongest mind and most diligent industry , will be sure to meet with the best welcome . For the ensuring of success in the establishment of a great library , large appropriations are needed . From what quarter shall they come ? The Corporation has appropriated five thou sand dollars annually . This is doing well according to their means ; but it is not enough . A fire-proof building , somewhat remote from other buildings , is required . Besides , the sum we have mentioned is but just enough to keep up with the age ; a great many works of former ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when determined on making Berlin a central point for science and letters , deemed thirty thousand rix dollars a year not too large an appropriation ; be made , also , occasional grants for specific purposes . Our Republic stands in need of as great foundations for general culture as the Prussian monarchy , and Boston is a place of more wealth and of more business than Berlin . Who shall aid the Corporation in their efforts ? We answer , those that are able . Every body knows , that the student in his retirement has little to do with finances ; the streams of Pactolus have not their sources in the classic regions of contemplative employment . The soil of Parnassus is barren , though its air is pure , ' is a true remark of an English physician . It is not , then , from the literary class , as such , that large contributions are to be expected . Go into the streets , and karn who are the men , that control the sources of all the prosperity , with which our country rings from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron , the traders to the Indies , the skilful managers of factories , the prudent masters of monied companies , then it is of them that the country invites , requests , demands a fostering care for the endowment of those fixtures , which are essential to the best interests of knowledge . But it may be said by those , whose industry has borne away the richest prizes , cui bono , how does all this tend to our advantage ? Are we to contribute to purchase books , which we are never to read ? // To be sure you are , is our reply . It is perfectly reasonable to expect that you will assist in buying a large collection of books , though it would be most unreasonable to ask of you to read them . You buy lands which you do not till ; yet the culture of them turns to your profit . You own ships , which you send to the utmost limits of the sea ,  --  you do not navigate them in person , and yet the returns are for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfers of property ; but it is not necessary for every one to labor in the mines . The man of letters extracts the gold , puts upon it a stamp , and makes it current coin ; do not in your pride think meanly of the laborers in the mines or the servants of the mint . Take the benefit of the general mass of information circulating in society ; but remember that old notions , like old coins , lose part of their currency , and require to be stamped anew , if they are to pass freely in the busy world . We repeat , then , you must buy the books , but there your duty ends ; you are not obliged to read them . There are in society men , whose duty it becomes , in conformity with the right .. flil subdivision of labor , to read them for your benefit , so soon as the means are offered . It is necessary , for example , that there should be a large medical library ; and it is important to the community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , professional men , acquainted with all that has been observed respecting every disease and form of physical evil , to which inherent weakness , or civilization , or virtue , or vice , has exposed poor human nature . But God forbid , that every individual , not of the profession , should store his mind with all the details of men 's infirmities , should crowd his imagination with the disgusting images of loathsome illness , should load his memory with all the vile circumstances of a lazar-house , should be aware of all the intensity of excruciating tortures , which the surgeon relieves , or should know all the frantic creations and saddening tricks of insanity , as exhibited within the gloomy walls of a mad-house . It is essential to the common happiness that all these things should be known , and the memory of them carefully treasured up ; but it is fortunately not every man s duty to hoard such melancholy facts . Apply the same mode of reasoning to the study of Latin and Greek . How often have we seen men contumeliously sneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his diligent investigation of difficult points in grammar , and treat VOL. xxxfll. - No. 72. 29 // his labors as insignificant and valueless . Be it so . We will not argue that point . Undoubtedly much of the minute toil , requisite to the formation of a good scholar , is mere drudgery yet , as times and manners are , the habits of cqltivated nations and the approved modes of education , it is on any view requisite and desirable , that all the results of philological researci ) should be possessed by living men . And hence the necessity of an immense critical apparatus , which the opulent xviii seldom consult , though they must coItribute to its 1 ) urchase . We might multiply illustrations . What branch of knowledge is more inteiestin* than that wich records the fortunes of the human race ? Yet to make history valuable , there must be for the inquirer ready access to the sources , and abundant opportunity offered for verifying the details . Most of us read not more than one history of Rome . What confusion of ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , in a community where there was no erudition ? The opportunity for research is the best safeguard against incredulity ; and we shall take things quite enough on trust , even if we have the materials of re-production within our reach . But is there to be no end to this 1 ) urchase of books ? Oh yes ,  --  and let us see bat it is . When the public library has redeemed from time all the valuable intellectual bequests of former ages , when it has garnered up all that preceding generations had amassed as a sacred and im1 ) erishable inheritance , there will then remain no duty , but to collect what the age produces . And when literary ambition shall cease to be excited ; when genius is no longer bestowed by the munificence of Heaven ; when industry no longer collects new facts respecting man or nature ; wt ) en the forming hand ceases to re-pioduce ; when the streams of human intellect no longer flow ; when the sprin0s of intelli0ence and thought are all dried up ; when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethaigy , then it will be time to give over buying books ; and then , too , there will be no need of a university at Cambridge , and no functions for a college corporation . In fine , we think that the present movement in favor of the Library , on the part of the governors of Harvard , is not to be attributed to the transient impulse of a magnificent , ephemeral enthusiasm ; but is rather the result of a right understanding of their duty , is approved by the deliberate judgment of the community , and is in strict accordance with the public requisitions and wants.
