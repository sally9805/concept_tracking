txt Monday . Had just finished my breakfast , when Mr. John Jones called at my dwelling , to beg I would use my influence with our board , to prevent a note of his from being thrown out . Mr. Jones pleaded very hard-said his credit would be ruined if this note were not discounted . He proved to me very satisfactorily that he owns twice as much as he owes , and is only pressed for a little ready money . Assured Mr. Jones that I would do all in my power to serve him . When the hoard met , and Mr. Jones 's note came under consideration , I mentioned that I had great respect for the offerer , who was one of my most particular friends , and one for whom I would go all lengths that I could , with propriety , to serve . But , as a member of a directory to which the little property of orphans and widows was intrusted , I felt it my duty to state that I had undoubted information that my friend 's credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did not doubt , however , but he would ultimately pay every body , and have something handsome left ; and as he had usually a very large deposite in our bank , I hoped the board would take this into consideration , and not suffer the credit of so meritorious a merchant to sink for want of a little timely assistance . Mr. Snatchpenny , chairman of the discount committee , said that , as I was a particular friend of Mr. Jones 's , I would probably be willing to guarantee the bank from loss . Astonished at such a proposition , and frankly told Snatchpenny as much . Friendship is one thing-business another . Sorry to say that , notwithstanding all my endeavors , the board threw out Jones 's note . However , we had no sooner adjourned , than I went to the first teller , and took up the amount on a memorandum check of my own . // As I passed out of the bank door , found Jones waiting on the steps in great anxiety . Told him of my bad luck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was near sinking to the earth . Did all I could to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted . ile spoke of his wife and children , and of the loss of all his earnings and savings , the result of many years of toil and trouble . Could not bear to see him so distressed , and therefore told him that , though exceedingly pressed for money myself , I would speak in his behalf to a friend of mine , who occasionally had money to lend , and he must make the best bargain with him he could . Referred him accordingly to Mr. Sharpsucker , my private broker , taking care to have first an interview with Sharpsucker to be sure that my benevolent intentions should not be frustrated . In the afternoon met Jones , and found him very grateful . Was sorry to learn from him , however , that Sharpsucker had himself to borrow the money , and therefore could not let him have it at less Than three per cent . a month . But this , as Jones himself says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . I have done a good day 's work . I have done my duty to the bank , to myself and family , and to my friend . Tuesday . Nothing particular at the Exchange or at the bank today ; but in the evening there was a social little party of one or two hundred friends at my mansion . Among them there was our beloved pastor , the Rev. Dr. McThwackem , with whom I had a most interesting conversation . As the Doctor was once Professor in a Unb versity , and as he is as distinguished for his erudition as he is for his piety , I took occasion to ask him the exact meaning of the word specie , and was pleased to learn from him that the popular use of the word is entirely unauthorized by any classical authorities . The true word , the Reverend Doctor says , is species , which , in a secondary sense , is equivalent to the vernacular sorts . As language deteriorated , men began to speak of species of coin , as philosophers sometimes spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers meant by species of things , the vulgar herd misapplied the term , and further corrupted speech by an ellipsis " of coin , " and dropping the ' final s in " species . " To a man of true classical taste , the Reverend Doctor said , nothing could be more offensive than a word thus extruncated and misapplied , and in this I perfectly agree with him . " Species , " and consequently " specie , " has its root in a Latin word which ( the Doctor says , ) signifies to see , and therefore species , specie , and specious , correspond very nearly , in their primitive acceptation , with idea and ideal , the two latter being derived ( the Doctor says , ) from a Greek word which has the same signification as the Latin radical of species . The original application which philosophers made of these terms , was strikingly indicative of their affinity of meaning ; species being , in the science // of logic , a special idea , and sometimes denoting mere appearance to the senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor is decidedly of opinion that , for purity of language , with which purity of morals is closely connected , it is necessary to restore the primitive sense of the word specie , if not the primitive spelling . All analogy is shocked by the vulgar use of this dissyllable ; the true meaning of which is , however , still retained in its cognates specious and speciously . Nothing could be more lucid than the reverend gentleman 's illustrations ; and his arguments were perfectly conclusive . This encouraged me to ask him the true meaning of the word bullion . He said it was a downright vulgarism which few scholars thought worthy of any attention . The French word billon , a kind of base metal or base coin , was evidently related to it ; but it was altogether too base a word to have an etymon in respectable Greek or Latin . Its root , if it be found anywhere , was , perhaps , to be found in bulla , a word of the corrupt Latin of the middle ages , * which word might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bubble being literally a little hollow ball . " Recollecting , " continued the Reverend Doctor , " the connection there is between bullion and the bulls of the Roman see , I never hear the word mentioned without experiencing the most painful emotions . The Popish edicts take their name of bulls from a little bail of gold attached to each , called bulle in monkish Latin . Hence the English word bullion . The bare sound makes me tremble , for it immediately causes my mind to revert to the little balls of gold attached to the Popish bulls , thence to the contents of those bulls , and thence to the horrible designs many entertain of subverting our Protestant liberties by bringing in the Pope , and it may be the Pretender also . " Well may you tremble , roy beloved pastor . The evident intention of the hard-money men is to bring us back to the condition of the dark ages . Wednesday . I was early at bank this morning , for this is the day for preparing our annual return to the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver coin in vaults of too small an amount to be mentioned except to particular friends . Asked cashier if he could not borrow from other banks for the day , to be paid back to-morrow . Said he had already borrowed as much as he could from every bank and broker for five miles round , and that to get what he had got , he had been obliged to promise to pay back to-day instead of to-morrow , and also to lend every pistareen he had to three several banks in succession , before three o'clock this afternoon . How very embarrassing these returns to the Legis * It is with great diffidence we venture to dissent from so high an authority as Dr. McThwackem , but we must be permitted to observe that the word buZZa is used by Virgil , and other writers of the Augustan age . // lature sometimes prove ! I wished to know if the difficulty could not be got over in the old and approved way of putting specie and specie funds together , and including bills of exchange among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much money on various memoranda purporting to be promises to pay on demand , that the bank had not been able , during the last six months , to purchase a single real bill of exchange . One of the board suggested that the notes of other banks on hand , and sums due from other banks , being as good as specie , might be put down as specie . Cashier said if he took too much from these accounts , the return , though it would look very fair in the eyes of the Legislature , might excite suspicion in the minds of " great financiers ' * in other banking institutions . Besides this , as a conscientious man , he should not like to swear to such an account . Mentioned to cashier my conversation of last evening with his beloved pastor and mine . The whole board loud in their praise of the Rev. Dr. McThwackem 's piety and patriotism ; but cashier , though perfectly satisfied that there is a Popish plot at the bottom of the schemes of the hard-money men , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie . Said , however , that if he could be convinced that specie meant much the same as specious and speciously , he could make out a very fair account , for then he could include the memorandum checks of the directors among the specie . Sent for Webster 's large dictionary , and read to cashier the following explanations of the word , omitting the first , second , fourth , eighth , ninth , and tenth meanings , they not being essential : " SPEcIEs L. from specio , to see . I " 3 . In logic , a special idea , corresponding to the specific distinction of things in nature . " " 5 . Appearance to the senses ; visible or sensible representation . " 6 . Representation to the mind . " 7 . Show ; visible exhibition . " Cashier perfectly satisfied , except as to whether species and specie were not different words ; therefore read to him a part of what Webster says under the eighth head , namely , *In modern practice this word is contracted into specie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says he shall never more have any difficulty in making up his annual returns . Memorandum checks are the real specie ; for , if they are not " a special idea , " they are certainly " an appearance to the senses ,  --  a visible or sensible representation  --  a representation to the mind  --  a show  --  a visible exhibition " - of sorn*ething . Mr. Snatchpenny proposed that , to make the specie in our bank a round half million , we should each take up an additional amount on memorandum checks , allowing the cashier to share equally with the directors . Nothing could be fairer , and the conscientious scm // pies of the cashier being entirely removed , he went immediately before a magistrate and made oath to the return , agreeably to the provisions of our charter . Thursday . My son Jack , who has just come from college , put into my hands the Democratic Review for May . Was highly gratified with the autobiography of my most worthy friend , Ferret Snapp Newcraft , Esq . Mr. Newcraft hardly does him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will publish fuller reminiscences of his life and times , for the benefit of his children , and of mine . It is true , he was not quite free from faults ; and I always thought that , as he himself says , " the distinction between making a great speculation and taking in ' a fellow creature , was never precisely clear to his mind . " Thanks to McThwackem 's excellent instructions , I can perceive distinctions where Neweraft never could . McThwackem splits hairs with so much dexterity , that they never break off in the middle . The worthy Doctor called on rae this morning to consult about some affairs of the *#******** Society , of the hoard of managers of which we are both members ; and also to aid in completing the plans of some land , rail road , and other speculations in which we are jointly interested . In the pulpit and out of it he is equally instructive . We talked at large of our banking system , which we , as moral and religious men , agreed required reform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effected ? A reform must be either sudden or gradual . A sudden reform of the system every man of sense must admit to be impracticable ; and as for a gradual reform , that will produce more evil than the system itself occasions . A German philosopher admirably illustrates the effects of gradual reform , hy a story of his dog and his servant . He directed the servant to cut off just so much of the dog 's tail as the fashion of the times required , and then returned to his studies , " de omnibus entibus et quibusdam aiiis , " in full expectation that the dog would , in a few days , be in a fit trim to accompany a philosophical dandy whenever , he felt inclined to be of the Peripatetic school . But day after ( lay elapsed , and the dog was not forthcoming , and every day the philosopher was disturbed by the wailings of his favorite . At length he inquired into the cause , and found that his servant , supposing that the dog could not bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had endeavored to make the operation as easy as he could for the poor animal , by clipping off a little piece every morn-ing ! No*v , continued McThwackem , the application of this story is obvious . Brother Jonathan is a " sad dog " if not a " spry dog . " The banking system is his tail , and about nothing else is he so sensitive , because he is fully conscious that it is not such a tail as a good looking dog ought to have . He is willing , and even desirous , // that it *hotild be clipped , but then it must be only a little piece every day . It is evident that before half the necessary clippings can be made , Brother Jonathan will become restive ; and as half reform is worse than no reform , let us have no reform at all . I do like McThwackem , I only wish he would drop the ugly prefix to his name , and become a native . Friday . Great outcry among the merchants , because our bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of the directors and a few others monopolizing the funds of public institutions for their private speculations . Of all stations in society it appears to me that that of director of a bank is the most thankless . The officers of Government are all paid for their services , and the officers of banks , presidents and cashiers excepted , are not paid . Even the small emoluments we get in an indirect way seem to be grudged to us , though these have never , in my own case at least , amounted to more than fifty thousand dollars in any one year . Yes , these little gains excite envy , and this at a time when we are doing all in our power to make dollars as plenty as black-berries , and when the country would , without our operations , be in as desolate and dreadful a condition as Spain or Barbary . The merchants and the rest of the community have , indeed* abundant cause of complaint , but then it is of the government , not of the banks . If the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make money so plenty that there would be not only enough to promote our own speculations , but also to grant the merchants the facilities they require . What I mean by government ceasing to make war on the banks , is , that government should redeem our bank notes by giving land in exchange for them , regard our promises to pay as equivalent , in all cases , to actual payment , and let us have the use of all its funds free of interest . So long as Government refuses to come into these measures , it must be regarded as standing in a hostile attitude towards the banks : therefore making war upon them . Some of our friends are decidedly of opinion that Government ought to levy a direct tax on the people for the benefit of the banks . I have no particular objection to this , but it seems to me that redeeming our issues by giving public lands for them , and receiving them for duties , *viI1 amount to much the same thing . This the government must do and shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country are no longer to be borne with . I do not go as far as some , and say that if there were no bank notes there would be no money , but this I will say , if there were no banks there would be no paper money , and we have the authority of a former committee of the United States Senate for declaring that bank notes are better than gold and silver . Neither do I agree with those who think that if there were no banks there would be no credit , but I firmly believe that // many men who now have a most extensive credit , would not then be trusted for a shilling . If there were no banks , commerce would be a humdrum affair , whereas it is now almost as exciting as a game at rouge et noir , and almost as uncertain . If there were no banks every man would have to be content with his own earnings , and there would be no capital to the Corinthian column of society ; or rather , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Done shaft . If there were no banks there would be no means of acquiring even a competency , except by labor , agricultural , mechanical , mercantile , or professional , all slow and hard ways of becoming rich . Banking affords a quick and easy road to wealth ,  --  if not to the whole nation at least to a part of it . By its means I have myself , besides living tolerably like a gentleman , acquired ' a snug little fortune of two hundred thousand dollars in the short space of ten years , and I am morally certain that if I had been obliged to work for it I never should have been worth the onehalf part of that many cents . Saturday . I happened once to be present when an old and experienced bank cashier dropped the remark that he had known the rejection of a single note to sink the price of flour in one of our principal markets , simply because it compelled the offerer of the note to sacrifice his merchandize to save his credit . I treasured up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a combination with a number of friends to depress the price of certain articles by refusing to the holders of them all kind of facilities , and pressing on them for the prompt discharge of their obligations . As the scheme was an extensive one , requiring a number of persons to carry it on , and profound secresy to bring it to a successful issue , it was several times in danger of miscarrying . But our power was so great , and the necessities of the merchants who held the articles were somehow so urgent , that we bought them all up pretty much at our own price . We have now only to increase our issues , and we shall be able to sell these articles at such rates as we may choose to ask . In that case my two hundred thousand dollars will become four hundred thousand . I prefer going on in this snug way to dashing out as Neweraft did . He always appeared to me to go ahead too fast . At a special meeting of our board , held to-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelt at great length on some very plain truths , such , for example , as that gold and silver in the vaults of a bank are a dead weight to a bank , and of no use to the community-that there is continual risk of the metals being stolen-that memorandum checks are the real specie , &amp;c. , &amp;c. ; and finally wound up with a proposal to rid the bank of the gold and silver with which it was encumbered , by giving his own memorandum checks for it . O'Squeezem is all for self . Now , if there is any one vice I do dis // like , it is selfishness . I therefore opposed him most manfully ; but I had not spoken more than half an hour before another director proposed that each member of the board should have an equal share of the gold and silver . In this form there was something like fairness and justice in the proposal ; and I withdrew my opposition , for the moment , that the cashier might give some necessary information . Cashier expressed his desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the board , but stated frankly that the adoption of the resolution in its present form would expose him to considerable inconvenience , and he doubted if all the gold and silver at present in the vaults of the banks , would be much of an object to the directors , if equally divided among them . Mr. O'Squeezem remarked that the amount , when the annual return was made up , appeared to be considerable . Cashier said that appearances were frequently deceitful . The sun appeared to move around the earth , but every body knew . that the earth moved around the sun . Things appear great or small according to the position in which they are placed . The gold and silver belonging to the bank appeared considerable , placed in a certain position , that is , in the accounts of the bankplaced in another position , that is to say , in the pockets of the directors , it would appear much less considerable . He hoped that whatever was done , the board would leave him enough gold and silver coin to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we live made this indispensable . The remark of the cashier in regard to postages almost decided me , and a few words I had with him apart , left me no longer in doubt as to the course I should pursue . I opposed the proposition in its modified form with as much energy as I had resisted it in its original shape . A distinguished Senator from , would doubtless have displayed more ability in arguing for the propriety of having a metallic basis for our currency , but he could not have evinced more zeal . O'Squeezem sneeringly remarked " that Deacon Graball ought to be at his prayers-that he was becoming a convert to the Specie Humbug '  --  a defender of the Specie Circular , ' &amp;c . " These revilings affected me not . I look on all kinds of paper money except what is founded on a metallic basis as a DOWNRIGHT FRAUD on the community . Whether the basis is large or small , is not of much moment . Such is the excellent nature of paper credit , that a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in paper . Sunday . Brother McThwackem has gone to a watering place , partly to recruit his health , partly to look after some rail road , and other speculations in which he and I are jointly interested-and partly to try if he can not be of some spiritual benefit to the poor , light-headed mortals who usually flock to these scenes of gaiety. // Through some strange mistake he left to fill his pulpit a stupid country parson , or I should rather say priest , for if his sermon did not savor of ppery I know . not what popery is . It was all worksworks-works ! Not one word about the precious doctrines of grace ! I doubt if the man be not a Jesut in disguise , smuggled into the church by the hard-money men with intentions best known to themselves . His text was " THOU SHALT NOT 5TEAL ; " and , in the course of his remarks , he drew a strongly marked line between what he was pleased to call conventional and essential honesty . There were , he said , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at utter variance with the latter . Taking advantage of men 's ignorance and necessities in driving a bargain , was , he said , just as bad in the eyes of reason and religion , as taking advantage of their physical weakness and robbing them on the high way . It was no matter whether this was done according to the forms of law or contrary thereunto . What was wrong in itself , mere human enactments could never make right . It was no matter whether this taking advantage of men 's ignorance and necessities was open and immediate , or covert and indirect , by a long string of contrivances , with a legislative charter at the end . If a man 's pocket was picked , it was much the same to him whether the thief did it with his naked hand and five fingers , or by means of machinery the handle of which was turned in the next street . If a multitude of men were thus treated , it only added to the enorrnitv of the offence . I can truly say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole congregation were of the same opinion as myself ,  --  at least , I know all my particular acquaintances were . I suspect that this parson or priest , or whatever he is , will have but few hearers this evening . At all events , I am determined that my pew shall be vacant . If I use the power which circumstances or my superior intelligence gives me to increase my wealth , I am only acting according to the dictates of nature . That is morally right which is conformable to the law of the land . It is the law of the land which , in fact , determines what is right in a civil sense , and therefore in a moral sense . If the law is wrong I am not in fault . I did not make the law . Went in the evening to hear Dr. Diddler , and heard a truly great and glorious discourse . It was all gospel and no law-all faith and no works . Monday . An old friend , whom I saw in the congregation last evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before , called on me this morning . I wished to draw him into conversation on the excellent discourse we had both been favored with hearing , but he rather avoided the subject , and from some of his // remarks 1 fear he is infected with the neiv-fangled notions of the day . The doctrines of legal righteousness are making strange havoc among professors . " The five points " have been rubbed at so long that they are actually worn down into five blunts . This brother 's mind seemed full of worldly matters . He reminded me that about twenty years ago when I was much embarrassed , he had not pressed for the payment of a debt of five thousand dollars I then owed him , but suffered the claim to lie over . With some little difficulty I recollected the fact , but I did not think it very christianlike in him to call it up at this late day . A favor ceases to be a favor if gratitude is required in payment . He said that he had met with many reverses since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and all the efforts he had made in the South and West to retrieve his fortunes had proved unsuccessful . Under .. standing that I was possessed of boundless wealth-of a tract of three millions of acres of land , and six town plots , in the Western country , besides stocks and various other property in the East , he now ventured to hope I would discharge his claim  --  the interest he would give in if I would pay the principal . Such effrontery I never before met with . The debt is barred by the statute of limitations , and has been these thirteen or fourteen years . Mr. Downright said law was not every thing-there was such a thing as equity . So there is , I admit , but I have had the misfortune to fail three times in the course of my life , and the aggregate of my old debts ( if debts they can be called ) is between two and three millions of dollars . It is utterly impossible for me to pay all , and nothing could be more clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the others* Finding by further conversation that Downright was in great distress I gave him a check for fifty dollars , writing " charity " on one corner of it , as is my practice when I make donations , in. order that I may keep my accounts square , and know exactly how much I give in each year for benevolent purposes . Downright refused to receive the check unless this word was erased ; and so finding him both poor and proud , I took it back , leaving him to suffer the consequences of his folly . People ought to learn to conform to their circumstances . In regard to the three millions of acres of Western land , I must remark that they are not exactly mine , though they will , I hope , nay trust , be mine . It is Newcraft 's tract which he has transferred to me on certain conditions , and which I am to restore to him in certain contingences , which I shall take good care shall never occur . Newcraft thinks himself a man of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business as well as he . Tuesday . Beset during the whole day by a crowd of vulgar // mechanics , to whom , during the late high prices , I had sold , or let on ground rent , some hundreds of lots in the city and the many new and important towns and villages that were then rising up around us on every side . The company of this class of people is always disagreeable , but I had to endure it . On a great number of these lots they have erected substantial buildings , but owing to the pressure of the times , ( produced entirely by the doings of the Government , ) these buildings rent at very reduced rates , and such of the lots as remain vacant will sell for but a small part of their original cost . Made the best arrangement with these people that I could , both for themselves and for myself . I can not enter into particulars . It is enough to say that there is a fair prospect of my getting back one-half of my lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built them will be rid of all incumbrances-for property is always an incumbrance to this kind of people . I fear , though , I shall have to sue some of them to get my just dues , and this will be very unpleasant and somewhat expensive . Was bored for a whole hour by that eccentric old mortal , Judge Johnson of West-Quoddy Head . He maintained that I and Snatchpenny and O'Squeezem , and the other directors of the great bank of Bubble-opolis , are conducting our affairs on false principles . He said that the proper business of a bank is granting facilities to merchants by discounting business paper , and that to this we ought to confine ourselves . He averred that a bank 's dealing in cotton was only a kind of wholesale pawnbroking . He said that the bank of West-Quoddy Head , of which he is a director , never discounts any thing but business paper , and haa in consequence not made one bad debt in twenty-five years . I can not subscribe to such views . Banks , so far as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lend money , but by people who want to make money . We pay heavy sums to the State for our privileges , first in the shape of a bonus and next of an annual tax . And it is strange , indeed , if after this we are not to be allowed to use our privileges for our own exclusive benefit . But I must confess that I see a great deal of ignorance of the proper principles of modern civilized " financiering " still prevailing even among those who ought to know better . When I see , as I must say I do pretty often , men enjoying the advantages of position , and the opportunities of knowledge , of bank directors , neglecting to take the gifts the Gods provide them , ' and clinging to the absurd antiquated notions which our glorious science has exploded , and which those pestilent Loco-Foco destructives are trying to revive ,  --  I can scarcely conceal my contempt for such ignorance and stupidity . Wednesday . It seems as if my troubles were never to end . Today I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maids , and old // widows , and some young ones among them , to whom I had sold stocks when they were high . Stocks have fallen now , and these foolish people really seem to think I am to blame . I told them that the fall of stocks was altogether owing to the infamous Specie Circular , and the odious Sub-Treasury , and thus satisfied some of them . With the rest I did the best I could-that is , I bought back their stocks at such prices as I was able and willing to give . Some of them said I was rather buying them back at such prices as they , from stress of circumstances , were forced to take . flut what is this but the usual course of trade ? All questions of price are questions of power-of power on the side of the seller to get as much as he can , and of power on the side of the buyer to give as little as he can . I was truly grieved at the conduct of many professing christians , both among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that filled my office to-day . Downright infidels -- very heathen - could hardly have displayed less resignation under reverses of fortune . There was one old father in particular , a man seventy-five years of age , and a member of the church from his youth , who seemed as if he would go frantic under his losses . He had , by my advice , sold his farm , in a neighbouring county , for five thousand dollars , and invested the proceeds in a stock , which was then the best in the market , being fifty per cent . above par . Through the vicissitudes of the times , ( caused entirely by the abominable proceedings of Government , ) it is now fifty per cent . below par . The old man said he knew not how , with what was left , he should be able to support himself , his aged and bed-ridden wife , and three small grandchildren , who had , within the last six months , lost both father and mother . Thursday . Good news at last . The odious Specie Circular is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether at the Government 's being compelled to bow to the banks , or to the power now given to us to raise prices as high as we please . One joy is enough for one day , and the prospect of the rise of prices is quite sufficient of itself to make me forget all my past troubles . Now for the sale of the lots and houses that were transferred to me on Tuesday , and for the stocks I bought on Wednesday . And now I shall be able to do something handsome with my three million acres of Western lands and my six town plots . I may as well call them mine , for I have so arranged matters that Newcraft can never get them from me . Of all means of advancing the wealth of a country there is none like banking . Agriculture , manufactures , and commerce , are well enough in their place ; but they all sink into insignificance when compared with this modern mode of acquiring wealth  --  or rather of producing , for I will maintain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between 1834 and 1836 , we gave value to many pieces of property which never had any value before , and which will never have any value again . The pine lands of Maine attest our power , as do also the cabbage gardens in the neighbourhood of New York , and the lands ten feet under water in the new State of Arkansas . An able writer estimates all the landed property in the United States as having been worth four thousand millions of dollars in 1834 , and six thousand millions in 1836. * By our banking operations we added half as much to the value of real estate in two years as all the industry of the country had been able to give to it in two hundred years . And if the Government had not interfered with its despotic and atrocious experiments , who knows but that we might , in two years more , have made the real estate of the country worth sixty thousand millions ! Now this obstacle is happily removed , confidence will be restored , and we shall go on increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . Let it be so . What is there that is truly real in this world of vanity and show ? Every thing depends on our conceptions of things , and if a man can only fix it firmly in his fancy that he is worth six millions of dollars , he may enjoy just as much happiness as if he really possessed this amount of solid wealth . If he had the whole sum in silver dollars he could not eat them or drink them ; neither could he cat or drink what they could procure . A man 's personal wants are very few , and easily supplied ; but most men have cravings to which it is not easy to set limits . And I will affirm that there is no way in which all men s cravings , or even the cravings of any great number , can be satisfied , unless it be by banking , or some similar contrivance . It is , in the nature of things , absolutely impossible that all men , or that any great number of men , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , produced by plentiful issues of paper money , a great many may be brought to believe that they are very rich , and thus enjoy as much satisfaction as if they really abounded in wealth . Happiness resides in the mind . All philosophers agree in this . Friday . Great jubilation at a meeting of our friends to-day ; but Satan came among us in the guise of a Loco-Foco , and a more appropriate shape he could not have assumed . Loco-Foco said much about the importance of a fixed standard of value-that it would be as absurd to be always changing the size of the bushel , or the length of the yard stick , as to be always changing the value of the dollar , &amp;c . Talked , also , much about justice , and equity , and ho . nesty , and all that sort of thing . The devil can , you know , quote scripture to serve his purpose . Told Loco that all he had said was very true in the abstract ; but he was a mere theorist . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principles of Political Economy . " By H. C. Carey . Philadelphia , 1837. // practical man . Loco asked me if I knew the true meaning of the word " theory . " Told Loco that if I did not , my friend Doctor Fiddler did . Loco asked what I meant by " a practical man . " He had never heard of Adam Smith or J. B. Say 's keeping a huckstershop . Made no reply to Loco , but thought within myself that " a , practical man" is one who has failed in business at least twice , and owes at least twice as much as he can ever pay . Changed the subject by telling Loco that the " Specie Circular " was " a humbug . " Loco said modestly that perhaps the paper money system was " a humbug . " Here Dr. Diddler stepped in to my relief , in a manner which entitles him to my eternal gratitude . Without condescending to make a direct reply to Loco-Poco , he began : " I am a humbug , We are humbugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbugs , He , she , or it , is a humbug , They are humbugs . " And in this way went through all the tenses , present , imperfect past , perfect past , plusquam-perfect past , future , and paulo-post future , and all the moods , indicative , imperative , subjunctive , and inlinitive . It is impossible for me to do justice to Doctor Diddler 's performance on this occasion . His gesticulation was admirable , and his enunciation so varied that the conjugation of a verb was as pleasing to me as the best performed music I ever listened to . It even extorted a compliment from Loco-Foco , for he said Doctor Diddler must have been taking lessons from the editors of the Journal of Saturday . Well , this is most outrageous . The old Specie Circular is repealed ; but here comes a new Specie Circular close on its heels . Our tyrannical Government is not content with redeemable paper , but will have it actually redeemed at stated periods ! This is a downright farce . Redeemable paper , every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having it redeemed is sinking bank notes to a level with the notes of private traders . The very means by which banks make their profits are by issuing a great many notes which , though always payable , are never paid . However , we have obtained one great and open triumph over our abominable Government , in the repeal of the old Specie Circular ; and , as for the new , if we do not make that a dead letter my name is not Graball . Government is at Washington . The collectors are all along shore ; and the receivers all over the prairies . They are not as stupid as the Administration . Tkey know where their own true interest lies . Sunday . Really the Church is as much in need of reform as the State . McThwackem is still at the watering place , and his pulpit was supplied by , if possible , a more intolerable proser than we had last Sunday . His text was , " Ye can not serve God and mammon. " // Tie said that to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stone . There were false gods still more to be dreaded - idols of the mind , for , whatever a man did in heart regard as his Supreme Good was , in reality , the god he worshipped . At what shrine the great body of men of the present day paid their devotion , few could be at a loss to discover . At no period in the world 's history had we stronger evidence of the truth , that " the love of money is the root of all evil . " Hardly more ingenuity had been exerted in inventing machines for the multiplication of products , than in devising ways and means for abstracting wealth from toiling producers and honest proprietors . Operations of this kind on a small scale are , indeed , branded with the name of dishonesty ; but when they become extensive they are highly honorable . Not a few seem to be of the opinion of the old Highland chieftain who thought the only crime consisted in not taking enough . On the same prin ciple that " One murder makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar from one man is theft or robbery , taking a great many dollars from a great many men is only speculation . Such was the substance of this truly vapid discourse . In the evening went to hear Dr. Diddler , and was comforted and edified as usual.
