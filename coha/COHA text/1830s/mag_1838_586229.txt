txt Ma . WOODBIJRY is descended from that intrepid and strong-minded race of men who left their homes in England early in the seven* teenth century , to enjoy their rights as freemen , and settled upon the rocky shores of the North . The American nation is indebted to their foresight and sagacity for many of these institutions which have given character and efficiency to our system of self-governinenL However obscure as individuals , each of those practical democrats held that station in society , and possessed the weight and influence in its government , to which his talents , industry , and usefulness , entitled him . In Farmer 's account of the early emigrants to New England , it is stated that the ancestors of Mr. Woodhury were among the origioal settlers of Salem , one of the first plantations in the colony of Massachusetts . From that part of the ancient town of Salem , which is now comprehended within the limits of Beverly , Peter Woodbury went , at an early age , to Francestown , an agricultural settlement in the interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present sketch , was born , about the commencement of 1790 . Mr. Woodbury , from his childhood , was trained to those habits of industry which are so general among the population of New England . His principal elementary education was obtained in the free schools kept in his native village , during the winter months , when farming labor is suspended , as is the usual practice under the system of laws which were originally established by the Pilgrims . On reaching a suitable age he was sent to permanent seminaries away from home , for short periods , during the summer season , in order to acquire a sufficient knowledge of the rudiments of the Latin and Greek languages , to enable him to enter college . He was early distinguished for his application to study ; and manifested , even in his boyhood , that ardor in the pursuit of knowledge , and that readiness of apprehension and decision of character , which he has since shewn in the discharge of the most important duties . He took his first degree at Dartmouth College in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediately devoted himself to the profession he had chosen . After passing a year at , the celebrated law school at Litchfield , Connecticut , he studied the VOL . II . NO . VIII.  - -  JULY. z // residue of his preparatory term at Boston , Exeter , and his native jplace . In 1812 he was admitted to the bar . At the period of Mr. Woodbury 's entrance into active life , party spirit raged in the Eastern States with more intensity than at any time since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States . The restrictions and embarrassments upon our commerce during previous years , imposed in consequence of the lawless course of the European belligerents , had deeply involved the pursuits of the bulk of the people , and wrought up their feelings against the policy of the Government . This state of general agitation had been fob lowed by the declaration of war against Great Britain , by which the ordinary employments and means of subsistence of large classes were suspended , and the luxuries and comforts of all curtailed . Those opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , able to infuse an extent of disaffection towards the Government of the Union among the people , which can hardly be realized by those who have only witnessed party contests of more recent date . Throughout the greatest part of New Hampshire the democracy was overwhelmed by the unremitting and unscrupulous exertions directed by individuals of distinguished talents . Declamations setting forth in glowing language the wrongs inflicted on the people of New England by the Government of the Union , and the advantages of secession and alliance with Englandor at least a state of neutrality , were boldly put forth in every part of New England . The unwearied pains taken to subvert all sentiments of patriotism among the mass of the people , had produced such alarming consequences , that the friends of the Republic were compelled to interpose their most strenuous exertions to prevent the adoption of measures of the last extremity by the Opposition to the Government of the Union . Notwithstanding the youth of Mr. Woodhury , he took a decided stand during this eventful period . He bestowed unwearied exertions in disabusing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the factious measures of the federal party . At a public meeting of democratic delegates from the several towns in his native county of Hillsborough , he took a leading part while yet a student in a law office . A series of powerful and judicious resolutions from his pen were adopted , with salutary effect upon the political stability of that large county . In other parts of the State the federal party carried the elections of 1813 , and retained the asc*ndency in its councils until 1816 . Besides his exertions in support of the great constitutional principles involved in the contest which raged during a great portion of this interval , Mr. Woodhury continued to bestow the most diligent application upon his professional duties . Few lawyers have obtained at the outset of their professional life a more extensive and // respectable practice . By an exemplary performance of the high promise of his youth , he rapidly acquired a rank at a bar at which lawyers , who are among the most distinguished in the Union , practised . In 1816 the political character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascendency , on the meeting of the Legislature Mr. Woodbury was invited to the seat of Government to discharge the duties of Secretary of the Senate ; and at the commencement of the next year , he was appointed judge of the Superior Court . Ascending the bench of the highest judicial tribunal of the State , at an age more youthful than had before occurred in its history , the appointment excited much remark where Mr. Woodbury was personally unknown . The result surpassed the utmost expectations of his friends . In the discharge of the arduous and responsible duties of this station , he evinced the most estimable qualifications of a judge-diligence , patience , firmness , and good temper . His familiarity with legal principles and reach of mind , combined with his suavity of manners and moral courage , enabled him to conduct jury trials with great satisfaction to the public-while his judicial opinions showed great research and accurate discrimination . Ample testimony of the qualifications of Mr. Woodbury for the performance of the duties of his office , may be found in the two first volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed to Portsmouth , the commercial capital of New Hampshire , where he continued to reside until he became a member of President Jackson 's cabinet . Mr. Wo odbury was chosen Governor of New Hampshire in 1823 , under circumstances which placed him in a novel position in relation to the two political parties into which that State has been long divided . An estimable citizen belonging to the western section of the State , was put in nomination for that office by a portion of the democratic party ; while those in the eastern part of the State nominated and supported Mr. Woodbury . No candidate was brought out by the federal party , who had witnessed the rigid abstinence from every expression of political bias , which he had maintained in the discharge of his judicial duties , and who generally voted for him throughout the State . Elected by an overwhelming majority , the federal leaders undoubtedly flattered themselves that he would be induced , from having received their support , to regulate his official measures agreeably to their wishes . When the policy of his administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became too obvious to be mistaken ; and the only solace remaining to them under the disappointment of such hopes , was to denounce him in strong terms . Equally unmoved by the abuse , as unseduced by the blandishments of partisans , whose approbation // of public measures appears too often to depend upon the extent to which they may be made to promote their personal interests , Mr. Woodbury inflexibly pursued the path of duty . The united opposition of the federal party , together with that of many influential democrats , who had originally opposed his election , prevented his being chosen for a second term , and he resumed the practice of his profession after his period of service as Governor expired . His knowledge of the law and his forensic talents immediately surrounded him with clients from every part of the State . He was soon called on by his fellow citizens to discharge political duties . In 1825 , the year following , he was chosen by the town of Portsmouth , a representative in the Legislature of the State ; and , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any legislative assembly-he was elected Speaker of the House . Among the last acts of the session was the choice of Mr. Woodbury to fill a vacancy which had occurred in the Senate of the United States . His talents , information , and habits of unwearied application , gave Mr. Woodbury much influence upon the deliberations of the Senate . Regarded as the principal organ of the democracy of Ne*v England in thatbody , during the administration of President Adams , his clear and forcible expositions of its views were received with great deference on several important occasions . His powerful vindication of that party against the sarcastic attacks made upon its conduct and principles , by those who had opposed it both in peace and in war , which occurred in the course of the debate upon Mr. Foot 's resolution respecting the public lands , was much spoken of at the time . After the first session at which Mr. Woodbury took his seat , his name appears upon some of the most important committees , and connected with the most interesting proceedings of the Senate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Commerce , and entered zealously into several measures affecting the commercial interests . His report upon the Delaware Breakwater , in January , 1827 , and his speeches upon that subjectupon the West India trade , when our relations with Great Britian , in regard to this branch of commerce , had become unfortunately disturbed-upon the Bankrupt bill  --  and his report from the Committee of Agriculture , and speeches in favor of the repeal of the salt duty , were all highly creditable to him . The duties performed by Mr. Woodbury upon the Committees on Naval Affairs and on the Library , as well as upon several important Select Committees , were equally exemplary and useful . While he retained his seat in the Senate , many transactions of great interest were intrusted to his management before the Superior Court of his own State . The requisite care of his family and // private affairs necessarily occupied much of his attention , and his annual absence from home exposed him to great sacrifices . When the period approached at which it was understood an election would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed a letter to the Governor of the State , containing a request that it might be communicated to the Legislature , declining a reelection . His term of service expired on the third of March , 1831 . At the annual election in New hampshire , which occurred five days afterwards , he was chosen State Senator for the district in which he resided . On the reorganization of the cabinet , in the month of April following , he was invited by President Jackson to take the office of Secretary of the Navy . This appointment he was induced to accept . He accordingly declined the office of State Senator ; and , repairing to the seat of the General Government , soon entered upon the functions of his new appointment . Those who held official intercourse with Mr. Woodhury as Secretary of the Navy generally concur that he manifested great method , firmness , and promptitude in the discharge of the important duties which devolved upon him in that station . By introducing general and impartial rules for the guidance of the decisions of the Depart*. ment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privileges and burdens arising from the relative advantages to the officers employed at the various stations , he succeeded in avoiding many of the imputations and inconveniences to which the course before pursued had sometimes subjected the Head of the Departrnent . He evinced great zeal as well as judgment in arranging the naval force of the country for the protection of its foreign commerce , and sustaining the honor of our national flag abroad . When , on one occasion , in 1831 , he promptly despatched the frigate Poto.b mac to Sumatra to obtain satisfaction or inflict punishment upon the habitual marauders upon the trade carried on with the Indian Archipelago , he was most unjustly censured , both on the floor of Congress and in the newspapers of the day , before the result of the expedition was accurately understood in this country . After the facts became known , the transaction was generally conceded to reflect great credit both upon the Department and the gallant officers in comman ( l . While Mr. Woodbury was Secretary of the Navy several important questions came before the cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he afterwards became connected with the immediate management of the public finances as Secretary of the Treasury , measures which produced the most important and exciting consequences upon the commercial and financial prosperity of the country were brought into operation , the origin and object of which we feel bound to point out , as well as to explain his course in relation to them at some length . It therefore seems to be proper // to give , as far as our information of the transactions of that period will enable us , his views upon these questions . The charter of the Bank of the United States was to expire , by its own limitation , on the fourth of March , 1836 . The president and directors of that corporation , with a design which could not be mistaken , applied to Congress early in the session of 1831 , 2 for a renewal of their charter-on the eve of the presidential election of the autumn of the latter year . This question was obviouslyand indeed , on the part of some of the advocates of the recharter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could take effect , with a view of controlling that election through the power of the bank over the mercantile and speculating classes , should the President determine to refuse his sanction to the recharter-as was generally supposed would be the case . The bill rechartering the bank passed , extending the bank charter twenty years , and was placed before the President for his approval. - What advice was given by the several members of the cabinet upon the question of approving this bill , we have no means of knowing , excepting from the general opinions upon that and similar subjects which have been on other occasions avowed by the individuals composing it . Mr. Woodbury , from the commencement of his political career , had been a firm , and devoted disciple of the school of Jefferson , and on all occasions had steadfastly opposed the doctrines and practices which had grown out of what had been usually termed a liberal construction of the Constitution . We hazard little of conjecture , therefore , in stating that he advised the President to return the bill with objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it originated , with a message , assigning reasons both constitutional and prudential , against its provisions . The question of the recharter of the bank was made , as had been doubtless intended by bringing it up in advance of the election , the main issue in the contest for the presidency in 1832 . The course of the Executive having been sustained by a very great majority of the people of the Union , it became necessary , in the exercise of common prudence , to make seasonable arrangements for the management of the public finances after the expiration of the bank charter . The unscrupulous policy manifested by the bank immediately subsequent to the veto , both towards the commercial interests of the country , manifested in its wanton and severe curtailments , and towards the Government , in relation to the performance of its great public trusts , imperiously required the settling of such arran gements . Congress had made provision for the immediate redemption of the Public Debt . The then Secretary of the Treasury , in pursu* ance of law , gave public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Bank of the United States for payment , public money having been placed there for the purpose of meeting the amount . A large proportion of the three per cent . stock being held in europe , the bank despatched an agent thither , and entered into a stipvdation with the holders that they should decline the redemption provided by law , by withholding their certificates , while the bank paid the interest on the stock in order that it might appropriate to its own purposes the public money provided for the payment of the principal-thus , in effect , negotiating an actual loan , on the security of the United States , of several millions of dollars , at three per cent . interest , contrary to the express will of Congress . This transaction , and an official communication , made by the directors on the part of the United States , that the corporation had , by formal vote , placed the whole funds in its possession , both public and private , at the absolute disposal of the president of the bank for secret services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toucher or specification-together with the evident determination , on the part of that corporation to employ the paramount control it had proved itself able to exercise upon all occasions over the amount of paper currency in circulation , for the purpose of extorting a recharter bymeans of the sufferings of the community-induced President Jackson to call upon his cabinet for their opinions upon the question of the expediency of the immediate removal of the public money from the Bank of the United States . It was well understood at the time that a diversity of opinion existed among the several members ; but the precise grounds of difference have never transpired . The opinion attributed to Mr. Woodbury was , that he advised the seasonable selection of suitable State banks , in order that these institutions might be fully prepared to transact the whole public business which would devolve upon them on the expiration of the charter of the Bank of the United States , as well as to convince the public beforehand of their ability to perform the duties , previously discharged , of that institution , in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the change be made as gradual as might be consistent with the public service-though beginning its execution in time for its full completion when the charter should expire  --  and then drawing the public funds required for disbursement from the Bank of the United States , and depositing the new collections in such State banks as might be selected . The President , after having expressed his opinion publicly that the conduct of the bank had been such as to destroy all his confidence in its management as the fiscal agent of the Government , directed that the public money in its custody be forthwith transferred to certain State banks at the most important points , and at more remote periods at other places . Mr. Duane , then Secretary of the // Treasury , having opposed this decision , he was dismissed , and Mr* Taney , who is understood to have expressed an opinion , as Attorney General , favorable to the immediate removal of the whole public money from the bank , was appointed in his place . On his becoming Secretary of the Treasury , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying the decision of the President into effect . The measures before pursued , to a comparatively small extent , by the bank , for narrowing the circulating medium of the community , and by this means creating distress for money , were then vigorously brought to bear upon the State banks , and the commercial men throughout the United States . The rigid system of curtailments which the other banks were compelled to adopt , produced a sudden and violent crisis in most of the cities . Debtors became alarmed , and creditors inexorable . The politicians who supported the interests of the Bank of the United States were vociferous in charging the Government with having occasioned the general pressure which prevailed . The fall in the prices of commodities , and the numerous failures of mercantile men , created great popular excitement , which was much increased by the inflammatory course pursued by several members of Congress during the session of 1833 , 4 . The strong measures adopted by President Jackson for the purpose of repressing the threatened outbreak of the State of South Carolina against the protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they joined the advocates of the bank in denouncing the removal of the deposits as an Executive usurpation , though it was expressly provided for by the charter of the bank . Some of the legislative mari*uvres displayed during the session which , by general consent , has been styled the PANIc SEssIoN , were described in our May number , in the sketch of Mr. Speaker Polk , then Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives . The removal of the public money from the Bank of the United States to the selected State banks was condemned by a vote of the Senate , but sanctioned by a majority of the House of Representatives . When the nomination of Mr. Taney , as Secretary of the Treasury , came before the Senate , it was rejected ; but no objection appears to have been made to that of Mr. Woodbury as his successor , whose appointment was confirmed at the end of June , 1834 . The duties which devolved upon him in this new station , and the manner in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his talents , acquirements , and habits , for the efficient superintendence of the public finances . The variety of important reports , many of them calling for ability and research , which he has been required to make to Congress from time to time , in addition to the current business of his office , have fully evinced the energy and // rapidity of his mental operations . Within a few months after he took charge of the Treasury Department he prepared an elaborate annual report on the finances , together with a supplemental report upon the keeping and disbursing the public moneys , which clearly demonstrated that no Bank of the United States is necessary for these purposes under the demands and facilities which exist at the present day , whatever may have been required by the state of pub* lic cradit at the period when the first and second banks were char* tered . The principal argument in favor of the constitutionality of a Bank of the United States is conclusively answered by the facts established by this report , since unless such an institution is actually required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted on all hands that Congress possesses no authority to charter it under the general grant of incidental powers . In this valuable document some of the questions relative to the currency and exchanges of this country which had been little understood , were explained in a most satisfactory manner ; as well as many statistical facts collected , which must be regarded as an important accession of novel and authentic information on those subjects-particularly the tables showing the receipts and expenditures in each State  --  and the circulation of specie and paper in the different countries of the world at different periods . Within the same time Mr. Woodbury prepared a masterly report upon the reorganization of the Treasury Department , in which the checks against the possible occurrence of fraud or mistake , in its various branches , were proposed to be simplified in such a manner as to enforce the most rigid accountability ; and another report , which must have required extensive investigation and inquiry , upon the number , grades , and duties of the officers in the several custom houses of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had involved the practical computation of the mode pointed out by law for the compensation of most of the principal officers of the customs in great confusion , and , in many instances , produced a degree of injustice which could not have been foreseen by Congress . Mr. Woodhury explained the whole subject , in all its bearings upon the public service , with great ability . About the same period he was obliged to enter into an extended correspondence with the President of the Bank of the United States respecting the issue by the bank of the drafts of its branches , and their payment to the collectors and receivers of public money as currency at points remote from those to which they were directed ; and relative to the sequestration of the dividends belonging to the United States upon a claim for damages on the return of a bill of exchange upon the French Government-both of which assumptions of power by that corporation were exposed with great force and effect . // The panic measures concerted by that bank were pursued with so much harshness , before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that several of its devo*ted friends were reduced to the verge of bankruptcy-indeed , some of them were evidently sacrificed for the purpose of increasing the clamor against the administration . But President Jackson remained steadfast in his desire of ultimately relieving the mercantile transactions of the community from the mischievous disturbances which the interest or caprice of the managers of the bank had so repeatedly produced , through its power over the public revenue . The excitement fomented with the view of inducing Congress to order the public money to be returned to its custody having entirely failed , the bank , near the close of 1834 , suddenly and entirely changed its course of policy towards the merchants and the public at large . As to the results expected to be produced by this revolution , we have no further means of ascertaining the intentions of the managers of private corporations than of determining the motives which actuate individuals . If the general maxim that individuals possessing intelligence and free agency must be presumed to understand and intend the natural and ordinary consequences of their conduct , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that the managers of the bank , for the accomplishment of objects which will appear in the sequel , deliberately resolved , by this new movement , to throw the currency , exchanges , and public finances of the country into disorder and confusion . It can not be supposed that the measures which inevitably produced this result were taken in ignorance of their consequences by men of experience , whose boldness seemed to disdain all disguise . The contraction , unsparingly exercised both upon its own issues and those of the State banks , had a short time before plunged the trading classes in every part of the country , as we have seen , into the deepest difficulties . All at once the bank commenced bestowing loans arid accommodations in every direction with the most profuse liberality . The desires of the mercantile community appeared to be far too limited for the employment of its boundless benevolence of means . The leading directors invested large amounts in public lands , and the great profits realized by these operations were ostentatiously reported throughout the community as an encouragement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready and assured path to fortune , and thousands , whose habits and employments little fitted them to embark in such speculations , were induced to follow these brilliant examples of success . It became comparatively easy to make extensive purchases from the general plentifulness of currency which began to prevail in all sections of the country as soon a the restraint imposed by the previous course of the Bank of the United States had been removed from the operations of the State banks . // By the returns of the Bank of the United States , printed by order of the Senate , it is shown that the expansion of the accommodations of this bank between December , 1834 , and July , 1835 , . *mounted to twenty millions of dollars ! If to this amount is added the encouragement which this sudden liberality gave to the increased issues of about seven hundred State banks , the extraordinary impulse afforded to every description of speculative undertaking , wholly through a rise of prices from this sudden expansion of the commercial measure of value , may be comprehended . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , be produced by such a rise of prices . If we had no intercourse with foreign nations , an expansion of currency here would be of no further injury to our citizens than the impairing the obligation of all antecedent contracts . The reduced comparative value of our currency would only enable us to see things in a larger light-like the person who put on magnifying spectacles to make the cherries he was eating look bigger . But a rise of prices caused by an expansion of paper is intended to increase all the expenses of living , and of course the rates of wages in this country , and always effects its design . The cost of bringing into the market the products of our agricultural and manufacturing industry is consequently increased , while they are placed in competition in our own markets with foreign commodities produced at less cost ; or in the case of the exportation of our staples to a foreign market , their value is measured , not by the factitious currency in which the cost of production is computed , but by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper than ourselves , and to undersell and destroy our manufacturing industry in spite of the mockery of legislative protection . A large surplus revenue was brought into the public Treasury by the extensive importations of foreign goods , subject to duty , and by the great sales of the public lands , both of which were obviously produced by the enormous expansion of the currency The extent of the public domain sold and paid for during the years 18.35 and 1836 exceeded the whole which had been sold during the preceding period from the establishment of the General Land Office . The force and organization of this branch of the Treasury Department were found entirely inadequate to discharge its most pressing duties , and it was enlarged by Congress more than fourfold . The questious of conflicting interest among purchasers increased with their avidity to possess themselves of choice tracts . More questions of this kind were appealed to Mr. Woodbury and decided by him between 1834 and 1838 , than had probably arisen from the foundation of the Department . Many of these questions were argued at length by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the value of the property involved , required extensive investi // gation and great care in their decision , and increased the burthen and responsibility of his official duties to an important extent . The p*blic money , accumulated in the manner we have endeavoured to explain , was deposited in the State Banks which had been selected for that purpose . These corporations enjoyed an accession of profits and influence by this means which excited general dissatisfaction on the part of those interested in the numerous other banks , as well as of vast numbers of individuals who , under the continued advance of prices , from the increasing expansion of currency , were desirous to avail themselves of greater facilities than they could command for speculation . This they hoped to do by the selection of a greater number of banks . All the complaints in every quarter of the country against the deposite banks , on the score of favoritism , and disinclination to accommodate the trading community , were char* , ed against Mr. Woodbury and the administration of the General Government , though these banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to partisan views , as must be evident from the fact that the directors of nearly the whole of them were politically opposed to the administration at the period of their selection , and have so continued to the present hour . In his annual Report on the Finances made to Congress at the commencement of the session of 1835 , 6 , Mr. Woodbury discussed the question of disposing of the surplus which , under the existing laws , had been raised from the people beyond the necessary expenditures of the government , with signal sagacity and ability . Such a question had evidently never occurred among the possibilities foreseen by the framers of the Constitution . Under the operation of the system of solid currency exclusively recognized by that instrument , a large surplus revenue could not have been inadvertently created by a sudden expansion of the medium of payment . 1-Laying suffered innumerable evils from the depreciation to which all paper currency is liable , they did not contemplate that their posterity would fall into the snare against which they had provided so many safeguards . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the speculations it had engendered produced this evil . The corrupting influence of large amounts of public money employed by irresponsible individuals for their own private advantage , had aroused the jealousy of the people at large . Some mode of disposing of it had become absolutely necessary . Convinced , as he appears to have been , that the sudden *vithdrawal of the great amounts deposite ( l in the banks would deeply affect their credit and usefulness , as well as impair the confidence reposed in them by the community , Mr. Woodbury recommended to Congress the enlargement of the appropriations for the permanent security of the frontiers , the completion , with all practicable rapidity , of our great public works // and the investment of such sums as might not'be applicable to these objects , in such stocks of the several States as might be readily sold in the market , forming a provident fund , with probable security , for the purpose of meeting the prospective reduction of the tariff and deficiencies of the revenue , which he confidently predicted from the inevitable operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Congress determined to divide the surplus which might remain in the Treasury on the first of January . 1837 , among the several States , and in the meantime to distribute it among the banks in such a manner that no one should hold a greater proportion of the public money than threefourths of the amount of its capital . It is well known that President Jackson , foreseeing many of the evils to which the withdrawal of great amounts of money from the banks , within a short period , would expose both them and the community , under the state of artificial expansion which was continually going on , very reluctantly gave his approval to this measure , which had been most earnestly supported by the most zealous professing friends of the State banks . With the view of checking this expansion , and enabling the banks to make suitable provisions for sustaining themselves under the crisis which it was obvious , to all reflecting men , must be occasioned by the operation of this measure , he directed the rigid enforcement of the laws , which require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash , except those made by actual settlers within a certain specified periodwhich occasioned the promulgation , by Mr. Woodbury , of the circular order of the eleventh July , 1836 , on that sub ject . On the passage of the Deposite Law , Mr. Woodhury appears to have adopted the necessary measures for carrying it into execution . Several of the banks , previously employed as depositories , especially those of New York , the commercial emporium of the country , as well as in other cities where large importations had been made , held amounts of public money greatly beyond the proportions which could be permitted to remain in them under the rigid enactments of the law . All the existing banks in the city of New York were insufficient for its custody there under its provisions . As the act imperatively directed Mr. Woodbury to select one or more deposite banks in each State of the Union , and in many of the States little or no revenue was collected and none of the public money was within them which was required to be deposited with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compelled to order the transfer of the overplus which could not be held in those cities , to such convenient points as might enable the deposits to be made with the States with the greatest facility . For this course he was exposed to the most violent censure from individuals who have manifested that the ties of the law furnish // very feeble restraints upon the gratification of their views of advantage . In fact , the character of the abuse which has been showered upon Mr. Woodhury by some of the advocates of this law must be regarded as extraordinary , even under the latitude of criticism to which public men in this country are subjected . He never made a secret of his repugnance to some of the provisions of the law , which , in common with most men of discernment , he foresaw would be attended with great public and private calamities , unless the banks should exercise great forbearance towards each other . Nevertheless , as a public officer , he was bound to fulfil his duty by adopting all practicable steps for carrying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was publicly charged by a class of unscrupulous politicians with having determined to disregard its enactments . When , however , he had commenced the discharge of his duty by issuing the necessary orders for carrying it into effect , the same politicians alleged , in effect , though not , perhaps , in terms , that he was responsible for the evils created by its operation , many of which he had foreseen and pointed out as inevitable before its passage . The sudden curtailment of the accommodations of the banks by the transfer of nearly forty millions of dollars within nine months to the States , many of which were out of the ordinary channels of extensive commerce and large pecuniary operations , could not fail to produce the greatest inconveniences , both to the banks and their debtors , All the indulgences within the power of Mr. Woodbury appear , from his correspondence called for and published by order of Congress , to have been given , as to time , place , mode , and transfer . But , by the terms of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . A dispensation from this process could alone relieve them from their difficulties . This could be done only by a repeal of the law , or by a flagrant violation of its provisions . Still he was constantly assailed as the author of the troubles in which the banks were involved , and even was held responsible for the want of confidence evinced by them towards each other , by demanding specie upon the transfers he was compelled to direct , in fulfilment of the enactments of the law . Many of the supporters of this law , fully aware of the severity of its operation upon the banks , of which they were zealous professing friends , had , besides charging upon Mr. Woodhury the responsibility which belonged to themselves , endeavoured to satisfy the public that many of the inconveniences arising from the curtailments required to execute its provisions , should be ascribed to the circular order requiring payments for public lands to be made in cash . The absurdity of this pretext becomes too appareYit for serious refutation , when it is recollected that these inconveniences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // were not required , while the banks of the States where most of the public lands were on sale , remained in a condition of comparative ease and safety , although the amount of specie transported to those States was trifling compared with the amount of the sales . The clamor , therefore , against the Government , of hostility to the banks , was wholly misplaced  --  the measure which exercised the most disastrous influence upon them having originated and been supported principally by individuals who have usually been governed by suggestions from another quarter . The various charges which had been made in Congress , during the sessions of 1835 , 6 and 1836 , 7 , against the management of Mr. Woodbury , relative to the public money deposited with the selected State Banks , resulted , during the latter session , in the appointment , by the House of Representatives , of a Select Committee for the purpose of investigating this subject . Another Select Committee was also appointed , about the same time , to investigate any other charges either against him or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the expedients resorted to for the purpose of showing an improper collusion with any agent of deposite banks which was the leading subject of inquiry , the American people , to whom their representatives are alone accountable , must determine . All the charges made against Mr. Woodhury were substantially abandoned , and after collecting a large volume of testimony , involving a most severe and searching scrutiny , the reports of the whole of the committee resulted in his exculpation . Nor did the inquiries of the other committee develope any thing which tended in the slightest degree to impugn the fidelity , judgment , and ability with which the transfers to the States , and the other requirements of the Deposite Law , which had been made the principal topic of complaint against Mr. Woodbury , had been directed by him . So strong was the confidence of the framers of the Constitution of the United States in the intelligence and candor of the people , that they wisely prohibited the Executive officers charged with the necessary details of carrying the laws into operation , from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation where a representative branch of the government is known . In England , and every where upon the continent of Europe where public measures are discussed in deliberative assemblies , the responsible ministry always form a portion of these assemblies , and by their presence are able to explain and defend their own conduct . But it is a fundamental principle with us that the Legislative and Executive authorities are to he kept separate . The advantages derived from this principle are obvious and conclusive ; but as the best institutions may be abused , its operation sometimes enables factious individuals to misrepresent Executive transactions with // impunity , as well as to mislead the judgments of the people , in cases where a single sentence of explanation from the individual whose official conduct is implicated , would be not only satisfactory , but triumphant , on the spot . Among the onerous and thankless duties officially devolved upon him in 1836 , was an investigation into the affairs of the Bank of the United States , for the purpose of liquidating the sum due from that corporation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the capital stock . The course pursued by the managers of that bank relative to this public property , shocked the sense of jus. tice of many individuals who had palliated their previous conduct . Those who had not ventured to disapprove of violations of the law , the observance of which constitutes the only secure safeguard of all our social rights , were unable to find any sufficient excuse for a palpable breach of the ordinary principles of upright and honorable dealing . Just before the charter granted by Congress expired , the directors had assigned its assets to a new corporation created by the State of Pennsylvania , bearing the same name . It appears by the report made to Congress , early in the session of 1836 , 7 , that repeate ( l calls were made upon the president of the corporation chartered by Congress , for a statement of the value of this stock . After the lapse of some months , a statement representing its precise value was officially transmitted to Mr. Woodbury , who caused it to be carefully analyzed , upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million of dollars ought to be paid , in addition to that originally stated . An adjustment was subsequently concluded upon the basis established by this report , under the authority of Congress . With the year 1837 , the difficulties of the banks , arising from their excessive issues , which had been repeate ( lly adverted to by Mr. Woodhury , and the fatal consequences predicted in his annual report on the finances at the commencement of the preceding session , were aggravated by the execution of the deposits with the States . The preliminary measures required by law , of transferring , from the banks holding amounts of public money exceeding three-fourths of their capital , that excess , had occasione ( l , during the last half of the year 1836 , great distress in the principal commercial cities . This was materially increased by the payment of the first instalment of one-fourth of the surplus in January , which required further curtailments of the currency in those cities . The banks throughout the country manifested an increasing distrust towards each other . The payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust . But the catastrophe evidently contemplated as the great result of the vast expansions produced , as we have seen , from the commencement of 1833 , and rendered inevitable by the Deposite Law , was // hastened by the measures taken by the Bank of England . As soon as the advocates arid supporters of tire Bank of the United States had determined that the measure of ( listribution of the surplus among the States should be brought before Cngress , foreseeing that irresistible motives would insure its passage , even by a twothirds vote if uecessarxr , that bank ( lespatche ( 1 its cashier to Europe , for the purpose of borro*ving atl ( l importing a large anrount of specie to enable it to *vithstand the shock which it was foreseen would be brought upon the credit of all the banking institutions of the country . The large amount drawn from England for this purpose , early in 1836 , added to the ( Irain from the continent of Europe , 500fl afterwards compelled the Bank of England , to exercise a restriction upon its issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial houses in England , s topped l ) *yn1ent . The prices of our staples fell to such an extent , in that country , that a great portion of the bills draiv*r against them by the exporters were returned un ( ler protest . It became s ' di ( flcnlt to procure un(loul)te ( l exchange on England , and the rate became so exori ) itant , that soon after the payment of the April instalment , specie began to be dra'vmr from the lanks of New York for the purpose of remittance . Satisfied that this course would he extensively adopted by individuals who were determined to sustain their credit abroad , the banks of New York ,  --  their stock of specie having been greatly reduced a short time before by ( lrafts ma ( le upon them by those of other cities , especially of Philadelphia ,  --  determined , on the tenth of May , to refuse the payment of their oblhrations in specie . A. similar resolution was adopted in the course of that month by most of the banks throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency , placeni the public Treasury , *vhese means of payment had hy law been loiged in banks , nearly tire whole of which dishonored their obligations at once , in a novel and most embarrassing predicament . From tire origin of the Government of the United States tire laws had strictly prtvided that no payments should be tirade into the Ureasury but in gol ( l rlO ( l silver coin . In practice , these laws had been relaxed by the receipt of the notes of specie paving banks . convertible into specie at the place where receive ( l as equivalent to cash ,  - -  and tins practice had been sanctioned by the joint resoltni n of Corn congress of 1816 . Under tire provisions of tlre act of 1836 , no payment to any T ) nibhic creditor even in the notes of specie paying banks , excepting above certain ( lenominnations and equivalent to specie where offered , was lawful . When tire banks throughout the country , holnhing within their control nearly tire whole means provided for meetinig the I ) nnbhic engagements , refused at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first innpressie1n among all classes of people was , that the financial operations of the VOL . II . NO . VIII. - JULY A1 // Government must he totally stopped . This was exultingly proclaime ( l , in a ( I**flce of the suspension , b* individuals who had performed a leading part in the measures which had produced it . But Mr. Woodhury met this emergency with his characteristic promptitude , energy , and sagacity . As soon as information of the suspension of the banks of New York , reached the seat of Government , circular orders were despatched , to the collectors and receivers of the public money , to forbear making deposits to the cre ( lit of the Treasurer , in any bank which should not redeem its notes in legal currency . They were directed to keep the public money , and make weekly returns of the amount , in order that the Treasurer might draw directly on them in payment of claims against the United States . Their receipts were not very considerable , excepting at some of the land offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claims charged upon the Treasury for the support of the public establishments upon the seaboard . For the purpose of providing for the appropriations made by law , without requiring public creditors to receive the depreciated paper of the banks in which the public money was placed in deposite , he immediately directed the Treasurer to change the mode of making pay* ments at the Treasury . For several years it had been the practice to issue warrants in favor of claimants , based on the proper appropriations , directed to the Treasurer , who made his order upon the warrants , requiring some deposite bank , convenient to the claimarts , to pay the warrants and charge their amount to the Treasury . In*tea ( l of sending them to the claimants , Mr. Woodbury directed the Treasurer to keep the warrants , and transmit his orders separately by drafts upon the banks , holding cash to his credit , in such sums , amounting to the aggregate of each warrant , as might be desired by the holders . Should these drafts be paid to the satisfaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be indebted to the bank on which they were drawn , they would enable the bank to extinguish so much of its debt to the Treasury , an ( l no complaint could arise . But if the holder of the draft did not choose to accept such payment as the bank might offer , on proof of their dishonor , they were declared to be valid claims upon the Treasury , and all collectors and receivers of public money , were instructed to receive them as cash in payment for duties and lands . By this simple arrangement public creditors were protected from the loss to which they might have been subjected from depreciated paper , and at the same time , payments into the Treasury were facilitated without violation of law . Loud complaints were made by the projectors and advocates of the suspension of specie payments , that this course which protected the public creditors from injmistice , and supported the laws , offered inducements to individuals to protest the drafts upon the banks , and // was an act of direct hostility towards those institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which its value as currency , was depreciated from ten to thirty per cent . in ( different sections of the Union , wholly for the advantage of themselves and their debtors , effecting at once a most important practical change in the burden of all existing contracts , was zealously defended as a great measure of exalted and disinterested patriotism . Great pains was taken to foment excitement through the country against the measures adopted by Mr. Woodbury , under the hope that a gcneral refusal to make any payments on public account , might be brought about , unless the irredeemable paper of the banks should be received into the public Treasury . Had the public creditors been obliged to accept such paper , in discharge of their claims upon the Treasury , the public debtors ought undoubtedly to have been permitted to pay in the same currency . Equity and fair dealing , would require that the same medium in which debts are paid , should be received in payment of dues . But the course taken by Mr. Woodbury , for the discharge of warrants , entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated the advantages anticipated from the suspension . If , by means of appeals made to the basest and most mercenary felings of a portion of the community , the irredeemable paper of the suspended banks had been received into the public Treasury , the expansion of paper currency would have doubtless increased , and in a short time the currency of the country would have been reduced to a *vorse condition than in 1816. rfhe recognition , by the Government , of depreciated paper , would have afforded irresistible motives to the banks in the different sections of the country to have increased its depreciation . The receipts into the Treasury would , as a necessary consequence , have borne a variety of values in various parts of the United States . To extricate the country from a state of things so disastrous to the industrious and producing classes , Congress as on a former occasion , would have no doubt been urged to resort to its implied powers , and recharter the Bank of the United States . The necessity for providing immediate means to sustain our arms against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while public credit was prostrated , to a departure from the law requiring payments into the Treasury to be effected in legal currency alone . The urgency of the occasion afforded the onlyapology for this breach of the principles of the Constitution . While the war continued , and the taxes raised were mainly expended within our territory , and from the condition of the country , little currency was employed in the operations incident to foreign commerce , the inconvenience was cheerfully submitted to . But the return of peace displayed at once the inequality of the burthens imposed upon different sections of the // country by this state of ' things . The actual difference in the medium in which duties were paid in the Eastern arid Southern States was from t*veuty to thirty pea ' cent . in favor of the latter , which operated as an increase ( l tax to that extent upon the former . To obviate this evil , the resolution of W16 was pasSe ( l , forbidding the receipt of irre(leemal)le paper into the * and the Bank of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such payments . Its subsequent operations overthrew a great part of the State banks which had previously furnished the medium for that purpose an ( l left a large amount of " unavailable funds " in the public Treasury in the shape of bank notes totally without value , where they still appear in the annual reports as a permanent monument of the inevitable misfortunes attendlag the adoption of temporary expedients for relief . Nor were these the whole of the evils . The expansions of ' the currency caused by the operations of the Bank of the United States , in 1817 and the first half of ISIS , stimulated the spirit of speculation which had previously existe ( l throughout the country to such an extent , that **hen that bank was able to save itself from destruction only 1w suddenly calling upon all its debtors , both banks and individuals , and to discredit the notes of every State bank in the Union , 1w refusing to receive them in payment for pul ) lic ( lues , the productive interests of every section of the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought , l ) y this means , upon our manufactures , which was absurdly attributed to any thing but its true origin . Under the cost of production which had been extravagantly raised by the previous expansions , our J ) ro ( lucers found it impossible to compete with those of foreign countries in our own markets . It was , therefore , the mismanagement of the banks which gave rise to the clamor for the increase of the tariff , and led to the establishment of the preposterous policy facetiously called the AMERICAN SYSTEM . Those who will take the trouble to follow the various steps pursued by the Bank of the United States from 1832 will be able to ju ( lge ,  --  if its managers exercised any foresight and premeditation in the great task they had assumed of regulating the currency ,  - -  whether the sufferings and embarrassments inflicted upon the people of the Union ( luring the year 1837 were not a subsequent portion of the great drama , of which the first act was perfurmed during the panic session ,  --  and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be the catastrophic an ( l consummation of the piece . During this performance , the cupidity of the State banks , and the necessity of a National Bank to control them , were the principal themes of ( leclamation by the Opposition until the suspension of specie payments was brought about . Since that event the arguinent has changed  --  to the hostility manifested by the Government // tOwar ( IS these corporations in refnsinr to receive their irredeemable paper into the Treasury . Could this great point have been carried in consequence of the dilemma into which the public service was believed to have been thrown by the unrestrained expansions of tlese banks , it would doubtless have soon plunged them iIit9 the bottomless abyss of ' permanent non-redemption , by a similar process of crippling and destroying the State banks as that practised after the former suspension , while the Bank of the United States , by means of its extensive f*reigri re sources , and the great confidence reposed in its operations by the mercantile community , might have receive1 a charter from Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only efibctual meatis for restoring that equality of payments into the Treasury required by the Con4itution . The firmness of the Executive , and the efficient arrangements adopted , on the spur of the suspension , 1*y Mr. Woodbnry , not only protected the immense amount of ' outstan ( hing contracts from the consequences of an increasing depreciation , but relieved the public finances from any pretext for committing them to a private corporation which had shown itself totally unscrupulous as to the violation of any law which interfei'ed with its interests . More than all this-*-  --  the State banks were saved from ultimate overthrow by this wise an ( l judicious course . 1'he prospect of the restimption of their duties to the community , which has already been realized to a gratifying extent , must he in a great measure attributed to the assurance aflorded , that their true advantage was only to be promoted by the discharge of their obligations . Had the banks throughout the country been encouraged not only to have continued but to have increased the expansion of irredeemable currency , by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the charter of a National Bank , for the purpose of destroying the State banks , would have been -- not " placing the credit system and the exclusive metallic system fairly in the field , face to face , with each other " - but arranging these combatants quietly side by side , under a legally established ratio of depreciation , as was ( lone I ) y our fathers during the Revolutionary war ,  --  as Russia and Austria have more recently been compelled to ( 10 in consequence of the expansions of their banks ,  --  - as will no doubt be done by Brazil , under the advice of the leading financiers in Europe , as the only effectual mode of preventing the entire subversion of property which the present condition of her bank currency must otherwise inevitably produce ,  --  and as every contest. , from the origin of commercial interchange , which has arisen between a sound and equal currency and a false and fraudulent measure of value , has resulted . On the occurrence of the suspension , the necessary arrangements for meeting the public exigencies* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time , and making suitable provision // for the balance , imposed a task upon Mr. Woodbury which required unremitting care and attention . The deficiencies from this source were supplied by drafts placed upon the banks holding public money in deposite in the mode before described . The largest payment which these banks were called on to effect , after their suspension , was the third instalment of deposite with the States , payable under the terms of the law , in July . Several of them were either unable or unwilling to pay their proportions-in some instances even to the States which had chartered them . Many transfers which had been directed by Mr. Woodhury , with the view of making seasonable provision for the last instalment , which fell due in September , had been at once stopped by the inability of the banks to execute them in consequence of the suspension . The innumerable obstacles which obviously intervened in effecting the balance of the deposits with the States under this new state of things , together with other weighty considerations relative to the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their management , induced the President to issue his proclamation for calling Congress together on the first Monday of September , 1837 . The occurrences of the *xtra Session , as well as those of the present session of Congress , relative to the management of the public finances , are presumed to be so fresh in the recollection of our readers , as not to need special reference to them . We have felt ourselves obliged to furnish a general narrative of the course taken by the Bank of the United States , and its consequences upon the commerce and prosperity of the country , in connection with Mr. Woodbury 's management of the Treasury Department , in order that the duties which devolved upon him , and the manner in which they were discharged , may be fairly understood . The expedients which have been adopted from time to time by that corporation , and the measures promoted by its partisans and advocates , for the purpose of creating an apparent necessity for its recharter by Congress , form an instructive and interesting portion of our public history ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals have acquired almost a tragic interest from the convulsions of excitement and depression , to which the industry and trade of the country have been continually subjected since 1832 in furtherance of this great design . Some of the measures accessory to the various schemes which have been from time to time devised for this purpose , have inadvertently received the countenance of very respectable portions of the democracy of the Union . We have no question but this happened under the influence of mistaken views of expediency entertained with entire honesty of motive on their part . It can not be regarded as a reproach against the general intelligence of our active business men to say , that many of them are not thoroughly informed // on the subject of currency ,  --  since one of the most experienced and successful financiers of Europe has recently expressed his deliberate opinion to a Select Corn **ittee of the house of Commons of England-an assembly of which he was himself , for mat y years , a distinguished member , though now elevated to the British Peerage , that Parliament authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Bank of England in unsuspecting ignorance of the great revolution which these measures would produce upon all contracts and pecuniary obligations . Men who are actually engaged in engrossing pursuits , rarely enjoy either the means or opportunity of considering the ultimate consequences of such measures , especially when plausibly recommn aded by pretexts of public benefit , and when immense sums are lavished upon partisan presses to advocate , as well as unwearied personal exertions are made to promote them by political and pecuniary speculatsrs . More conclusive proof of the want of correct information on the part of an influential portion of our commercial community can not be required , than their zeal and sincerity in endeavoring to carry into effect the intention lately avowed , of making the Bank of the IJaited States a great political and fiscal machine on the plan of Law 's Royal Bank-of France-notorious in history on the Mississippi scheme . The letter published by the head of that corporation , in April last , for the first time expresses the determination to adopt the principles respecting trade and money which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled the security of private property , and involved the public finances to such an extent that the ruinous consequences upon the industry and prosperity of France , were not retrieved throughout a whole gene . ration . The main feature of Law 's scheme was to make " the farms , the commerce , the factories , and the internal improvements of the country , " the basis of paper currency Every reflecting irund will perceive that unless the whole world shall agree to change the fixed capital of every nation into circulating medium , any country that enjoys extensive foreign commerce which shall adopt this plan , must be overwhelmed with disaster whenever the currency becomes depreciated , as inevitably will be the case . The bold enunciation of such a doctrine shews the extent to which the gambling operations , encouraged by this corporation , were confidently believed to have blinded and corrupted the mercantile community . Paper currency actually representing coin , into which it is eonvertible at the pleasure of the holder , is the result of a totally different system of banking . The friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection afforded to the permanent welfare of the country by the provident and efficient course pursued by the ad ministration of the General Government is appreciated by the farsighted // and judicious of all parties . Such must become the general feeling throughout the country when truth shall be understoo ( I by the people at large-that a private corporation , possessing neither soul nor conscience , and unvisited either by remorse or coinpuaction , has not only inflicted SO much suffering , distress , an ( l destruction of property , upon the community , and hopes in the execution of its ( lesigo , to control the future destinies of the nation ; but , at the present time , prevents that revival of confidence so essential to commercial enterprise . It is to the influence and example of the Bank of the United States that the general delay of the other Kinks in fulfilling their obligations to the community is to be ascribed . Claiming , as this corporation constantly has done , the most ample ability to discharge its debts , it has , in substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confess , as ivoulr be done by resumption , that its great design has miscarried , through the vigilance an ( l sagacity of the Executive , now prevents its retorn to the path of honesty and fair dealing . Whether its warfare upon . the sound and *vholesome prosperity of the country will be l ) rolormged until , like many of the splendid bubbles inflated by its operation* , it shall explode into nonentity ; or whether advantage will be taken of some convenient pretext for a speedy withdrawal from this con. * test , time only can ( letel'mine . We have had occasion to notice some of the criticisms to which the official conduct of Mr. Woodbury has been subjected . It would , however , be gross anil unjustifiable slander upon our free institutions to intimate that the vituperations which have been sho*vered upon him ( luring his administration of the I'reasury Department , have , in the slightest degree , impaired the esteem and confidence of his fellow citizens in his ability and purity of purpose . On the contrary , the amenity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupled with the firm and impartial course he has pursued during the stormy perioml we have endeavoured to describe , have unquestionably increased his previous high standing . His native State appears to appreciate justly the character and talents of Mr. Woodbury . The important and di*nifled office of Chief Justice of her Supreme Court havinir recently become vacant by the death of an individual of distinguished abilities anil virtues , who bad held it for many years-her constituted authorities have unanimously selected Mr. Woolbury for his successor . While this sketch is in the bands of the printer , we have been informed that Mr. Woodhury has been induced to waive his well known personal predilections , for the present , in favor of the paramount claims of the public service of the Union.
