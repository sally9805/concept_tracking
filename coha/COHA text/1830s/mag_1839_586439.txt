txt Few persons are so rash as to say they do not relish Milton 's Paradise Lost , and still fewer read it . We appeal to the critics themselves , and ask them , How often , during the last ten years , have you held in your hands Milton or Spencer , or even Shakspeare ? And how often have you recurred to these great names , and spoken of them as if they were your daily study ? It is as bad with the Bible , which is forever a subject of conversation . Its sublimity and pathos ; its simplicity and clearness ; its wisdom and adaptedness to all our moral wants and feelings , are set forth , upon occasions , with earnestness ; and yet few books in the libraries of scholars are so seldom read and so rarely studied . It is considered proper to say such things , and generation after generation will repeat the axiom upon trust , and the scanty knowledge gained of the Sacred page by hearing it read as Sundays . There are a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , to depart from which no one more dares than he does , at this day , to wear a cocked hat , and cue , and white-topped boots . Milton is in every body 's mouth who hopes for reputation , scholarship , and taste , while his volumes lie dust-laden on the shelf It is no small matter to get up a taste for poetry . It is no small matter to learn to read any book ; to be able to feel in the mind ideas transferred from the printed page , as vividly as when uttered by the human voice , enforced by the gesture , and illuminated by the countenance . " Mistrust , " says the author of Imaginary Conversations , " mistrust easy writing , easy versemaking , a knack at poetry . " True poetry is hewn out from the deep mines of the soul . As it is not easily uttered , it is not easily read . We must come prepared to the task , as the priesthood who robe themselves and burn incense around the altar when about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can no more be read and appreciated by a mind engaged in frivolous pursuits-can no more be fathomed by him who has never thought long and hard , and suffered , and wept , and agonized-than can the child 's tiny boat live in the tempest on the broad ocean , or the back-thread , with which the boy fishes for minnows , can sound the depths of the sea . If , according to Bacon , " Poetry is the accommodation of the shows of things to the desires of the mind , " how high and deep , how far and wide must be his reach who would understand and sympathize with the susceptive heart of the poet , with his nameless unrest , ' ' " the blind struggle of a soul in bondage , " " his sad , longing discontent ; " often with his life-weariness , his moody melancholy , and mad , stormful indignation , borne on the tones of a wild and quite // artless melody ? What must be his preparation who would follow the poet in the aspirations of an immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nature and abstraction from all gross and worldly pursuits ? At college anniversaries and Phi Beta Kappa festivals , in all professedly literary performances , there are certain names which the speaker feels bound to invoke and lug into his exercise ; no matter whether he speak from actual knowledge or not ; no matter whether he has ever read the authors he invokes or takes their sacredness by hearsay , he is safe in saying all manner of flattering things about them , and gains a reflected credit for taste and general acquaintance with literature . The fact is , the standards , as they are called , are studied little enough . In the flood of books , good and bad , which deluge the times , the old land-marks of literature are overwhelmed . It is as much as one can do to keep up with the march of modern writing , without making excursions backwards and sideways , to examine the castles and fortifications which thought once erected in the wars against ignorance , and superstition , and folly . Splendid editions of Addison and Goldsmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves of public libraries and private studies , while Talfourd and Buiwer , Lamb , Martineau , and Wordsworth are found never at hand upon the table . This is not written in a spirit of fault-finding , but as a bare statement of fact ; and away , say we , with bubblings , affectations , and lying ! Let men seem what they are ; say what they know and feel ; praise what they really admire , and choose what they love . To expect scholars to rather their food from the past alone is idle . They must find their main nourishment in the productions of those who embody in their works the spirit of the age , its deep interests and noble schemes for human advancement . Every writer is best understood in his own time . His forms of expression , his figures , allusions , his satire and praise , must all grow out of these passing events , important at the moment , but hardly worthy of a record in public memory . We except from this remark , of course , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated principles and not manners ; who have not been so anxious for present fame and popularity as for truth and others ' good . The perfect scholar will become acquainted with the ancients and the predecessors of his age in letters , as the politician will record the progress of governments , but his interest and heart will be given to the present . Antiquity and distance will not blind him to faults ; and he will remember that , if age and experience are worthy of attention , this is the old age of the world ; that now we are profiting by the experience of the past . However , to present one subject fully , there is some reason why we should look back for models upon which to form a taste for poetry . All the arts attained their highest perfection in a comparatively rude age , because there seemed to be a necessity for them . The people of those times , when books were unknown , were instructed by statues , pictures , // and poems . Verse was the vehicle in which national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . Music and measure kept unadulterated what would have been liable to addition or subtraction in prose . Victories , sacrifices , instances of elevated patriotism , were embalmed in song . We may , then , well suppose that poetry attained a higher elevation in a time when it was needed , than when it was only a refuge from ennui or the pastime of a luxurious taste . Hence , Homer became the model of Virgil , and Milton was indebted to his predecessors . But to return-while we contend that the majority of readers can have no appreciation of the highest poetry  --  a notion which accounts for the general neglect the best books have met with in the age in which they were produced , excepting national poets , like Homer and Burns-there are some fugitive pieces of poetry which have found an immediate answer in the human heart ; so natural , so true , so easy do they seem ; so directly do they address those feelings which warm the bosom of the ploughman and artisan no less than that of the scholar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs no commentator , almost no study . Its beauty , and harmony , and completeness , strike every reader , at once . Children love to recite it . Age finds consolation in its philosophy ; and humble merit blushes , while he reads , to believe that there are some who respect his unnoticed existence . There are besides passages from Shakspeare and Milton , and short poems without number of other writers , which have passed into common use and notoriety , from the fact of their being found in school books , and their being drilled and hammered , vi et armis , into the ears of the young . But these are not always the purest specimens of poetry or of the style of their authors . they have been selected for their moral sentiment , for their obvious sense , perhaps their martial tone and adaptation to declamation . Such passages and poems are never forgotten . They go far to form the taste and ear ; and in after-life they often come to us with new meaning and force , as we have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read them deeper . Poetry exists in two forms , as does music : First , there is what may , for distinction , be called the poetry of nature ; sweet harmonies dimly expressed in words ; a sense of the beautiful and lovely , of peace , purity , and God , struggling up through an imperfect utterance . The affections of woman , love , childhood , evening , flocks , woods , and streams , contented labor , and family worship , form the theme of the natural poet 's numbers . We sometimes find a simple story touchingly related , not depending upon the foreign aid of ornament , but the more graceful and winning , as it is left to stand by itself , like the " We are Seven " of Wordsworth . This is true , natural poetry . Those verses of Burns , to " Mary in Heaven , " would occur to any warm , devoted heart , under like circumstances ; he had the habit of versifying , and put them down for every one to admire and weep over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns was a natural poet , almost more than any other . We read such poetry with a feeling similar to that with which we listen to the music of birds , or the noise of waterfalls . Second , comes poetry as an art ; lines and poems written by rule and precedent , conforming to the definitions , criticisms , and conventionalities . This last , like difficult pieces of music , performed with great skill of execution , where the pleasure we feel arises rather from wonder than any concord of sweet sounds we can discover , may surprise , please , and satisfy the judgment , but it touches not the heart . There are many minds which have a taste for poetry without any trick of rhyme , as there are some with exquisite cars for music , who know nothing of the science . They perhaps do not even know the name of distinguished poets , and they make no pretensions to knowledge . These have been educated and prepared for this gift " by the gentle breeze of Heaven , " by suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibilities have been tuned to chord with rich notes and deep mysteries . Who that has never wept and mourned can do full justice to the poetry of a Hemans ? Who that has never had his mind torn and distracted by doubt can understand the poetry of Shelley ? Can he who never loved find out Shakspeare 's meaning in his sonnets ? Can he who never prays uaderstand the Bible ? When men bring out their arranged stores of learning , and display them by art , these impulsive minds we speak of may withhold their sympathy , for their thoughts and emotions must come unbidden , and of themselves , as the wind in bloxving when it listeth may chance to touch the strings of the iEolian harp , and awaken heavenly concords . But it is not a love of the mysterious and vague which constitutes a taste for poetry . It is not a love of harmonious words and flowing sentences , apt antitheses , and ingenious rhyme . A love and taste for poetry is the love and taste for beauty and excellence , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for nature and God . These feelings must be at the bottom of every heart that would hope to find an answering chord in his bosom for the true inspiration of the poet , however they may be hidden from observation by habit and passion , by bodily wants and infirmities . There are no contradictions in the character any more than there are in mathematics and the natural sciences ; it is our imperfect knowledge of each other 's motives and feelings that gives appearances of them . " To be a good orator , " says Cicero , " one must be a good man . " No less necessary is goodness to the poet , the artist , and philosopher . How vain to look for those states of holy enthusiasm and entrancement , in which great deeds are accomplished in the arts , in minds debased by selfishness and mean vices " Let him who would write heroic poems , " says Milton , " make his life an heroic poem , " and let him who would read and feel the true spirit of poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie will see , as through a glass , darkly.
