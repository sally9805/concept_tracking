txt THE Commencements at our colleges resemble , in some degree , the public games of Greece , but with a difference not very creditable to us . All Greece , and all the sons of Greece , wheresoever dispersed over the civilized world , collected at Olympia , and the other festal cities , to witness the Athletic games . The object seems scarce worth the attendance . With us a limited ,  --  though an intelligent and interested assembly ,  --  is brought together to witness , not a foot race , nor a chariot race , nor a match at quoits or in wrestling , performed by men ,  - -  who , after all , must have been but a better species of prize-fighters ; but the specimens of proficiency , and the earnest of future usefulness , exhibited by the young men , who are to be the guides and ornaments of the country . These great academic festivals ought to excite more interest . Their object is of eminent importance ; not merely for the sake of the transactions of the day , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the minds and hearts of the young men , who are then taking a new departure in life ; and also for the effect on our places of education , produced by the notice of a scrutinizing and watchful community . In former times , Commencement was a greater matter than it has since become ; and this for good reasons . There were then fewer colleges ; for a good while after the settlement of the colonies , only one in New-England , and then , for another long period , but two . We have now eight or ten , to divide the interest , which is taken , in their respective festivals , by the friends of our colleges . But in addition to this , with the progress of society , numerous other institutions have sprung up-other societies and celebrations demand attention . The calls of political life , under the present government , give employment for not a little of the time and attention , which , before the revolution , must have taken another direction ; and a dense population provides , // in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratification , which , in a simple state of society , were sought in the religious and academic celebrations . In fact ,  --  election day , and occasionally an ordination and commencement , were about the only festivals , which our self-denying ancestors were permitted to enjoy . At the present period , the red-letter days are almost a majority in the calendar . Public celebrations have greatly multiplied . Associations have become exceedingly numerous ,  --  many of them organized for public assembling and discourse ,  --  and commencement day is but one among numerous occasions , reputed of nearly equal interest , in the course of the year . Besides all this , as a community becomes prosperous , and the means of comfort and domestic enjoyment abound within doors , public places of resort lose their zest . The passion of the Greeks for out-doors life , sports , and occupations , was , no doubt , much heightened , by their detestable privation of household comforts . If commencements have declined a little in interest , ( we speak of all commencements ) the fault may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribe the order and matter of these academic festivals . The treat formerly consisted very much of orations and dialogues in the learned languages , enlivened by metaphysical discussions of points of scholastic philosophy . This must always , and to all persons , have been a terrible bore ,  --  as much so to the grave professors and reverend presidents , who were obliged to sit and seem to listen to it all , as to the young , gay , and fashionable , who thronged the galleries . This has passed away . The spirit of the age has invaded the walls of our colleges , and among numerous other reforms , has secularized the exercises of commencement day . Hebrew and Syriac orations , ( we remember a Hebrew one , on pride , from a worthy graduate , who , we are sure , knew as little of the passion , as the audience did of the language , in which he described it ) have been exorcised ; syllogistic arguments in Latin are put to flight ; and the learned tongues have scarce retained a foothold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises under various names are substantially a succession of English orations and essays ; - we speak of our colleges generally . Now of these , the number usually delivered is too great to be brought within moderate compass ; and , as the writing and speaking of a piece of composition , in his mother tongue , happens to be precisely the hardest thing in nature , of the literary kind , to do well ,  --  the very ne plus ultra of education and talent ,  --  it results that a considerable mimber , who are put to this test , although they may acquit themselves creditably , all things considered , fail of a degree of excellence , sufficient to gratify a large and mixed audience . How would it do , to select some three or four of the graduating class , those best able to do credit to themselves and to the college , by a public exhibition , and allow to them a quarter an hour or twenty minutes each ; that all thought of any thing handsome may not be crushed , by the farcical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the residue of the class some other system of rewards , and a more precise indication of relative merit ? At the commemoration at Oxford , four performances only take place ; being those of prize essayists and poets . New-England has reason to be proud of her colleges . There were in 185*7 , in all the New-England colleges , fourteen hundred students . // If we suppose a fourth to be graduated yearly , we have three hundred and fifty young men of education , annually dismissed from our places of education into the world . Of these , a large number are from other parts of the country , and naturally carry away with them , in most cases , a kindly recollection of the college , at which they have been educated . In fact , the attachment of the alumni of most of our colleges to their Alma Mater is strong and distinct enough , to form an esprit du corps , among several powerful sectjons of the community . With the lapse of time , and the growing repute and age of the colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements of political calculation , among the influences , which may affect the prospects of candidates . It is almost the only compensation , which New-England has for the irreversible decree of proscription , which the organization of the Union produces against her . It is in her destiny to exercise no permitted direct control over the interests of the country ; but her seminaries of learning enable her to wield some indirect power over public sentiment . But we have been talking of commencements in general . We must not forget that we have written Commencement at Yale College at the head of our article . The attractions of this year 's commencement at Yale were not a little heightened by the appearance of Chancellor KENT , as the orator of the Phi Beta Kappa Society , the day before . Before attending the exercise of this institution , we enjoyed an opportunity , by the kindness of Professor KINGSLEY , one of the soundest scholars and most judicious critics in the country , of visiting some of the collegiate establishments . Most of these are too well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mentioned . This instrument is , probably , the best in the country , about ten or twelve feet long , with a magnifying power of three or four hundred , of the most approved English construction and workmanship . It is the gift of Mr. CLARK , a farmer of a neighboring town , who without having himself received the advantages of a college education , and without being stimulated by theological sympathy or sectarian zeal , has been a more magnificent benefactor of Yale College , than all other individuals united ! The splendid Mineralogical Cabinet , collected by Colonel GIBBs , forms an ornament of the college too well known to be commemorated . It is the most costly and elegant in the United States , and in these respects superior to that at Cambridge , which is said , however , to be of equal scientific value . At eleven o'clock on Tuesday , we repaired to one of the churches in town , to attend the oration of the Chancellor . It was understood that , at the private meeting of the Phi Beta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branch at Harvard , in abolishing the idle injunction of secresy , which lay upon the proceedings of the fraternity . This Society , in its origin , was a college club , instituted for literary purposes . Its secret organization grew out of the youthful love of mystery , of which there are other equally harmless cases among the young men at college . In the lapse of time , this Society has acquired a new character ,  --  that of ' a literary association of a portion of the alumni of the colleges where it exists , including some of the most distinguished men of the community , and attracting to its anniversaries a resort not much inferior to that of commencement . The affectation 52 // of mystery , in an association of this character , is , of course , unwise and objectionable . We wish , in abolishing it , that the Society had gone one step further , and changed the pedantic , ill-sounding name , which is in the worst possible taste . The Chancellor 's appearance was a most gratifying incident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his graduation . The Chancellor , by the over scrupulous care of our fellow-citizens of New-York , to protect the bench from incompetent judges , has been for the last six or eight years legally superannuated ; but is blessed , nevertheless , with the still unclouded possession and exercise of one of the soundest , best adjusted* and truest intellects , that have ever adorned the country , or his profession . We do not take upon ourselves to pass judgement on the wisdom of that provision of the constitution of New-York , alluded to ; but had it been in force , with respect to the courts of the United States and Great-Britain , many years of service of some of the ablest judges , that ever sat on the bench , would have been lost to the world . Chief Justice Marshall would have been obliged to vacate his seat , fifteen or sixteen years ago . The Chancellor 's address was very happily conceived and successfully executed . It was a sketch of the efforts of the early settlers of New-England in the cause of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of an account of its successive presidents . The Chancellor did justice to the characters of the distinguished men , whom he was thus led to recal , to CLAP , STILES , DWIGHT , and their less renowned , but worthy associates , in the presidentship of the college . A great deal of matter , equally instructive and entertaining , was embodied in this survey , and presented in the peculiarly chaste and unaffected style of Chancellor Kent . He occasionally allowed himself to be drawn out into digressive remarks , suggested by the subject ; among which , those in defence of classical learning were especially well weighed and pertinent . The whole address was peculiarly seasonable , in reference to the attempt making by the associated alumni of the college , to effect a large subscription , in aid of its funds . The success of this effort must , of course , greatly depend on the warmth and concentration of the college feeling of the sons of Yale ; and this feeling could not but be strengthened and stimulated , by this happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the characters of some of its great luminaries . Accordingly , at a meeting of the alumni , which was held in the evening , to concert measures for the promotion of this object , a gratifying display was made by several gentlemen ,  --  sons of Yale ,  --  who addressed the meeting , of the most affectionate and dutiful attachment to their intellectual parent . The Chancellor himself presided at this meeting , as president , we believe , of the associated alumni . President DAY made an interesting expose of the affairs of the college , from which it appeared , that its whole disposable fund did not yield an income , much exceeding two thousand dollars per annum . All the rest of the expenditure is met by the tuition fees . It is hard to say , whether such a state of things does more credit to the personal characters and professional exertions of the faculty , by which , during a long course of years , the college has , on so insecure a foundation , maintained its respectability ; or discredit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ought to // have endowed it . It was stated by President Day , that , more than once , the institution , in consequence of its financial condition , had been in a state of peril ; and it was further added , if we mistake not , that seven thousand dollars , the part of a bank bonus , was all that could be hoped from the state . Now , what has Connecticut , what can she have or hope in the world , so honorable to her , or even so profitable , as Yale College I The possession of such an institution is more creditable to her , than ifshe had given to the United States every president , that ever filled the chair ; and , if she allows it to suffer , for want of patronage , it will be an ineffaceable blot on her annals . If a handsome sum were annually granted to the college ,  --  as the high school of the commonwealth ,  --  out of the school fund , it would do more good , than all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses were made at the meeting of the alumni ; and , among them , the glowing and affectionate appeal of Mr. L. C. DUNCAN , of NewOrleans , commanded the sympathy of all who heard him . The intention of the Society is to raise one hundred thousand dollars , on easy terms of subscription ; and , of this liberal sum , a third part , we believe , is already subscribed . We heard , with equal admiration and pain , that very large sums had been subscribed towards this fund , by President DAY , Professor SILLIMAN , and other members of the faculty . This ought not so to be . Those gentlemen do all their duty to the college and the public , by the assiduous and faithful discharge of their official trust . They ought not , out of their frugal salaries , to be allowed to tax themselves to aid its finances . We are sure , the wealthy sons of Yale will not allow these subscriptions to take effect , in any other way , than that of creating a new title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in behalf of these excellent and eminent men . The next day , ( September 14th ) we attended commencement . The assembly was held in a very large church , capable of accommodating nearly twice as many as the church at Cambridge , and crowded to excess . The greater part of the exercises manifested good studies , maturity of thought , and manliness of character . The elocution was throughout good , frequently excellent ; and , in fact , if we may be perzuitted to judge from this commencement , and the last at Cambridge , the ancient tone is banished from our colleges . Would that the prompter , that evil genius , which at Yale , as well as Harvard , still haunts over academic exhibitions , could be banished also ! Among the exercises , were some , which , though admirably composed , and spoken with much effect , and to the great satisfaction of the audience , were of a character , which will disappear , probably , before long , from the collegiate stage . We refer to the colloquy and dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have observed , were exceedingly well done , and were , probably , to most of the audience , the most attractive part of the performances . At any rate , we did not observe that the hearty expressions of pleasure , which they drew forth , proceeded exclusively from the young of either sex . Even the dignity of the stage , where the learning and gravity of the corporation and faculty were arrayed , furnished no defence against the contagious merriment excited by these exercises . And , perhaps , these very circimmstances may furnish a ground for discontinuing such levelling perf.rmnances . It would bear a question , whether an academic dignitary // ought to be put to laughter , by any thing less excruciating , than a Latin pun . " Veiled in the decent obscurity of a learned language , " we tolerate , at Cambridge , a little pleasantry in the valedictory orator ; but the cloisters of a college ought to afford an asylum from profane vernacular wit . The exercises were divided into two portions , one of which was performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ceremonial of conferring the degrees is the same which has descended to our colleges , from the academic institutions of Great-Britain , and which is , we believe , discontinued or modified in that country , and might be ,  --  ( as on former occasions , we have observed , in reference to the same ceremony at Cambridge , ) - reformed with advantage in this . A short Latin form , describing correctly the nature of the occasion , as the termination of the college course , ought to be substituted for that which is now in use , which has no foundation in the laws or customs of our community . On the present occasion at Yale , a very large class received the honors of the institution , whose graduates have for some time been considerably more numerous , than those of any other of our colleges . From the tone and sentiments expressed by many of the performers , it might safely be inferred , that they departed from the walls of the college , with feelings of respect and gratitude . Numerous expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing assurance , that the faculty had succeeded in the most difficult part of their honorable vocation , that of retaining the affections of the students . The ceremony of the valedictory address , as performed at New-Haven , is singularly beautiful and toughing . The gallery of the church was cleared for the graduating class ; and when the ora* tor reached the part of his performance appropriated to the valedictory address , the whole class rose . Upon the whole , the exercises were , in the highest degree , gratifying ; and the assembly in the Cabinet of Minerals , at noon , during the recess , exhibited a scene of mutual congratulation , among the children and friends of the college , and strangers attracted by the occasion , of the most exhilarating character . It was impossible not to take an honest pride , as a New-Englander , in witnessing the prosperous condition of so noble an institution . How grateful ought we not to be to our pious ancestors , who , amidst the incredible hardships that surrounded them , turned their thoughts to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their posterity , beyond what Providence granted to them ! How imperative is the obligation on us , to go along with the progress of improvement , and to take care , in our day and generation , that these perman*nt institutions should faithfully represent the advancing state of science , that our children may be better taught ( as they ought to be in a period when learning is progressive ) than their fathers . New-Haven is one of the most beautiful towns in the United States . It is laid out on a regular plan , with streets at right angles to each other . The college buildings are erected on one side of the square , which is divided by a street running through it . In the portion of the square nearest the college , are several churches , and the state-house . The latter has been lately constructed , on a Grecian plan , and in very good taste . The lower half of the square is without buildings . The // whole is surrounded by houses of sightly appearance , and , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our large cities . The streets are not paved , and the porous quality of the soil enables the inhabitants to enjoy the luxury of an unpaved street , without the inconvenience of mud in wet weather . The appearance of the environs of New-Haven is in keening with the neatness and elegance of the city , and presents a succession of prospects , on either side , of uncommon beauty . It would be wrong not to mention , in connection with the college , the institution for popular instruction , lately founded by the liberality of a single individual ,  --  a mechanic of the place . This gentleman has appropriated a part of the property , acquired by laborious and honest industry , in erecting an establishment for scientific and popular instruction . It comprises a lecture-room of fine dimensions , a chemical laboratory , a mineralogical cabinet , and a collection of shells , scientifically arranged . The establishments will be extended and enlarged with the success of the institution . It is placed under the care of Mr. SHEPHARD , as curator ; a gentleman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecturer to Professor Silliman . Mr. BREWSTER , the liberal and enterprising proprietor , looks to the fees of those who shall attend the courses , for the support of the institution , and his own reimbursement . We can not doubt that the experiment , so judiciously planned and commenced under such favorable auspices , will , in the midst of a population , like that of New-Haven , be crowned with entire success . It is worthy of all praise , as an example to others . In what possible way can any person appropriate a few thousand dollars , with equal hope of doing good to the present generations , and those that shall come after ? Let no one leave New-Haven , without going to see Jephthah and his Daughter , a group nearly completed in marble , by Mr. AUGUR , a native and self-taught artist . This extraordinary person , if we have been rightly informed , has passed the earlier years of his life , in occupations the most humble , and least congenial to the cultivation of the taste and talent , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . cuted , we believe , little else than a Sappho , a copy of the head of the Apollo Belvidere , and the present group , which is not yet quite finished . The female figure is complete , and in the highest degree beautiful . The attitude is well conceived ; the expression of surprise and affectionate disappointment , at her father 's averted looks , is admirable . The drapery is finely disposed and wrought . The father , we thought , not quite equal to the daughter , though still treated in a masterly style . We were told that this extraordinary artist works without model , or even drawing , transferring his conceptions directly from his mind to the marble . We trust he may be persuaded to adopt a less adventurous method . It is not the object of any artist to work miracles . And truly miraculous as it seems to be , that a group , like this , should be wrought without a model , yet , in his further studies and efforts , we trust Mr. Augur will be convinced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may do more with means , than without . Mr. Augur can not be unwilling to employ those aids , which were made use of , in the same noble art , by Canova , Michad Angelo , and Phidias ; and without which , though he may produce a few works , // which will astonish and gratify the public , he can scarcely make a sure and rapid progress to the heights of his profession . Should he have the opportunity of forming himself at Rome , under the eye of the distinguished living artists there collected , and in the presence of the departed masters of the art , of ancient and modern days , who teach in their immortal works , there is scarce any eminence in sculpture which he may not fairly hope to reach . The new Grave-Yard in New-Haven is visited by every stranger . It wants nothing but trees to make it a delightful spot . There are the monuments to some of the distinguished presidents of the college . General HUMPHREY5 ' 5 epitaph declares the obligations under which he laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he introduced from Spain . But WHITNEY 'S monument perpetuates the name of a still greater public benefactor . His simple name would have been epitaph enough , with the addition , perhaps , of the " inventor of the cotton gin . " How few of the inscriptions in Westminster Abbey could be compared with that ! Who is there that , like him , has given his country a machine ,  --  the product of his own skill ,  --  which has furnished a large portion of its population , " from childhood to age , with a lucrative employment ; by which their debts have been paid off ; their capitals increased ; their lands trebled in value ! " * It may be said , indeed , that this belongs to the physical and material nature of man , and ought not to be compared with what has been done by the intellectual benefactors of mankind ; the Miltons , the Shakspeares , and the Newtons . But is it quite certain , that any thing short of the highest intellectual vigor ,  --  the brightest genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines ? Place a common mind before an oration of Cicero , and a steam engine , and it will despair of rivalling the latter as much as the former ; and we can by no means be persuaded , that the peculiar aptitude for combining and applying the simple powers of mechanics , so as to produce these marvellous operations , does not imply a vivacity of the imagination , not inferior to that of the poet and the orator . And then , as to the effect on society , the machine , it is true , operates , in the first instance , on mere physical elements , to produce an accumulation and distribution of property . But do not all the arts of civilization follow in the train ? And has not he who has trebled the value of land , created capital , rescued the population from the necessity of emigrating , and covered a waste with plenty-has not he done a service to the country , of the highest moral and intellectual character ? Prosperity is the parent of civilization , and all its refinements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , is an addition of so many thinking , inventing , moral , and immortal natures.
