txt THE previous publications of Dr. Lieber upon punishment and penal law , give him a strong claim to be heard with attention whenever he speaks upon these and similar subjects . His " Remarks on the Relation between Education and Crime , " published in 1835 , and his Introduction , Notes , and Additions to his translation of Beaumont and De Tocqueville 's work on the Penitentiary System in the United States , contain the results of patient examination , reflection , and inquiry upon the great questions of criminal law , and the prevention and correction of crime , and recommend themselves by their enlightened humanity no less than by their philosophical spirit . The present work , an elaborate pamphlet of about a hundred pages , has been called forth by the controversy which has been some time going on in the country between the friends of what are commonly called the Pennsylvania system and the Auburn system , and is an exposition of the advantages of the former , the principle of which is uninterrupted solitary confinement at labor , while that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor by day . A part of the work only is devoted to a comparison of the two systems ; and , before proceeding to this portion of his proposed subject , he engages in a thorough examination of the questions , whence we derive the right of civil punition , what are its due limits , and for what precise purpose we punish ; since , in point of fact , punishment is necessary , and society does possess the right to inflict it . He first examines the various grounds , which have been assumed , in order to find the source of the right of punishment . The theory of expiation is defective in this , that expiation is a purely moral act , and belongs to the forum of conscience alone . Necessity or expediency , which seeks // for the right of punishment in the effect of the punishment alone , without regard to the offender , affords neither a right to punish , nor a standard of the application of suffering . Somewhat similar to this is the theory of deterring , - establishing examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting to them the suffering which it has brought upon others . This , in the first place , does not answer the question , Whence do we derive the right to punish ? Moreover , we have no right to make use of one human being as an instrument simply , to make him suffer solely for the benefit of others . Besides , the theory does not give us a just standard of punishment ; because the legislator would be bound to affix the several penalties , not to those crimes which are the most atrocious , but to those which men were most strongly tempted to commit . The theory of special prevention , or the depriving the criminal of the power of committing the same offence a second time , settles no principle and admits of no scale of punishment ; because the means of effectual prevention must be always the same , - death or imprisonment for life . Some found the right of punishment in the theory of warning , - in the right which the state has to warn every one , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every offence . This , however , begs the question , for , " when we are asked to grant the truth , that the state has a right to warn its citizens , we either understand by warning , simply and strictly warning , or warning with the right of executing the threatened penalty in case of contravention . If we mean the first , we grant nothing , and no right of punishment can be deduced from our concession ; if we mean the second , we grant the very thing to be proved , namely , the right of punishing . " Besides , it is defective in affording no standard of punishment . The theory which rests the right of punishment upon a civil contract , by which society punishes offences as so many breaches of the contract entered into between it and the individual members composing it , is invalidated , in Dr. Lieber 's opinion , by two objections ; in the first place , that there is no such contract in point of fact ; and , in the second place , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right which the contracting parties had of making it . Many philanthropists have asserted , that the only legitimate object of punishment , and therefore the only ground on which // we can found the right of punishing , is the correction or reform of the convict . Although the reform of the criminal enters largely into every true penal theory , it is far from affording us the right of punishment . The moral correction of the citizens , as such , is not one of the obligations of the state ; if it were , the most insufferable inquisitorial power would be established . Various other objections may be urged against it , on theoretical grounds ; and , in practice , it is next to impossible to decide , with any degree of satisfactory probability , whether reform in any given case , is real or pretended . Retaliation , as the sole basis and object of punishment , admits of nearly the same objections to which expiation is liable ; and it becomes the more objectionable , the more it approaches to revenge . Retaliation and revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early stages of society , when the state has not yet clearly severed itself from the family , and personal wrongs are taken to be family wrongs . From this arises the system of composition , by which offences are estimated in certain rates of money to be paid by the offending to the offended party . The next step in the progress of penal law is to have these compositions assessed by a judge , with power to punish in default of payment . Some distinguished philosophers have maintained , that punishment is merely retribution , and that civil punition is inflicted for the sake of justice , and for no other reason . This opinion rests upon a confusion of sin , or offence against the moral law , with crime , or offence against the state . The theory , moreover , leaves unanswered the question , Why should a man be punished for the sake of justice ? The theory , which establishes the right to punish from the principle of self-defence , originally vested in the individual , and subsequently in the state , would lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , places all means at our disposal , and leaves it to our own will to make the selection . Having stated his objections to these various theories and opinions on the nature of punishment , Dr. Lieber proceeds to give his own views upon the subject , considering it under the following heads ; What is the nature of punishment ? On what grounds rests the punitory power , or whence do we derive penal right ? What is the standard of punishment ? What is the object of punishment ? // The state he defines to be a society founded on right , or a jural society , the word jural being legitimately formed from the Latin jus , as rural is from rus ; and with reference to state , corresponding to the word religious with reference to church . Right is here taken in its primordial sense , as that which gives the foundation of all single rights . All the relations of the individual to the state must be founded on right , or the idea of the just ; and we can do nothing within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not first establish the right we may have to do it . The state is by no means to be confounded with society at large . The state is established for the protection of society , and is its necessary manifestation ; but it is distinct from it . " Now , if we call right , that which indicates man 's relations to the state , or that which is the necessary consequence of his relations , founded on the just , towards others , that which the state is bound to grant him , punishment , is the right between society and the offender , or , however paradoxical it may appear at first glance , the right both of the society and the offender . " But to meet this definition , punishment must be at once just and necessary . All ide*i of the just is founded in equality ; and every member of the state must grant to others the right he claims for himself ; and , if he interferes with the rightful state of others , he grants them the abstract right to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has its origin in abstract right , passes over into the state ; for the state is a society , in which every one individually owes certain duties to every one collectively , and each interference with the rights of the individual is an interference with the state , a wrong inflicted upon it . The law of retaliation was deficient in this point , that it omitted the consideration of the object we have in view in the infliction of evil or suffering ; for , though we may have the abstract right , yet if we inflict pain without a good purpose in view , it becomes cruelty ; and this establishes the principle , " that though equality , and the idea on which the state is founded , give us the abstract right of retaliation , we can make use of it only so far as it shall be found necessary . " The question , What is the standard of punishment ? is closely connected with this ; What is the object of punishment ? The first object of the state is the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twofold , material and intellectual , // direct or indirect . Direct security is positive protection against direct wrong ; indirect security is that security , which results from the maintenance of that general state of society , without which its ends can not be obtained . The true standard of punishment , therefore , is the danger , material or intellectual , to society ; and the effect the punishment has on society or the punished individual himself . Disproportionate punishments are objectionable on two accounts ; because they are unjust , and consequently opposed to the idea of the just , on which the state is founded , and because the effect of the punishment is destroyed . Reciprocity , on the ground of equality , being the principle of the right of punishment , immorality becomes punishable when and because it interferes with the rights of others . A committed wrong is not only the material wrong done to our neighbour , but the moral wrong of interference with the rights of others . It is on this ground , that the state has a right to punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence against the animal itself can be committed , if the cruelty be committed publicly , it is an offence against the rights of the citizens who see it ; and it is no answer to say that the animal belongs to his tormentor , for no man has a right to do as he pleases with his own . We are aware , that we have given a very imperfect abstract of this portion of Dr. Lieber 's pamphlet , which admits , indeed , of very little condensation , it being a close and compact piece of reasoning , which embraces many original and striking views , and deserves and will well repay a diligent study . Having settled certain preliminary and fundamental principles , he proceeds to give a sketch of the various characteristics which sound punishment ought to possess . These we should be glad to transfer to our pages in full , did our limits permit ; but we must content ourselves with copying the tabular abstract , which he himself has furnished . " Punishment , with regard to its principle , ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Striking the offender alone . With regard to its effect IV . It ought to prevent crime , By warning the community , By correcting the offender , politically or morally , // By maintaining the moral character of the state . V. It ought to protect .

It must annihilate all causes of crime , wherever it has a right to act , ( within or without the convict. ) *- pp. 43,44 . Dr. Lieber next proceeds to examine the various punishments which have been in use among mankind , with a view to ascertain how large a proportion each one contains of the above characteristics of punishment as it ought to be . The following is the list of those he passes under reviews " Apology , or publicly asking pardon . Fine . Ridicule . Censure . Dishonor . Declaration of unworthiness of public confidence . Privation of privileges . Degradation . Distinction in dress . Infamation of the offenders Infamation of his descendants . Pillory . Whipping . Public whipping . Brand . " ing . Infliction of pain otherwise than by whipping . Imprisonment . Imprisonment with public labor . Exile . Transportation . Maiming . Death . Death , with additional pains or in amatory procedures . " - pp. 44 , 45 . For his valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his candid estimate of their various excellences and defects , we must refer our readers to the pamphlet itself , as we could not copy them entire , without VOL . XLVII. - NO. cm. 58 // occupying too much room , and it would be doing injustice to the author , to attempt any condensation of his views , which are already stated with great brevity . The result to which he arrives , is , that there is no form of punishment , which presents so many advantages as imprisonment , attended with the insulation of each prisoner . The principle being thus established , the next question is , How shall it be put in practice ? The advocates of the Pennsylvania system , so called , say that nothing short of actual , material insulation is sufficient ; the advocates of the Auhurn system , on the other hand , contend , that all the necessary effects of insulation can be obtained by actual separation during night , and joint labor in silence during the day . The remainder of the pamphlet is devoted to a discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objections urged against it by the advocates of the Auburn system , and of what are conceived to he the unavoidable disadvantages of the Auburn system . We present to our readers an extract , containing an exposition of the supposed advantages of the Pennsylvania system . " We conceive uninterrupted solitude and labor of equal importance , for the following reasons 1 . It prevents effectually contamination , and it alone can effectually prevent it . It allows , therefore , the offender , at any rate , not to grow worse . " 2 . It is essentially both a stern and a humane punishment ; stern , because solitude is stern in its character and especially so to men , who nearly without exception have spent their lives in boisterous intercourse with fellow criminals ; and humane , because it is a privation rather than an infliction . It is mild , and acknowledged as such by the offenders themselves , after the first irksomeness of solitude has passed , especially if they have passed previously through several other prisons or penitentiaries . Whomever of this class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently their eyes would flash with resentment when they spoke of penitentiaries founded on other plans . Solitary confinement at labor is decidedly a calm punishment . " 3 . It is emphatica1lv graduable and accommodable , as no other species of punishment . The offender , undisturbed by others , or by new inflictions of punishment , receives from solitude just that impression , which his peculiar case or disposition calls for or is capable of . // " 4 . Advice and exhortation can be adapted to each single case in no other punishment , so precisely and justly like moral medicine , as in solitary confinement . The religious adviser , assistant , and comforter can enter the solitary cell at any time ; and , as all religious conversations with a convict must have much of the character of a confession , the undisturbed cell , overheard by no one , is the very place for this converse . In no other penitentiaries can this religious instruction be given so effectually. " 5 . Solitude is the weightiest moral agent to make the thoughtless thoughtful ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminally thoughtless . Solitude h ms been sought by the wisest and best of mankind , to prepare themselves for great moral tasks ; it is the only means to bring the offender to a more rational course . Labor united with solitude , gives steadiness to the thought , and makes it possible to support solitude with ease for those who have not been accustomed to abstract reflection before . " 6 . It is the only punishment known , which does not irritate anew , does not challenge opposition in mind or body ; for it is the only punishment which can dispense with the whip or other means of coercing to obedience , because it takes away the opportunity of offending anew , with the exception of such offences as destroying instruments or materials , for which again the more negative disciplinary means of withholding labor or diminishing rations are sufficient . " 7 . It makes the lonely prisoner love labor as faithfully as the dearest companion , - a companion who will be with him for life . " 8 . It does not deaden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many into repentance by its absence of all harshness , as I frequently have found . It does not inflict on those , who have a strong sense of shame , the additional punishment of exposure . " 9 . It does not expose the convict to acquaintance , even by night , with other criminals , who out of the prison form a very compact fraternity , to escape from the clutches of which forms the most difficult obstacle in the way of resuming an honest life . The history of innumerable convicts proves this . Whenever I have asked recommitted convicts why , simply on the score of worldly prudence , they had not abstained from a second crime , they would invariably answer , You do not know these things ; a man leaving the prison , very often thinks , You shall not catch me again . ' He begins to work , when old acquaintances will come , induce one to drink and talk , and all will end by agreeing upon a new job . If one re // sists , he is ridiculed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so firmly buried in his victirri 's flesh , as that of criminal acquaintance in the life of an offender. " 10 . It contradicts for the first time , by irresistible fact , the convicts in their belief that society is at war with them , in which they please themselves so much , that frequently they argue as if they were the hunted , the pursued , the injured . 11 . The punishment has , therefore , what I have called an elevating character . It touches the man in the convict , not the brute . The convict sees himself treated as one on whom far different things than stripes can have an effect . 12 . It is , perhaps , the only punishment which allows us to select men for superintendents of prisons in whom sternness does not overbalance kindness . 13 . It tiains the convict in cleanliness , and paying attention to the neatness of his dwelling it imparts an attention to the room , which becomes the irwipient stage of love of home , with those who have lived in slouchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frill of meaning , Cleanliness is next to godliness . ' A strictly cleanly man of the laboring classes will never be so much exposed to offend against the laws , as a disorderly , dirty person . Cleanliness , a highly important ingredient of national civilization , is equally such in political reform . 14 . All the reasons given in favor of the Pennsylvania plan assume still higher importance with the youthful or first offenders , because their minds are yet more ready to receive good impressions , and they have not yet formed that vast association with criminals of older standing . I was once present when a convict vas brought to be entered in the Philadelphia Penitentiary . His age , - he was past forty , and the peculiar manner with which he spoke of his mode of life , which can not be designated precisely as frivolity , but rather professional indifference , attracted my attention . He had been seventeen years of his life in prison , never before in a penitentiary on the Pennsylvania plan ; and I chose him as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old offender , who had lived in various lines , but always in that trade , ' as his words were . I can not give here an extract of my journal , respecting him , but will merely mention that John , - this was his name , - after having treated lightly the confinement , and not having changed for a long time to speak with frankness indeed , but also with perfect unconcern of his trade , ' and the various lines in which the different nations excel , one day said to me of his own accord , and with more gravity than I had been accustomed to observe with him ; Sir , what will become // of me , I do n't know . To he sure , I now think it foolish enough to live as I have done ; hut I do not know how it will he , when I get out . I am accustomed to nothing else . But , Sir , had they put me here when I committed my first offence , I know for certain I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rae a great advantage of the Pennsylvania system , that the prisoner is not prevented , by false shame , from lending his ear to better counsel , and gradually changing for the better . Wherever a number of men live together in close community under some superiors , a degree of fear exists of being considered by their comrades as a peculiar favorite of those placed over them , on account of stricter compliance with the respective laws and rules . We find this in schools , colleges , among soldiers , sailors , &amp;c . The individual does not wish to be . suspected of using unfair means , or being an informer , in order to obtain this favor ; and this well founded feeling leads generally to the excess I have alluded to . In a community , however , in which a ready compliance with the rules of the superiors becomes , in a manner , a reproach to the others , a joining of the opposite party as it were , a declaration of the intention to abandon in future those who , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution and moral character to brave the sneers of former comrades , and , perhaps , own false shame of declaring one 's self ready to surrender . The apprehension of a nickname is one of the most powerful agents in any community ; but how easily is such a nickname , a taunt , a word of contempt , passed on in the lockstep of the Auburn system . All this difficulty is happily removed in our system ; no false shame awaits the convict when he shows the first signs of sorrow , when he utters his first ackno*vledgment of guilt or folly ; at least no shame of appearing weak before comrades in guilt , which is far more powerful than that of surrendering to those whom the prisoner almost always allows to be better , with the same readiness with which a prostitute will always speak of other women as virtuous ones . " 16 . The convict thinks in kindness of his keepers , arid the memory of the penitentiary is not a galling sore , when he has left it , and chooses to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the skill of the officers , or a long apprenticeship , than the Auburn system , in order to make it answer at all . The Pennsylvania system , therefore , is easier to be introduced . " 18 . It is sufficient with our race and at the stage of civilization we are now in , and no more , which is what a punishment ought to he . This point , which by experience alone , i. e. by close and circumspect observation of reality , not by hasty // numbers and rash conclusions , can be decided , appears so to us ; and none of us has seen reason as yet to change his opinion . 19 . Finally , it offers the greatest security , being in this superior to all other species of imprisonment . " - pp. 62- 67 . The disadvantages of the above system are stated to be , not of a moral or essential character , but merely accidental , and to consist principally in the greater expense of building the prison , and in the fact that many profitable species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be carried on within doors , or because they require joint labor ; and prisons are , obviously , not erected to make money , but to punish , and if possible to reform by punishment , and no pecuniary considerations should be allowed to interfere with this purpose . The objections made by those who prefer the Auburn system , are stated to be comprehended under the following heads ; that we have no right to condemn a human being to uninterrupted solitude , that it is a violation of the law of God , that solitude drives men to despair , and that the Sabbath can not be properly celebrated . Dr. Lieber meets these several objections with great firmness , and controverts the positions of his opponents with much force of argument , clothed in vigorous and occasionally eloquent language . His remarks in reply to the last charge are deserving of particular attention . The concluding pages of the pamphlet are occupied with a statement of objections to the Auburn system . The friends of uninterrupted confinement at labor , while they acknowledge the Auburn system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment , are nevertheless opposed to it on the following grounds . Because , while it admits that insulation is the fundamental principle of all sound discipline , it does not carry it out , but stops short of its true effect . Because it can not be maintained without personal violence and the constant use of the whip . Because the inmates become known to each other , which knowledge , in after life , may be so employed as to defeat the efforts made by the discharged convict to lead a good life . Because the community ought to have confidence in a prison , which can only be maintained by free access to it ; and the allowing of persons to come and gaze freely at the prisoners , when met together // for labor , is objectionable ; and , finally because , if the principle of cheapness be maintained , it will be impossible to give to the cells on the Auburn plan , those dimensions , and that character , which they should have . These various objections are earnestly and eloquently supported , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts are stated , which were learned by Dr. Lieber from the lips of convicts themselves . The summary of his objections to the Auburn system , is stated in the following paragraph " We think , then , that the Auburn system does not effect what it strives to effect ; does not afford an accommodable punishment ; does not sufficiently prevent the growing worse of the convict ; does not obtain the highest effect with the smallest means ; requires physical violence to be maintained , and , therefore , irritates anew ; is not well calculated for that religious or intellectual instruction which the criminal requires ; does not prevent entirely contamination , and does not calm the prisoner ; while it offers no other advantage than that of saving money in the first outlay , which , we think , is vastly overbalanced by the steady , sure , mild , yet effective mode of the Pennsylvania system , and therefore believe the latter to be greatly preferable . " - pp. 89 , 90 . It has been our object , in the foregoing remarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieber 's pamphlet , without going into any speculations of our own ; and we are sensible how little justice our imperfect analysis does to its sterling merits . To all persons who are interested in the great questions of prison discipline and penal law , we recommend its diligent perusal . It is the production of one , who has thought deeply and carefully upon these subjects , and advanced nothing rashly or crudely , and is enriched with those facts and observations , which are the results of practical knowledge and personal experience , and is written in a vigorous English style , which betrays the foreign origin of its author , only by an occasional stiffness of expression , and not by any violations of idiom . Of course , many will reject his conclusions upon the much controverted subject of the comparative merits of the two systems ; but all candid minds must unite in assigning a high value to his remarks upon the nature and ends of punishment in general , which occupy rather more than half of the whole pamphlet . Whoever , hereafter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , without // first giving it a careful examination , must be considered as having undertaken a task , for which he had not yet entirely qualified himself.
