txt AN able writer in the New-England Magazine for January last , under the head affixed to this article , has made certain statements and arguments which deserve notice for more reasons than one . They are both more candid and more clear than most of the opposition has been , which the Colonization Society has been obliged to encounter , and are , of course , both more susceptible and more worthy of an answer . Much of this opposition , we are inclined to think , has been quite as often guided by zeal as by knowledge ; and we take this fitting occasion to make the same remark of the other party in the question . There are many individuals in it , as there are in all parties of much moment , who injure the cause by their well-meant but over-strained exertions to do good . Some are violent , and others are visionary , upon both sides , and these classes are equally ill adapted to convince or conciliate . But in cool reasoning-among uncommitted spectators and auditors-there is no necessity of confounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who discuss them . Setting aside , then , the exaggerated calculations of friend and foe alike , let us judge the Colonization Society , so far as there may be occasion to judge it at all ,  --  not by common conversation or speeches at conventions , nor even by indiscriminate reference to the pages of its authorized Repository ,  --  but by facts and principles ,  --  by the system itself , and by its history . But let not our readers anticipate an elaborate inquiry into the strength of all the positions which have been urged against the institution . We do not even intend to make out an entire exposition in favor of it . This , were it necessary , would be inconsistent with the proper limits of a magazine essay . Our intention , therefore , is only to show that several of the statements of the writer in this case , to say the least , admit of some doubt ; and that the arguments built upon them , of course , admit of some controversy . He begins by numbering among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not America , is the native country of negroes born in thi // hemisphere . Taking it for granted that something like this has been said by somebody upon some occasion , and supposing also that more enemies than advocates have been made for the institution by the expression of such views , the only inference is , in the language of the writer , that it was " extremely bad policy . " And so also many of the attacks which are daily made upon slavery and slaveholders are extremely bad policy . But does that fact go to prove that the opponents of slavery are in the wrong , or the supporters of it in the right ? We think not . It only proves that a good cause may suffer in rash hands . But we do not admit with the writer , that America is as much the country of the blacks , bond or free , as it is ours . We do not admit , that if the slaves of Alabama , becoming free , should insist upon sending their former masters back to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonization Society . " This is our country , indeed , by birth ; but it became our ancestors ' by adoption . They were voluntary emigrants , as are the tens of thousands who come among us , every year and every month , from other portions of the continent and from most of the kingdoms of Europe . But the ancestors of the blacks , and they alone , came here by compulsion . They and their descendants have remained here by compulsion . Most of them have lived and died in slavery . A small proportion , something like one in six or seven at the present time , have , by various means and in various places , become free . These only , we conceive , can with any pretext of justice , be said to have adopted this country as their own . But the truth is , they have not been at liberty to do that . State after state is , at this very time , driving them from place to place , as fast as they become free , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge ; and the latter , on the other hand , are taking or must take corresponding measures of an equally vigorous character , for keeping them out . Can these people be said to possess this country as we do ? We venture to assert , on the contrary , that a great portion of those who are safely located in the states which at present tolerate them , are not virtually free to make choice of their country . It is a matter of necessity with them , and is becoming so more and more every day . They are compelled by legislative enactments , in the first place , to abandon one section for another . They are then compelled , in the second place , to remain in such section as they flee to , for want of means and opportunity to abandon a country which they would gladly abandon if they could , or which , at any rate , they can not be said to have adopted* until some power of choosing is allowed them . Now here it is that the Colonization Society comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enabled more than two thousand individual free blacks ,  --  so called ,  --  to transport themselves to the African shore . These men were glad to go , but , without charitable assistance , were utterly unable . That these two thousand , or that the great body of the free colored population at large , love the country " which disowns , con temns and oppresses them , " may fairly admit of so much doubt as to justify asking them the question . That they are disowned , and contemned , and oppressed ,  --  that they are " thrust forth as aliens and outcasts , " from a large number of the large states ,  --  and that where they are generally native ,  --  admits of no doubt . Under these circumstances , is it not merciful , as well as just , to give them the power as // well as the liberty to adopt freely a residence of their own ? This is the only thing proposed . The Society , as the writer honestly allows , do not wish to remove any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . " They only offer him the opportunity of throwing off the thraldom which the law at present imposes . They do not make it necessary for him to emigrate to another continent ; they take away , as far as they can , tLe necessity of his remaining in this . We have said but little of the disadvantages and mortification ander which the free blacks notoriously labor , wherever in this country their presence is tolerated at all . It is sufficient to observe in this connexion , for the present , that these disadvantages , and these mortifications ,  --  independently of the actual legislative restraints already referred to ,  --  are amply sufficient to raise a presumption , a priori , that they would be rid of them if they could . This , too , the Colonization Society is aware of . It is a matter of universal comment ; and this alone , we conceive , would be enough to justify , and far more than justify , the tendering of the means of removal and freedom to this most unfortunate class of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man pretends to charge this state of things upon them as their own fault . It would be our fault , however , if , when the means of relieving them stand ready at our hands , or might be easily sought out , we should make no movement to use them . The least we can do , it would seem , is to suffer any to exercise this charity who choose to do so . The expense and trouble , to say nothing of opprobrium and opposition , constitute guaranty enough of their disinterestedness , at least ; and let the other part  --  the objects of this charity-be equally free to accept or refuse it . They have a right to be the sole judges , if they are not , in fact , the best , of their own business . The writer says , they are , almost to a man , opposed to the project of emigration . Now , if this were true , it is clear there would be no far* ther occasion for anxiety among the opponents of Colonization . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is expressly admitted that they do not . What more , then , can be done ? Is it not clear , that , if the Society transports only voluntary emigrants , and none such are to be found , it will at least do very little harm ? But we regard this statement as a strong exaggeration . It is said in support of it , that , at all the recent conventions of the free blacks , they have passed resolutions to this effect , and " some of them have declared that they will hold all who may consent to embark for Africa as traitors . " This , in our opinion , only goes to show that some of the free blacks , like many of their white fellow-citizens , are opposed to the scheme in question ; and they not only have a right to be so opposed , but such might naturally be expected to be the case . Unanimity of opinion upon this subject , however desirable it may be , and howeve*r reasonable it may appear to the friends of colonization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need not enlarge on the commonplace observation , that popular questions of any moment always give rise to parties . We need not allude to the great pains which some of our own citizens ,  --  sincere and benevolent men , we have no doubt ,  - -  have taken and are taking to promote this division of opinion . It is sufficient to suggest , that the Colonization Society expect opposition , however much they regret it , from all classes . The effects of it , like // that of discussion generally , may even be beneficial to them at present , and still more so hereafter , when the truth shall be fairly arrived at . But , be that as it may , the essential character of their scheme remains the same . We should add that the proportion of the free blacks who favor the society , and would be glad to avail themselves of its aid , is none the smaller and none the less respectable ,  --  at all events , none the less objects of charity ,  --  because they call no conventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this course might have done better , appeared sufficiently , we think , from the tenor of their resolutions , as cited above . To speak in moderate terms , they indicate extraordinary passion , and a disposition to use all the force they are masters of for retaining in this country the free blacks who are desirous of leaving it . But , as we have said before , the violence of partizans proves little or nothing , though it generally creates and sometimes seems to authorize a presumption , that they are either ignorant or desperate , and perhaps both . So much for the writer 's proof of his statement that the free blacks are , almost to a man , opposed to the project of emigration . Some of them , no doubt , are opposed to it . Some are opposed to this particular project , and in favor of the Canadian or the Haytien , or some other . The Colonization Society does not expect to be without rivals any more than without enemies . Jts very success has had the effect to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement ? The writer must be aware that a small part of it only consists in the fact stated by himself that two thousand emigrants have actually gone over to Africa , under the auspices of this odious institution , from this country of their " love . " There is every xeason to believe that these men are satisfied with their present situation . Not only have they not returned , and expressed no wish to return , but they have declared their determination to remain , and to use all the little influence they possess to induce others to follow their example . But the society has had no occasion to solicit emigrants at any period . From the very first year of its operation , the number of applicants has greatly exceeded the number of those who could receive aid . When Paul Cuffee returned from his exploring voyage to the African coast , in the yery worst days of the institution , as many as two thousand of the free blacks in the neighborhood of this city were desirous of being carried out to Sierra Leone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other lands on the face of the earth ? So , when *Ir . Waring returned , in August , 1S2* , from Montserado to Petersburg , in Virginia , more than one hundred offered their names immediately to embark in the next vessel which should sail for the colony . This was just after the happening of the worst disasters which have befallen the Liberia emigrants from first to last . Again , in 1S*6 , the Society of Friends in North-Carolina , who have always done and are still doing so much in the cause , reported that three hundred free blacks had been " conveyed to free governments since the last year , " who had been left to their own choice of location . Forty had chosen to go to Liberia , one hundred and nineteen to Hayti , eleven to Philadelphia , and the rest to Ohio and Indiana . It further appeared that five hundred more were then ready and *villiiig to emigrate ; " Uj arets of three hundred to Liberia , and the other two hundred to other places . // All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statc Colonization Society of Virginia , of which , by the way , Judge Marshall is President , and Mr. Madison , and Mr. Monroe , until his death , Vice-Presidents , say , in 1828 , " the Society will find no difficulty in procuring emigrants of approved character , and to any number . Already about five hundred free blacks and two hundred emancipated slaves are soliciting to be removed . " The season after this , we find the Lynchburg Auxiliary Society reporting , that such had been the change in the public sentiment within a year , and such the increase of applications , " that the resources of the Parent Society were found wholly inadequate to the object . " In January , 1829 , six hundred persons were seeking a passage to the colony. * In January , 1830 , applications were pending for about one thousand free persons of color , and six hundred slaves , besides about two thousand of the latter class in North-Carolina , who were emancipated , or would be as soon as there was reason to expect their immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present moment as our information enables us , we understand that , although many more emigrants have gone out during the last than during any preceding season , more applicants than ever remain soliciting passages . J'hree hundred and thirty-nine went out in the James Perkins from Norfolk , only three months since . As many more were ready to go from the state of Virginia alone . In November last , there were over one thousand applications for passages ; and in October one of the Society 's western agents wrote from Louisville , that , for one hundred who were then eagerly soliciting the means of removal , there would in all probability be three times that number ready to go " within the year . " On the whole , we believe our readers will concur with us in opinion , that there seems to be less reason for admitting the writer 's unqualified statement as we have quoted it , than for believing the Colonization Society itself . " The free people of color , " say the managers in a circular issued a few months since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of their situation , and are ready , in large numbers , to emigrate to the colony of Liberia . " The truth is , that this class have always been eager to embrace even an indifferent opportunity to leave this beloved country for almost any other . Over six thousand of them emigrated to Hayti during one season . But enough on this point . The writer has advanced other positions which we believe equally untenabie with the last noticed , and the strength or weakness of which is of much more importance to his main argument against the Society . He cites it as another doctrine among the advocates of African colonization , that the color of the blacks is , and will be , an insuperable b r to their moral or political elevation while they remahi in this country . In confirmation , he quotes the Repository as saying that " this class , degraded in character , and miseral ) le in condition , was forever excluded , by public sentiment , by law , and by a physical distinction , from the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be seen , does by no means justify the principle which the writer has attached to it ; but , setting aside his construction , let the passage and the principle be tried by their own merits . It is unnecessary , of course , to prove that " color is the sole source of // the universal prejudice against the descendants of Africa . " This appears to be an imagination of his own . He admits , however , that such a prejudice exists ; that it is universal ; that it has excluded them from the exercise of most of their civil rights ; that they have been denied the common privileges of education , and forbidden to associate with those by whose society their morals and intellect might have been improved. * Now this is very nearly the doctrine of the Society , even as expressed in the passage above cited ; and this fact it is which furnished one of the strongest motives for the establishment of the institution . The writer adds , that " instead of wondering that they have done so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be surprised that they have done any thing . " And who does wonder , or who ever did , that they have done so little ? Not the Colonization *Society , at all events . They have said and done all that was possible and proper for them to say and do , to show , as the very passage in question goes to show , that the imbecility and insignificance of the free blacks , instead of being a matter of surprise , are the inevitable consequence of the circumstances under which they are placed . It is not a fault of theirs , but a misfortune . It makes them not the objects of contempt and hatred ,  --  God forbid that it ever should !  --  but the subjects of an unfeigned and earnest sympathy . The writer thinks , however , that a change has taken place for the better within the last twenty years . This is certainly no pleasant subject of discussion ; but we can not refrain from saying that we believe the free blacks to be , as a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . There may be some individuals more completely educated now than ever before ; and we are happy to acknowledge that there are , as there ever have been , many intelligent and virtuous men among them who are not educated at all ; but the great mass , we solemnly believe , has made no advance whatever . That a few schools should be established , and that some other similar movements should be made among them , was to be expected from the great increase which has taken place in their numbers , and was necessary to counteract the effects of that increase . There appears to us no good reason for expecting them to improve for the future , any more than they have for the past . The same causes which have debased them for two centuries , are still in existence , and are long likely to be so . These are something more than their color merely , and something more than the prejudice which arises from that circumstance ,  --  or from any other circumstance . This feeling is not the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The writer himself contends , in another connexion , that when vice and ignorance shall disappear from among them , the prejudice will disappear also . The Colonization Society are of the same opinion . They differ from the writer only in believing that contingency a matter of more doubt and more difficulty than he does . They lay greater stress upon the inevitable effect of the relation which the blacks in this country necessarily sustain towards the whites ; and great numbers of the blacks themselves agree with them . " As long as we remain among you , " say the Baltimore free // blacks in their memorial of 1826 , " we must be content to be a distinct caste , exposed to the indignities and dangers , physical and moral , to which our situation makes us liable . " The writer , therefore , does injustice to the Society in ascribing to them the sentiment , that " a black skin is a natural and just cause of offence . " His own quotation shows their sentiment to be otherwise , and to be precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have embarked for Africa under their auspices , and of the far greater number who are ready and eager to go at the first opportunity . Other individuals of the class may think and feel differently . Some of them are better situated than others , and have more inducements to remain here . Let every man determine this matter for himself . The same facts , whick go to show the true interest of the colored population , indicate also the subordinate though not inconsiderable interest which the whites have in their removal . The Colonization charity is literally one that blesses him that gives as well as him that takes . And here again we wholly dissent from the writer 's positions . He does not believe that their presence is disadvantageous to us . They do not resist the laws , he thinks , or interfere with us in any respect . They do us some good and no harm . If they do not improve , we shall be none the worse ,  --  and no motive can be imagined for wishing their removal , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , one good and sufficient motive , as we believe , has been stated already ; and that is " vice and ignorance " as making them objects of charity . A better one is in this vice and ignorance itself which the writer has alleged to be the foundation of the prejudice which exists against them . Let us appeal to a few facts in this case , to confirm him in this better opinion of the two . The bills of mortality for New-York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , and all the other cities , so far as our information extends , where they reside in considerable numbers , always show an over-proportion of deaths among them , as compared with the whites  --  and even as compared with the slaves of the southern states . So in regard to their pauperism and their crime , both which , indeed , are plentiful causes of the fact last stated . In 1829 , the Lynchburg Colonization Society gave a statistical exposition of the situation of the free blacks in that place , from which it appears , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , there was an equal number of each class supported by the public funds ; " so that a free negro is seven-fold as likely to become chargeable to the community as a white . " This , it will be observed , was an estimate including several years ' expenses . It is independent of the fact , that the same class are practically exempt from all the civil and practical duties , paying taxes , county and parish levies , service of patrols , militia fines , working on roads , &amp;c. - in a word , that they are supported generally by the labor of others . The memorials of the Richmond and Manchester Societies , a few years before this , stated to the Assembly of Virginia , that , of thirty-seven thousand free blacks , then computed to reside in that state , only two hundred were proprietors of land . We turn now to the First Annual Report of the Prison Discipline Society . " The first cause , " say they , " existing in society , of the frequency and increase of crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They then go on to state , that , in Massachusetts , // where the colored population is but one seventy-fourth part of the whole , one sixth part of the convicts are colored . In Connecticut , the population is one thirty-fourth part , and the convicts one third ; in NewJersey , the population one thirteenth , and the convicts one third ; in Pennsylvania , the same as in Connecticut . Of nine hundred and eighteen souls , constituting the whole black population in Vermont , twenty-four belonged to the Penitentiary . In New-York , of sij* hundred and thirty-seven convicts in the city prison , one hundred and fifty-four , or about one fourth , were blacks ; while the whole number of that class were but a thirty-fifth part of the entire population of the state . Three of these states alone ,  --  to wit , Massachusetts , Connecticut and NewYork , having in all less than fifty-four thousand free blacks within their boundaries , had paid one hundred and sixty-four thousand dollars for the support of convicts belonging to that class within twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum laid out for the purpose of educating these unfortunate people , would probably have had an equal effect in diminishing this frightful amount of crime . But the next remark is particularly worthy of notice . " If , however , their character can not be raised where they are , a powerful argument may be derived from these facts , in favor of colonization . Civilized states ought , surely , to be as willing to expend money on any given part of its population , to prevent crime , as to punish it . " This is our doctrine precisely ; and will the writer still assert , that the presence of this class is of no disadvantage to us-that they do no harm-that they resist no laws-that they interfere with us in no respect-that no motive can be imagined for wishing their removal ? We think he will not . We have taken our instances from various sections of the country , including those where the colored population is understood to be the most respectable , that there might be no complaint against us of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states are not in our possession ; but we are not entirely without the means of forming a tolerably fair opinion as regards them . As Mr. Clay remarked , in his address delivered two years since , before the Kentucky State Society ,  --  " If the vicious habits and propensities of this class were not known to every man of attentive observation , they would be demonstrated by the unerring test of the census . " He then mentions the *vell-known fact , that the rate of their annual increase , between 1810 and 1820 , was only about two and a half per cent. , while that of the other classes was about three . Public opinion seemed to have recognized this lamentable state of things in almost all the states . Hence the terribly severe enactments which fill the statute books of the South . Hence the proposals daily brought forward , for expelling the emancipated slaves . Hence the memorials presented to the legislatures , and the arreements entered into among individuals , with the view of forcing the free blacks from among them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presented to the Virginia Assembly now in session , pledged themselves ,  --  1 . To have no dealing whatever with any free negro in the country . 2 . To rent them neither house nor land for the future , and to warn them as soon as possible to quit the premises they had already occupied . 3 . To use their influence for preventing owners of vessels from employing them . Hence , too , the severe legislation which ' has driven so many thousands // of the class from Ohio . So , Louisiana passed a law , not long since , expelling all free persons of color , who had removed into their territories subsequently to 1825 . And thus , we should add , not only is the evil becoming more notorious , but more flagrant . The colored population is concentrated more and more within circumscribed limits , and made to feel , more and more bitterly , with how much truth they have been called aliens and outcasts . Do all these facts furnish evidence , that public sentiment is meliorated towards them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in morals or in intellect for the future ? Just the reverse . The presence of the blacks among us , then , is likely to be , as it is now ' , " a curse alike to themselves and to us . " The objection against the Colonization Society which we have now to notice , is the most extraordinary of all . " It confines its offices to the free blacks , " says the writer , " and , we believe , does nothing for the redemption of slaves . That the Society takes charge of slaves emancipated , for the purpose of being sent oW is granted . " Why , then , " he asks , " do they not confer their benefits on those who need them most ? " Now , not to say that from tei*i to twenty free blacks , at the least calculation , and perhaps double that number , can be transported for the round price of one slave , it must be known to every man in this country , that the Society has encountered more opposition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this very manner , or in any other manner , with the slave-holders and the slaves , than from all other classes of the community put together . A charitable society has a right always , we conceive , to pursue their legitimate objects by any one particular mode of investing their own funds rather than by any other ; but in this case it was a matter of necessity . A society could not have been formed in this country with such a professed object in view as the writer proposes . At all events , it would have done infinite evil , instead of the least good . Besides , the Society expected , without meddling with the property in slaves , to benefit the slaves themselves more by indirect than they could by direct efforts . They believed , that of all the methods which could be devised to promote voluntary emancipation , none would be so efficient as the establishment of a free black colony . They knew , that while vast numbers would indignantly resent the slightest appearance of an express intention to procure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were connected with the system of slavery from necessity , and not from choice ; and that their own liberal sentiments would prompt them to avail themselves of the earliest opportunity which should offer , of conferring freedom on their slaves , when this would evidently be beneficial to the slaves , and without injury to the public welfare . " This declaration we find in the African Repository for October , 1828 . To show the correctness of such reasoning , the editor annexes letters from various parts of the Union , offering large numbers of slaves to the Society gratis , on condition of their being sent off . In August of the same season , a Georgia slaveholder tendered forty-three slaves on a similar condition . Instances of this kind have been multiplying ever since . As we have already stated , two thousand were at one time ready to be emancipated a year or two since , in one state , provided the Society could remove them . It , is very clear , then , that if the von . ii . 37 // emancipation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken no surer course than they have taken to effect it . And not only has the disposition to emancipate conditionally , been manifested , but the Society has made every possible effort to encourage and to meet it . In the nature of things , it would not do to build up their colony of emancipated slaves alone , had there been no other class whose necessities demanded notice . But a large proportion of the emigrants , to the amount of many hundreds , have , nevertheless , been of this description . During the last season , forty-nine slaves , liberated by one gentleman in Georgia , have been sent to Liberia ; and , of forty-six emigrants carried out by the Brig Criterion from Norfolk , thirty-nine were manumitted for the purpose . It is not true , then , that the Society does nothing for the redemption of slaves . They have colonized more of this classfreely liberated , in consequence of the establishment of the free black colony ,  --  than , upon any other system , all the funds they have ever held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark particularly on the writer 's query , " whether such liberality as this ( on the part of slave-owners ) is to be expected ? " Finally , it is alleged that the Society proposes to furnish the means for conveying away the whole black population of the United States , and affirms that this is practicable . This objection we shall notice with great lenity , for we do not consider it a matter of much importance . Suppose that they do entertain views of this kind ; and suppose , also , that these views are unreasonable ; we do not apprehend that much harm will arise in consequence . Let the Society , then , have credit for the good which it has done , and can do-for the charity administered to thousands , though not to millions ,  --  for the change which its mild and benevolent measures have wrought in the tone of pulilic sentiment at the South ,  --  for the salutary spring it has given to public feeling and discussion throughout the country , upon subjects as delicate as they are difficult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the suppression of the slave-trade on the coast of Africa , and the spread of civilization in the interior of that continent . We deem it superfluous , then , to go into minutia upon this point . It is sufficient to observe further , that the Society does not and never did propose what the writer suggests , in the sense which his readers will be likely to put upon his words . Such schemes have , indeed , been discussed , generally by individual friends of the institution ; sometimes , perhaps , by the institution itself ; but never , in the slightest degree , like a proposal . The constitution speaks for itself on this matter , and it avows no object whatever but the colonization of free blacks , and of such as may become free , on the African coast . Any thing further than this is acknowledged to be contingent , and expressly admitted , at all events , to be inconsistent with the means of the institution . The most they have ever hoped for is , that the governments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves of what had been done by the Society for other purposes , in order to promote , by their own resources , the remote national purpose in question . " A private association , " say the Managers in their memorial of 1826 , " can do little more . " Than they had done . The work now becomes too vast for their powers , &amp;c . So speaks Mr. Clay , a Vice President of the Society , at the annual meeting of 1827 . " It is no objection to the scheme , limited as it is , exclusively , to thosefree // people of color who are willing to emigrate , that it admits of indefinite eztension and application by those who alone , having the competent authority , may choose to adopt and apply it . " This explanation cannotbe improved , or we should go on and cite passages to the same effect , ad infinitum . The scheme of emancipation proposed by the writer , need not be discussed in this connexion . His remarks upon the history of the colony , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass over with the single remark , that he mistakes in asserting that the progress of the colony has been retrograde . Up to November last , eighteen hundred and fifty-seven emigrants only , including recaptured Africans , had been carried out ; and the population was then more than two thousand . This fact alone is comment enough upon the climate . T.@@183068171.txt Prepared and read , by appointment , in the Lexington Branch of the National Lyceum , November 1st , 1831 . PURSUANT to a resolution of this Lyceum , passed on the evening of its organization , it is my duty and purpose to submit to it , at the present meeting , a few thoughts on the subject of Rail-roads . In a particular manner , I am to speak of the " moral and other indirect influences " of that great invention . The task is an important one . It involves matter of deep concern to the community , and considerations of high responsibiblity , as relates to myself . Carelessness or mistakes , in the performance of it , can scarcely fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corresponding feelings I approach it ; and shall , therefore , treat the subject of it gravely and conscientiously . To inquire into the " influences " of Rail-roads , here alluded to , is to examine the agency of that extraordinary means of transportation and traveling , as an element in a scheme of popular education . Every thing calculated to alter the condition of the mind of the community , by either improving or deteriorating it , must be thus interpreted . Nor is it possible that such an innovation in the mode , and such an astoni*shintr addition to the power and velocity of conveyance , can fail to produce commensurate effects , for good or for evil . They must either benefit or injure society , deeply , extensively , and permanently . Their bearings should be scrutinized , therefore , with a severity in accordance with the interests they involve . By popular education , I would be understood to mean , the training and improvement of the public mind , in all its faculties , by popular or general means , by influences apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible to every one . In my remarks on this subject , whose importance is not surpassed by that of any other , especially in its relation to our own country , my end will be practical truth ; and I shall endeavor to reach it by the shortest and plainest route . If my views be not incorrect , a brief analysis of the human intellect will aid me , materially , in the attainment of my purpose . I have to ask the indulgence of the Lyceum , therefore , while I make a few observations to that effect . Man is constitutionally a being of a three-fold nature ,  --  animal , moral , and intellectual . Considered in his mere corporeal capacity , consisting of the various parts , which unite in composing him , and possessed of the propensities to eat , breathe , move , sleep , guard against enemies , engage in battle and destroy , prepare for himself places of shelter , protection and concealment , amass property , and perpetuate his race-considered in these respects , I say , be is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls inferior . In this capacity , his feelings are altogether selfish , and the stronger and more predominant they are , the worse and more degraded do they render him . If they do not make him virtually an enemy to the rest of his race , they induce him , at times , to forget them , and to live and act only for himself . As a moral being , man belongs to society , and all his feelings , in this capacity , leaning instinctively to the welfare of others , have respect to himself only as a member of the human family . He is disinclined to serve or gratify himself at the expense , or to the injury of others . It is under this character , that he possesses , and , to a proper extent , indulges , the laudable feeling of self-respect , and a desire to receive the approbation of his fellow-men . To this portion of his nature belong also sentiments of benevolence , justice , firmness of purpose , veneration for things above him , hope , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral , as well as physical . As far as these sentiments predominate , his condition is elevated ; and , if they induce him to act , his existence is valuable , because he is friendly to the human race , and endeavors to promote their welfare . In this capacity , he holds a great ascendency over the rest of the animal kingdom . As an intellectual being , man posseses a knowledge of the external world , and its changes or economy . In plainer terms , he forms an acquaintance with objects , events , and their relations . In kind , these relations are various . They have respect to time , place , size , likeness or unlikeness , and identity or difference . But // 289 the highest and most interesting and important relations , are those of analogy , and of cause and effect . Possessed of a knowledge of these things , man is able to direct his course , accomplish his purposes , and gratify his wishes . It is , therefore , as an intellectual being , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render himself useful or pernicious to his fellow-men . In this capacity , also , his superiority to other animals is great . Such are the several sorts of faculties , belonging to man , as a being possessed of mind . The three united form his constitution , or entire nature , and vary his character , according to the predominance of one or more of them , and in proportion to the degree of that predominance . The following are a few of the varieties they produce . Are the animal powers active and vigorous , and the moral and intellectual ones feeble , and wanting in excitement ? The individual thus endowed is groveling in his disposition , dull of apprehension , limited in his range of thought , and inclined to vice , rather than virtue . He is much of an animal , in the form of a man . Do the moral faculties possess strength and activity , while the animal and intellectual are weak and torpid ? He , whose mental constitution is thus compounded , is , by nature , a well disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing great . His predilection is for virtue , which he follows for its own sake ; but he wants both knowledge , and energy of character-light , to direct his course , and eagerness to pursue it . Are the intellectual powers keen and of great strength , and the animal and moral ones dull and feeble ? The possessor of this form of constitution delights in knowledge , cultivates it industriously , and ucquires it with ease . But he fails to apply it to useful purposes . Not being a practical man , he suffers it to lie in a state of inaction . Like the mis er 's gold , it is so much capital out of circulation , which benefits neither its owner nor the community . In our intercourse with society , we often meet with characters of the foregoing descriptions . They may be called simple , because they contain but one set of active and vigorous faculties . The sphere they occupy is comparatively limited . Hence , they do but little , either to improve or deteriorate the condition of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose aspects and spheres of action are very different from those just described ; and so are the results of the careers they pursue . Are both the animal and intellectual faculties powerful and vivid , while the moral ones are imbecile and dull ? The individual thus endowed is fitted for mischief . Unless well-directed training and good example prevent it , his propensities will precipitate him into vice , and his knowledge will direct him , in the commission of it . It is by persons thus constituted , that the most atrocious crimes are usually perpetrated , and the deepest miseries inflicted on society . Are the moral avd intellectual powers vigorous and active , and the animal ones weak and slug*islm ? The possessor will be a model of elevation of sentiment , rectitude of coiduct , and purity of life . He may also be distinguished for his attainments in science , literature , and taste . But he will want resolution and practical energy . He will never either originate a great , much less a hazardous , enter nor give any effective aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his personal efforts . He may counsel learnedly , if not wisely ; but he will never act boldly . Nor will his opinion and advice be communicated with such firmness and fervor , as to produce conviction and awaken confidence in those who receive them . Are the three sets of faculties , animal , moral , and intellectual , all vivid and vigorous ? The person thus gifted is formed for greatness ; and , should an opportunity offer , he will confer extensive benefits on his contemporaries , and leave a name to aftertimes . He will possess knowledge to enlighten him , and furnish him with means , virtue to incline him to praiseworthy ends , strength of character to give him action and energy , and the requisite perseverance to insure success . Such is the plainest and simplest view of the constitution of man , and of the casts of character , corresponding to a few varieties in it , that I am able to offer , within the limits to which I must confine myself . It is on this constitution , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deteriorate our condition , must ultimately act . And it is for that reason , that I deemed it requisite to give a brief exposition of it . I need scarcely add , that none but agents conformable to our nature , can benefit us by their influence . All others are useless , at least , if not injurious . voi , . mm. 38 // Each of the faculties , which has been represented as entering in to the composition of the human constitution , is alike indispensable to it , as one of its elements ; and they are all equally essential to bestow on man his highest perfection . Nor can they do this , under any state of union , unless they are correctly and sufficiently trained . They come from the hand of nature crude and untutored , and can receive from education alone the power and efficiency of which they are susceptible . To prove this , it is only necessary to compare disciplined with undisciplined individuals , in any branch of science or letters , in mechanical pursuits , or in any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if duly examined , as to the causes productive of it , will not fail to convince us , that the mental difference between man and man , which strikes us so forcibly from every quarter , and is so powerfully operative , in human affairs , depends much more on difference of training , than of natural endowments . Other things being equal , therefore , in proportion to the merit of the training bestowed will be the relative standing of those who receive it . But my present business is not to speak of the principles , modes , or mutative influence of general education ; nor to pronounce a panegyric on its importance to our race . I trust that , at no distant period , that duty will be devolved on a member of the Lyceum , whose qualifications for the performance of it are of the highest order . My purpose , as heretofore stated , is , to confine uiyself to the expression of a few thoughts , on the effects , which , as one means of education , Rail-roads are calculated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , of the communities and nations , in which they may be erected . I consider this , however , as a very broad outline of the subject before me . It is tantamount to saying , that my remarks will relate to the influence of Rail-roads , in the promotion of public prosperity and happiness ; for these depend on the degree of advancement of the several points of cultivation referred to , and bear a direct proportion to it . It has been already observed , at least in substance , that I mean , by general education , the process of properly training and improving , by every available method , and from childhood to old age , all the faculties , which enter , as elements , into the constitution of man . At present , I more particularly mean , the imparting or otherwise producing of the greatest possible amount of the most useful practical knowledge . accompanied by agreeable manners , sound taste and judgement , and a disposition to apply all the attainments possessed to the most laudable purposes . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enlightened , liberal , and accomplished utilitarian . That Rail-roads will contribute abundantly to this , appears , if I mistake not , from sundry considerations , some of which shall be submitted to the Lyceum . Education is essentially a social process , and is effected by the influence , direct or indirect , of one mind on another . This is more especially the case with popular education . In the dreariness of solitude it can not go on , because the requisite means are wanting . The education of the savage , in the wilderness , is extremely limited , on account of his loneliness . He associates but little with his fellow-men , and his faculties are , therefore , but slightly improved by conversation or example . Much less can the convict , sentenced to solitary confinement , where no human voice salutes him , except the echo of his own complaints , or perhaps imprecations , and where the eye of man never beams on him with intelligence or fellow-feeling ; much less , I say , can the wretch , thus loomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insensate cell , be either advanced in knowledge , or amended in morals . On the contrary , he necessarily retrogrades in both , and is sometimes deprived entirely of his mental faculties , and reduced to idiotism . Society alone is a rich source of education and improvement , in all that is most desirable ,  --  all that ministers to the elevation and perfection of human nature ,  - -  knowledge , morals , manners , taste , and personal appearance . I may securely add , that , as relates to these matters , it is the most abundant and valuable of sourcesand , if of a proper description , contributes , in the course of ahifetime , more to general improvement , than any other , or , perhaps , than all others united . In proportion to the perfection of society , in any place , therefore , is that of education . Hence the strong and laudable desire of parents , that their children should associate with good company ; by which is meant , social circles possessed of correct morals , sound and well-informed intellects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in towns , in towns than in villages , and in villages than in country places ? So is education . In proof of this , Paris and London may be cited in Europe , and Boston and Philadelphia , in the United States . In those cities , edu // cation and society act and react on each other , until both are brought to high perfection . Without intending any disparagement to other situations , I venture to affirm , that , in these respects , the cities referred to surpass , very greatly , any towns , villages , or country places , which the world contains . Although there is an immensity of book-learning , critical literature , and classical scholarship , in Oxford and Cambridge , the real education of those academic towns , is greatly inferior to that of London . Young men who have been taught in the former places , repair afterwards to the latter , or to some other theatre of good society , to be truly educated . But why need I travel into foreign countries , or to remote spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own town , or even without these walls , in quest of matter to prove my position ? It is proved by the very principles , on which this Lyceum , and the National Lyceum , of which it is a branch , are established . Why do we meet , in this place , to unite our feelings in a common treasury , on which each of us may draw , at pleasure , and to interchange thoughts on different subjects , which we deem important ? I answer ( and every e'e before me looks assent to the reply ) from a conviction that we shall be bene*ted by each other 's society . Why shall we hereafter send delegates to the meetings of the National Lyceum ; and why commune , in some way , with other town , county and state Lyceums ? The reply is to the same effect . It is our intention to consolidate the whole , as far as possible , into one great society , in which each memher may mingle , and partake of the benefits , moral , intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a communion of feeling and thought . Do aur state legislatures , and the legislature of the United States , convene annually in their respective capitols ? They do ; and for what purpose ? To confer and deliberate , as state and national societies , on matters involving the wetfare of the commonwealth . Are not Europe and America studded all over with societies and associations , of descriptions almost innumerable  --  to advance the interests of literature and the fine arts-of law , religion , medicine , chemistry , agriculture , history , mechanics , human liberty and right ; and to contribute to the advancement of general science ? In fine ; when improvements on any subject become desirable , is not a society , for the cultivation of it , immediately established , as the most effectual means for the speedy attainment of the end in view ? So obvious is the truth , and so universal the recognition of it , that social intercourse is the most invaluable source of enlightened wisdom and practical knowledge . Secluded study and contemplation may fill the mind with learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectio*x s to the intensity of enthusiasm . But those who are ambitious of a correct acqo *intance with human nature , and wish to qualify themselves to isoprove its condition , must often forsake , for a time , the grove of Egeria , emerge from the visions of classical solitude , and mingle in the stream of living men . But , when constructed on the scale , and carried to the extent , which I am confident await them , Rail-roads will contribute emine*stly to the improvement of society . They will make consolidated societies of whole nations . The island of Great-Britain will be formed into one vast institution , whose knowledge and feelings will make a common stock . Of the empire of France , the same will be true . Her two-and-thirty millions of inhabitants will be concentred in Paris . How brilliant will be then the blaze of knowledge , that will issue from that great capital ; and how tremendous the power it will be able to wield ! What hostile force will dare to approach such a moral volcano , whose slumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desolating action With the expedition of magic , the whole embodied prowess and power , and all the military enginery of the nation , might be brought to bear on any single point , to discomfit and destroy an approaching enemy . The aspect and condition of the United States will be still more impressive , because it will be exhibited on a grander scale . She will present the most magnificent association , that the sun shall shine on . Her knowledge , and feeling , and power will be ONE . She will be ONE , in all her attributes , without the least disposition to divide herself while no earthly force can compel a division . The distance from Maine to Louisiana , or perhaps to Texas , and from the Atlantic ocean to Missouri and Arkansas , or even to the Rocky Mountains , will he no longer measured in miles and perches . The distance will-be computed by the time consumed in a journey from the one extreme to the other . And that will he short ; much shorter than was requisite , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Beston to Philadelphia , or from Richmond to Charleston . By the our sectional feelinos and interests arrangement conteml ) iated , will be extingui*hed , and even our sectional names will be little else than history . When , as respect // our Union , east , and west , and north , and south shall be spoken of , they will mean nothing more than adjacent points or groups , in the same great and harmonious society . For all , I repeat , will be merged in national ONENESS . The moral and social unity , which will then prevail , throughout our country , constitutes one of the grandest objects , that contemplation , looking into the future , can dwell on . To cement it more by affection and interest , the ties which man most reluctantly breaks , and therefore to render it more indestructible , numerous marriages will be contracted , and family alliances formed , between the inhabitants of remote states , and of distant sections of the same state . This will be the necessary result of an intercourse among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The imperishable cementation ( 1 was near saying identification ) between the whole population of the United States , which this condition of things will produce , constitutes a theme too vast for the tongue to describe , or even for the imagination distinctly to conceive . The reason is , that man has yet seen nothing like it , because the pieans to effect it have been wanting . It will be a new creation , which must b* seen and examined , before it can be correctly understood or spoken of . Hitherto extended plains and lofty mountains , and , in some instances , trackless wildernesses , have separated our states and communities from each other . But Rail-roads will annihilate all such barriers , and bring into contact the inhabitants of the remotest points of the Republic . The entire people of the United States , being thus formed into a compact society , will enjoy the advantages , moral , iiitellectual , and physical , arising from facility of intercourse with each other . Constituting virtually a mighty city , they will experience all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded population . In a particular manner , they will be exempt from much of the poverty , wretchedness , and concomitant vice , and no little of the sickliness of large cities . Nor , as might be easily shown , bad I leisure to dilate on the subject , will they be liable to contract , to any serious extent , certain city vices , practised by some of the higher orders of inhabitants . They will possess a large share of the knowledge , refinement , and polish of a city , united to the virtue and purity of the country . Extravagant and untrue to nature as I fear some may deem this picture of the future condition of our country , it is no fancy piece , thoughtlessly sketched in a moment of enthusiasm . Correct or otherwise , it is the result of deliberation . Nor is it half so improbable , as certain improvements , now in existence , would have been deemed but thirty ywrs ago , had they been then predicted . I shall show hereafter , by a few details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsels me to efface it . It will be remembered , however , that it is founded on the presumption ( which I doubt not will be realized , ) of the establishment , in our country , of a federalized system of Rail-roads . By this I mean the connecting of the several states with each other , by state branches of the road , the running of subordinate ramifications from these to the most populous and important sections of each state , and the connection of the whole , by suitable routes , of the same description , to the capital of the nation . I mean by it , a system analogous to that of the blood vessels of the human body , where minor ramifications , running from remote parts , connect themselves with others , in their course , and unite in main ones , to empty their contents into the cavity of the heart . That a system of this kind can be formed , admits not of a doubt ; and , confiding in the wisdom and energy of the country , I persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province nor my intention to play the statesman , on the present occasion . A single glance , however , in that direction , will , Itrust , be deemed exceptionable . A short period will effect the extinguishment of our public debt . Unless the present scheme of finance be materially changed , the annual surplus of the national revenue will then be large . Let itbe applied to the construction of a federalized system of Rail-roads . The measure will be alike patriotic and wise , and will soon become as popular as it will be salutary . In fifteen or twenty years , or , perhaps , in a shorter period , the scheme may be completed . By means of it , as formerly mentioned , the Union will be ONE ; and its duration may bid defiance to every thing but time . Let us , for a moment , look forward into future years , contemplate , in fancy , our country thus provided with rail-road conveyances , and suppose the whole pageant presented to us at a single view . Art has never yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture so striking . It is all in action , under a power that is stupendous ; and its grandeur and magnificence are overwhelming to the // 293 mind . The rush of the waters of Niagara is sublime . But it is not comparable to the panorama I would delineate , had*1 powers adequate to it . Throughout one of the most extensive empires of the world , every section is studded with cars , bearing hundreds of thousands of well dressed and gay inhabitants , and uncomputed millions of wealth , in the form of merchandize ; and the whole is conveying to different points , with surpassing grace and majesty of movement , and the fleetness of the antelope , at the top of its speed . Nor can a state of things so splendid and impressive , fail to be productive of corresponding effects . It is a law of nature , that every thing produces after its kind . Objects of exalted power and grandeur elevate the mind that seriously dwells on them , and impart to it greater compass and strength . Alpine scenery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublimity to the conceptions of beholders . The same will be true of our system of Rail-roads . Its vastness and magnificence will prove communicable , and add to the standard of the intellect of ouz* country . Nor will this augmented magnitude and strength " come like shadows , so depart . " They will be permanent ; and thus will American genius be improved . Under this state of things , suppose our country to be invaded by an enemy ,  - -  but the supposition is inadmissible . The power , that could he instantly brought to crush the invader , forbids us to believe in the possibility of an enterprize so rash and hopeless . The certain prevention of foreign war , therefore , from violating . our borders , and the foot of a foe from insulting our soil , will be one of the numerous advantages of Rail-roads. indeed , the invention will do much towards the suppression of war in general ,  --  a thousand fold more th n all the Peace and Missionary Societies , that will ever be established . This it will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it will promote civilization , by bringing men and nations more together , enabling them to intermingle with greater facility , and thus partake of a mutual and general advancement in knowledge , and become better acquainted with each other . Acquaintance rarely fails to beget esteem and good will ; and those states of feeling aid in the prevention of quarrels , both personal and national . Besides , war , in its least exceptionable shape , is the offspring of mere animality and savagism . To promote civilization , therefore , is the way to exterminate it . And , I repeat , that Rail-roads will prove one of the most powerful means for the advancement of civilization , that has ever been devised . They must ultimately act on different nations , as they will on remote sections of the same nation . They will bring their inhabitants more together , and make them MORALLY ONE . Or . if they do not produce positive unity of feeling , they will remove prejudices and dislikes-implant , in their stead , mutual kindness and regard , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been already done by Rail-roads , in a few years , and the boundless resources that have been opened for further enterprize and improvement , and , looking into futurity , attempt to fathom what may be done hereafter , as nations shall advance in knowledge and power , I almost shrink from giving language to my conceptions , lest they should he deemed extravagant and wild . But , from the most temperate view I can take of the subject , I see no ground to doubt , that the invention is destined to produce , in time , an entire revolution in some of the leading channels of the commerce of the world . 1 allude particularly to the channels between Europe , Asia , and Oceanica , and between the latter continents and North-America , and the eastern section of SouthAmerica . Between these great divisions of the globe , commerce has been , heretofore , and is , at present , carried on , by tedious and dangerous voyages round Cape Horn , and the Cape of Good Hope . The amount of time and labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that form of intercourse , is incalculable . But , if I mistake not , Rail-roads offer a remedy for the evil . Let one be constructed across the isthmus of Suez , and another across that of Darien , and the work will he done . They may , if it be deemed advisable , be made to transport entire ships and their cargoes , without unlading , from one body of water to the other . Setting aside the immense saving of human life , that will be thus effected , given points in the Southern and Pacific Oceans can then he reached , from Europe and America , in a tenth part of the time that is now required . And the enterprize , far from being impracticable , is neither difficult nor expensive . The Mediterranean and the Red Sea can be be more easily connected by a Rail-road , than New-York and Philadelphia ; and the distance from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean is about the same . Let the projects for erecting these roads be matured , and permission to that effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the authorities of Mexico and Egypt , and associations to complete them can be instantly formed , in either of our great commercial capitals ; and , in less than a year , from the times of commencing them , the establishments will be in operation . And thus may Alexandria become again the great commercial emporium of the East . Nor have I any hesitation in believing , that be fore the close of the present century , both these enterprizes will be completed . Within the same period steam-navigation will be brought to such perfection , as to be as well suited to seas and oceans , as to lakes and rivers . By it and Rail-roads , therefore , ( both of them inventions of but yesterday , ) channels of communication , safe and rapid far beyond what our forefathers dreamed of , will be opened between the remotest points of the globe . The field of knowledge , action , and enjoyment , to which mankind will have access , from these causes , will be literally such , as fabulists have never feigned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I am dealing only in general assertions , and to ask for specifications and details , in support of them ? The call would be fair . Fancying it made , therefore , I shall endeavor to answer it . Here , I must abandon what is only probable or prospective , and have recourse to facts ; and I find them in the performances on the Liverpool and Manchester Rail*road. * Between those two towns , as was recently stated , on a public occasion , passengers are conveyed , a hundred or more by a single engine , at the rate of thirty miles an hour ; and they can be and leave been conveyed with twice that fleetness . Nor is the transportation of merchandize much slower . A single engine can travel , with nearly or quite a hundred tons , from fifteen to twenty miles an hour . Engines have done this , and can do more . Such are the facts , which I am authorized to employ . The consequence of them is , that Liverpool and Manchester , although thirty-two miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate with each other , in the transportation and delivery of merchandize , the conveyance of passengers , and other forms of social intercourse , more readily and expeditiously ( I might say much more , ) than the remote points of London can , by the usual modes of carriage . As a barrier to the intimate association of those two towns with each other , therefore , the distance between them is annihilated . What is done , and daily doing , between Liverpool and Manchester , can be done as well , and , in a short time , will be , in other parts of England , and also on the Rail-roads of the United States . This assumption will not be questioned , and needs , therefore , no proof . To realize , then , in its full extent , all I have represented as practicable , and which I believe will be effected , in the United States , it is only necessary to construct Rail-roads , and suitable machinery , in the places where they are wanted . The picture , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bold reality . For further illustration and final conviction , let us bring the matter to our own doors . Suppose the Lexington and Ohio Rail-road finished , and in as perfect operation , as that which has identified Liverpool and Manchester . The consequence is plain . Lexington and Louisville will be equally identified . Their inhabitants will feel themselves members of the same social circle . A citizen of the former place , may set out , in the morning , breakfast with a friend in the latter , transact a little business , and return home to an early dinner . Or the ladies of either town may dine at home , figure and make conquests , at a tea-party , or a ball , in the other , on the evening of the same day , and return to breakfast , in their own dwellings , the next morning . More interesting still . A Louisville beau becomes desperately enamored of a Lexington beauty . His heart 's first petition is granted , even before he pours it forth , in all the exquisite misery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annihilate both time and space , And make two lovers happy . " The Rail-road has anticipated their deityships , in the kind office , and done it already . Is a Rail-road , of equal execution , established between this place and New York or Philadelphia , those two cities being connected as they shortly will be , in the same way ? One of our merchants may leave home , on Monday , purchase goods , in either of the places specified , and have them on his own shelves , on the fol * Since writing this , I have been much gratified to learn , that the performances of locomotive engines , on the Albany and Schenectady , and the Charleston , South-Carolina , Rail-roads , are not lunch inferior to those on the road between Liverpool and Manchester . On the Americaii roads , cars , loaded with passengers , have traveled upwards of thirty miles an hour . // lowing Saturday . Under such an arrangement , a delegate from this Lyceum may set out , on the morning after one of our sittings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , and report to us their proceedings , by letter , or in person , at our next meeting . And this can he done without danger or fatigue . I need scarcely add , that the celerity , with which mercantile and other intelligence , might he thus communicated , would be immensely advantageous . Despatches , by telegraph , would be , in a great measure , superseded . In these representations there is no extravagance . They are fair inductions from well known facts . Performances , which daily present themselves elsewhere , authorize me to make them ; because like performances can be effected here . In traveling , then , and the transaction of business , in distant places , much time , as well as money , will be saved by Rail-roads . And the portion of each article , thus gained , may be applied to very important purposes . Let the time be employed in the cultivation of the mind , and the money appropriated to the procurement of means to that effect , and the result will be , no small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community . I say , " of the community ; " for the good done will not be confined to those alone , whose time and money are thus applied . Nothing is so contagious , as knowledge and example . One wise , upright , and public-spirited man , can do much in assisnilating thousands to himself . He can infuse into society a moral leaven , which will stir the whole mass , and produce on it highly beneficial effects . Let others co-operate with him , and the issue will be an ameliorated condition of society , in morals and intellect , on an extensive scale . Such may be the effects of the mere savings by Rail-roads . In alluding to the additional strength , which rail-road establishments promise to bestow on the Union of the States , I did not speak of all the considerations which bear on that subject . I shall briefly , therefore , present to the Lyceum another view of it . The Roman empire fell by its own weight . Why ? On account of its extent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of its existence . The life and vigor of the empire were in Rome , as those of France are in Paris . But , owing to the impediments just referred to , they were hut slightly felt , in the distant Provinces . In consequence of this , those territories , some of them very spacious and populous , scarcely considered themselves portions of the empire . Knowing but little of Rome , from having never approached it , their inhabitants had no common interests or sympathies with it . Did they meditate or attempt a revolt ? It was long before the coercing power of the capital could reach them ; and when it did , it was enfeebled by the length and difficulties of the way . And the same delay and impediments , which weakened it , strengthened and encouraged the disaffected provinces . Hence , in time , the connecting ties of its remote sections decayed from age , or were severed by violence , and the empire fell to pieces . But , let the contemplated system of Rail-roads be established in our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar causes , will be impossible . It has been already represented , that , on account of the community of feeling and interest , and the consequent strength of general attachment , that will pervade the Commonwealth , no state will indulge , or have reason to indulge , the slightest disposition to separate from others . But , should the case be otherwise , and some section of the Union prove refractory , and attempt a revolt , its efforts to that effect can be instantly frustrated , and the spirit of resistance crushed , by the fhicility and promptitude , with which the corrective power of the nation can be brought to bear on it . The first movements of discontent will reach the eye of the federal capital , and the means requisite to quell them return from it , before treason can ripen into dangerous action . But this is not all . Man is , instinctively , attached to greatness and splendor . He admires magnificence and sublimity , and is gratified by participating in scenes where they are displayed . In a special manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing such scenes . He is flattered , in his pride , by being thus employed , and feels his standing and weight augmented , by the part he acts . He perceives that he is an integral portion of something great , and takes to himself a share of the greatness which he contributes to form . It is on this ground that the soldier and the mariner exult in the memorable battles , in which they have been concerned , and that the maimed and war-worn veteran " Shoulders his crutch , and shows how fields were *von. " // their respective empires ; and that a native of ancient Rome was proud of his birthright . Hence the lofty declaration of Cato , that " A senator of Rome , while Rome survived , Would not have itiatched his daughter with a prince . " All this is natural and praiseworthy . Such is the principle ; and its appltcation to the case before us is plain . Let the rail-road system contemplated be adopted , and the greatness and glory of the Union will be complete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal ) it . in magnificence and grandeur . Impregnable to violence from without , on account of its strength , it will be no less secure from commotion within , by reason of its glory . To belong to it , and make a part of it , will be the pride alike of individuals and states . A separation from it would be felt by any of its sections , as one of the greatest of calamities-as a sort of effacement from the map of the world . Compared to such a tie , mere conventional and legislative enactments are but a thread to a cable . Thus , trebly cemented by force , feeling and interest , the Union of the states would be indissoluble . But all the moral influences of Rail-roads are not yet recited . An increase of industry is a further and very important one . Man is never so liable to fall into vice , as when he is idle . Hence idleness has been denominated the mother of evil ; and the product of it is too apt to be abundant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pronounced identical . Persons constantly and earnestly employed , in useful business , or productive labor , have neither time nor inclination for vicious practices . Their feelings are otherwise engaged , and their thoughts better directed ; and hence the irregular and licentious are often tItus reclaimed . Bitt nothing so effectually awakens and sustains the industry of a community , as a prompt and profitable market for the products of it . Did the Elkhorn tract of country adjoin either Louisville or Cincinnati , its industry would be augmented in a fourfold ratio . Hence the activity and bustle of a maritime and commercial town , contrasted with the dullness and languor of an inland village . But , as already demonstrated , a system of Rail-roads will bring every place near to a market , in consequence of the facilities of transportation it will afford . It will render industry , therefore , general and vigorous . Apart , then , from the wealth and comfort it will produce , its influence in the promotion of morality will be great . Nor , as relates to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far from it . They are active sources of moral influence , on a threefold ground . They afford protection from temptations to vice , which poverty and want are unable to resist ,  --  keen necessity vanquishing , at times , the most laudable resolutions . They give a sense of character , which serves as a shield from profligate indulgencies , and degrading conduct . And comfort itself is , in its nature , a sort of guaranty against the commission of crime . Comfort is a compound of sundry grateful feelings , most of them of a domestic nature . It therefore produces content . But such a state of mind can not fail to favor virtue . It induces men to spend their evenings , and other leisure hours , at home , in the bosoms of their families , where they are secure from victous examples and allurements . It is the wretched and reckless , who are without a home , and feel that they have nothing worse to fear , that are prone to crime . The hardships they endure , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds , from which , under kinder auspices , they would recoil with Itorror . We are told of a golden period , when poverty and innocence were habitually associated . As relates to this point , whatever might have been the case , in former times , but few instances of the kind present themselves now . The reverse is known to be lamentably true . The declamations , therefore , which we so frequently listen to , on the demoralizing effects of riches , have no foundation in truth . They are but the clamor of ignorance , or the cant of fanaticism . It is only the abuse of riches that demoralizes . And so does the abuse of every thing else . Wealth , suitably employed , subserves , in a high degree , the cause of morality , as well as of knowledge ; and it does not produce necessarily a single disadvantage . The discreet appropriation of it is , in all respects , beneficial . Misuse , I repeat , the greatest good , by applying it to improper purposes , and you change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion of knowledge , refinement , and taste , favors substantially the cause of morality . It withholds man from the inordinate indulgence of his animal propensities , diverts his mind from sensual pursuits , and fixes it on objects more elevated and praiseworthy . It makes him more of a human being , and less of a mere animal . But , from what has been already said , it // 297 can not be doubted , that Rail-roads will contribute much to the advancement of knowledge , with all its concomitants . Whatever improves society , and brings individuals into better company , than they would otherwise enjoy , necessarily produces these effects . We are , in a high degree , imitative beings , and are strongly inclined to look upward for our models . We rarely , if ever , follow the example of those we tbink below us . To do so would be unnatural . It would , moreover , be offensive to our self-estimation and taste . In proof of these remarks , let an ordinary man be familiarized , for a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for it . He will be improved in personal cleanliness , dress , manners , taste , knowledge , and morals , and , in all respects , assimilated to those with whom he associates . He will be proud of his new and ameliorated condition , and resolved to do nothing to produce a forfeiture of it . This will be more especially the case , if well-bred , elegant , and intelligent women make a part of the company . I intend no compliment , but the annunciation of a simple truth , in saying , that the best school on earth , for instruction in morals , and intellectual refinement , is the society of virtuous and cultivated women . It is superior to all the scholastic lectures on ethics and taste , and all the male examples , in practical morals , that have been delivered and exhibited , from the days of the Grecian sages and scholars , to the present period . If any thing of earth be irresistible , in its influence on man , it is female good example and morals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bring apostates back to their violated faith . For proof of this , I might refer to observation , as well as to history . But , an elegant mode of conveyance ( and such is that by Rail-road cars , ) will insure the presence of elegant travelers . It will be unfashionable to appear in one of those vehicles , without being well dressed . Good breeding also will be expected and observed in them . A lady can sit in a car , in as much cleanliness and comfort , as in her own parlor . In each place , therefore , her wardrobe will be alike elegant . The only difference will be , that she will wear a traveling dress in one case , and a home one in the other . The superiority of the costume and general appearance of Rail-road travelers , over those of travelers in our present stage-coaches , will be as striking , as is the superiority of the costume and appearance of steam-boat passengers now , over those of persons , who , in former times , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanliness is the native growth of purity within . Nor does it only spring from it . It contributes not a little to strengthen and confirm it . The two qualities thus stand mutually related , as cause and effect , acting and reacting on each other . Hence , Innocence is always arrayed in unsullied whiteness ; while Guilt and Murder are wrapped in begrimed or blood-stained garments .. Steam-boats have greatly improved the style and advantages of traveling . The company in their cabins is often equal to that of the most splendid drawing-rooms . They have also augmented , in a high degree , the amount of traveling . As a consequence of this , the tone of manners , and the character of conversation , in the traveling portion of the community , are already much improved . And no little of this improvement is necessarily imparted to those who do not travel . And thus is amendment making progress through the whole community . Let Rail-road traveling be introduced , to the extent contemplated , and the march of this general amelioration , in manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that of morality will accompany it . That this is true , can scarcely be doubted by any one acquainted with the constitution of man . Even the elegant construction and ornamental beauty of the cars will have a favorable effect . Like other products of the fine arts , they will improve the taste of those who may travel in them . But all that does this , as already stated , is favorable to morals . It substitutes higher and more refined indulgencies for lower and grosser ones . The elegance of our steam-boats has the same sort of elevating and purifying influence on those who make voyages in them , when compared with the effects of other water-conveyances . I appeal to the experience of any one , who has ever made the trial of a first voya*e to New-Orleans , in a common flat , constructed of rude planks , and filled with dirt and litter , and a second in a superb steam-boat , with ornamented state-rooms , and elegantly curtained and carpeted cabins , whether he did not , in the latter instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will fearlessly add , the more moral being ? and whether in his first trip , he would not have been more easily tempted to commit a degrading or a vicious act , than in his second ? To this inquiry , it would he superfluous in me to reply . The true answer must be obvious to every one  --  and it is affirmative . An asso von . si . 39 // ciation with elegant equipment and furniture , improves the taste and purifies the mind , as certainly as an association with good company . In which of the two positions does a rider feel himself the more exalted and dignified , and the less likely to do a mean and unworthy action ; when he is seated on a grand , richly caparisoned , and bounding war-horse , or an ignoble and ambling sumpter-mule , covered with a pack-saddle , and guided by a hempen halter ? Again the interrogatory answers itself . I repeat , then , that the elegant structure and tasteful equipment of Rail-road cars will exercise a moralizing influence on society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elevate the mind above groveling thoughts and foul practices , give it greater expansion and a higher tone , and impart to it additional purity and correctness . They stamp on it somewhat of their high-inspiring image , which so ennobles it , in its own estimation , that it descends , with much more difficulty , to the commission of acts degrading or immoral . It comports with experience , as well as with the true springs of human action , that man should be more prone to crime , in the Dismal Swamp , where all is sombre , and every thing around unsightly and offensive , than by the Falls of Niagara , where brightness prevails , and Nature presents herself in matchless sublimity . But , the magnificence of Rail-road establishments has been already referred to . There is reason to believe , therefore , that it can not fail to be favorable , in its influence , on public taste , refinement , and morality . Nor , in speaking of the magnificence of a system of Rail-roads , in full operation , do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits . The pageant is instinct with a moral grandeur , which makes a deeper and more salutary impression on the mind . The immense power , which it manifests , and which is developed , controled , and directed by human means , excites , in those who see and contemplate it , an exalted idea of the dignity of their race . It awakens in them , therefore , higher respect for themselves , as a portion of that race . It exhibits man to them , as possessing a more elevated rank in creation , than they had assigned to him . This becomes a source of livelier gratitude to the BEINo , who placed him there ; and thus are the highest and best feelings of our nature improved , and motives to piety and devotion confirmed . Those who possess this lofty sense of their own standing , can not descend to mingle with the unworthy , and follow their examples , or sully themselves , in any way , with moral pollution . On the contrary , they set an example , invaluable to society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be conferred on society by Rail-road establishments , is an improvement in common school-education . Parents , becoming wealthier by it , will procure for their children more competent instructers . They will also continue them longer at school . Thus will they cause them , not only to be taught more correctly , but to be more thoroughly initiated in the elements of knowledge . That such measures will contribute to the promotion of sound morals , as well as of enlightened taste and becoming manners , will not be questioned . They can not indeed fail to ameliorate the entire condition of society . Nor is this all . A further advantage of Rail-road arrangements will be , that they will give rise to other inventions and improvements in mechanics . This they will do , by stimulating the minds of gifted mechanicians to higher exertions . Men of genius are keenly ambitious , and therefore reluctant to be surpassed in their own departments . Hence the history of human improvement* teaches us , that one important invention or discovery , is usually succeeded , in a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the invention , of which I am speaking . The Rail-road itself was first prepared , and then was erected the locomotive engine , with its retinue of cars . lt is indeed inevitable that one improvement or invention must lead to another , because it gives a further knowledge of nature or art . By raising man a grade higher , on the hill of science , it places him in a purer and clearer atmosphere , unfolds to him more commanding views of things and their relations . and enables him to operate on them to better purpose . Thus is the chain of cause and effect , in human affairs , perpetually lengthening , the last effect becoming , in its turn , the cause of a further one ; and where the series will terminate , the prescience of man is too limited to decide . Again . There are certain branches of science , the knowledge of which will be , in a particular manner , promoted , in our own , as well as in other countries , by the establishment of Rail-roads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topography , mineralogy , geology , zoology , and botany ; and they all exercise a moral influence . A generally diffused acquaintance with these , will be the necessary effect of general traveling . True ; passengers can not satisfactorily study them , at the very time when they are swept alon , , in cars , at the rate of fifty or // 299 sixty miles an hour . But they can stop , at selected points , snake their excursions , explore the country , collect specimens for their cabinets , and have them speedily conveyed to their destined places . With the facilities thus afforded , a general knowledge of all the states of the Union can be acquired in a shorter tin*e , than the knowledge of some individual states can be acquired without them . Once more . I have already adverted to the vast increase of intercourse between the various points of the Union , which a system of Rail-roads will necessarily produce . This will prove highly beneficial , on a twofold ground , not yet distinctly spoken of . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by enabling and inducing invalids , and persons of feeble constitutions , to migrate from the south to the north , in summer , and from the north to the south , in winter . Thus , will those , whose infirmities and weaknesses require them , enjoy , at the proper times , the invigorating freshness of northern breezes , and the balmy mildness of the southern zephyrs . Nor is this all . The same increase of i*i*ration will greatly subserve the diffusion of education . It can not be denied , that , as relates to schools , and every sort of mental improvement , the east and north are , at present , far in advance of the west and south . But I have already remarked , that man is constitutionally an iniitative being , and that he looks upward for his models and examples . He is also , by nature , proud and ambitious , and , in the case I am considering , these qualities will operate to high and useful effects . The inhabitants of the south , feeling themselves , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around them , and being mortified by the contrast , will avail themselves of every means to attain an equality . They will read , observe , and reflect more themselves , and employ their wealth liberally , to procure more competent instructers for their children . Thus will education , the great improver of humanity , be itself improved , in those parts of our country , where it is now most defective , until its fruit shall appear in a general illumination of the mind of the nation , accompanied by sounder morals , better taste , higher prosperity , and more abundant happiness . But the hour admonishes me to close this discourse . Though my theme is far from being exhausted , yet , as respects the patience of the Lyceum , notwithstanding the indulgence they have extended to me , I feel persuaded that the reverse is true . A few further tho - ghts , therefore , by way of reflection on what has been said , and I shall have done . Taking our station on the isthmus of time , which we call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future from the past , something more than the dawn of a new era presents itself to us . A bright morning is somewhat advanced , and promises to lead to a glorious nieridian . In proof of this , an interesting and satisfactory experiment might be made . Let the present condition of Christendom be compared with that which existed but half a century ago , and the difference be noted . How vast is the contrast ! and at the same time , how gratifying to the feelings , and encouraging to the hopes of the philosopher , the patriot , and the philanthropist ! Since the date referred to , knowledge , with its concomitant blessiobs to individu* Is and nations , has been increased , in some respects , a thousand fold . Were it not that superstition has been curtailed in her power to delude , her votaries might he tempted to believe that magic has been at work . In un three preceding centuries had an equal amount of human improvement and happiness been produced . To prove this , I have only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blessings ( and they are numerous and great , ) which man has experienced within the period specified , America has become an independent continent , the United States a free , powerful , and enlightened empire in regenerated France , Liberty and Law have wrested the sceptre from the grasp of Despotism ; and human rights are , in some degree , recognized , in most parts of Europe . These changes alone , I repeat , make a sum of improvement in the welfare of man , superior , in magnitude and importance , to all that had been done , in any three preceding centuries , whose history is known to us . Jn contemplating these glorious and felicitous events , well may we exult in them , as members of the human family ; but our exultation should be trebled , by the recollection , that we are natives and citizens of the United States . Am I asked my reason for this allegation ? I reply , that , to the hleople of the United States , more than to all other nations , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly , they are all ascribable to the American Revolotion . That was the work of our fathers . The other blessings followed it , nod // were the product of the free and vigorous action , which it imparted to the human intellect , and gave direction to it . That our successful struggle for liberty gave freedom to France , independence to Spanish America , and a juster knowledge of human right to the other partially regenerated nations of Europe , the world has acknowledged , because the truth is too obvious to he questioned . The . /ihnerican origin of steam-navigation , which is another colossal stride in modern improvement , is also acknowledged . Nor are we without some participation in the invention of Rail-roads . The mind of Great-Britain , as well as that of other nations , ha , * been excited , expanded , and strengthened , and therefore rendered more inventive , by the influence of what has been achieved in the United States . But for the great mental awakening , which began with our Revolution , there is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in existence . But Britain is our mother , though she once treated us harshly , and does not cherish toward us , even now , all the tenderness that belongs to maternity . But no matter . The sooner that shall be forgotten , the better . She claims Rail-roads as her own invention- Be it so . We concede the claim , follow her example in constructing them , and cheerfully pronounce the invention another mighty stride in the progress of improvement . It is when we contemplate the present rapidity of that progress , and the certainty that it can not fail to be daily increased , by the constant accession of fresh causes and stronger powers , giving additional impetus to it-it is when we take this view of the subject , I say , and connect it with future years , that the effulgence of the prospect dazzles , while its grandeur overwhelms us . It is then that we are inclined to exclaim , with the poet , " Magnus ab integro secIonu* nascitur ordo . " And , should this progressive improvement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection , ( as I believe it will , ) the establishment of Rail-roads will be then looked back to , as one of the leading causes , that have co-operated in the production of that great consummation.
