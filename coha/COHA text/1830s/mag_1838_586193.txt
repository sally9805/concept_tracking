txt THE Speaker of the House of Commons is called the " first genleman of England , " and it is characteristic of the sturdy love of popular liberty , which that nation has transmitted to us , that such a title is more honored and respected than all the chartered peerages in the land . The Speaker of the American House of Representatives , though , unlike the British functionary ,  --  from the glorious privilege of our institutions , which make every man his equalnot heading the people , or directly representing their constitutional rights , is , nevertheless , in the dignity and duties of his office , the symbol and representative of those unalienable rights of free opinion and popular supremacy , which have made our country all that it is in the scale of nations . He is at the head of the purest representative body in the world , and directs the business and guides the deliberations of that proud assembly which is at once the heart , and hand , and voice , of the whole American pqople . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker of the House of Representatives may always feel honored in his nobly distinguished position . In these characteristic portraits ,  --  of which the design is to give our readers , whom we love to consider as rooted to the soil , a correct idea of those distinguished public men , who live for and before heir country , as they are seen from day to day in their ordinary avocations ,  --  the present sketch of Mr. Polk will be found equally spirited as a drawing , and happy as a likeness . He is represented in his place as Speaker , and standing up to address the House on a point of order , a part of his duty which Mr. Polk discharges with singular dignity and effect . The " Speaker 's chair " is situated on a semicircular platform in the curve of that magnificent Hall in which the House of Representatives meets . A railed desk runs round the whole , at which are seated the Clerk of the House and his assistants ; raised above this a few steps , is a similar desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimson drapery is suspended above it between two of the lofty , and wondrously beautiful marble pillars by which the Hall is supported , and which is justly inveighed against as incompatible with the Grecian simplicity and massive richness of the architecture around . Two large candelabras , are placed on either side of the chair , as represented in the drawing . // Mr. Polk 's manner in the chair is conrteous , dignified , and attentive , and his entire impartiality in giving the floor has been frequently admitted by the Opposition side of the House . His know. * ledge of parliamentary law , and of precedents attained by an unreraitting attention since his first election , is so conspicuous that no difficulty ever finds him at a loss , and has completely won for him the confidence and respect of the House , composed as it is of a large number of violent political opponents . In the narrative of his life , as given in the subsequent pages , the reader will have an opportunity of judging how justly this has been merited on general grouqds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , was born in Meeklenburg county , North Carolina , on the second of November , 1795 , and is consequently in the forty-third of his age . His ancestors , whose original name , Pollock , has , by obvious transition , assumed its present form , emigrated , more than a century ago , from Ireland , a country from which many of our most distingufshed men arc proud to derive their origin . They established themselves fim*st iii Maryland , where some of their descendants still sojourn . The branch of the family from which is sprung the subject of this memoir , removed to the neighbourhood of Carlisle , in Pennsylvania , and thence , to the western frontier of North Carolina , some time before the commencement of the Revolutionary war . Its connection with that eventful struggle is one of rare distinction . On the twent*eth of May , 1775 , consequently more than a twelvemoath anterior to the declaration of the Fourth of July , the assembled inhabitants of Mecklenburg county , publicly absolved themselves from their allegiance to the British crown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manly eloquence , which have become " familiar as household words* ' to the American people . Col. Thomas Polk , the prime mover in this act of noble daring , and one of the signers of this first Declaration of Independence , was the great uncle of the present Speaker , who is also connected with the Alexanders , Chairman and Secretary of the famous meeting , as well as with Dr. Ephraim Brevard , the author of the Declaration itself . * * Tradition ascribes to Thomas Polk the principal agency in bringing about th Declaration , lie appears to have given the notice for the election of the Convention and ( being the colonel of the county ) to have superintended the electio in each of the militia districts . He had been for a long time engaged in the service of the province as . a surveyor , and as a member of the Assembly ; and was thus intimately acquainted , not only in Mecklenburg , but in the counties generally . His education had been acquired , not within the classic walls of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amidst the passions and feelings of his countrymen . Dr. Ephraim Brevard ( the author of the Declaration ) and Wrai0htstill Avery , ( the first attorney&gt;eneral of North Carolina ) were men of the highest classical attainments , and contributing their enlightened resources to the shrewd native enthusiasm of Thomas Polk , produced a Titeclaration. at that time unrivalled , not only for the neatness of its style , but for the moral sublimity of its conception. - Jones 's North Carolina ; // Mr. Jefferson having , sincerely , no doubt , but upon merely nega* Pvc grounds , questioned the authenticity of this interesting piece *of history , the Legislature of North Carolina , with a becoming pride of patriotism , caused the evidence establishi g its validity to be collected in a complete shape , and deposited in the archives of the State . The people of Mecklenburg were , almost to a man , staunch Whigs , in the genuine , revolutionary , acceptation of the term , and have been up to the present day remarkable for their *inwavering adherence to democratic principles . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is often pleasantly observed that , at the last war , they took up arms six months before , and did not lay them down until twelve months after , he government . In the contest for independence several of Mr. Polk 's relatives distinguished themselves , even to the peril of life . ro be allied to such a people and lineage , is a fit subject for honorable pride . Liberty does not frown upon the indulgence of a sentiment so natural . She does not reject the heritage of honor , while refusing to add to it , social or political distinctions subversive of qual rights . The American people have always manifested an affectionate regard for those who bear the names of the heroes or martyrs of the revolution . They furnish not a proof of the alleged ngratitude of republics . The father of Mr. Polk was a farmer of unassuming pretensions , but enterprising character . Thrown upon his own resources in early life , he became the architect of his own fortunes . He was a warm supporter of Mr. Jefferson , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn of 1800 he removed to Tennesee , w*here he was among the first pioneers of the fertile valley of Duck river , then a wilderness , but now the most flourishing and popu%us portio of the State . The magical gro Ii of a country which was but yesterday redeemed from the sole dominion of nature , is a phenorPenon of great moral and political interest , and can not fail to impress a character of strength and enterprise upon the authors and particip*tors of the wonderful result . How can man languish or alt , when all around him is expnndii*g and advancing with irrepressible energy l In this region Mr. Polk still resides , so that he may be said , literally , to have grown with its growth and strengthened with its strength . Of co rse , in the infancy of its settlement , the opportunities for instruction could not be great . Notwithstanding this disadvantage  --  and the still more formidable one , of a painful affliction , from which , after years of suffering , he was finally relieved y a surgical operation-he acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings were read distinctly and audibly , at the court house door , by Col. Thomas Polk , to a large , respectable , and approving assemblage of citizens , who were present , and gave sanction to the business of the day-Meoir of Rev. Humphrey Huntcr. - Thd. // education . Apprehending that his constitution had been too much impaired to permit the confinement of study , his father determined* much , however , against the will of the son , to make of him a commercial man ; and with this view actually placed him with a merchant . Upon what slender threads hang the destinies of life ! A little more , and the uncompromising opponent of the Bank of the United States , the democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives , might have been at this day , in spite of his origin and early tendencies , a Whig preacher of panics , uttering jerernictd* for the fate of that shadowy and intangible thing yclept " Credit System , ' * " If shape it might be caild , that shape had noner Distinguishable in member , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that shadow em 'd , For each seem 'd either . " He remained a few weeks in a situation adverse to his wishes and incompatible with his taste . Finally , his earnest appeals succeeded in overcoming the resistance of his father , and in July , 1813 , he was placed first under the care of the Rev. Dr. Henderson , and subsequently , at the academy of Murfreesborough , Tennessee , then under the direction of Mr. Samuel P. Black , justly celebrated in that region as a classical teacher . In the autumn of 1815 he entered the University of North Carolina , having , in less than two years and a half , thoroughly prepared himself to commence his collegiate course* It will be seen from this hasty sketch , that the history of the Speaker furnishes an interesting example of talent and perseverance triumphing over disheartening difficulties in early life . So frequent are such instances , that it would almost seem that true merit requires the ordeal of adverse circumstances , to stre gthen its temper ani distinguish it from unsubstantial pretension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At each semi.annual examination , he bore away the first honor , and finally graduated in 1818 , with the highest distinction of his class , and with the reputation of being the first scholar in both the mathematics and classics . Of the former science he was passionately fond , though equally distinguished as a linguist . His course at college was marked by the same assiduity and studious application which have since characterized him . His ambition to excel was equalled by his perseverance alone , in proof of which it is said , that he never missed a recitation , nor omitted the punctilious performance of any duty . Habits of close application at college are apt to be despised by those who pride themselves on brilliancy of mind , as if they were incompatible . This is a melancholy mistake . Genius has even been defined the faculty of application . The latter is , at least , * something better , and more available . So carefully has Mr. Polk avoided the pedantry of classical display , which is the false taste of our day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished his early career . His preference for the useful and substantial , indicated by his youthful passion for the mathematics , has made him select a style of elocution , which would perhaps be deemed too plain by the shallow admirers of flashy declamation . The worst of all styles is the florid and exaggerated . It is that of minds which are , as it were , overlaid by their acquisitions . They break down beneath a burden which they ha ; *e not strength to bear ,  --  " Deep versed in books , but shallow in themselves . " The mind should rather be fertilized by culture than encumbered with foreign productions . Pedantry is at once the result and proof of sciolism . Returning to Tennessee , from the State which is , in two senses , his alma mater , with health considerably impaired by excessive application , Mr. Polk , in the beginning of the year 1819 , commenced the study of the law in the office of Senator Grundy , and late in 18 ' 20 was admitted to the bar . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great advantages , derived from the connection of his family with its early settlement . To this hour his warmest friends are the sharers of his father 's early privations and difficulties , and the associates of his own youth . But his success was due to his personal qualities , still more than to extrinsic advantages . A republican in habits as well as in principles , depending for the maintenance of his dignity upon the esteem of others , and not upon his own assumption , his manners conciliated the general good will . The confidence of his friends was justified by the result . I-us thorough academical preparation , his accurate knowledge of the law , his readiness and resources in debate , his unwearied application to business , secured him , at once , full employment , and in less than a year he was already a leading practitioner . Such prompt success in a profession where the early stages are proverbially slow and discouraging , falls to the lot of few . Mr. Polk continued to devote some years exclusively to the laborious prosecution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the more solid rewards by which it is accompanied . In 1823 , he entered upon the stos'my career of politics , being chosen to represent his county in the State legislature , by a heavy majority over the former incumbent , but not without formidable opposition . He was , for two successive years , a member of that body , where his ability in debate , and talent for business , at once gave him reputation . The early personal and political friend of Gen. Jackson , he was one of those who , in the session of 1823 , 4 called that distinguished man from his retirement by electing him to the Senate of the United States ; and he looks back with pride to the part he took in an act which was followed by such important consequences . In August , 1825 , being then in his thirtieth year , Mr. Polk was chosen to represent his district in Congress , and in // the ensuing December took his seat in that body , where he has remained ever since . He brought with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has adhered through all the personal mutations of party . From his early youth he was a republican of the " straitest sect . " He has ever regarded the Constitution of the United States as an instrument of specific and limited powers , and that doctrine is at the very foundation of the democratic creed . Of course , he has ever been , what is termed , a strict constructionist , repudiating , above all things , the latitudinarian interpretations of federalism , which tend to the consolidation of all power in the central government . He has signalized his hostility to these usurping doctrires in all their modes . He has always refused his assent to the appropriation of money by the Federal Government for what he deems the unconstitutional purpose of constructing works of internal improvement within the States . He took ground early against the constitutionality as well as ekpediency of a National Bank ; and in August , 1829 , consequently several ITlouths before the appearance of Gen. Jackson 's first message , announced then his opinions in a published letter to his constituents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection , and was , at all times , the strenuous advocate of a reduction of the revenue to the economical wants of the Government . Entertaining these opinions , as we shall have occasion to illustrate , and entering Congress , as he did , at the first session after the election of the younger Adams , he promptly took his stand against the broad and dangerous doctrines developed in the first message of that Chief Magistrate , and was , during the continuance of his administration , firmly and resolutely , but not factiously , opposed to its leading measures . When Mr. Polk entered Congress , he was , with one or two exceptions , the junior member of that body . But capacity like his could not long remain unnoticed . In consequence of the palpable disregard of the public will manifested in the election by the House of Mr. Adams , together with the means by which it was effected , a proposition was brought forward , and much discussed at the time , to amend the Constitution in such manner as to give the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . In favor of this proposition , Mr. Polk made his first speech in Congress , which at once attracted the attention of the country by the force of its reasoning , the copiousness of its research , and the spirit of honest indignation by which it was animated . It was at once seen that his ambition was to distinguish himself by substantial merit rather than rhetorical display , the rock upon which most young orators split . At the same session , that egregious measure of political Quixotism , the Panama mission , which was proposed in contempt of the sound maxim , to cultivate // friendship with all nations , yet engage in entangling alliances with none , gave rise to a protracted debate in both Houses of Congress . The exploded federal doctrine was , upon this occasion revived , that , as under the Constitution , the President and Senate exclusively are endowed with the treaty-making faculty , and that of originating and appointing to missions , their acts under that power become the supreme law of the land , nor can the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sound discretion* refuse , the appropriations necessary to carry them into effect . Against a doctrine so utterly subversive of the rights and powers of the popular branch of Congress , as well as of the fundamental principles of democracy , Mr Polk strenuously protested , embodying his views in a series of resolutions , which reproduced , in a tangible shape , the doctrines , on this question , of the republican party of 95 . The first of these resolutions which presents the general principle with brevity and force , runs thus : " that it is the constitutional right and duty of the House of Representatives , when called upon for appropriations to defray the expenses of foreign missions , to deliberate on the expediency or inexpediency of such missions , and to determine and act thereon , as in their judgment may seem most conducive to the public good . " From this time Mr. Polk 's history is inseparably interwoven with that of the House . He is prominently connected with every important question , and upon every one , as by an unerring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From his entrance into public life , his adherence to the cardinal principles of the democratic creed has been singularly steadfast . During the whole period of Gen. Jackson 's administration , as long as he retained a seat on the floor , he was one of its leading supporters , and at times , and on certain questions of paramount importance , its chief reliance . In the hour of trial he was never found wanting , or from his post . In December , 1827 , two years after his entrance in the House , Mr. Polk was placed on the important committee of Foreign Affairs , and some time after was appointed , in addition , chairman of the Select Committee to which was referred that portion of the President 's message calling the attention of Congress to the probable accumulation of a surplus in the Treasury , after the anticipated extinguishment of the National Debt . As the head of this committee he made a lucid report , replete with the soundest doctrines , ably enforced , denying the constitutional power of Congress to collect from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants of the Government , and maintaining that the revenue should be reduced to the exigencies of the public service . The session of 1830 will always be distinguished by the death blow which was then given to the unconstitutional system of internal improvements by the General Government . We have ever re // garded the Maysville Road Veto as second in importance to none of the acts of Gen. Jackson 's energetic administration . It lopped off one of the worst branches of the miscalled American System . Mr. Polk had assailed the bill before its passage with almost solitary energy ; and one of his speeches , * in which he discusses the general policy of the " American System " in its triple aspect of high prices for the public lands , to check agricultural emigration to the West , and foster the creation of a manufacturing population ,  --  of high duties or taxes for protection , and excessive revenue ,  --  and of internal improvements , to spend this revenue in corrupting the country with its own money ,  --  should be perused by every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has so much agitated the public mind . When the bill was returned hy the President unsigned , a storm arose in the House , in the midst of which the veto was attacked by a torrent of passionate declamation , mixed with no small share of personal abuse . To a member from Ohio , whose observations partook of the latter character , Mr. Polk replied in an energetic improvisation , vindicating the patriotic resolution of the Chief Magistrate . The friends of States Rights in the House rallied manfully upon the veto . The result was that the bill was rejected , and countless log-rolling ' projects for the expenditure of many millions of the public treasure , which awaited the decision , perished in embryo . In December , 1832 , he was transferred to the Committee of Ways and Means , with which his connection has been so distinguished . At that session the Directors of the Bank of the United States were summoned to Washington , and examined upon oath , before the committee just named . A division of opinion resulted in the presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that the Bank had exceeded its lawful powers , by interfering with the plan of the government , to pay off the three per cent . stock , was tame , and unaccompanied by pertinents facts , or elucidating details . Mr. Polk , in behalf of the minority , made a detailed report , communicating all the material circumstances , and presenting conclusions utterly adverse to the institution which had been the subject of inquiry . This arrayed against him the whole bank power , which he was made to feel in a quarter where he had every thing at stake , for upon his return to his district he found the most formidable opposition mustered against him for his course upon this question . The friends of the United States Bank held a meeting at Nashville to denounce his report . The most unscrupulous misrepresentations were resorted to in order to prove that he had destroyed the credit of the West , by proclaiming that his countrymen were unworthy of mercantile confidence . The result , however , was , that after a violent contest , Mr. Polk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Orleans Road Bill . // more than three thousand . Fortunately for the stability of our institutions , the panics which " frighten cities from their propriety , " do not sweep with the same desolating force over the scattered dwellings of the country . In September , 1833 , the President , indignant at the open defiance of law by the Bank of the United States , and the unblushing corruption which it practiced , determined upon the bold and salutary measure of the removal of the deposits , which was effected in the fob lowing month . The act produced much excitement throughout the country , and it was foreseen that a great and doubtful conflict was about to ensue . At such a crisis it became important to have at the head of the Committee of Ways and Means , a man of courage to meet , and firmness to sustain , the formidable shock . Such a man was found in Mr. Polk , and he proved himself equal to the occasion . Congress met , and the conflict proved even fiercer than had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House by such men as Mr. McDuffie , Adams and Binney , not to mention a host of other names . It is instructive to look back in calmer times , to the reign of terror known as the Panic Session . The Bank , with the whole commerce of the country at its feet , alternately torturing and easing its miserable pensioners as they increased or relaxed their cries of financial agony ; public meetings held in every city with scarcely the intermission of a day , denouncing the President as a tyrant and the enemy of his country ; deputations flocking from the towns to extort from him a reluctant submission ; Whig orators traversing the country , and stimulating the passions of excited multitudes , without respect even to the sanctity of the Sabbath ; inflammatory memorials poured into Congress from every quarter ; the Senate almost decreeing itself into a state of permanent insurrection , and proclaiming that a revolution had already begun ; all the business of legislation in both wings of the Capitol postponed to that of agitation and panic ; an extrajudicial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in violation of usage and of the Constitution ,  --  these features present but a faint picture of the alarm and confusion which prevailed . Consternation had almost seized upon the the republican ranks , thinned by desertions and harassed by distracting doubts and fears . But the stern resolve of him whose iron arm guided the helm of State , conducted the perilous conflict to a successful issue . Nor should we forget the eminent services of the individual who presided over the Committee of Ways and Means . His coolness , promptitude , and abundant resources were never at fault . His opening speech in vindication of the President 's measure , contains all the material facts and reasons on the republican side of the question , enforced with much power and illustrated by great research . To this speech almost every member of the Oppo // sition , who spoke upon the question , attempted to reply , but the arguments which its author brought forward to establish the power of the President under the Constitution , as elucidated by contemporaneous or early exposition , to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-handed and tyrannical usurpation , could neither be refuted nor weakened . Mr. McDuffie , the distinguished leader of the Opposition in this eventful conflict , bore testimony , in his concluding remarks , to the " boldness and manliness 's with which Mr. Polk had assumed the only positioa which could be judiciously taken . The financial portion of his speech , and that in which he exposed the glaring misdeeds of the bank , were no less efficient . When Mr. McDuffie had concluded the remarks to which we have alluded , a member from Virginia , after a few pertinent observations , demanded the previous question . A more intense excitement was never felt in Congress than at this thrilling moment . The two parties looked at each other for a space , in. sullen silence , like two armies on the eve of a deadly conflict . The motion of Mr. Mason prevailed , the debate was arrested , and the division proved a triumphant victory for the republican cause . The Bank then gave up the contest in despair . The position of Chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most arduous and responsible one , was doubly so at this session , which will form an epoch in the political annals of the country . Mr. Polk occupied it for the first time . From its organization and the nature of its duties , this committee must be at all times the chief organ of every administration in the house . At this session it was for obvious reasons peculiarly so . To attack it , then , was to strike at the government ; to embarrass its action was to thwart the course of the administration . Extraordinary and indiscriminate opposition was accordingly made to all the appropriation bills . It was avowed in debate , that it was within the scope of legitimate opposition , to withhold even the ordinary supplies until the deposits were restored to the Bank of the United States ; that this restitution must be made , or revolution ensue . The Bank must triumph , or the wheels of government be arrested . The peoshould never forget the perils of a contest , in which they were almost constrained to succnmb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power in the State of such formidable faculties . The tactics which we have just described , threw great additional labour ppon the committee , and particularly upon its chairman . Fully apprised of the difficulties he had to encounter , he maintained his post with sleepless vigilance and untiring activity . He was always ready to give the House ample explanations upon every item , however minute , of the various appropriations . He was ever prompt to meet any objections which might be starte4 and of quick sagacity to detect the artifices to which // factious disingenuousness is prone to resort . All the measures of the committee , including those of paramount importance , relating to the bank and the deposits , were . carried in spite of the most immitigable opposition . The true-hearted republicans who conducted this critical conflict to a successful issue , among whom Mr. Polk occupies a distinguished rank , deserve the lasting gratitude of the country . Towards the close of the memorable . session of 1834 , Mr. Speaker Stevenson resigned the chair , as well as his seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Polk as his successor , but in consequence of a division in its ranks , the Opposition , to whom his prominent and uncompromising course had ren-. dered bin-i less acceptable , succeeded in electing a gentleman , then . a professed friend , but since , a decided opponent of the President and his measures . Mr. Polk 's defeat produced no change in his , course . He remained faithful to his party , and assiduous in the performance of his arduous duties . In December , 1835 , he was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives , and chosen again in September last , after an animated contest . The duties of this difficult situation , it is now conceded , he has discharbe.d with rare fidelity and fairness . In the beginning unusual difficulties were thrown in his way by an animosity which was sometimes carried to an extent that called forth general animadversion . During the first session in which he presided , more appeals were taken from his decision than had occurred in the whole period since the origin of the Government ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many of his political adversaries . Strangers of all parties who visit Washington are struck with the dignity , promptitude , and imparti .. ality with which he presides over the deliberations of the House . It was with great pleasure that we heard , but the other day , an eminent member of the Opposition in that body , bear the same testimony . Notwithstanding the violence with which he had been assailed , Congress passed , at the close of the session in 1837 , an unanimous vote of thanks to its presiding officer , from whom it separated with the kindest feelings ; and no man , now , could enjoy its confidence and friendship in a higher degree . His calmness and good temper have allayed the violence of opposition , in a sta .. tion for which his quickness , coolness , and sagacity eminently qualify him . Few public men have pursued a firmer or more consistent course that Mr. Polk . Upon several emergencies , when the current of popular opinion threatened to overwhelm him , he has sternly adhered to the convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather that rise by their abandonment . This , we have no .. ticed , was the case after his bank report in 1833 , and he incu*rred the same hazard , when in 1835 he avowed his unalterable pur // pose not to separate from the democratic party in the presidential election . On each of these occasions , the popular excitement in his district , would have appalled and driven back a timid and timeserving politician . Had he been governed by selfish motives ; had he consulted his own personal ease and looked to his re-election alone ; had be , in short , regarded success more than principle , he would have yielded his own convictions to the indications , not to be mistaken , of popular opinion . But he took counsel of nobler sen timents , and with a fearlessness characteristic of his whole public course , avowed and persisted in his well-matured determinations . He succeeded in carrying truth home to an enlightened constituency , was sustained by increasing majorities , and is now so strong in the good will of his district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing can be more false than the charge of subserviency which has been brought against him , in common with the prominent supporters of the late administration . It is true , that despising the cant of no party , which has ever been the pretext of selfish and treacherous politicians , and convinced that in a popular government nothing can be accomplished by isolated action , he has always acted with his party , as far as principle would justify . Upon most of the prominent measures of the late administration , however , his opinions were not only generally known , but he had actually spoken or voted , before the accession of Gen. Jackson to power . Mr. Polk is a ready debater , with a style and manner forcible and impressive . In discussion , he has been always distinguished by great courtesy , never having been known to indulge in offensive personality , which , considering the prominence of his course , and the ardor of his convictions , is no small merit . As a proof of his exemplary assiduity , he is said never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor of the House , his name being found upon every list of the yeas and nays . His ambition was to be a useful member as well as a prominent actor , and accordingly he always performed more than a full share of the active business of legislation . In person he is of middle stature , with a full , angular brow , and a quick and penetrating eye . The expression of his countenance is grave , but its serious cast is often relieved by a peculiarly pleasant smile , indicative of the amenity of his disposition . The amiable character of his private life , which has ever been upright and pure , secures to him the esteem and friendship of all who have the advantage of his acquaintance.
