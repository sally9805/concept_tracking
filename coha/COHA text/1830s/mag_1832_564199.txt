txt A Lecture , delivered before the Salem Lyceum , February , 1832 . BY HENRY COLMAN . ELOQ*3ENCE is the topic to which on this occasion I respectfully ask your attention . It may be deemed presumptuous in me to speak of it . This would be a hard judgement . We meet here as an assembly of inquirers . We may do what we can to assist each other 's investigations . We are often competent to judge where we have no power to execute . We can admire the picture of a beautiful landscape , its invention , arrangement , coloring , perspective , and harmony , yet be ourselves unable to paint even a leaf ; and we may criticise in good taste a masterpiece of sculpture , its proportions , attitude , fidelity , expression , its all but life ; and yet be incompetent to fashion even a waxen doll . In a community , formedon the liberal principles of mutual improvement , the humblest contribution will find encouragement and welcome . The river must not disdain the rill . Every drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the majestic stream which traverses a continent , and fertilizes vast territories by its inundations , may be traced up to some humble fountain , which a man may gather up in the palm of his hand . I shall inquire with diffidence , What is Eloquence ? what are its proper attributes ? what its necessary and true foundation ? I shall attempt this , not even with the hope of doing this grand subject any thing like justice ; but with the humble desire of contributing something to stimulate and direct the thoughts of reflecting minds , and of suggesting some few rules , by which the judgement may he guided in a matter of universal conversation and interest . What is Eloquence ? This is a question to which the answer is not easy . If it were not departing too much from the gravity of the subject , I might reply with the young lady to a certain question of a more tender character , and say that I can not describe it , but it is something , putting her hand to her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , as of the beauty or attractiveness of the human countenance ; not that it consists in any regularity of form , any color of the eye , any tints of the cotuplexion , of any particular feature or any particular combination of features , but a certain expression , uniting and blending what is personal , intellectual , and moral , which is neither to be described nor resisted . Eloquence is the power of persuasion . It is the power of convincing by argument ; of conveying a vivid representation of what is purely sensible by language and gesture ; of inflaming the imagination of others ; of moving their affections ; of waking their passions ; of impelling them to action ; the power , not of ruffling the surface merely , but of stirring the deep waters of the soul from their lowest springs ; of melting to tenderness by the warmth which it infuses , and making the heart liquid , so that it pours itself out in the gushes of sympathy ; or of rousing all the sleeping energies of the soul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempest , which it gathers within his own bosom . Eloquence is made up of voice , gesture , language , sentiment and passion . This is not a perfect analysis ; much else is wanting to complete the proper combination and to secure the highest triumphs of eloquence ; but let us briefly remark on these topics , as far as they may be concerned in it . To a perfect orator a good voice and a full command of it are essential . It should be clear , distinct and full ; neither squeaking nor harsh , neither a whistle nor a growl ; but susceptible of all the various inflections and alternations from a forte to a pianissimo , which may suit the different sentiments , it may be required to express . There is great power in the human voice , it is capable of most extraordinary modulations . Even those persons , who are little susceptible of the influence of music , are often subdued by its gentle accents , and roused by its deep intonations . But above all things , it should be natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . The slightest affectation is offensive , and a departure from our natural tones becomes as unpleasant to the hearer as it is painful to the speaker . Gesture is considered as the second requisite in public speaking . The books are full of directions on this subject ; but all artificial rules are useless , excepting as far as they teach us to avoid what is extravagant , awkward , and grotesque . A little awkwardness , however , is by no means offensive , where we see that it is natural ; or where it doe0 not proceed to an excess , which renders it painful ; or // where it springs from real diffidence or modesty , which always conciliate an audience . In respect to action , men differ very much in their natural habits and temperament . Nations differ as much as individuals . The English deal little in gesticulation . The French abound in it . It is difficult to give any precise rules , which would be universally applicable . Is a man accustomed to much action in common discourse , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , it would appear awkward were he to attempt it . All set forms of gesticulation , all moving by geometrical lines , all attempts of every kind at what is called mansmerism ,  --  let them be never so exact and graceful , and precisely according to the rules of art ,  - -  though they may please in a schoolboy 's exhibition , on serious occasions ,  --  the only legitimate occasions for true eloquence ,  --  produce disgust and defeat the force of even the best sentiments . The power of action is great . By action in this case I can not be supposed to mean the mere attitude of the body or the movements of the limbs ; but I mean especially the expression of the countenance , composed , as I before remarked , of I know not what , the knitting of the brow , the workings of the lips , the lightning of the eyes ; as when the whole face becomes illuminated , and men behold it , as the Israelites saw the face of Moses , when he descended from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an angel 's glory . There are few of the simple emotions of the mind , which may not be expressed in the countenance . All the passions present themselves at the windows of the eyes and are immediately recognized . The countenance amuses , reasons , intreats alarms , threatens , commands , persuades , while the mouth does not utter a word . Hope , fear , joy , triumph , anger , pity , revenge , all show themselves in the countenance , and are read there almost as distinctly as if the words were written on the forehead . We all know the force of such action ; and we can judge something of its increased effect , when the sentiment which it indicates is besides plainly expressed in appropriate tones and language . The power of action is very great , as most of us have often witnessed . I ask to he allowed to give what I have always deemed a very strong example of its effects . Some years since , I went with a friend in Baltimore to hear a celebrated German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own countrymen in his native tongue . Neither myself nor my friend understood one word of German . After the introductory services were over , this gentleman began his discourse . His animated , expressive , and pathetic manner , immediately arrested and riveted our attention . I was , more than once , affected even to tears . My companion was as deeply moved . I said to him , on coming out , that this man must have been discoursing on the Prodigal son ; and , on inquiry , I found the truth of the conjecture . I had imagined that I heard this young man demanding his portion and departing on his perilous adventure . While I listened to the father 's blessing , I saw all the yearnings of parental affection , and all the anxieties and forebodings of parental fear . I beheld the inexperienced youth , leaving the home of kindness and security , with plans unformed and principles unfixed , to encounter the seductions and perils of a vicious world . I traced his wayward and downward progress until I perceived him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vice ; and now a bondmuan and no longer master of himself , sunk down , a deserted stranger , in all the bitterness , and infamy , and squalidness , and unmixed wretchedness of vice and profligacy . Alas ! how fallen from what he once was . But life is not wholly extinct . His bosom heaves with the agonies of remorse ; the si*hs of contrition are quivering on his lips . A beam of hope is let in upon this dark picture . I perceive the first kindling of virtuous resolution ; conscience , not yet wholly gone , struggles again to recover her throne , from which passion had forced her ; and the wretched slave , at last , with a convulsive effort , bursting his fetters , sets out on his return . I followed him to his home . I beheld the pourings out of that parental love , which no ingratitude could extinguish , and the lost child embraced by the amazed father ; and I could not refrain from joining in the loud welcome of forgiveness and affection , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , I felt the power of action . Perhaps the mind was in a peculiarly favorable condition to receive its best influences ; the novelty of the occasion had its power ; the solemn chauntiug of the prayers and psalms in the Lutheran church affected me ; the soft and deep tones of a powerful organ , touched by the hands of a master , had passed over the soul and hushed it into a profound attention ; imagination was kindled and lent its aid to the occasion ; yet // with all this there must have been an indescribable force in the action , the attitude , the tone , the looks ; which now expressed sorrow , friendlessness , compas* sion , welcome ; and at last gilded this whole scene of mixed disappointment and hope , misery and joy , abandonment and return , with the rays of a divine mercy ; as , sometimes in the summer , after a day of fearful darkness and tempest , while the heavy clouds are lingering upon the horizon , and the big drops are falling fast , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes down in a flood of splendor . Language is the next branch of eloquence of which I proposed to speak . By language I intend not only the choice of fit and proper words , and their just arrangements , but the various embellishments of speech , and the force it may derive from similes , metaphors , allegories and other figures and ornaments . The first aim of every speaker should be to be understood ; and , in orde rto do this , he must himself understand . Much of the obscurity , which prevails both in writing and speaking , arises from the fact that the writer or speaker has no clear conception of what he means to say . This applies especially to extemporaneous speakers , whose great effort must be to say something and to occupy a certain time ; but whose talk is too often only a sort of muddy current , poured out with great profusion , and where possibly , by settlinr and siftino* and washing , you might in a S large quantity pick out a few stray grains of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; besides that , we have not time to do it ; we get out of hr eath in trying to keep up with the stream ; much less can we venture to dive into it , to see what may be found in its whirling eddies and boiling foam . If a man would say something , it is indispensable that he should have something to say . When he has a perfectly clear conception of what he means to express , he will generally be at no loss to find words to express it . The language of true eloquence is in general simple and direct . I mean by simple , the use of common words , freedom from all superfluous epithets , and the avoiding of every thing , which may come under the name of verbiage . This does not forbid the use of some of the highest embellishments of speech . The orator may seek to please as well as to instruct or persuade his audience , and by pleasing he may better obtain the power both of persuading and instructing them . Similitudes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only charm the ima , , ination , as the sparkling eye and dazzling scales of the serpent enchant the hoveriRg bird ; but by the power of association they deepen the impression of sentiments , which are uttered , and fix them immoveably in the affections . The too abundant use of figurative language , however , especially in argumentative or narrative discourses , though it may be all in itself proper , tends to distract the attention and defeat that singleness and strength of impression , which we desire to make . Elegant simplicity is always admired . This is as true ef eloquence as of every thing else . I hope I shall be pardoned my bad taste if I presume to say that , in female dress , when youth and beauty appear arrayed in simple white , with perhaps some single diamond sparkling among the auburn curls that nature herself has entwined , or some simple bouquet reposing on the bosom of innocence , how infinitely does such a celestial vision outshine the mere earthen image , tricked out in all the puffs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glittering ribands and sparkling paste , which wealth or luxury or vanity or folly can string together . The clover field in full flower , exhibiting a gaiety and splendor , which the magnificence of no kaleidoscope can rival , is not so strikino ' as the wild lilies and roses scattered here and there among the tangled bushes and along the winding paths . The glorious heavens themselves studded with a countless and crowded host of stars and constellations , in a clear winter 's night , do not impress us so deeply as when , at the change of the moon , on the bosom of a clear twilight , around the edge of which the gilding rays of the departed sun still faintly linger , we see the beautiful crescent and the evening star in new conjunction , as it were holding bright converse with each other on the glory of God . All inflated and bombastical expressions are in bad taste . Sentences , constructed with too much attention to harmony of sound , especially where they abound and succeed each other so often as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , become extremely wearisome . Illustrations drawn from the abstruse sciences are entirely misplaced , excepting where those sciences are familiar ; and allusions to mean and low objects are liable to offend by their grossness . To return again to the subject of figurative language , it ought to be remarked , that , to some men , this style of speech is much more natural than to // others . In some minds the invention , or imagination , or what the Plirenologists would call the organ of ideality , is predominant . In cases where it prevails , as Hudibras expresses it , " their mouth they hardly ope , but out there flies a trope ; " we soon perceive that it is in a degree the natural mode of speech , their vernacular tongue ; it is evidently not forced ; we regard it therefore with more indulgence ; and , in the hands of those bright genuises , whose minds are tempered by soundness of judgement , their speech is like turning out a casket of gems of every hue and form and splendor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and yet so naturally and appositely , that the audience are now thrilled with delight ; now melted by tenderness ; now transported by rapture ; now impelled by deep passion ; the gay , or the sombre picture rises at the pleasure of the speaker , before the rapt imagination of his audience ; and all its brilliant scintillations and all its gloomy shades are reflected in the deep emotions of their bosoms . Ames was an orator of this description . The lamented Buckminster belonged to the same school . But the master spirit , who remains at a height as yet scarcely approached by any other , was Edmund Burke , that bold genius , which saw the flashes of its own light , reflected from every object on which it fell in an infinite variety of coloring and beauty ; and whose glowing speech , like the setting sun of summer , was often seen wrapping itself in clouds of every hue and form , and of matchless gorgeousness and splendor . The time which I dare to occupy allows me only to glance at topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening 's lecture . This must be my apology for many of the imperfections of this service ; of which imperfections I am not less sensible than my respectable audience . The next great attribute of Eloquence is sentiment . By sentiment I mean the subject matter ; the conceptions , the idea , the thing expressed . We attribute much to tones , to action , to language , to embellishment ; but the foundations of all true eloquence must be laid in the sentiment . Tones , actions , language , derive all their force from the sentiment , which they indicate or express . The skillful use of them may give increased force and interest to the highest conceptions ; but exerted under all the circumstances of effect and advantage , with which they are capable of being associated , they can never elevate nor render eloquent a mean or trivial or low thought . On the other hand , noble conceptions and sentiments , though unaided by the powers of rhetorical embellishment , and presented in a form the most unadorned , will often force their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own intrinsic weight and moment . In this matter , as in every thing else , we can not go against nature . Her laws are inviolable . If we mean to interest others , there must be an inherent interest in the subject presented . In order to impress them deeply , the subject itself must be momentous . If we would elevate their views , there must be a grandeur in the conceptions , which we seek to kindle in their minds . If we would stir their passions , the subject must be of a nature to make them feel . It is in vain to think of exciting alarm and terror , where it would be impossible to produce a sense of insecurity or danger . The lightning 's flash and the deep thunder would create no fear , were it not for the consciousness that instant destruction and death are often borne upon their blast . There can be no eloquence , therefore , unless there is eloquence , - if the expression be ahlowable ,  --  in the thought or subject itself ; or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or expressions employed . I proceed to the last and highest attribute of Eloquence , which is passion . No man can be eloquent , who does not himself feel deeply ; and even in argumentative discourses of the most logical character , and where the reasoning approaches almost to mathematical demonstration , an audience will not be impressed , they will scarcely listen with patience , if they are not persuaded that the conclusions to which the orator would tbrce them are the deliberate and solemn convictions of his own mind . He who would persuade others must be himself persuaded . He must be sincere . He must be in earnest . In all serious cases ,  --  and no man can be eloquent in any other ,  --  the slightest suspicion that the orator is merely acting a part , that he is not himself true to what he utters , will defeat his success . It may be said that the effect of theatrical representations contradicts these positions , for persons feel as much at the performance of a tragedy , where the acting is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real . But is it not the case that we do not feel on such occasions until we forget that it is fiction , and surrender ourselves to the illusion of its reality , which the scenery , the circumstances , and the natural , powerful acting are adapted to create ? // On EIo*uence . To be eloquent , a man must be true to nature . This is , perhaps , saying all that can be said . His whole soul must enter into the subject which he would have enter into the souls of others . It is for this reason that every thing , which appears like mannerism , all affectation , all prettinesses , all exquisite attention to motion , attitude , tones , pronunciation , injure or destroy the effect and purpose of the orator . A decent personal appearance is , on the part of every gentleman , a matter of proper respect to his audience ; slovenliness , or an affectation of indifference or negligence on this subject , is always disgusting , and much oftener springs from vanity than from absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - excuse a word . for which I hardly know how to find a substitute ,  --  all nice adjusting of the hair , all simpering with the mouth , all solicitude about the collar of the shirt or the tie of the cravat , and all flourishes of the hand , that we may display the whiteness of its complexion or the brilliancy of the diamond , which sparkles on the finger , are as offensive as they are contemptible . Such things are beneath the dignity of true eloquence . The triumphs of true eloquence , pathetic , magnificent , sublime , awful as they sometimes are , are seen only when the orator stands before you in the simple majesty of truth , and , overpowered with the strength of his own convictions , he forgets himself , and forgets every thing but his great subject ; you think no longer of who speaks , or how he speaks , but of what is spoken ; subdued by the gushes of his tenderness , your tears mingle with his ; determined by the power of his reasoning , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield to the force of arguments , which bring with them this pledge of their power ; entering with his whole mind and soul into the subject of his address , you sympathize in those strong emotions which you see are , in his bosom , burning and struggling for utterance ; and soon find yourself moving onwards with him on the same impetuous and resistless curient of feeling and passion . These are among the highest efforts of eloquence . Those only are capable of producing such effects , who are themselves susceptible of these deep emotions ; who themselves at the time actually feel them , and have within their own hearts the fire , which they would kindle in the bosoms of others . I should be happy on this occasion to have adduced examples of this eloquence , and to have illustrated by various references the remarks which I have made ; but I would not willingly trespass upon your kindness . The forbearance even of the greatest kindness can only reach to a certain point ; and it is both folly and waste in the pensioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insist upon your making it run over . Of the eloquent writers in the English language Shakspeare still bears off the palm froni all others . He was a miracle of genius . To the most wonderful powers of conception , and the most extraordinary vivacity , loftiness and brilliancy of imagination , he added a knowledge of human nature and a thorough insight of the workings of human passion , with a power of expressing them , which have never been surpassed . There is , it must be admitted , much trash and nonsense and grossness and objectionable matter in his plays . Passages in abundance may be selected from the writings of other men equal in eloquence to any thing which he has written ; but no writer , in proportion to what he has written , presents so much that is truly eloquent ; no writer understood so perfectly the language of deep passion ; and no writer is , perhaps , capable of keeping up the feelings of his readers for such a length of time , or of wringing their hearts almost to breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take for an example the interview of Hamlet with the Ghost of his murdered father , in which that imaginary personage exhorts him to revenge his father 's death , and discloses to him the iniquity of his mother and uncle . What , indeed , must be the effect of such scenes in the representations of men like Garrick or Talma ! It might be expected that I should go on now to speak of the different kinds of eloquence , narrative , argumentative , deliberative , passionate , or , of that which combines the whole . But it would be unjust to you and to my subject on such an occasion as this to attempt it . My object in reference to this subject has been only in a humble skiff to skirt along its shores , and to point out to you its grand outlines , as they are marked upon the horizon , but to explore the country , to advance into the interior , to visit its beautiful , its grand , and its magnificent scenery , to penetrate its deep forests , to trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascend its lofty mountains , and , above all , to think to touch those rocks from which the waters of inspiration gush forth , would demand a lengthened voyage and a guide far different from one , who has seen it only in the distant prospect and under a hazy sky . // Of the state of eloquence in our own country I shall scarcely speak . As far as eloquence belongs to art , it would be unjust to compare the eloquence of our country with that of Europe ,  --  the greenness of youth with the vigor of manhood . As far as it belongs to nature , there are examples in the history of the aborigines of this country of a grand and touching eloquence , which will live in the story of this abused race as long as , in their own expressive allusions , the trees wave in their forests ,  --  the winds , responsive to their just complaints , echo among their mountains ,  --  and the waters , like the tide of their mighty griefs , continue to flow . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now without them ; stars in our western hemisphere of the first macrnitude , shining with their own native light . Men of true eloquence will always be rare . Many qualities must combine to form an orator in the highest sense of that great name ; and genius itself is an infrequent gift . At the bar we have had eloquent pleaders , who , by the power of argument , were able to force conviction . We have had eloquent men in our deliberative assemblies . The great*occasions in our history have called them out ; men , who came forth uncovered and almost alone in the hour of darkness and storms to proclaim a nation 's wrongs and to demand a nation 's rights ; men , whom patriotism and philanthropy made eloquent ; who sealed their devotion with their blood , and who in the convulsive throes of expiring nature , shouted Liberty forever in tones , which shook the throne of despotism to its foundations . Other great men , competent to meet the emergencies of the country , have succeeded them ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shield of their powerful eloquence over the constitution of our country , the great palladium of our liberties and rights , the last and best hope of the friends of liberty throughout the world . The pulpit among us has not been without its eloquent men ; men , not less eloquent in their own deep impressions of religious truth , in the purity of their lives , in their self-devotion , and the disinterestedness of their zeal , in their fervent piety and their solicitude for the eternal well-being of those whom they addresscd , than in the power of their reasoni'ngs to enforce the principles of God 's everlastiirg truth , and in their array of the high and holy motives which should lead men to provide for theireverlasting welfare . The eloquence of the pulpit , in my humble opinion , differs from every other . It should deal less ,  --  nay , rather it should not deal at all ,  --  in any tricks of art . To enforce convictions of what is true ; to persuade men to what is good ; to rouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desponding ; to console the broken-hearted ; to excite men to virtue ; to leindle and cherish within them benevolent and pious affections ; to direct their attention to a future life ; to impress them with the conviction of their own moral responsibility ; in a word , instead of mere worldly to make them religious beings , to raise them from the death of sin to a life of righteousness , and to aid in forming their characters for a world of unmixed and ineffable purity and glory-these are the great ends of the Christian ministry ; and to do all this , and to urge all this under the teachings of divine inspiration and the immediate and oracular revelations of the Deity himself is the business of the eloquence of the pulpit . In such a case , a man may well put forth all his power . How , if he be what he would seem to be , can he do otherwise ? He may summon to his aid all the helps of the imagination , of learning , of genius , in a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we say , and speaking to those who should also feel it . I submit to the judgement even of a child-is there any thing so offensive in the oratory of the pulpit , as that of a man 's acting his part , and " playing such tricks before high heaven as would make even angels weep . " But here the people are as much to blame , where blame applies , as the minister . They flatter the man ; they too often make a fool of him . They speak of his performance as they would speak of a player on the stage ; they boast to him of his person , his voice , his genius , his success . Human nature can hardly bear this ; men are either chagrined and mortified and distressed by the fear of public censure and criticism , or they become inflated with the passion for display ; they drink in the intoxicating nectar of flattery until they can not live without it ; our churches become mere theatres , and the true spirit of Christian zeal and piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature ! Would to God that it were not so ! It is indeed humiliating , when you have striven to pour out your whole soul to persuade , to reclaim , to comfort , to rescue , to save those who hear you , to be told by some heartless flatterer , perhaps some man who thinks to do you a kindness , " Well , this is fine . " // The only way to be eloquent in the pulpit , most surely , is not to think of ones self ; but to forget every thing but God and your duty . Why should we think of ourselves ? We are poor , frail , ignorant , imperfect , sinful beings , like those whom we address . We can claim no exemption from any of the ills or any of the imperfections , " which flesh is heir to . " We are fellow pilgrims on the same road . We are candidates for the same eternal life or death . We must stand without distinction at the same tribunal . Let us feel this ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vain glory , and make us trample them in the dust ; and when , feeling this , we come before our fellow beings to speak to them from the fulness of our own hearts , of God , of judgement , and of immortality , the subjects themselves , by their own native and inherent grandeur , solemnity and everlasting moment , will need little extrinsic aid and few of the embellishments of artificial eloquence to impress the hearts of those to whom they are addressed . I have thrown out these imperfect hints for your reflection . Accept them in your kindness , simply as a testimony of my good will towards the institution , in whose behalf I have appeared . What a delightful spectacle is presented in your association for mutual improvement in all that is intellectual and moral . Go on !  --  and may your institution be continually advancing . You come here for the high purposes of education . You turn aside from the ordinary and distracting pursuits of life , where , amidst its whirls and eddies , its corroding anxieties and noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you may engage in the higher purpose of providing food for the mind , and stimulating and expanding its celestial attributes . It is a privilege and a noble duty . The human mind is the emanation of the divine intelligence ; the image of the divine glory ; the most brilliant gift of the Creator in his exuberant bounty . How subtle yet how wonderful in it operations ! how diversified in its talents ! how bold in its conceptions ! how mighty in its effects Surveying places far beyond the reach of human sense ; controling events over which physical force is impotent ; erecting monuments upon which the revolutions of time effect no change ; measuring the material universe in its bold calculations ; penetrating even into the presence-chamber of the divine glory , and presuming to scan the perfections of that great Being , who occupies all space , lives through all time , and reigns in his own glory , undivided and supreme throughout the universe . More than this ; higher than all this ; clothed with the attributes of divine immortality ; destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , to go onwards and upwards , when every thing earthly and sensible shall perish ; and now , while yet on earth , by the dictates of reason , by the power of conscience , and by all the eloquence of religious faith , exhorted to fix its eye heavenward , to expand its powers , and to plume itself for an eternal flight . Men ! reasonable beings ! offspring of God ! children of light ! heirs of immortality ! he just to yourselves and true to the nature , which God has given , and the destiny , which he sets before you.
