txt THE literature of Christain Missions already forms one of the most interesting and extensive chapters in the general literary history of our times . Not many years have elapsed , since the spirit of protestant missions came into being ; - and already that spirit has kindled the altars of true religion in almost every nation upon earth , and engaged in its operations hundreds of pious , heroic and gifted individuals , of whose travels and toil , of whose noble schemes and glorious achievements , and martyr-like endurance of every conceivable form of danger and pain , - of whose godly lives and happy deaths , the records form an extensive library ; - a library unsurpassed , if not unequalled , in thrilling incident , in memorable record , in magnanimity of purpose , in valuable lessons , in praiseworthy actions . What a collection do we possess of missionary voyages and travels ; - travels that track the map of our earth from the icebergs of Greenland , to the torrid deserts of Africa ; - from the mountain-holds of our own ahorigines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all , what a host of biographies of holy men , and devout and heroic women , - . who have labored and suffered // and perished , in extending the limits of the kingdom of Jesus Christ , and who have left behind them that example , which the good in all coining ages shall love to admire and imitate , and that memory which is , in the language of Scripture , " blessed . " Could these biographies he collected and published in a series , xvl ) at an amount of the most valuable and spirit-stirring matter would thus he presented to the public ! We hope that something like this may he done , so that succeeding times may not lose the influence arising from a familiarity with such works . That this inFluence is very great , no one can doubt , who has himself read these biographies , or has had an opportunity of witnessing the effect produced upon others , hy their perusal . The writer of this article well remembers the xvarm flood of feeling which bathed his youthful heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary memoir refers the origin , or the full development , of the missionary spirit in its hero , to the reading of some other similar work . The pages of Boardman 's hiography are crowded with allusions to the spirit-stirring effect produced upon Boardman by the Memoirs of Brainard , and Mills , and Martyn , and Chamberlain , and others , their fellows in the heavenly work of evangelizing man . It is impossible to peruse the written life of any i-nan or woman , who has manifested great intellectual or great moral power , whether in a holy cause , or an unholy one , without a strong admiration and a deep sympathy , and a powerful impulse toward imitation . The soul is awakened , the active powers are roused , the contemplation of high achievement kindles emulation , and we are drawn towards the object of our admiration , like floating atoms on the stream towards the rush of the cataract . It would be well were the character of those leading minds , which thus draw after them the mass of mankind , always virtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances , the leaders of mankind are individuals whose principles and motives the Christian must condemn , as hostile to the spirit of the gospel . More precious therefore , is the example of that pious few , who have devoted themselves " with pure hearts fervently , " to the glory of God , and the good of man , and whose energy of purpose , and firmness of principle , and magnanimity in despising difficulty and danger and suffering and death , in the accomplishment of a noble end , rouse into active admiration all who contemplate their glorious career . // We bail with sincere pleasure the appearance of the biography of every such person , as the creation of one further instrum ent of advancing the Redeemer 's kingdom among men . The life of the late Rev. George D. Boardinan , is , on this account , xvelcomed from the press ; and after having read it pages , we turn with ardent zeal to the duty of making its character and contents known to the literary community . Boardman has but recently died : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising career in India , - He was an American ; - a man of fine learning and talents ; of rare moral qualities , and most zealous in the missionary enterprise . Lie is , therefore , entitled to our respectful consideration . The story of his life and labors will be found full of interest and instruction . Our readers will therefome follow us , we believe , with pleasure and profit through a sketch of his short but efficient career . He was the son of a Baptist clergyman , who still lives , and was born in Livermore , Maine , February 8th , 1801 . He was a feeble and studious boy , ardently devoted to the pursuit of knowledge , sometimes concealing his bodily illness in order to get to school , and always securing the esteem of his teachers , by his proficiency . At the age of twelve he had resolved on procuring that grand desideratum of New England youth , a liberal education , and apprehending , as well he might , that the narrow salary of his father would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he informed his mother that as soon as he came of age this should be his first object . His parents encouraged this noble spirit , and sent him to a preparatory academy in North-Yarmouth . While at that academy , an incident occurred , which illustrates both his uncommon ardor in the pursuit of learning , and his fine mental powers . He was put upon the study of the Latin grammar ; through which he passed with a rapidity before unknown to his teacher . Having thus quickly conquered the grammar , he hoped to be immediately admitted to the use of his Lexicon . But he was told that he must first go over the grammar once or twice more . Disappointed , he returned to his seat . In an hour or two he was called up to recite , and repeated verbatim ci literatim , sixteen pages of the grammar . His preceptor inquired if he had got more ; he answered " yes , " and on being asked " how much , " replied , " I can recite the whole book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // an equal power in the study of mathematical science . At the age of sixteen , he became a teacher in a village school , and displayed extraordiiiary power as an instructer ; reducing , as it seemed , almost without an effort , the most unruly and turbulent schools to perfect order and harmony . His acquaintance with human nature , and with the elements of control , at this early age , gave him almost creative power ; - so that from the chaos of the most unmanageable schools he called forth a beautiful system and regularity . His countenauce , by its power of ex*-pression , which was benignity tempered by severity , did much to control his pupils ; and he used to say that he considered a pupil as almost hopeless , whom he could not too/c into good behaviour . In May , 1S19 , at the age of eighteen years , he became a member of the collegiate institution , in the town of Waterville , Maine . While young Boardman was a member of this institution , early in 18*O , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constituted a college ; at which time he was found , on examination , qualified for admission as a junior , or third year pupil . He is described , by the late president of that college , as being at this time a youth of sober habits , and of superior intellectual powers , hut showing no strongly marked features of piety . He seemed to possess an unusual share of what Dr. Paley calls " the heroic character . " He was quick in his sensibilities , jealous of his fame , eager in his attachments , inflexible in his purpose . He was remarkable , too , for vigor , firmness and resolution , and for a kind of haughty independence which made him unwilling to be indebted to others for his opinion upon any subject . During his collegiate course he became a pious man . We can readily imagine that the operation of religion upon a mind so constituted , would produce no ordinary result . The great elements of the natural man , when brought under the control of spiritual influence , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever affected , xvould lose none of their efficiency ; - while they would become consecrated to holy purposes . " His independence of mind , " says Dr. Chaplin , " continued ; but the haughtiness connected with it , disappeared : " and so great were the promises of future eminence , in both learning and piety , apparent in his progress , that the good president , and other friends of Waterville , anticipated the time when the young scholar should preside over the college . // 380 April , These anticipations , as to the department of his future labor , were destined to be disappointed ; - and , as the circumstances attending Boardman 's religious conversion , and his determination respecting his mode of life and action , are peculiarly interesting , we xvdl briefly narrate them . The parents of Boardman were both pious ; and both , of course , labored to educate their son in the fear of the Lord . But , although a moral , a studious , and reflective boy , he never became thoroughly religious , until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were directed by a variety of circumstances , to a consideration of the vast and important topics of evangelical religion . His room-mate was a very pious , and most warm-hearted man . His class-mates all felt deeply interested in George 's moral state . The officers of the college , likewise , did all in their power to elevate his thoughts and affections . In short , every external influence , by which a young man could be surrounded , was calculated to lead his mind heavenward . Under the operation of these causes , he was , by the Spirit of God , induced to consecrate himself , body , soul and spirit to religion , and in July , 1820 , he made a public profession of his belief , and was baptized . From ibis time forward he engaged with characteristic activity in every mode of religious operation , and his letters and journals of this and subsequent dates , exhibit the most elevated and glowing emotions . He seemed to move in a world of bright light , and of a pure glory ; - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she exclaimed - " Go , wing your flight from star to star , From world to luminous world , as far As the universe spreads its flaming wall , Go , count the pleasures of all the spheres And multiply each through endless years , - One moment of heaven exceeds them all ! " A mere psychologist , acquainted with the powers and capabilities of such a mind , and beholding the ardor of the religions zeal which animated it , would have xvatcbed with intense interest the result of his actions . But a real philanthropist would find , in such a soul , a study of far deeper and more engrossing anxiety ; - for he would know that its movements were destined to exercise a power of tremendous energy over the condition of mankind . // We have Boardman 's own authority for saying , that soon after his conversion , his thoughts and feelings were turned towards Missionary subjects . " in the winter of 1820 , " he says , " the thought occurred to me that I could take my Bible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if ever , heard , and without sustaining the name of a preacher , could visit from hut to hut , and tell the story of Jesus 's dying love . Then , in imagination , I could welcome fatigue , hun*er , cold , nakedness , solitude , sickness and death , if I might only win a few cottages to my beloved Saviour . " Not long after this he hegan to meditate upon the condition of the Western Indians , and modestly considering himself unfit to preach among civilized Christians , he rejoiced at the thought of laboring , and at last finding a grave , in the forest . In 1822 his mind was directed , by the death of Rev. Mr. Colman , to the Mission in Burmab ; and his soul was stirred within him by the reflection , that millions and millions were every year perishing in that devoted land without the slightest knowledge of the gospel . It is consoling to those who mourn for the dead who die in the midst of their labors , to know that the event for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colman 's death , prove the actual cause of future additions to the missionary band . Colman sailed from Boston for India in November , 1817 , and was actively engaged as a missionary in Aracan , when death suddenly cut him down , in 1822 . The voice from his grave crossed the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic. , and fell upon the ear of one pious student in the heart of the forests of Maine ,  --  and that student responded to its call , and resolved in his soul that , God helping him , he would do something for destitute India . In February , 1823 , the thoughts of Mr. Boardman were for a while most deeply interested in the condition of the Jews , - God 's ancient people , who remain to this day a sad hut wonderful illustration of prophetic truth . " My mind , " says he , in a letter to his parents , " has been much occupied about the Jews , as it appears from several parts of the prophetic scriptures , that they are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . I have sometimes thought of becoming a missionary to them . I feel comparatively but little anxiety to what part of the world I am sent , if God calls me there . It is of but little consequence where I live , or where I die . Life is so short , when protracted to the longest , that the difference is VOL . XL. -. - . No.87. 49 // coml ) aratively small , whether we live at ease , or are compelled to toil in poverty , and live without a settled habitation . " His social nature was full of warm affections and tender sentiments . His love of friends and home was an intense passion ; but even his dearest friends could he resolutely ahandoned , his strongest passion controlled , for the sake of accomplishing his grand design . He remembered , and felt , and acted upon the Saviour 's words , - " he that loveth father or mother more than me , is not worthy of me . " In the letter just above quoted , he remarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference which looks aside from duty , ) would be " to live in the embraces " of his friends , especially of parents , and brothers and sisters , and finally to die in their presence . " But , " adds he , " when I take duty and eternity into the account , all these things , so desirable in themselves , appear comparatively small . Eternity will be just as long , and heaven just as sweet , if I die on a desolate island , or on some heathen shore , as though I should die at home , in the midst of my weeping relations . And as for a resting-place for my body , when I shall lay it aside , my bones can rest , - my ashes sleep , as securely in Burmah as in America , - on a desolate , unfrequented island , as in a christian church-yard . Why should I fear to lay me down in Burmah ? I shall hear the voice of the archangel , and arise from the grave as soon as though buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am willing to spend my days , and to breathe out my life , where duty shall call ; whether in America , or in some heathen land ; among the relics of departed saints , or by the side of Juggernaut . " On graduating at Waterville , IXIr . Boardman had resolved to enter info the missionary labor . But he was immediately appointed a tutor in that college , and most strenuously urged by all his own friends , and by all the friends of the college , to remain in his new relation . The struggle which then arose in his mind was great . He was impelled in one direction by his religious zeal , and by his favorite scheme of usefulness , - while every one else was urging him in another . He reluctantly yielded to importunity , as , probably , most young men of twentyone years old would have done , from diffidence of their own judgment , - but he did so with the avowed purpose to remain a tutor but a short time . " I now calculate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year of misery . My whole soul is engrossed // with the state of the heathen , and I desire to go among them : but I have engaged for a year , and I must remain U ' That year at length elapsed ; - he was free from his engagement ; - and he hastened to offer his services to the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions , - and was at once accepted as a missionary . The parting scene between Mr. Boardman and his religious friends at Waterville was exceedingly touching . In the corner room , on the third floor of the south college edifice , - from which may he seen the broad surface of the Kennebec , - the green fields on the opposite side , - the president 's house , and part of the village ; the room which he had occupied for several years , - there , surrounded by his christian brethren , who were members of the college , stood Boardman , about to give the parting hand , and to say the last farewell . He stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey , for the last time , the objects on which he had so often gazed . After he had lingered for a moment , to view each long familiar object without , he turned away from the window , and cast his eye around upon his beloved companions , who stood in silence , forming a circle quite round the room . All was still . The eye of Boardman alone was undimmed by a tear . In a tender and yet unfaltering tone , he addressed a few words to his brethren : - " My dear brethren , serve your Saviour unceasingly , and faithfully until death ,  --  and if it may not be your duty to be missionaries abroad , be missionaries at home ! " We all knelt down in prayer together for the last time . On arising , Boardman passed round the room , and gave to each the parting hand . His countenance was serene , - his mild blue eye beamed with heaven-like benignity , and though there was in his manner a tenderness which shewed he had a heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to his room-mate . As he took him by the hand , his whole frame became convulsed , - his tongue faltered , - his eye instantly filled , and the tears fell fast , as if all the tender feelings of his spirit , till now imprisoned , had at this moment broken forth : lie wept , he faltered " farewell , " and then , smiling through his tears , said , ashe left the room , " we shall meet again in heaven ! " Such is the account , as given by one who was present on that affecting occasion . In offering his services to the Missionary Board , Mr. Boardman had signified his willingness to be sent wherever they // would be most valuable . To his delight , however , Burmah was assigned to him as his field of future labor . He expected to sail within a short time after his appointment , in the same ship which carried back to India the justly celebrated and admired Mrs. Judson . In this expectation he visited , and took leave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents willing to consecrate their much-loved son to the cause of missions , although their hearts almost broke with the pain of separation . This willingness is worthy of universal admiration and praise . If every man of elevated principles and noble feelings , is ready to regard with emotions of moral sublimity , the stern justice of that elder Brutus who subjected to the claims of violated law his offending sons , and without a tear pronounced their fatal sentence , - how much more will such a one reverence the magnanimity of those parents , who surrender their son to perpetual separation from their presence , to all the hardships and dangers of an almost savage land , to certain peril and pain , disease and early death , in the arduous labors of philanthropy ! If we stand awe-struck in the ideal presence of Agamemnon , as he binds his lovely daughter Iphigenia upon the altar of a false and bloody deity , to propitiate favor for his countrymen , - ought we not to bow reverently to him and to her , who are moved by love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to surrender their son , bright with talents and virtues , rich in learning and the respect of all who knew him , but feeble and sickly in body , to the missionary labor , - whose certain and speedy end is death ? Boardman describes his own feelings on this occasion as being of the most painful description . They were , however , premature . It was finally decided by the Board of Missions to send out Mr. and Mrs. Wade with Mrs. Judson , while Mr. Boardman should remain some time longer for the sake of preparation in America . To make this preparation , he went , in June , 1823 , to the Theological Seminary at Andover , where he entered with his usual zeal upon the study of Hebrew . While in this institution , he read with thrilling interest the lives of Henry Martyn , Samuel J. Mills , Obookiah , and others , whose devotion to the cause of religion awakened in his breast a sympathetic ardor . He also entered deeply into the spirit of that " Society of inquiry respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to diffuse a knowledge of the Gospel through heathen lands , and a knowledge of the wants and woes of the heathen through the christian community . In the ample library of that society , he found every book that could facilitate his preparation , by making him familiar with the history , customs , manners and religions of pagan countries , with the extent , nature and results of missionary labors , and with the inner principles , the moving impulses , of missionaries themselves . Nor did he fail to make a faithful use of these advantages . He remained , with occasional interruptions , at Andover , till the spring of 1825 , when he was called upon to bid his friends a last farewell . We can not properly estimate the heroism of his character , without a full knowledge of the feelings which agitated his bosom in contemplating this final earthly separation , and the strong current of natural affection against which he resolutely braced himself at the call of duty . In his journal he thus writes . " What ! must I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers , and sisters and friends ? Must I die before the time ? For what is it less than death , to be separated from them , probably to see them no more on earth ? But at length it occurred to me that it was Jesus , the dearest of all my friends , who called me to go ; - then I said , welcome separations and farewells ; welcome tears and cries ; welcome last sad embraces ; welcome pangs and griefs , - only let me go where my Saviour calls , and goes himself ; welcome toil , disappointments , fatigues and sorrows ; welcome an early grave ! " In a letter to his sister , he says , " that some may perhaps think him destitute of natural affection , " but he adds , " they know not my heart , and are unacquainted with the struggles I have often felt . Be assured , my love to my friends was never warmer , my affection for them never stronger , than when I regarded them in the light of a speedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the greatness and importance of the work before me , I could not have endured the trial ! " in another letter , he expresses himself yet more forcibly . He says , " Think not , my sister , that I have lost all sensibility on the subject . Be assured , if tenderness of feeling , - if ardor of affection , - if attachment to friends , - to christian society and christian privileges , - if apprehension of toil and danger in a missionary life , - if an overwhelming sense of re // 386 April , sponsibility , - could detain me in America , I should never go to Burmah ! " " Since my appointment 1 have known seasons when the thoughts of parting from my friends seemed almost insupportable . " If ever man was , in the beautiful language of Paul , " constrained by the love of ( ihrist , " Boardman was thus " constrained . " But he was not to leave all his friends behind . One whom he most tenderly loved was ready and willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , like Ruth to INaomi , - " xvhither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou abidest , will I abide thy people shall be my people ; and thy God my God ; where thou diest , I will die , and there will I be buried ! " Fortunately for the missionaries , and wisely for their employers , it has always been the policy of the Mission Board to prefer married men for their service ; correctly considering that such persons are most likely to become efficient , contented and permanent laborers . In pursuance of this judicious policy , and in accordance with his own choice , Mr. Boardman was married a short time before his embarkation for India . His wife was Sarah B. Hall , a young lady of Salem , of whom , as she still lives , it is enough to say that she was just such a person as Boardman needed for a companion in his holy and arduous enterprise ; possessing fine natural abilities , which were excellently educated , and which were directed and sanctified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the missionary cause , - and like him was ready to devote herself , body and soul , to its advancement . That Mr. Boardman 's choice was a wise and proper one , we si*iall learn from his subsequent history . On the sixteenth of July , 1825 , Mr. and Mrs. Boardman embarked at Philadelphia , on board the ship Asia , for Calcutta . Their voyage was long , but not otherwise unpleasant , nor marked by any extraordinary occurrence . Mr. Boardman acted as chaplain of the ship , by preaching every sabbath , and attending public prayer every evening ; and at least one individual among the crew will always remember with delight the influence of these pious services . They landed at Calcutta on the second day of December , and were cordially welcomed by the English missionaries . At this period Great Britain , or rather the East India Company , was involved in a war with Burmah , and hostilities were carried on with great fury . The chief ministers of // the Emperor were determined never to submit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able conduct of Sir Archibald Campbell , had again arid again defeated the rude troops of the Burmese generals , and had captured several important cities , none of the ministers dared inform their imperial master of the actual condition of affairs . Such is Eastern allegiance We are assured by some of the missionaries , that although this whole war was one continued series of defeat , disgrace and loss to Burmah , the royal chronicles of that period describe it as one of continued and brilliant triumphs and victories , over an insolent but at last humiliated invader . By this war the American Mission in Burmah was wholly broken up . Dr. Price and Mr. and Mrs. Judson were prisoners at A va , while i*'Jr. and Mrs. Wade had been driven from the empire , and compelled to seek shelter within British jurisdiction . It was , therefore , impossible for Mr. and Mrs. Boardman to proceed to their original destination . They resolved to take up their abode with Mr. Wade 's family at Chitpore near Calcutta , and prosecute the study of the Burman language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence of some other event , which should open to them their proposed field of labor . Accordingly , they domesticated themselves in a little bamboo hut at Chitpore , - which was endeared to them by the fact that it had been previously occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Carey , and was now tenanted by Mr. and Mrs. Wade and Mrs. Colman . The residence of Mr. Boardman in and near Calcutta , was prolonged through a period of twenty months , during which time , besides studying the language , he preached almost constantly to congregations of English residents , and English and American sailors , visited the various schools and other institutions for educating and civilizing the natives , and , by communion with other missionaries of greater experience , prepared himself for his approaching labors . On the 14th of April , 1826 , Mr. Boardman announced to the Mission Board the termination of the war in Burmah , and the safety of the American missionaries . This last fact was the cause of unmingled joy through ) the whole christian world . Nearly two years an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price and Judson , who were universally respected* and also of that heroic woman , Mrs. Judson , who had returned // from America to her husband in Ava , just before the war broke out . There was every reason , which could exist apart from actual certainty , to believe that they had fallen victims to the fury of the king . In the language of Professor Knowles , " Those who cherished the belief that the missionaries were alive , relieil only on the power of that God who had so signally protected this Mission , and who , by an interposition almost as visibly miraculous as that which rescued Peter from his enemies , had recently preserved the missionaries at Rangoon , ( Messrs . Wade and wife , and Hough and wife , ) from instant , and apparently inevitable death . " Under such circumstances it is no wonder that the news " filled the heart " of Boardman " with joy and gratitude , " nor that he spoke of this deliverance from death as " one of the most glorious displays of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon at the treaty of Cainpo Formio , made it his first de**and , in giving terms to Austria , that Lafayette should be rescued from the dungeons of 01-mutz , and restored to liberty and France , every generous heart in Europe and America was moved with gratitude for the youn* conqueror of Italy . So , in like manner , when Sir Archibald Campbell , prescribing the condition of peace to the Emperor of Burmab , within forty miles of his capital , required the safe delivery of the long-suffering Judsons and Price , all Christendom admired the generosity of his conduct , and felt that such an act was worth more to him and to England , than all the treasure or territory acquired by the war . Thousands and thousands of pious hearts , in every quarter of the globe , will long cherish the recollection of this noble deed . It would be a pleasant task , were it proper , for us here to give our readers a full history of the sufferings through which the rescued missionaries had passed , and the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lovers of female virtues and heroism ; - but this is not the appropriate occasion for such a narrative , - and the story is already familiar to the American community . Mr. Boardman would have proceeded at once after the establishment of peace , from Calcutta to some Burmese province , - had he not been urred by the English missionaries , and instructed by the American Board to remain awhile in the chaplaincy vacated by the death of Mr. Laxvson , who preached in the Circular Board chapel in Calcutta . It was not until // March , 1827 , that he and his family actually entered upon their original plan of operations as missionaries to Burmab . In the month last mentioned he sailed from Calcutta for Amherst , the newly built capital of the territories recently ceded to England by the Burman emperor . This place had been surveyed and laid out , under the direction of Mr. Judson , by British engineers , and in an incredibly brief period , became a city of . many thousand inhabitants . In India the building of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the population fluctuates with strange facility from place to place . It is only necessary to make a clearing in the jungle , and erect barracks for a few soldiers , and , as water rushes at once into hollows scooped in the damp sea-sand , so do the swarming natives of india crowd by thousands into the clearing , and create a city . Amherst was built upon the banks of the Martaban , near its mouth , about twenty-five miles below the city of Maulmein , ( whose growth was like that of Amherst , ) and nearly seventy-five miles eastward of Rangoon . On his arrival at Amherst , Mr. Boardman first met Mr. Judson . Mrs. Judson was now in her grave , and her afflicted husband seemed to be almost worn out with trouble and suffering . A few days after this , Mr. Judson was called to bury his only child , his " tender-hearted , affectionate , darling Maria , " by the side of her mother . Mr. Boardman was obliged to make her coffin with his own hands ! It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judson , and Boardman , that two Mission establishments should be commenced , - one by AIr . W. in Amherst , another by Mr. B. in Maulmein , - between which Mr. J. was to divide his care . In prosecution of this project , Mr. and Mrs. Boardman proceeded on the 28th of May , to Maulmein . Of that city he says , " the native population of M. is supposed to be 20,000 . One year ago it was all a thick jungle , without an inhabitant ! " On the evening of May 28th , Mr. B. makes the following entry in his Journal - " Arrived at iVianlmein . After nearly two years of wanderings , without any certain dwellingplace , we have to day become inhabitants of a little spot of earth , and have entered a house which we call our earthly home . None but those who have been in similar circumstances , can conceive the satisfaction we now enjoy . " This sounds pleasantly , and seems to promise quiet , comfort and security ; // and perhaps the reader might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was about as pleasant and easy as any other person 's . We advise him to suspend his judgment , till he has examined somewhat more particularly into the facts in the case . Looking further along the Journal we find recorded against June 25 , the following startling piece of information - " last night our house was robbed of nearly every valuable article it contained ! " Is this one of the comforts of missionary life ? The robbery was committed by desperadoes from the opposite shore of the Martaban river . This river separates the British and Burmese territories ; on its western bank the deserted city of Martaban was the lurking-place of numerous hordes of robbers , who were continually crossing over at night for the sake of plunder , and who scrupled no more at murder than at robbery . On this occasion the plunderers , taking advantage of Mr. Boardman 's solitary situation , broke into what was called his house ; - " a house of such frail materials , " to use the words of Mrs. Boardman , " that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scissors ; " they broke open and rifled every trunk , box and bureau , and carried off looking-glass , watch , spoons , and keys , in short every article of value they could find . Fortunately Mr. and Mrs. Boardman were not awakened by the noise of the marauders , and knew nothing of their loss till morning . Had their slumbers been broken , there can be no doubt that they would have been instantly murdered ; for there had been cut through the moscheto curtains of the bed two large holes , one at the foot , and the other at the head , through which the villains doubtless watched with murderous eye the faces of the sleepers . After this robbery a guard of two sepoys was stationed in Mr. Boardman 's house ; but , as it seemed , their presence was intended to reveal the existence of another species of that danger , by which Mr. and Mrs. B. were surrounded . As one of the guard was sitting in the verandah , a tiger , or some other furious beast , sprang suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wounded him considerably . The silence of midnight was almost constantly interrupted by the howling of wild beasts , so that our friends were daily obliged to shudder at the frail structure and flimsy protection of their abode . An incident related by Mrs. Wade during her recent visit to this country , was listened to with thrilling // interest by the writer of this article , and as it seems worthy of repetition , now that we are speaking of the dangers of a residence in India , - it may be here related . In the rear of their bamboo hut was a small garden enclosed by a slight wicker fence , and surrounded by jungle . In this enclosure was erected a little summer-house or arbor , of scarcely firmer fabric than the wicker , and elevated a few feet above the ground . This room was occupied by Mr. Judson as a study , while the house was open for the reception of visitors , who might come to inquire about the new religion . Mr. Judson was engaged in tran*Iating the Bible , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the close of a day of toil , Mr. and Mrs. Wade retired to the study of Mr. Judson , for the purpose of spending a short time with him in conversation . As it grew dark they rose to return to the house . Mrs. Wade first stepped out of the summer-house , pausing on the steps to complete a sentence which she was uttering . A little dog that accompanied her ran out before his mistress towards the house . He had scarcely reached the gate when an enormous tiger leaped growling upon him from the jungle . The size of the spaniel saved him , for he slipped through the claws of the wild beast and ran yelping into the house . Robbed of his expected prey , the tiger , as though alarmed at finding himself encaged by the garden fence , walked rapidly around the area , snuffing the breeze and searching for an outlet . Mrs. Wade had retreated into the arbor , and through its frail texture the three friends now gazed upon their dangerous neighbor . As lie approached them he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused to fury by the smell of blood . At this moment a large mastiff , who was attracted by the yelping of the spaniel , came barking into the garden . Fatally for him , hut fortunately for his owners , he was seen by the tiger , who in an instant , with a howl that resounded far through the stillness of evening , sprang upon the faithful creature , siezed him with the gripe of death , and sprang off with his prey into the jungle . Occasionally moved to fear by incidents like these , Mrs. Boardman was ready to exclaim " oh for one little , little room , composed of such materials as would enable us and our babe to sleep in safety ! " At his house in Mauhnein Mr. Boardman , who had now acquired a tolerable knowledge of the language , devoted his // time to the reception and instruction of those natives who were curious to learn the religion which he had come so far to teach . He was almost constantly surrounded by these inquirers . He also visited among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the doctrine of the Gospel . On Sunday , July 22 , he and his wife alone sat down to celehrate the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper ; - and although far from all christian friends , they felt no ordinary degree of religious delight in performing that service . We have no doubt that , to a really pious man , the very circumstances of separation from Christians , and of being surrounded by the horrible rites and the unspeakahle evils of paganism , would be productive of both benefit and comfort , by compelling him to look within himself , and to his relation with the great Father of all , for enjoyment ; and would thus elevate and spiritualize his thoughts and affections ; while the awful contrast , ever present to his eyes , between the loveliness of Christianity and the loathsomeness of idolatry , must of necessity inflame his love for the one and his horror for the other , and thus at once add depth to his devotion , and ardor to his zeal for the conversion of the perishino crowd around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Boardman ; and in the pages of their journals and letters there appears the most convincing proog that to them the joys of religion were constantly on the increase . In October of this year Mr. Wade and wife , and Mr. Judson removed from Amherst , and joined Mr. B. at Maulmein . This removal was occasioned by the rapid decrease of population at Amherst , the inhabitants of which thronged into Maulmein . Before the close of the year two schools , one for children of each sex , were estahlished , and two places of public worship erected . In these houses of worship Mr. Wade and Mr. Judson were daily employed in proclaiming religious truths and in circulating religious books and tracts . The schools were speedily filled , and the zayats crowded with listeners . Two of Mr. Boardman 's pupils were children of a Burman woman who had died a Christian . He was gratified to perceive that the mother had early and thoroughly taught them Bihle truths , and that they were familiar with the narrative and doctrine of the sacred volume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them in January , 1828 : // " Believing in the Lord Jesus Christ , I daily , without ceasing , offer up prayers . I pray continually that the blessed religion of the Lord Jesus Christ may be established . I am reading the Gospel of Matthew , and the Epistle to the Hebrews , and am studying a tract . I have great respect and love for my benefactors who live in America , and affectionately address them this letter . " The labors of the missionaries were not unattended with success . Three of the natives became believers in Christianity and were baptised , within a few months ; and several more requested admission into the little church ; so that there was much reason to rejoice that the mission had been fixed in Maulmein . On the 8th of March , 1828 , our friends were threatened with destruction by a danger not altogether unknown in some portions of our own country . Just as they were lighting their evening lamps , they heard " the noise of a mighty rushing wind " approaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of bills eastward was enveloped in flames , which , with the roaring sound of a hurricane , rapidly spread through the thick and dry grass and undergrowth of the jungle , toward their bamboo cottage . As the fire flew on the wings of the wind from point to point , it seemed that nothing could rescue the house from its fury ; Mr. and Mrs. B. hastily packed up a few valuable articles and prepared to retreat from the devouring element . Their regret at being thus driven from their home was accompanied by a fear lest their path should be beset with the tigers , leopards , and other wild beasts , which were expelled from their usual haunts by the flames . The fire continued to advance till within a few feet of the houses , when providentially the wind ceased , and its progress was arrested . " Thus we are again preserved , " says Mr. B. " when no human arm could have saved us ! " The feelings of a husband were on this occasion associated with the love of a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once more without a home , pilgrims and wanderers . In accordance with the plan of the Missionary Board at home , it was resolved that a new station should be established in the province of Tavoy . This province , which is one of those ceded to England at the close of the recent Burmese war , lies at the head of that peninsula , which separates the Bay of Bengal from the Gulf of Siam , north of the Malay country , and adjoining // the kingdom of Siam . The capital city of this province , which bears the same name , is situated in latitude 130 4 , north , on a low plain , almost surrounded by high mountains . To this city , which is one hundred and fifty miles eastward of Rangoon , it was deemed advisable to send Mr. Boardman : and as duty seemed to require his consent , he gave it cheerfully , although contrary to his most cherished plans . He had hailed Maulmein as a home , and looked forward to a fixed residence therein with real pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly attached , and from his pupils and hearers he had reason to expect that many would become believers in Christianity . If it had been necessary for him to remove , and he had been permitted to select his own place of residence , he would have gone to Aracan , where labored and died that Mr. Cohuan , whose fate had first kindled in his breast a desire to go to India . But still lie was ready to yield to the wish of others , and settle in Tavoy . That this submission cost him some effort , and was considerably opposed to his own previous desire , we infer from some singular precepts which he wrote and sent to a young friend in America . He says Do not be disappointed or grieved if your brethren should pursue a course , in several respects different from what you should recommend l " On his arrival with Mrs. Boardman and his infant daughter , at Tavoy , they were kindly received by Mr. Burney the commissioner for the Tavoy district ; though their spirits seemed to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their days in Tavoy , or wander still farther . " One thin , g is certain , " says Mr. B. " we were brought here by the guidance of Providence . It was no favorite scheme of ours . " Within ten days from his arrival Mr. Boardman procured a house , was quietly settled , and had begun to preach in the language of Burmah to curious crowds of the worshippers of Guadama , many of whom manifested a very encouraging spirit of candor and inquiry . Soon after Mr. Boardman was established in Tavoy , lie was brought into connexion with the Karens , a singular and hitherto almost unknown race of men . Of this race we are induced to speak more particularly , inasmuch as recent inquiry seems to establish , or at least render extremely probable , its descent from a Hebrew root . // The Karens are a wild and ignorant race of men , scattered in prodigious numbers over all the wilds of Aracan , Burmab , Martaban , Tavoy , Mergui , Siam and other countries . They live in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - differing most essentially from the other inhabitants of the ahovenamed countries , with a peculiar physiognomy , a I ) eculiar language , peculiar mental and moral qualities , and characteristics They had no written language , and of course no literature , until Mr. Wade , one of the missionaries of the American Baptist Board , reduced their language to writing . But they abound in curious traditions , handed down from generation to generation , in the form of both prose and poetry . Amongst other traditional stories is this : - that when some superior being was dispensing written languages and books , to the various nations of the earth , a surly dog came along and drove away the Karens , and carried off their hooks . Because of their singular habits , their ignorance and want of written language , tli ey are called Wildmcn by the Burmans . Mr. Boardirian supposed that they were atheists , - but incorrectly ; for although we find among them few traces of religious belief , it is evident from the tradition just related , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , that they have a tolerably clear conception of a Suprenie Being . They are not , however , idohaters . Their simplicity of life may be learned from the short inventory of the chattels and personal property , which constitute their domestic wealth . These are a box of betel made of bamboo , - a little rice , a basket , a cup , two pots , a spinning-wheel , a knife , an axe , a mat , a few buckets , and a moveable fire-place . This is their whole array of valuables . They manufacture an intoxicating liquor , and are much addicted to intemperance . Too idle and effeminate to be quarrelsome , they are l ) eaceful and mild in their disposition and habits , and being persecuted and trampled on by their hau*hty neighbors , they are driven together by community of suffering , and attached by brotherhood in misfortune . A more extended notice should be given to those circumstances , which have led to the conjecture that the Karens are of Jewish original . At the request of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Karens , communicated to him the following results of his observation and inquiry in regard to them . Their countenance is decidedly Jewish : the // beard is worn long by many of them , and their dress , differing from that of surrounding nations , is precisely like that of the Hebrews , both in texture , fashion and mode of wearing . But it is their remarkable traditions which most strikingly indicate an affinity with , if not a descent from , the Hebrew race . These traditions have been preserved , like the poems of Ossian , by fond memories deli0hting to revive the recollections of former glory and prosperity ; - repeated by grandsires at eventide to their listening descendants , and sung by mourners over the graves of their elders . They believe in a God , who is denominated Kfi-tsa , or great Lord , - and Yu-wah , or Jehovah . That this last word is identical with the Hebrew Jehovah seems very probable . We know not how the original word in Hebrew was pronounced . The Greek writers spelt it thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle syllable , as Bishops Hare and Lowth both do , we have the Karen word Yu-wah . Like the Jews the Karens regard this word as sacred , and fear to utter it . They repeat a verse containing this sentiment " God created us in ancient time , And has a perfect knowledge of all things : Call him not Yu-wah , but call him Pii ; - ( great ancestor When men call his name he hears ! " With regard to God 's attributes , their belief is thus ex-pressed " God is unchangeable and eternal : He was in the beginning of the world : The life of God is endless : A succession of words does not measure it . " They believe in the existence of heavenly beings , who have never sinned , and who are the angels , or messengers , of Deity . The following beautiful verse is a part of one of their old poems : " The sons of heaven are holy , They sit by the seat of God : The sons of heaven are righteous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver seat . " // of supernatural beings . The following stanza might be mistaken for the production of David , or Isaiah : - " Satan in days of old was holy , But he transgressed God 's law : Satan of old was righteous , But he departed from the law of God , And God drove him away . " Another of their traditional relics , in the prosaic form , is thus expressed : " Oh children and grand-children ! in the beginning God , to try man , whether he would or would not observe his commands , created the tree of death and the tree of life ; saying concerning the tree of death , eat not of it ! ' He wished to see whether man believed . Not believing , he ate of the fruit of the tree of death ; and the tree of life God hid . Because the tree of life has been hidden , men have died ever since that time . " The Karens say that Satan tempted woman to eat the forbidden fruit of the tree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rib of man . The dispersion at Babel is thus described - " Men were all brethren : They spoke the language of God : But they disbelieved the language of God , And became enemies to each other . Because they disbelieved God , Their language was divided . God gave them commands , But they believed him not , And divisions ensued : and the ultimate fate of the earth , to which frequent allusions are made in their poetry , they say will be destruction by fire . Their religious code embraces the following scriptural duties - viz. love to God , prayer , repentance , abstinence from idolatry , honor to parents , which last is thus declared , - " Respect and reverence your father and mother ; for when you were small they did not suffer so much as a moscheto to bite you . To sin against your parents is a heinous crime . - It also includes love to others , - alms-giving , - universal benevolence ,  --  love to enemies ,  --  patience and humility : - and like the scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying , profanity , idleness , covetousness , avarice , intemperance , // anger and revenge . The following precept seems to have been drawn fresh from the sermon of Christ on the mount - " Oh children and giand-children if a person strike you on the face , he does not strike you on the face ; he only strikes on the floor : therefore if a person strike you on one cheek , give him the other to strike . " Respecting their own nation , the Karens say that God formerly loved it above all others , but that on account of its sins he punished it , and reduced its in*abitants to their present condition . " But , " say they , " God xviii again have mercy on us : God will save us again . " " Oh children and grand-children the Karen will yet dwell in the city with the golden palace ; - the Karen king will yet appear , and when he arrives there will be happiness . " Good persons , the good , Shall go to the silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the new city ! " " When the Karen king arrives , There will be only one monarch : When the Karen king comes , Rich and poor will not exist ! " " When the Karen king arrives , Every thing will be happy : When the Karen king arrives , The beasts will be happy : When Karens have a king , Lions and leopards will lose their savageness ! " Abundance of quotations from their unwritten literature might be made to illustrate the similarity which exists between the Karens and the Jews , and to show that they are a most remarkable race of men . But enough has been already laid before our readers , to excite curiosity and direct the attention of philosophic as well as religious inquirers to this hitherto unknown race . Such being their character , condition , and religious notions , it can not surprise us that when they heard of the religion of Jesus Christ from Mr. I3oardman , they were ready to admire and embrace it . Immediately after his arrival in Tavoy he was visited by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to converse in the Burman tongue , and who listened with the simplicity and candor of children to his conversation , and displayed so great a willingness to adopt Christianity , that he was led to question their sincerity , lie could not readily believe that a people so barbarous , so far removed from all christian countries , and who seemed to him wholly irreligious , were sincerely gratified to learn the story of the Gospel , and adopt the religion of Jesus . To us , who now know more about them , it seems by no means strange that they were thus affected . The few Karens who first called on Mr. B. soon returned to their mountain fastnesses , and circulated the thrilling news that a teacher , from a strange and far distant land , had come to preach a new religion ,  --  a religion that told of one God , of a Saviour , of a pure and peaceful and holy life , of love to God and love to man ; of an immortality , and of a heaven of blessedness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from village to village , and was every where hailed as the dawning of a long expected day , - the day when the poor Karens should once more have a national faith , - a religion answering to the traditions of their fathers . From far distant hills , and remote valleys and forests , Karen inquirers flocked to Tavoy , and thronging around the teacher , hung upon his lips , and eagerly listened to his instructions , and manifested child-like pleasure and credulity in receiving as true all his assertions . Mr. Boardman was amazed ; - he knew not what to believe or think . They urged him to come up into their wild hills , and visit them ; and promised that he should be welcomed as a messenger of joy . They told him many sin* , u Jar stories , and among others this ; - that more than ten years before , a man in a strange dress came among them , and preached a strange doctrine , and left among them a book in a strange language , which he ordered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one living and true God . After he went away they remembered and believed his words ; they appointed a priest to take charge of the sacred volume , of which they did not know even the language , and they continued , in defiance of severe persecution by the Burmans , to obey their unknown teacher , and worship the hook and the one living and true God . Mr. Boardman 's curiosity was aroused : he requested them to bring and show to him this sacred book ; and they readily promised to do so . Their compliance was delayed first by the // sickness of the person who acted as priest or guardian of the mysterious volume , and next by the floods which in the rainy season of the year completely cut off the city of Tavoy from the Karen villages . It was not till September that they succeeded in gratifying Mr. Boardman 's wishes . Early in September , on returning home one day from his house of public worship , ( zayat ) he found his dwelling thronged with Karens , who informed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much venerated book . He called them up and inquired what they wished ; - when the teacher came forward , and thus replied . - " My Lord , your humble servants have come from the wilderness to lay at your lordship 's feet a certain book , and to inquire of your lordship whether it is good or bad , true or false . We , Karens , your humble servants , are an ignorant race of people ; we have no books , no written language ; we know nothing of God or his law . When this book was given us we were charged to worship it , which we have done for twelve years . But we know nothing of its contents , not so much as in what language it is written . We have heard of the Gospel of Jesus Christ , and are persuaded of its truth , and we wish to know if this book contains the doctrine of that Gospel . We are persuaded that your lordship can easily settle that question , and teach us the true way of becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , when the old man opened a large basket , and having removed fold after fold of xvrappers , he handed out an old tattered duodecimo volume ; - it was an English copy of the Prayer Boo/c and Psalter ! For twelve years had this little work been made an object of ignorant worship . The deified book , through the politeness of the Baptist Missionary Board , now lies before the writer of this article . It is covered with coarse , blue , cotton cloth , and wrapped about with a long strip of muslin , white , striped , and rudely embroidered . The volume has lost both its covers , and several of the outside pages at each end ; but fortunately the title-page to the Psalms , towards the close , is in good preservation . The gilding of the leaves is only partially injured . It is a pLasing and singular fact that , in its l ) rese1*t condition , the volume cornmences with the collect for The Epiphany , or the manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles . The title-page to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of PSALMS , collected into English Metre , // by THOMAS STERNHOLD , JOHN HOPKINS , and others ; conferred with the Hebrew ; set forth and allowed to be sung in all churches , of all the people together , before and after morning and evening prayer ; and also before and after sermons ; and moreover in private houses , for their godly solace and comfort ; laying apart all ungodly songs and ballads , which tend only to the nourishing of vice , and cormpting of youth . OxFORD ; &amp;c. &amp;c . MDCCcvI. " 1iVithin the leaves we find , in the writing of Mr. Boardman himself , the following short account . " This book of Common Prayer , with the Psalms , was , for about twelve years , an object of religious veneration , to a company of wild men ( Karens ) in the province of Tavoy . They knew nothing of its contents , - not even in what language it was composed , - but as they were taught by the person who gave it them , they paid it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival in Tavoy , they brought it forward and presented it to me , accepting in its stead a version of a part of the Psalms in the Burman language , which they partially understand . Some of them have since embraced the Gospel , and are desirous of being , baptised . The book is now forwarded to America , to be deposited in the Museum of the American Baptist Board of Foreign Missions . Tavoy , March 25th , 1829 . It were vain to conjecture how this little book found its way into the heart of the Tavoy forest , where it was found , as never book before was seen , elevated into an object of religious adoration . But one can not help wondering whether it was left with the Karens by a really pious Englishman , its owner , whose instructions were misunderstood , or by some profane scoffer , who was willing to try the experiment of furnishing a barbarous tribe with an object of sacred respect , and left his prayer-book as the first thing that came to hand for the purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ahead of our story , to which we will now return . Mr. Boardman established a school immediately after his arrival in Tavoy , and pursued the same course of public teaching as at Maulmein , and , as at that place , so here also , he attracted great curiosity , and was resorted to by great numbers , until he became an object of ' suspicion to the priesthood . This nu // merous body , which in Tavoy alone amounted to at least two hundred , soon found , like the shrine-makers of Ephesus , that the new religion was likely to make sad work with their ancient power , consideration and wealth ; and of course could not avoid cherishing towards the teacher of it a spirit of enmity and revenge . We say of course , for the religion of Guadania or Boodh , does not teach its disciples to return benefit for injury , - good for evil . But however unpleasant might be the aspect of their angry countenances , and the sound of their unfriendly voices , no real and open danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British government ; so that , although their timid disciples might , by the frowns of these ministers of iniquit ) T , be frightened from Mr. Boardman 's zayat , yet Mr. and Mrs. Boardman themselves had nothing to apprehend . Soon after their arrival in Tavoy , a Karen , named Ko-thahbyoo , who had become a Christian in Maulmein , and removed with Mr. B. , was baptized . Moved by the desire of extending to his countrymen in Tavoy the gospel-light , he started , immediately after his baptism , on an excursion among the distant Karen settlements ; and with him went many joyful members of these rude tribes . Three excursions of this kind did he make , each one of longer duration than the last , before Mr. Boardman himself complied with the oft repeated request of the Karens to come himself among them . Roused by the strange message which was thus brought among them , these simple-hearted people travelled many days ' journey to converse with the American Teacher , and on their return spread still more widely the moving story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India , the Karens were excited to inquiry . The year 1828 passed away , without Mr. Boardman 's having yielded to the Karen call . Meantime he had been laboring day and night with a zeal of exhausting ardor , anda consuming industry . His labors had been crowned with the establishment of a native church , consisting of four members , and of a flourishing school . One of his baptismal scenes is so finely sketched by his pen , that we can not deny our readers the pleasure of its perusal . " Having previously examined Moung-Bo and Kee-Keang , the two persons who applied for baptism last month , we could not , consistently with our feelings of duty , defer their case any longer , // and this day has been fixed on for administering the ordinance . Accordingly , after worship , a little band of us , passing through that part of the town most sacred to Guadama , heat our way among Pagodas , temples , and Kyoungs , - alike unheeded and unheeding , - and entering the high Pagoda road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank . Near the tank , was a tall Pagoda , pointing its gilded summit to the skies . It being Burman as well as Christian worship day , the multitude were gathered around to pay their devotions to the gilded shrine . In that tank , under the shadow of that Pagoda , and in sight of their former companions , who now gazed with mingled astonishment and malice , the two young disciples solemnly renounced their vain idols , and put on the Lord Jesus Christ , hy a public profession of his name . Oh ! it was a joyful and memorahle occasion . Some of the heavenly host , I douht not , gazed on the sight with approbation ; and he who promised to be in the midst of two or three assembled in his name , was , I trust , in the midst of us . " Mr. B. had devised an extensive and excellent plan of school instruction for the province of Tavoy , which now promises , in the hands of the Missionary Board , to become productive of abundant good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the dialect of the Burmese , spoken in Tavoy , differed widely from that which he had previously learned at Calcutta and Maulmein , so that while teaching his scholars , preaching to his hearers , engaged in building zaya ts and houses , contriving plans of operation , performing the domestic duties of husband and parent , and corresponding with friends in America , he was obliged to prosecute the study of Tavoyan-Burmnese . These multiplied duties , pursued in that urgent spirit which characterized this good man , so wore upon his feeble system , that in December of this year , ( 1828 ) he was attacked with one of the most alarming symptoms of consumption , - a copious expectoration of blood . This circumstance was enough to remind Mr. Boardman that his tenure on life was feeble and uncertain , - but not enough to damp his zeal . He regarded it as a warning to " work xvhile the day lasted . " On the 5th of February , 1829 , he left his wife and family for the purpose of making his long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Karens , two of the largest boys from his school , and a Malabar cook . They started at 9 o'clock , A. M. and travelled till 5 P. M. , but proceeded only // eighteen miles . It was the hottest season of the year , - the road was a winding foot-path , traversing cultivated fields , and uncultivated hills and valleys , and thick , tangled , and lofty bamboo jungles . They suffered from the hurning heat , and were completely drenched hy an unexpected shower of rain , which overtook them in an uninhabited spot , and heat upon them furiously . They were obliged to encamp in the open wilderness , - where they were again wet through by a storm that lasted till midnight . On the 6th they rose early , feeling grateful that they had not fallen a prey to the tigers , xvild elephants , or other savage animals which haunt these forests . Their road this day lay over rough cliffs and precipices , across large streams , and along the rugged hanks of mountain torrents . They slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7th they met messengers from a Karen village , who came out to receive them with a warm and christian-like hospitality , which cheered Mr. Boardman 's heart . At three o'clock they reached the village , found a large house prepared for them , and were literally overwhelmed with presents of provisions and fruits . The faces of the villagers heamed with delight , and they exclaimed " ah , you have come at last ; we have long wanted to see you ! " Mr. Board man , notwithstanding his fatigue , preached to the natives who assembled this evening , and again he delivered three sermons on the day following . On the 9th he delivered several sermons , and spent the day ( Sunday ) in a manner to himself most delightful . As he intended to depart early next morning , nearly half the congregation remained in the zayat all night , so as to hid him farewell . On the 10th and 1 ith he preached in other villages , where , as before , he found attentive and eager listeners . On the 12th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great discomfort , and at night after going to hed , he was for the third time deluged with a rain so powerful that it penetrated the bamboo roog and soaked through all his clothing , and drenched his haggage . On the 13th he returned to Tavoy , - having travelled more than a hundred miles , and preached seventeen sermons within the space of nine days , besides being exposed to the fury of storms in unsheltered places . By this journey Mr. Boardman was convinced that his doubts // as to the sincerity of the Karen character were unjust . The hospitalities which he received ; the joy created by his presence among the villagers , the earnest attention bestowed upon his preaching , were enough to satisfy him that the Karens were prepared to adopt his religion and become Christians . On his return to Tavoy , his feelings were severely tried by discovering that some of the native members of his church had been guilty of gross misconduct , and were disgracing their profession . Family trouble was soon added to his afflictions , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged by her feebleness of health to abandon his labors for a time for the purpose of giving her the benefit of a voyage . A fortnight 's vacation restored her strength and spirits , and he returned to Tavoy . In July , Mr. and Mrs. Boardman were called upon to mourn the death of their eldest child . " Our anxieties about her , " says the weeping father , " are now over ; but Oh ! how affection still clings to her , and often sets her ruddy , beauteous form before our eyes ! " At the same time their only surviving child was apparently at the point of death , - so that , while laying Sarah in her grave , they trembled at the probability of soon depositing George by her side . But he was spared . During this month , Mr. Board man prepared a record of the various afflictions by which his soul bad been tried within the year ; these were three successive losses of property by shipwreck : the apostasy of several of his church : two attacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the death of one child and the alarming illness of the other . " It grieves me , " said be , " to think that I was so sinful as to need such afflictions 1 " On Sunday morning , August 9th , our friends were roused from their sleep by the ringing of alarm bells , discharges of musketry , and the cries of their pupils , " master , teacher , Tavoy rebels . " They rose in great alarm and found that the city was in open revolt , and bullets were whistling around their heads . The rebel forces soon compelled them to desert their house , which stood without the city gates , and to take refuge within the walls . The English forces were small and feeble , and under the pressure of an immense host of insurgents , every moment becoming more numerous and violent , they were obliged in a few hours to evacuate the city , and retreat to the wharf . To VOL . XL. - No.87. 52 // this place , a wooden building of six rooms , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were huddled all the sepoys with their baggage , and hundreds of European women and children , all looking for protection to the English . In these narrow quarters , surrounded by casks of gunpowder , which were exposed to constant danger of explosion , - cut off from all communication with any other place , - poorly furnished with provisions , and exhausted by fatigue and the diseases of the rainy season , the wretched Europeans awaited their approaching fate . Meantime the work of destruction went rapidly forward in the city , and fire and sword made terrible havoc . On Thursday morning an assault was made at day-break upon the wharf , by a party of five hundred insurgents , who set fire to several neighboring houses and vessels . Providentially a violent rain prevented the spread of the flames ; and still more fortunately , a British steamer hove in sight , bringing succor to the desponding garrison at the wharf . The steam vessel , after taking the females on board , returned for reinforcements to Maulmein . On Saturday an attack was made upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their possession . On Sunday the city was completely restored to quiet , and the European inhabitants freed from all danger . Mr. l3oardman describes the scene presented on his return within the walls , as one of utter and awful havoc and desolation . Everything destructible had been destroyed . His own house was " cut to pieces , " its contents burnt , or broken , or carried off , - and nothing hut a few fragments left to indicate its fate . But his wife and child were safe at *iaulmein his own life was preserved , and none of his church or scholars had been concerned in , or injured by , the insurrection ; - his strongest feeling , therefore , was gratitude . In about a month he and his family were once more at Tavoy , as though nothing had occurred . To increase that pleasure which he had derived from a short visit at iVlaulmein with Messrs . Judson and Wade , he now found that his fate had been an object of intense interest to the Karens , and that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild-men " flocked around him from the remotest corners of Tavoy , in great numbers ; and one old man of threescore and five years had traversed mountains , rocks , hills and streams , a distance of fifty miles , to solicit baptism . Encouraged by increasing attention among the natives , he now // commenced a course of itinerary preaching in the scattered villages of Tavoy ; visiting three or four of these villages each week , and teaching both publicly and from house to house . It is impossible for us to form adequate notions of the arduousness of this mode of labor , in the burning climate of India . Within two months he visited nearly thirty villages in this manner , being almost universally received willingly and with pleasure , though sometimes treated with unkindness . The Karen village Ts'heikkoo , the one in which he first preached in February , became wholly Christian in its character , paying a sacred regard to the Sabbath , and in other respects conforming to Christian customs and institutions . The schools became more full and flourishing than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful prosperity seemed destined to follow the short reign of confusion and danger . Early in 1830 , Mr. Boardman 's constitution began rapidly to break down under his enormous burden of care and labor ; and the voice of approaching death was heard in his consumptive cough . Mrs. Boardman was also reduced to the very point of death by disease , and the whole system of Missionary operations was for several weeks suspended , while Mr. B. attended , as he thought , to the wants of his dying wife . " What will become of my child , " thought he ; " what will become of the schools , of the poor native women , - and what will become of me , if she die ? ' * On her recovery his thankfulness knew no bounds ; - his letters are eloquent in their utterance of joy and praise . There are but few incidents to relate as occurring within the year 1830 . Mrs. Boardman 's health compelled her to leave Tavoy and go to Maulmein , where she and her husband were once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - an infant son . Mr. B. made a third and long excursion among the Karens , on the hill of Tavoy , where the Gospel was bailed as indeed glad tidings . By advice of his missionary brethren , he passed a few months in Maulmein ; - but , their plan not being carried into full effect , he returned to the Tavoy station . At the close of the year , the Tavoy church included thirty-one native members , - of whom eighteen Karens were baptized at once , in November . Mr. Boardman 's health was now wretchedly bad , - and it was manifest to all , that he had but a brief period of labor or of life before him . But his heart // beat joyfully even in prospect of death , - and his spirits rose in anticipation of his heavenly rest . rrhe last record which has reached America , in Mr. Boardman 's hand-writing , is dated January 1 , 1831 , and is an entry in his Journal . It announces the expected addition of one or two missionaries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . On the 23d of January , Rev. Mr. Mason and wife arrived at Tavoy , from America . They arrived in time to accompany Mr. Boardman in his last tour among the Karens , and to witness his death . 1*Ir . Mason perceived on his arrival , that Boardman was " a dying man , " hut as his heart was fixed on visiting the Karen villages once more , no objection was made to the journey , - although he was too much debilitated to walk . He was carried by his faithful Karens on a cot-bed the whole distance of a three days ' journey , accompanied by Mr. Mason , and by his own affectionate wife , who would not remain behind . The journey was commenced on the 31st of January . On arriving at the zayat , which had been prepared for his reception , the Karen converts who were anxious to be baptized came in for examination , and the worthy missionary , reclining on his couch , devoted his failing breath to the agreeable duty . Of more than fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the hour for performing this ceremony arrived , Ivir . Boardman , at his own request , was carried to the water-side , though so weak that he could scarcely breathe without the use of the fan and smelling-bottle . His great desire was to behold the administration of the ordinance , - and he said that he could then die with the exclamation of Simeon on his lips , - " Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace ! " I-us emotions were almost too powerful for his frame . He afterwards addressed a few words to the natives around him , and offered a short prayer . The party attempted the following day to return ; they were overtaken by a violent shower of rain ; - the dying man was again drenched with wet among those hills , where he had so often before been exposed to tempest ; - he survived the night , but died at noon of February 12th , in the arms of the Karen attendants , who were bearing him homeward . The sorrow of wife and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised even through the cloud of death , and the grief of those who la // mented the removal of a faithful servant in the midst of his labors , was assuaged by the reflection , that he had " entered into the joy of his Lord . " The whole Christian world were Boardman 's mourners . The whole Karen nation wept bitterly over his grave . The station at Tavoy is now occupied by faithful Missionaries , -* and the blessings of Christianity are rapidly spreading over that province ;  --  but Boardman is still unforgotten ; - his name , who first preached salvation to the poor wildmen , is now whispered by hundreds of grateful voices at the eventide circle of friends , and at the altar of simple and pure devotion . We must close our long article somewhat abruptly , by a recommendation of the biography to the perusal of our readers , who will find it full of interest , and free from any display of narrow or sectarian feeling . The following Epitaph is intended to be inscribed on Boardman 's tomb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missionary to Burmah . Born Feb. 8 , 1801 , - Died Feb. 11 , 1831 . Ills Epitaph is written in the adjoining forests . Ask in the Christian villages of yonder mountains - who taught you to abandon the worship of demons ? - . Who raised you from vice to morality ? - Who brought you your Bibles , your Sabbaths , and your words of prayer ? Let the reply be his Eulogy ! a cruce corona.
