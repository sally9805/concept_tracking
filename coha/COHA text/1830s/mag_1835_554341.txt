txt IT is surprising to see what a vast amount of talent the necessity of establishin measures of time has called into exertion . But the reason probably is , that all men , without exception , are personally interested in them . The common almanac , a work which is apt to be found in every dwelling in the land , lightly as it is regarded , has required an immense exertion of thought and investigation in successive ages , to bring it to its present perfection ; and if any one traces the steps of discovery , from the first helpless attempts at dividing time , down to the wonderful results which are embodied for public and private use in such a work as the one before us , it will give him a profound impression of the reach of human power . We might moralize on this subject if we would , - and we think that such reflections are , in general , taken most patiently when they come in the beginning of an article . Certainly nothing , tends more to make men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time are the measures of mortal existence . We are to live for a certain time , - how long we do not know ; but we do know that every year that passes is so much taken from that limited season ; if wasted , it is lost , - forever lost . When we say that a year is passed , we mean not // merely that the earth has gone round the sun , and the moon has waxed and waned twelve times ; not merely that spring , summer and autumn , have passed in beautiful succession , and that the dread majesty of winter is again over all : we mean something more impressive still ; we mean that a hundredth part of the longest life is measured ; that probably a much greater proportion of our life is gone with its account to join the eternal past . Glorious as the heavens are , we are not sure , that there is any association connected with them so sublime as the thought , that every revolution is winding up the thread of our lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the heavenly bodies were intended to measure times , seasons , days and years . In most cases , they do furnish us with the measures by which we go . The earth 's revolution on its axis furnishes the measure of a day . A week is measured by the quarterly changes of the moon ; the measure of a month is suggested by the time which it takes the moon to go through its circle of changes ; a year is measured by the earth 's revolution in its orbit round the sun . There are some divisions of time now in use , which are not measured by the heavenly bodies ; such are the subdivisions of the day into minutes and hours . To begin with the min* utes . It is evident that such a division could not have been in use m very ancient times , because there was nothing to measure it . There was no timepiece invented ; the only thing of the kind known was the dial ; but so far froni measuring minutes , that invention could not measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed length , but prop6rtioned to the length of the day . The dial of ancient times must have been a very imperfect thing . Herodotus gives us to understand that the Chaldeans were the inventors , and it was doubtless from their country , that the memorable dial of Ahaz , mentioned in scripture , was brought . But so slowly was the invention improved , that at the time of the first Pume war , a dial was brought to Rome , and set up in the forum , which was made for a different latitude ; and no one in the city seems to have known any good reason , why it should not keep as good time in that latitude , as in the one for which it was made . They easily discovered that it was of no use to them ; but what was the matter ith it , or how to mend it , no one was able to tell .. // The clepsydra or water-clock was a later invention , and might have answered the purpose , if the ancients had known the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was measured very much as it is in the hour-glass , by the time which it took a given quantity of water to drop from the upper glass into the one below . But , unluckily , they did not know that when there was much water it would run out faster than when there was little , so that , though it would serve like the hour-glass to measure a single hour , it could not measure equal successive hours , nor could it measure the parts of a single hour . The Persian clepsydra was different ; a small metallic cup perforated at the bottom was placed on the surface of a larger vessel of water where it filled gradually and sunk at the expiration of the hour . The only important use to which these water-clocks were applied , was to determine the length of pleadings in court houses . To prevent the advocate from speaking too long , he was allowed so much time , measured by the water-clock , and if he could not get through his argument in the time assigned , so much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour-glass on the pulpit cushion , for the same purpose , but they by no means regarded the hint which it gave them .. As for clocks , they are entirely modern ; - they are inventions of the monks of the middle ages . When we read of clocks , however , in early times , we must not think of anything finished like our timepieces ; they were probably such , as the wooden clock of a pedlar might have looked down upon with disdain . These things show , that in extreme antiquity , they could not be acquainted with minutes , for want of something to measure them . When they spoke of a moment , they called it the twinkling of an eye , or glance of an eye ; but this , of course , was no measure of time . Passing then to the hours ; we are not to suppose , when we see the word hour in ancient writings , that it had the same meaning then which it has now . In the writings of Moses , it means simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - as in the expression of our Saviour , " My hour is not yet come . " in Homer and Hesiod the hours were the seasons of the year . In mythology , the hours were considered as goddesses who presided over the seasons of the year . In the book of Daniel , the word hour is used , but it seems to mean a moment , and not an extended portion of time : nor do we know of any passage in the Old Testament , where the word is used to denote any measured portion of a day . In the // Apocryphal writings there are some ; but those , compared with the books of the Old Testament , are quite modern writings . How then , were the day and night divided ? for there must have been some divisions , to answer the purposes of life . They had some , which answered their purpose in a general way . The night , in the Old Testament times , was divided into three equal parts , called the first watch , the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night . In the New Testament , the order is different , because then , the Jews had adopted in this , as in many other things , the practice of the Romans . They then divided the night into four watches ,  --  sometimes called by number , first , second , third and fourth , sometimes by name , evening , night , cock-crowing and morning . These were names often applied to the whole watch , though they properly designated only the times when each watch began . These must have been loose and arbitrary divisions ; thus they could not tell when it was midnight , if it was cloudy ; they only knew it by observing the ascension of a star . Cock-crowing , too , depended entirely upon the discretion of the poultry . When our Saviour tells Peter that he will deny him before the cock crows , he means to say that he will do it very soon . The Paschal supper was not eaten till it was dark ,  --  much time was taken up with its forms ; - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the city to the mountain , - and this walk must have taken considerable time , judging from the instructions , preserved by St. John , which Jesus gave them upon the way . It must have been ahout midnight when he was arrested , and it was not halfway from midnight to sunrise before the apostle denied him . Never was such a world of intensely interesting history , crowded into a few short hours . The day , was like the night , divided into four equal parts , in very ancient times , loosely called the morning , the heat of the day , the midday and the evening : this division was in use in our Saviour 's time , though they had then begun to divide the day into what were called the Bahylonian hours . This earlier division is referred to in the law ; the Paschal lamb must be slain between the two evenings ; an expression which would he perplexing , if we did not know that the evening began at the middle of the afternoon , and the name evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone down ; so that the command was to kill it at the latter part of the afternoon . The Babylonian hours , which were in use in our Saviour 's // time , were invented by the Chaldeans , who took the lead in astronomical discoveries and calculations . The day , between sunrise and sunset was divided into twelve equal parts : these , of course , were not of fixed length , but were longer or shorter , according to the length of the day . At the time of the equinox , when the sun rose and set at six , they would have been just equal to ours , - sixty minutes long ; but if the sun should have risen at four and set at eight , the hours would have been as much lon0er in proportion as the day was longer , - they would have been eighty minutes long . In Palestine , however , the sun never rose earlier than five , nor later than seven . The third hour was the hour of morning prayer ; if the sun rose at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it rose at four it would be at eight o'clock ; and the time of evening prayer was also at the middle of the afternoon ; the sixth hour , which was noon , never changed : but all other times varied with the length of the day . We read in the scripture of those who went up to the temple at the third hour to pray , - this being the time of public prayer ; and our Saviour sat at the well of Sychar at the sixth hour , which was the meridian heat of the day . The one who came into the vineyard in the eleventh hour , came hut just before sunset , - the time when every one was required by the law , to pay those who had been employed in his service that day . This division of the day into hours had its inconveniences , which are too obvious to be mentioned . They were doubtless felt ; - but what was to be done ? It is clear , as was just now mentioned in the case of minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of fixed and equal length could not possibly be measured by man . The Jews did not follow the Chaldeans in their time of beginning the day ; and this brings us to the divisions of time into days . These , in most latitudes , are measured sufficiently well for common purposes , hy the earth 's revolution on its axis , which exposes all parts of its surface in succession to the light of the sun . In high northern latitudes , however , this would not answer ; the hours of a day which last six months , might hang heavy on their hands ; and a night of equal length would he somewhat too long to spend in sleep , if they had any idea of ever waking . Even now , though any one would suppose that this portion of time was exactly measured by the heavens , we have in use three different kinds of day . The natural day is the time between sunrise and sunset . - The civil day , that which is observed in all legal trans // actions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beginning at twelve on Saturday night , and all legal movements are suspended till the next night at twelve . Then there is the astronomical day , - that which is used by astronomers and navigators , - it begins at noon , because that time can best be determined by observations , - and the hours are counted from one to twenty-four . The day , with the Jews , began at sunset ; thus the Sabbath began at sunset on Friday evening . Friday was called the preparation for their Sabbath , because as nothing could be done on the Sabbath , all preparations were necessarily made on the day before . A calm , perfect and profound , prevailed in every habitation , from the moment when the sun went down ; then , according to the beautiful ceremony of their religion , the Sabbath lamp was lighted in every dwelling , and burned till the next day 's close . In practical use , there is a slight perplexity attending the subject of time as measured by the sun . The days as measured by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the earth has two motions , - while it turns on its axis , it moves also in its orbit round the sun . While it is turning once on its axis , it advances about one degree in its orbit : it must therefore turn so much more on its axis , before the sun can be at the meridian again . But the younger part of our readers will understand this better by an illustration ; let a lamp represent the sun ; now if any one turns round on the place where he stands , when he has turned exactly round , he shall be exactly facing it again . But suppose that when he is turning , he is at the same time moving to the right : in that case , when he has turned quite round , he will not be facing it ; he must turn more before he will face it ; - now the time of meridian is the time when the place on the earth where we are , is exactly facing the sun , - and owing to this motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than quite round , and at others less than quite round , to bring us facing to the sun . But it always turns quite round in exactly twenty-four hours ; - if it must turn more than quite round , it will take more than twenty-four hours , - if not quite round , it will take less than twenty-four hours ; - and , accordingly , we find that the days , as measured by the meridian , are sometimes about a quarter of an hour longer , sometimes as much less than twenty-four hours . Now if we measure time by the meridian , - if we take it VOL . XLI. - NO. 88. 5 // to be twelve when it is noon according to the sun , it is evident that we must alter our clocks every day . This will not do ; - and the course which irien have adopted , is the old-fashioned way of splitting the difference between the longer and shorter days , and going by a clock which measures equal days throughout the year . The clock gives the average length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally called . Four times in the year it will be twelve by the clock and by the meridian , at the same instant : hut on every other day , the clock will differ from the sun . Of the week there is not much to be said . it was doubtless suggested by the time which it takes the moon to pass through one of her quarterly changes , though not exactly . In the Scripture , the word applies not merely to days but to years , - thus Laban says to Jacob , " fulfil her week , " - meaning the seven years ' term of service by which Jacob was to earn the hand of his daughter . So Daniel , in the celebrated prophecy of the seventy weeks , meant weeks of years , and was easily understood by the Jews . This division of time has been in use from very early ages and it is a little singular that the days of the week have been named from the heavenly bodies by the ancient Chinese , Hundoos and Egyptians , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name them now . Sunday , as is well known , is named from the sun , as Saturday is from Saturn , - it being Saturn 's day . Monday is so called from the moon ; the others retain the names to this day , which were given them by our Saxon fathers . Tuesday is so called from the Saxon name of the planet Mars ; Wednesday ; From the Saxon name of Mercury ; Thursday , from the Saxon Jupiter , and Friday from the Saxon Venus . This shows how generally the heavenly bodies are regarded as presiding over the measures of time . There is one singular form of expression in scripture which requires more attention than it has received ; - we will show what we mean by an example . It is said the disciples met after eight days , meaning a week after our Saviour ' s resurrection we should say after seven days ; hut if the time mentioned took in the least portion of a day , they considered it as taking in the whole . Thus our Saviour is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights : according to our calculation , it was not so ; - for he died late on Friday afternoon , and rose early on Sunday morning : but according to the Jewish calcu // lation , the statement was exact ; for though he was not fortyeight hours in the grave , he was still iii it a part of three days , - that is , Friday , Saturday and Sunday . The law required that infants should he circumcised when they were eight days old , - and still it was done on the eighth day , when , according to our calculation , they were but seven days old . By them , the day of the birth , however little of it remained , was called the first day , and the day of circumcision , however little of it was spent , was reckoned the eighth day . This must be understood in the explanation of Lierod 's massacre . It is said that he slew them from two years old and under , - and it is often asked , why he should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lately born , and why do not historians mention such a wide work of blood . But look at the peculiar calculation of the Jews . Suppose that our Saviour was born on the 25th of December , he would have been called one year old when that year closed , and on the 1st of January he would have been called two years old , because he had already seen a part of two years . This is a fact , however strangely it sounds . So that those born a very little time before Herod 's murder , supposing a new year to have begun since they were born , would have been described as two years old ; and those born on or after the new year 's day , would have been included in the phrase " and under , " - " under , " according to the time which he inquired of the wise men . Vile as he was , he did not probably wish to murder more than were necessary to secure the death of the lineal heir to the Jewish throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , arises from its furnishing us with the Christian Sabbath ; the Jewish Sabbath was on the seventh day of the week , - as the earliest Christians were Jews , they of course observed the day set apart by the Hebrew faith , and also another day , the first of the week , in remembrance of the resurrection of their Master . Jesus Christ taught his disciples , to respect the institutions of their former religion ; - they did not therefore take the seventh day for their celebration , possibly , because it was already sanctified to a different sacred purpose ; but there was no such objection to the first , which was also recommended to them by its being the day when the Saviour left the dead . How important this celebration is to religion , has been sometimes acknowledged by its enemies . The French revolutionists , when they wished to abolish Christianity , saw that it // could not be done while the Sabbath was regarded . They therefore undertook to alter the calendar , dividing the year into twelve months of thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weeks of ten days each . This was made the civil reckoning by law , so that the Sabbath was no longer observed . But twelve years could not make the people forget the Sabbath , nor was the new computation of time acce*table , - and when Napoleon came to the head of affairs , he abolished the new practice , and enacted that the week should be reckoned as in other civilized lands . And the reason why they could not make men forget the Sabbath , was , that the Sabbath was made for man ; the nature of man requires a day of rest , and God has ordained what proportion of time is needed for the purpose . One seventh portion of time is the amount set apart for the purpose , and the experience of man has abundantly shown that the estimate is just . There is no doubt on the mind of any one , who is capable of judging , that men are better in every respect with it , than they could be without it , both as respects this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more work done , and far better done , - there is more prudence , thrift and prosperity of every kind than there could be , if the Sabbath were like any other day ; and as for morality , and religious feeling , without the Sabbath , they would soon be lost . One thing is evident ; - it is that none need the Sabbath , so much as those who violate it , and those who would make it like any other day . The division of the year into months , is suggested by the changes of the moon . For the moon to pass through her regular circle of changes , crescent , full and waning , requires about twenty-nine days and a half . These changes of the moon are so obvious and striking , that it was very natural to employ the circle of changes or lunation as it is called , for one of the larger measures of time . Still , it has always occasioned much perplexity , arising from the fact , that a month measured by the moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month measured by the sun . A month according to the sun , is the time which it takes the sun to pass through one of the signs of the zodiac , which is thirty days and a half nearly , - or to be accurate , is exactly one twelfth part of three hundred and sixty-five days five hours and forty-nine minutes , which is the length of the mean solar year . Twelve months therefore , according to the moon , do not // equal twelve months according to the sun , and of course do not make out an entire year . The earliest months mentioned in the scriptures consisted of thirty days , all except the twelfth , which was made to consist of thirty-five days , in order to fill out the entire year . We say the twelfth , because the months were then numbered , and not known by names as they are now . But all this was afterwards altered . They gave names to the months , and measured them by the moon , while the year was necessarily measured by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of twenty-nine days and a half , - or rather , in order to avoid the inconvenience of fractions , one month consisted of twenty-nine days , the next of thirty , and so on throughout the year . The new moon was the beginning of the month ; the new moon determined the time of their celebrations , so that exactness in the time was of importance in a civil and religious point of view . They did not , however , probably from want of astronomical knowledge , go by the time when the moon is in conjunction with the sun ; but by the time when it is first visible in the sky . The first appearance of the crescent was narrowly observed ; if the sky was cloudy , the time was determined by authority in the temple ; at night , beacon fires were kindled on the mount of Olives : this fire was immediately answered from the surrounding heights , where men were stationed on the watch ; the signals rapidly spread , and in a few moments , all the hills in Judea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpets of the temple summoned the people to rejoice , and to celebrate the festival of the new moon . How much was thought of the season of the new moon , no reader of scripture will need to be informed . But , as we have said , twelve of these lunar months do not make out the year . And here let me call your attention to the arrangement made by Moses , who was fully aware of the difficulty which would arise from thus measuring time by the moon . The difficulty may be explained in this way . Twelve lunar months make about three hundred and fifty-four days , while the year consists of three hundred sixty-five ; - the lunar year therefore is eleven days less than the true year . Now , suppose that the passover should come one year on the twenty-first of March ; according to the moon , the anniversary would come the next year on the tenth of March ; the year after it would go back into February , - in a few years the passover would // come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the moon , the festivals would go farther and farther back , till they travelled throughout the year The difficulty was also felt in matters of common life . Suppose that a man had hired and paid for a field for three years ; according to this rule he would lose his third crop , the harvest being in the spring ; since the end of the third year would be thirty-three days earlier than the first , it would come in February , when the grain was not ripe , and as that third harvest was not ripe till the beginning of the fourth year , he must lose it , he having hired the field for but three . Now , with their small amount of astronomical knowledge , the only remedy they could devise for this difficulty , was to add a thirteenth month to the third year , and Moses so arranged it , that this must be done . Some may say , why did he not tell them at once to go by the sun , which would have saved all this trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain princess , who was told that the poor were dying for want of bread ; astonishing ! said she , why do n't they eat pastry ? The reason was , that they could not get it , - and the reason why Moses did not go by the sun was , that nobody knew the exact length of the solar year . His only remedy was to add this thirteenth month when it became necessary , and the way in which be did it , shows his far-sighted wisdom . Instead of leaving it to the discretion of the priests to add it when it became necessary , he provided that it should of necessity be done . The first moon of the year , answering nearly to our April , was the harvest moon of Palestine . Moses called it the ear-moon , and required that on the sixteenth day of it , at the time of full moon , ripe ears of barley should be offered as first fruits to God . By reason of the lunar year being only three hundred and fifty-four days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and twenty-two days earlier the year after ; and then , evidently , the harvest would not be ripe , so that the offering could not be made . When this was the case , they were not to call that moon the first of a new year : it was to be considered as the thirteenth month of the old year ; they were to wait for the next moon , when the harvest would be ripe , and that was to be regarded as the ear-moon and first of a new year . The great advantage of this arrangement was , that there was no need of going to astronomers to know when this odd month must be added ; // every husbandman could tell whether the harvest would be ripe or not , by the middle of the moon ; and if not , he needed no public authority to tell him that that moon was the thirteenth of the old year , and not the first of the new . Where there is no such arrangement , there is perpetual confusion . in Turkey , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without adding such a month , the festivals travel back every anniversary till they go quite through the year . Some ancient nations , being aware of this difficulty , made attempts to measure the year by the sun : but they fell on this very stumbling block , - ignorance of the exact length of the solar year . They called it three hundred and sixty-five days which was not correct , for the true year is about six hours longer , which in four years would amount to a day . The Egyptians are an example . They went by the heliacal rising of the dob-star , - that is , the time when , after having been so near the sun as to he lost in its light , it first rises so much earlier than the sun that its light can he seen in the sky . They supposed that the dog-star , after having been thus lost in the light of the sun , would re-appear at precisely the same time every year . But they found that the heliacal risings of this brilliant star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ; which , in the course of a century , would make a serious derangement of dates and calculations . We do not know when the year was first known to be six hours more than three hundred and sixty-five days in length . Plato is said to have learned it from the Egyptians , - but if they knew it , they do not seem to have known how to apply their knowledge , so as to remedy the trouble which arose from the unequal length of the years . This shows the wisdom of Moses in supplying a practical remedy for a defect , which there was not science enough in the world to repair . We think that even a child maybe made to comprehend what this difficulty is. it made precisely the same difficulty in the year , which a clock going too fast would make in a day . But what would the person who had the management of such a clock , do with it ? Probably , if he found it was an hour too fast , he would have the wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hour before he would consider the given hour as come . This is just what Moses did : when he found that the Passover was coming a month too soon , he put the calen // dar back , and made it go through another month , before he called it the beginning of the new year . Attempts were made by some ancient nations , to divide the difference between the lunar and solar years : some of these attempts may be traced among the Egyptians . Thus , the lunar year being three hundred and fifty-four days , and the solar three hundred and sixty-five , they considered the year as consisting of three hundred and sixty days , - to make no mention of fractions . This luni-solar year was more than five days longer than the lunar year , and as much shorter than the year as measured hy the sun . But this was too fast ; - and if the new year came five days and a half earlier every year than in the last , the months must soon cease to correspond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , the winter months must change places with those of summer . Professor Playfair remarked , that this fact would explain a difficult passage in Herodotus ; the historian said that , in the time of the ancient Egyptian kings , the sun had twice risen in the place where it had formerly set , and twice set where it had formerly risen . By this he supposes it was meant , that the sun had gone twice through all the signs of the ecliptic ; and that the sun had risen and set twice in every day and month of the year . This was eagerly seized by those who are for discrediting the sacred history , to prove that the earth is much older than the account of Moses makes it : hut all this might have happened in the short space of one hundred and thirty-eight years ; since , in that period , there would be a difference of about two years between the lunar and solar year . Without saying more of the perplexities of the ancients , we will now proceed to give some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar . It was done under the orders of Julius C*sar , - by far the most accomplished and intellectual of the class of conquerors to which he belongs . His victories do no lasting honor to his name : but this enterprise secures him the everlasting gratitude of mankind . We do not mean to say that he did this by his own calculations : he called to his aid the best astronomers that the age afforded . Sosigenes is celebrated as the most eminent of this number ; he saw in the outset , that nothing could be effected , without ascertaining , as nearly as possible , the length of the solar year . Accordingly , having ascertained , as he thought , that the earth revolved round the sun in three hundred and sixty-five days // and six hours , he settled it as a principle , that the months must he so arranged as to fill up three hundred and sixty-five days and six hours , that being the length of the year , without regard to the moon . The first thing to he done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in March ; in order to do this , he put the clock forward ; he made the year then passing go through two more months than usual , - because the festivals then came two months too soon . The year of fourteen months was call ed the year of confusion . But beside restoring the equinox to its place , it was necessary to provide for the extra six hours , and as these hours amounted to a day in every four years , he inserted a day in every fourth year , making three hundred and sixty-six , the same which we now call a leap year . This was done when Cwsar was appointed dictator and sovereign pontiff , about forty-five years before the corning of our Lord . This is substantially the same with the calendar now in use . It made the average length of the years three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter , instead of three hundred and sixty-five days as they were before . The extra day was added in February , as it is now . He called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason why it is so called is this . Because it leaps that year a day more than in a common year : for example , this year , the 1st of March will be Saturday ; next year it xviii be Sunday ; but the year after it will leap over Monday and begin on Tuesday , Monday being taken in** to February to make out the twenty-nine days for the month , and three hundred and sixty-six for the year . But with all the pains bestowed at that time upon the calendar , it was not quite correct . Before the time of Cresar , the year had been too short ; he lengthened it by adding six hours ; hut this was leaning on the other side , and making it a little too long ; for the true year wants eleven minutes and ten seconds of three hundred and sixty-five days and six hours . This , to he sure , is not much , and the error would occasion no inconvenience for many years . It amounted only to a day in one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use more than fifteen hundred years before it was even detected . At length , in the time of Gregory XIII , a Pope of the sixteenth century , it was ascertained by the festivals of the church , that there was some error in the computation of time . On looking into the subject , it was found that , whereas the caJ* // endar placed the vernal equinox on the 21st of March , it actually took place on the 10th , so that the seasons and festivals had 0one ten days from the place which the calendar asSi0 ned them . The difficulty experienced by the church was this . Easter was to he celebrated on the first full moon after the spring equinox ; the calendar placed the equinox on the 21st of March : it really took place on the 10th ; now suppose the moon was full on the 20th , what day should they observe ? The 20th was before the equinox by the calendar , and yet after it in reality ; if they went by the calendar they must wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th , being after the equinox , was the real anniversary of the Passover and of Easter . This was a serious thing to a church , which attached so much importance to its anniversaries and celebrations . But something must be done . And , whereas , on former occasions , they had been obliged to add some days to make out the year , or , as we should say , to put the clocic forward , now they were obliged to put it back ; that is , they were obliged to strike out some days to bring back the equinox to the 21st of March , where it belon0ed . The Pope , accordingly , gave orders that ten days should be struck out in October , 1582 ; that the next day after the 4th , should be not the 5th , but the 15th , - a change which was immediately made in all Roman Catholic countries , though not without sore misgivings on the part of some of them , at seeing the head of the church cutting off so many days from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new style , as it was called , was not readily adopted ; it seemed like a simple and necessary reform : still , they thought that since it proceeded from the Catholics , it was a suspicious movement , and the less they had to do with it the better ; they accordingly stood out against it in rejoicin0 ignorance , and with so much perseverance , that it was not till the middle of the last century , that Protestant countries generally adopted the Gregorian calendar . In England and this country , of course , the new style was not adopted till 1752 . In Russia , and other countries where the Greek church prevails , the new style was not adopted till 1830 , - only four years ago . Dr. Johnson gives an account of the sensation produced by the act of Parliament for effecting the change . The young people were all delighted at the // thought of killing so much time as eleven days , for it was necessary to strike out one more in the century before ; they also thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which public authority ordained should be a year of confusion . But older people did not like the idea of having a year with such an ominous name : moreover , they did not see what right Parliament had to strike out eleven days , as if Providence could not regulate that matter without their helping hand . The greatest outcry was made by certain ancient women , who said that their lives were full short enough without having eleven days struck off , and that to strike out a Sabbath from the year , seemed to them the most unrighteous thing that ever was done in a Christian country . The Pope , or rather the men of science whom , like C*sar , he relied on in the whole movement , not only restored the seasons to their place , but provided against a recurrence of the difficulty . The method was ingenious and effectual . The excess was a day in one hundred and thirty years . He therefore ordained that in three centuries out of four , the last year should be a common year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leap year , having three hundred and sixty-six days ; but 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 are common years , having but three hundred and sixty-five . This arrangement disposes of one day in about one hundred and thirty years , and brings the calendar nearly to perfection . We say nearly , for though there is a slight variation , it will only amount to a day in three thousand , years and that need not give us much concern : it can be attended to as well in the year 4835 . According to the Gregorian or new style , the year begins on the 1st of January . This was the time fixed by Caesar for new year 's day , because it is the time when the earth is nearest to the sun . But it was not generally regarded . Some have commenced the year on the 25th of December , the supposed anniversary of our Saviour 's birth ; others have commenced it on the 25th of March , and this was the time established by law in the reign of Henry VIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till the change of style in 1752 . In the dates of events in history , there is some perplexity , unless we rememher this fact : thus we read of a President of Harvard College , that he presided at commencement in July , and died in January of the same year ; a thing which would not now he easily done . But then , when the old style was in use , Jannary // was one of the last months of the old year , instead of being as it is now , the first month of the new . But we must not dismiss the subject , till we have said something of the still larger divisions of time , called epochs or eras , of which the Christian era , which computes the years from the birth of our Lord , is one . This- is the only one with which we nave much concern ; but in speaking of this , we are obliged to say a few words of the cycles , or circles of years , which were in use before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first was the solar cycle , and it was formed in this way . Suppose the sun entered the sign Aquarius in January , on Wednesday the 21st , at one o'clock in the day . It will not again enter the same sign on the same day of the month , the same day of the week , and at the same hour of the day , in less than twenty-eight years ; twentyeight years , therefore was called the cycle or circle , through which the sun must pass before he comes back to the place whence he started . In using this they said that such a year was the first , second , third , of the solar cycle ; and so on to the twenty-eighth , when they began again . There was also a lunar cycle , which was thus formed . Suppose that the moon should he at the full on Wednesday , the 28th of January , at one o'clock in the day . It would not he full again on the same day of the month , the same day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under nineteen years : this , therefore , was called the lunar cycle , which brings back the moon to the place whence she started . This was called the golden number , because it was found so valuable in ancient times , for regulating festivals which depended on the moon . There was another smaller cycle , called the Roman Indiction , - a period of fifteen years , which was in use only to determine the time for paying certain periodical taxes . But these cycles were so short as to be inconvenient ; in order to get a larger period , which might save the trouble of counting the years over and over again , these cycles were multiplied together , and the product was a cycle of 7980 years , which was called the Julian period . This is assumed to have had its commencement before the creation of the w&amp;ld , since there has been no time since , when the three cycles could have begun together . There was no attempt made to reckon the years from the time of our Saviour 's birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Roman abbot , suggested that this reverence ought to be paid to the Saviour of the world . He therefore began so to date the years , and assumed that the first year of the Christian era was the 4714th of the Julian period . There is no historical record , by which the nativity can be precisely ascertained ; he therefore decided what year it was by such indications as he could gather from comparing the sacred history with that of profane historians . But those were times in which much less was known concerning these points than in the present age ; and a mistake was then made in fixing the time of our Saviour 's birth which has never since been corrected . The manner in which this mistake was brought to light is a fine illustration of the advantages of science . Who would suppose that astronomy could have pointed out an error in chronology ? and yet so it was . Dionysius fixed the 1st year of Christ in the 4714th of the Julian period . But Josephus mentions that during Herod 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On consulting astronomical tables , we are enabled to ascertain the date of that eclipse to the day and hour ; we find that it took place in the 47 10th year of the Julian period , on the 13th of March , three hours past midnight at Jerusalem . Now we know that our Saviour was born before Herod died ; so that he must have been born at least four years earlier than that which was fixed upon as the first of the Christian era . He must have been born sometime before the death of Herod , since his parents took him into Egypt to save him from that tyrant 's malice , and kept him there till Herod died . So that astronomy makes it perfectly clear that our Saviour was born at least four , possibly five years earlier than the time assigned by the nativity ; and if the Christian era had been correctly determined , the present year would be 1839 or 40 , possibly 41 . The reason why the mistake , though universally admitted , never has been corrected , is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , and in the second , the error has prevailed for 1200 years through the dates of all histories , so that much confusion would be made in chronology without any correspondent gain . How perplexing this whole subject sometimes is , appears from a controversy which raged at the beginning of this century , and has lately been revived in the New-York papers . The great question was , did the year 1800 belong to the 18th or // 19th century ? Many intelligent men maintained that it belonged to the 19th ; and this shows how easily men are bewildered in such speculations . If any one had come to pay them 1800 dollars in parcels of a hundred each , we strongly suspect that they would have claimed the hundredth of the eighteenth parcel as well as the hundredth of all the rest : why not say that ninety-nine years made the first century as well as that 1799 years made eighteen centuries ? the ninetyninth year of a century is not the last : the hundredth is the last . The American Almanac has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarly known to our readers , if not actually in their hands . Its most important department is understood to he in the hands of Mr. Paine , whose observations command the entire confidence of those most interested in the subject ; - no ordinary honor , - since this is a field in which no one can arrive at eminence without really deserving it . In addition to these observation the Almanac furnishes a vast amount of information on various subjects of immediate and public interest ; it supplies a treasury to which any one can resort for those facts , which are in constant demand , and yet bave never before been made easily accessible , to those who have not libraries within their reach . It is fast taking the place of those lighter publications of the kind , which have so long been in general use , simply for the want of better . We have no doubt that it will prosper ; it is now very extensively circulated and every coming year will add to its success.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
