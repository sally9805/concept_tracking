txt IN our last number , we noticed at some length the observations of the Rev. Isaac Fidler upon the state of society and literature in this country . Some of our contemporaries have expressed the opinion , that we gave to that work an importance disproportionate to its value . It should be recollected , however , that in order to convey to the public a correct notion of the spirit of the British press , in relation to the United States , the *orks most suitable for notice are precisely the best and the worst ; on the one hand , those which , from the ability and information displayed in them , may really be thought to require refutation , and on the other , those in which the prejudices common to most British travellers are exhibited in their naked proportions , without any accidental advantages of style or general learning , and of course in the form most open to detection and exposure . Mr. Fidler 's work is a brilliant specimen of the latter class , and has a fair chance of retaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most absurd book of travels that was ever written ,  --  at least by a clergyman of ' more than ordinary acquirements . ' The work before us belongs to the other category , and may , perhaps , be considered in respect of literary execution and general ability as the best British account of this country that bas yet been published . The work of Captain Hall is the only one that can come in these respects into competition with it ,  --  and the two are in fact so nearly alike , both in spirit and execution , that it would be hardly worth while to attempt to settle their comparative merits . The work before us is described in the title page as written by the author of Cyril Thornton , a novel which is also anonymous , but is known to be the production of a Mr. Hamilton of Edinburgh . This person is , we believe , an officer of the army , living in retirement upon half-pay , of what rank we are unable to say with certainty , the newspapers having complimented him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain , and Lieutenant , some one of which is probably the true one . His Cyril Thornton , though of no great value as a novel , ex // 1834 . Men and Manners in America . hibits a good deal of literary ability , and would justify us in expecting from its author a work of a pretty high order upon a subject like that of the one before us , to which we think his talent better adapted than for fictitious writing . This expectation will not be entirely disappointed , nor yet very fully satisfied by the character of the present work . It is undoubtedly , as xve have said , in point of literary execution , one of the best that have yet appeared upon the United States . The style is not deficient in strength or spirit , and evinces at times a remarkable power of description , as in the passages on the Falls of Niagara and the river Mississippi . On the other hand , it is far from being uniformly so pure and correct as might be wished ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affected pertness , and a silly air of pretension , which are offensive fron the beginning , and finally become by repetition completely nauseous . We shall have occasion , in making extracts for other purposes , to give some specimen of these defects in style : and will merely add here , that one of the most remarkable transgressions against the purity of the language occurs in the very passage , in which the learned author is taking the Americans to task for their manifold and flagrant offences in this particular . At the close of his chapter on Boston , he introduces a page or two of observations upon barbarisms in language with the following sentence . Even by the educated and respectable class , the commonest words are often so trunsr o/jif as to be placed beyond the recognition of an Englishman . ' Trci'rismogri.fied ! ! ! and this too from the pen of a purist , and in the very sentence in which he is condemning a supposed want of purity in the use of language by others . Truly has it been said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspicious commencement , our author runs over the usual enumeration of clever , guess , and the use of progress as a verb , and having denounced , in addition to these stock examples , two or three other supposed American barbarisrns , allof which may be found recorded in the British provincial glossaries , and are more frequently used in the mother country than they are here , jumps at the following astounding conclusion ; unless the present progress of change be arrested by an increase of taste and judgment in the more ( better ) educated classes , there can be no doubt that in another century the dialect of the Americans will become utterly unintelligible to an Englishman , and that // Jan. the nation will be cut off from the advantages arising from their participation in British literature . ' Within the limited compass of our reading , we hardly recollect an example of a conclusion , that stands at so utterly hopeless a distance from its premises . Our readers , who have ears and nprves , will , we think , agree with his that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our author 's pages , and which , that we may have the full benefit of the invention , is repeated elsewhere , and followed out into the not less delightful derivative noun ,  --  transmognyjca*jon , ..... constitutes of itself a grosser of-. fence against the purity of the language ,  --   - -  we will not say than all the minor peccadillos which he has mustered up against us put together , because these really amount to nothing ,  --  but than the sum total of all the errors of this kind that came under his observation , in tolerably good company , in the coarse of his travels from Boston to New Orleans . So much for the mere matter of style , which , with the deductions we have mentioned , is in the main good . Of the spirit in which the work is written ,  --  -  --  a far more important consideration ,  --   - -  we are compelled to speak in less favorable terms . As friends of the two countries , anxiously desiring , not merely the continuance of the present political good understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really kind and cordial feeling between them , we deeply regret that the ablest and best-written work upon this country which has yet appeared from the pen of a British traveller , is also the one which exhibits in the most inveterate and malignant form the common prejudices of the class . The causes that have led to this unfortunate result , it is of course not for us ,  --  imperfectly acquainted as we are with the author 's history ,  --  to pretend to investigate . He seems himself to have anticipated the objection which we make to the temper of his book , and in a short apologetic preface , in the form of a dedication , attempts to parry it in the following manner . How far , in writing of the institutions of a foreign country , I may have been influenced by the prejudices natural to an En glishman , I presume not to determine . To the impartiality of a cosmopolite I make no pretension . No man can wholly cast off the trammels of habit and education , nor ( or ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latent predilections , which insensibly affect the judgment of the wisest . // But apart from such necessary and acknowledged influences , I am aware of no prejudice , which could lead me to form a perverted estimate of the condition , moral or social , of th' Americans . I visited their country with no antipathies to be overcome ; and I doubt not you can bear testimony , that my political sentiments were not such , as to make it probable , that I would regard with an unfavorable eye the popular character of their government . In the United States I was received with kindness , and enjoyed an intercourse , at once gratifying and instructive with many individuals for whom I can never cease to cherish the warmest sentiments of esteem . I neither left England a visionary and discontented enthusiast , nor did I return to it a man of blighted prospects and disappointed hopes . In the business or ambitions of the world I had long ceased to have any share . I was bound to no party , and pledged to no opinions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be permitted to claim the possession of such advantages as foreign travel can bestow . Under these circumstances , I leave it to the ingenuity of others to discover by what probable , what possible temptation I could be induced to write in a spirit of unjust depreciation of the manners , morals or institutions of a people , so intimately connected with England by the ties of interest and the affinities of common ancestry . ' That a spirit of unjust depreciation is the one that predominates in his work , is ,  --  as we shall have occasion abundantly to show ,  --  very certain . Why this is so , it is , we repeat , not for us to say , but the author has , we think , answered the question in a very satisfactory manner , in the passage immediately preceding the one just quoted . When I found the institutions and experience of the United States deliberately quoted in the Reformed Parliament , as affording safe precedents for British legislation , and learned that the drivellers who uttered such nonsense , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approbation by men as ignorant as themselves ; I certainly did feel that another work on America was yet wanted , and at once determined to undertake a task , which inferior considerations would probably have induced me to decline . ' The amount of this is , that the object of the author , in writing his work , was to furnish his countrymen with a reply to the argument in favor of reform , deduced from the supposed successful operation of democratic principles in this country . // After making this perfectly candid statement , it strikes us that he need not have been so much at a loss to imagine what temptation he could possibly have had to an unjust estimate of our institutions and character . That a person , writing with an avowed political purpose , will , to a certain extent , so color his representations , as may best fit them to effect this purpose , is not perhaps absolutely certain ; but the case is undoubtedly a very common one ,  --  so common , indeed , that no individual , however correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in admitting the possibility of its occurrence in his own person . Every impartial anti discerning reader must perceive , on the slightest inspection of the work before us , that it did in fact occur in the present instance ; that the disposition under which the author made his observations , and of course to a certain extent the character of their results , were determined by his political objects ; and that his book , instead of being a real account of Men and Manners in America , as it purports to be , is in substance nothing more than a long tirade against the Bill , the whole Bill , and nothing but the Bill . A. considerable portion of the work is in the form of a direct commentary on the political institutions of the United States , and is of course entitled to all the consideration which the arguments alleged against them may fairly deserve . In another and a more extensive portion , the author aims less directly at his mark , and endeavors to prove that the Government is bad , by showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mariner . Now supposing this point to be made out , we can not think that the conclusion drawn by the worthy traveller would necessarily follow . If it were admitted , for example , that the practice of che Ning tobacco , with its natural concomitants , is too common among certain classes of the community it would not be safe to draw from this fact the inference that the laws of the country are tyrannical , insufficient , or in any way objectionable , for the plain reason that the practice of chewing tobacco is not commanded by law , but is a mere matter of taste and habit . Again : if the only proper and polite way of eating eggs be ,  --   - -  as our author supposes ,  --  to convey the substance directly from the shell to the mouth , without the intervention of a wine-glass , a dish , or any other instrument except , perhaps , a spoon ;  --  and on this point there are great authorities against // him , for no less a personage than Baron Haussez , lately one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gastronome of high distinction , considers it as great an abomination to eat eggs directly from the shell , as our author to do it in any other way , and makes it a matter of distinct reproach upon the English that they all adopt this practice :  --  but admitting that our author and those who with him and his countrymen eat from the shell are in the right , and that the Americans , the French , and other nations , who occasionally indulge themselves in an omelette aux fines kerhes , a glass of mulled champagne or some preparation of the egg other than the au naturel are wrong ,  --  and for ourselves we consider the whole controversy no more important than the quarrels of the Big and Little Endians in the empire of Lilliput ,  --  still , however , if we were to grant all that our author can possibly desire in this particular , he could not with any fairness conclude that the Constitution of the United States is a bad form of Government , inasmuch as that instrument prescribes no rule xvhatever on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely free to eat them from the shell ,  --  a wine-glass ,  --  in omelettes ,  --  poached , or in any other way that he may think proper . But without dwelling any longer on preliminary points , we proceed to notice more directly the results of this new tour of observation in the United States . In attempting to discharge this duty , we shall briefly indicate the track pursued by our author , and make some occasional commentaries on his personal adventures , and on his statements respecting the character of the people and the principles and operation of the political institutions of the country . Our author embarked at Liverpool , on the 16th of October 1831 , on board the packet ship New York , Captain Bennet , and after a pleasant and rapid passage , reached New York on the 17th of the following month . His account of an adventure , in itself of no great moment , that happened to him on the very day of his arrival , will serve , as well as almost any other passage in the hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been arranged , it seems , among the passengers in the New York , that they should dine together at Niblo 's tavern on the day of their arrival ; and at the hour fixed , our author s*t forth from his lodgings , to repair to the scene of action . Finding it necessary , as he proceeded , to inquire his way , he stepped for this purpose into a shop , and asked the person in // attendance , if he could give him the direction he wanted . The latter replied that he could , and would do it with pleasure , ' which he accordingly did . Our author then went his way rejoicing , and reached his tavern in time to partake of the best dinner which he ate in America . Such is the adventure ,  - -  one would suppose that it was scarcely of sufficient importance to occupy a place in the traveller 's published observations and that , if it did , it would hardly afford occasion for any unfavorable conclusion as to the character of the people . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen of Mr. Hamilton . Before quitting the ship , it had been arranged among a considerable number of the passengers , that we should dine together on the day of our arrival , as a proof of parting in kindness and good-fellowship . Niblo 's tavern , the most celebrated eatinghouse at New York , was the scene chosen for this amicable celebration . Though a little tired with my walks of the morning , which the long previous confinement on board of ship had rendered more than usually fatiguing , I determined to explore my way on foot , and having procured the necessary directions at the hotel , again set forth . On my way an incident occurred , which I merely mention to show how easily travellers like myself , on their first arrival in a country , may be led into a misconception of the character of the people . Having proceeded some distance , I found it necessary to inquire my way , and accordingly entered a small grocer 's shop . " Pray , Sir , " I said , " can you point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - The person the addressed was rather a gruff-lookin* mali , in a scratch wig , and for at least half a minute kept eying me from top to toe , without uttering a syllable . " Yes , Sir , I can , " he at length replied , with a stare as broad as if he had taken me for the great Katterfelto . Considering this sort of treatment as the mere ebullition of republican insolence , 1 was in the act of turning on my heel , and quitting the shop , when the man added ,  --  " and I shall have great pleasure in showing it to you. ** He then crossed the counter , and accompanying inc to the middle of the street , pointed out the land marks by which I was to steer , and gave me the most minute directions for my guidance . I presume that his curiosity in the first instance was excited by something foreign in my appearance ; and that havin* , once satisfied himself that I was a stranger , he became on that account more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first practical insight into the manners of the people , and was useful both as a precedent for future guidance , and as explaining the source // many of the errors of subsequent travellers . Had my impulse to quit the shop been executed with greater rapidity , I should certainly have considered the man as a brutal barbarian , and perhaps have drawn an unfair inference with regard to the manners and character of the lower orders of ' society in the United States . ' Le vrai , says the Erench proverb , n'est pas toujours vraisernblable . If such an incident as this were found in one of Moliere 's comedies , we should say that he had greatly overcharged his character . Our author steps into a grocer 's shop to inquire his way ; the grocer commences a very courteous answer often words , but before he has even time to finish it , the inquirer nearly rushes out of the shop in a transport of offended pride , because forsooth the proprietor thought fit to look rather intently at him . Our author doubtless thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the shores of our continent , the natives , in coming into his august presence , would at the very least knock head in the Chinese fashion , if they did not actually grovel upon the ground before him , like the negro courtiers of Bornoo at the feet of their sultan . That a simple American grocer should not only fail in this , but should actually take the liberty of looking intently at a British captain ,  - -  or whatever his rank may be ,  --  on half-pay , and he too the author of a rather popular novel , this to be sure was an ebullition of republican insolence , which , had not the matter been speedily set right , would unquestionably have stamped the offender as a brutal barbarian , and justified the most unfavorable inferences with regard to the character and manners of the lower orders of society in the United States . This incident , ' says our author , C afforded me the first practical insight into the manners of the people , and was useful as explaining the source of many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably think , with us , that his account of the incident affords a pretty good insight into his own character , and explains very satisfactorily the source of many of his subsequent errors . We may rem*irk , en passant , that the peculmarity of our author 's enunciation , which , from the loss of a part of his organs of speech in some of his youthful campaigns , is , we understand , hardly intelligible to a person unaccustomed to it , probably had its effect in calling forth the look that offended him so much , as well as the something foreign in his appearance , which , however ,  --  if we are rightly informed ,  --  was in fact , in point of costume , generally more than singular . // Our author , on his arrival at New York , took lodgings at Bunker 's Hotel , and the next morning assumed his place at the breakfast table with the other inmates of the house . The state of things at his entrance is described as follows : I had nearly completed my toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large bell gave intimation that the hour of breakfast was come . I accordingly descended as speedily as possible to the salle 4 manger , and found a considerable party engaged in doing justice to a meal , which at first glance one would scarcely have guessed to be a breakfast . Solid viands of all descriptions loaded the table , while , in the occasional intervals , were distributed dishes of rolls , toast , and cakes of buck-wheat and Indian corn . At the head of the table sate the landlady , who , with an air of complacent dignity , was busied in the distribution of tea and coffee . A large bevy of negroes was bustling about , ministering with all possible alacrity to the many wants , which were somewhat vociferously obtruded on their attention . Towards the upper end of the table I observed about a dozen ladies , but by far the largest part of the company were of the other sex. * All this must , to a hungry man , have formed on the whole a rather promising ensemble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who frequently compliments himself upon possessing the hearty and indiscriminating appetite of an old campaigner ,  --  must have made a good breakfast . Most of the guests probably did so , and went their way without imagining that any thing extraordinary had happened . But to the refined sensibilities of our author , the affair was little more than a series of various abominations . The contrast of the whole scene with that of an English breakfast table was striking enough . Here was no loitering nor lounging ; no dipping into newspapers ; no apparent lassitude of appetite ; no interval of repose in mastication ; but all was hurry , bustle , clamor and voracity , and the business of repletion went forward with a rapidity altogether unexampled . The strenuous efforts of the company were , of course , soon rewarded with success . Departures , which had begun , even before I took my place at the table , became every instant more numerous , and in a few minutes the apartment had become what Moore beautifully describes in one of his songs , a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , under such circumstances , was by no means gracious either to the eye or the fancy . It was strewed tbickly with the disjecta membra of the entertainment . // Here lay fragments of fish , somewhat unpleasantly odoriferous ; there , the skeleton of a chicken ; on the right a mustard-pot upset , and the cloth , passim , defiled with stains of eggs , coffee , gravy ,  --  but I will not go on with the picture . One nasty custom , however , I must notice . Eggs , instead of being eat ( eaten ) from the shell , are poured into a wine-glass , and after being duly and disgustingly churned up with butter and condiment , the mixture , according to its degree of fluidity , is forthwith either spooned into the mouth , or drunk off like a liquid . The advantage gained by this unpleasant process , I do not profess to be qualified to appreciate , but I can speak from experience to its sedative effect on the appetite of an unpractised beholder . ' In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpus delicti ,  --  seems to have been , that the breakfast-table did not look so fresh , and clean and perfect in all its urrangements at the close of the repast , as it did at the beginning . There were stains upon the cloth and portions of the articles of food , which were partly eaten , remained upon the dishes . Truly , our author is a reasonable man . In Edinburgh , they doubtless manage these things very differently . There , a mustard-pot that is overturned leaves no spot behind it : the cloth and the napkins that have served the purpose of the meal are as smooth and as glossy as they were when they left the landlady 's press , and the bones of the chickens and the fish , as fast as they are denuded to satisfy the appetite of the guests , put on spontaneously a new covering , and look as plump as thou 6h nothing had happened . In the same way it is not improbable , that within the precincts of our author 's former experience , the linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three weeks ' wearing , as when first put on : and this may partly account for the singular fact , that an individual , so peculiarly nice in all his habits , and so decidedly averse to nastiness* of any kind ,  --  to use his own elegant phraseology ,  --  should have paid so little attention to the occasional refreshment of his costume during his residence at Bunker 's , that his fellow-boarders , if we are rightly informed , actually held a formal meeting on the subject , at which they passed a resolution , requesting him to change his linen ; and at length , finding his manners incorrigibly offensiye , were compelled to abate him as a common nuisance , by requesting the master of the house to deliver them from his company . At the egg question we have already glanced , and its im // portance is hardly such , as to justify our resuming it at much length . Our author regards it as entirely heterodox , to eat eggs in any other way than directly from the shell . Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eating them from the shell , as the nec plus ultra of barbarism . Highly as we think of the civilization and refinement of the Athens of Great Britain , we are compelled to say , that , on a question of this kind , the authority of the minister of Charles X. is decidedly preferable to that of a Scotch lieutenant on half-pay . As to the rapidity with which the breakfast was eaten ,  --  and this is one of our author 's great grievances ,  --  the real difficulty in this particular case seems to have been that , overdone by the fatigues of the preceding day , perhaps by the pleasures of the parting feast at Niblo 's , he had slept too late , and did not reach the table until the company had nearly finished . This circumstance accounts satisfactorily for the early disappearance of the other guests ; and for the comparatively disordered state in which he appears to have found the arrangements of the repast . The same topic is , however , repeatedly adverted to on other occasions , which do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his account of the dinner at the hotel on the same day , our author states , that he beheld the same scene of gulping and swallowing , as if for a wager , which his observation at breakfast had prepared him to expect . Each individual seemed to pitchfork his food down his gullet , without the smallest attention to the wants of his neighbor . ' In these remarks , the worthy captain ,  --  if captain he be ,  --  seems to have been a little less select in his choice of terms , than might have been wished , or ,  --  considering the high standard of delicacy he employs in judging the conduct and language of others ,  - -  perhaps expected . But without dwelling upon these minutiae , as a too great rapidity in despatching their meals has been for some years past a standing topic of reproach upon the Americans , by all the British travellers , and as the matter admits , we think , of an easy and simple explanation , we proceed to treat it very briefly on its merits . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time devoted to the business of eating is every where determined by personal and accidental considerations , rather than by any peculiarities of national character . The French peasant , for example , who dines upon a piece of brown bread , seasoned perhaps with a // morsel of cheese , or an onion , will spare himself the trouble even of sitting down to table , and may often he seen despatching his simple repast , with great got'U and gaiety , in the open air at his cottage door . The substantial burgher of all countries , on the other hand , who fares more or less handsomely , if not sumptuously , every day , will probably devote something like an hour to his principal meal . Again ; a party of friends , who meet together at the close of the day , in form to dine , but in fact to enjoy each other s conversation and company , will prolong the meeting for several hours ; while the same party , on the other hand , with the same viands before them , if restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abridge their conversation , and to devote themselves chiefly to the mere satisfaction of the wants of nature . Now the error into which the whole herd of British travellers , and our author tout le premier , have fallen in regard to this subject , proceeds , as we conceive , from their having overlooked the last of these incontestible truths . The conclusions of these gentlemen , respecting the state of society , manners and literature in the United States , are , as is well known , the results , in general , of observations made in taverns , steamboats , and stage-coaches . That the meals , which are eaten by the travellers in stage-coaches at the public tables in the taverns where they stop along the road , are commonly despatched with some rapidity , is no doubt true : but it is equally certain that there is a special reason for this , which does not operate with the same force upon the nation at large . When a stagecoach stops at a tavern , the company are allowed about half an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine ; and as the time of arrival is uncertain , a quarter or a third part even of this brief space must elapse , before the dishes are placed upon the table . What then is to be done ? Is the traveller to undertake to loiter and lounge :  --  to dip into newspapers : * to allow himself an interval of repose in mastication ? * If he did , the coachman 's horn would sound befpre he had finished the first cup of coffee , or the first morsel of be6f . Is he to refrain entirely from eating , rather than not take his meals with all the leisure of a British nobleman at his seat in the country ? Neither appetite nor health would permit this course . What then , we repeat , is he to do ? The answer is plain ; - not gulp and swallow as iffor a wager : - not ' pitchfork Iris food down Iris gullet , without the least attention to // the wants of his neighbors ; - for we do not admit that these coarse phrases give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public table in this country , or of any thing except the want of good breeding in the writer that uses them : but-put formality in his pocket , and without dawdling over newspapers or stopping to discuss disputed points in theology or politics , seat himself at the table and make a moderate meal with all convenient despatch , that he may be ready to take his place in the coach , at the time appointed . This is what the traveller in stage-coaches is compelled to do , and what he really does , not merely in this country , but all the world over . Such we suppose to be the secret of the extraordinary rapidity in the despatch of meals in this country , which has for several years past given so much uneasiness to the British travellers . On the occasion particularly alluded to by our author , the persons , whose early departure from the table annoyed him so much , had probably arrived fifteen minutes before in one coach , and were going away fifteen minutes after in another . That gentlemen , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , are in any haste to separate , is so far from being true , that the prevailing error , here as in England , is precisely the opposite one . In France , the practice is for the whole company to retire from the table together , on these occasions , at the close of the meal , which seldom occupies more than an hour and a half . Here , on the contrary , as in England , it is usual for the gentlemen to remain after the ladies have retired , and sit over their wine two or three hours in succession , not unfrequently till midnight . If this do not satisfy our author , we should recommend it to him to look well to his own ways , and join the Temperance Society as speedily as possible . For ourselves , if we were disposed to suggest to our countrymen any change in their habits in this particular , the counsel we should give them would , certainly be not to prolong but to abridge their potations , and adjourn in better season than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this subject , we shall merely add , that the standard of decorum at the public dinnertables in this country seems to be at least as high as in Enghnd ,  --  if we may draw any general conclusions from the following account of the proceedings of the Liverpool Agricultur // al Society , on a recent occasion of this description . We have been present at a considerable number of the public festivals of Agricultural and other Societies in this country , but have never happened to witness any new surtouts split from the collar downwards , ' - any unauthorized visibility of white under yestures ,  --  ' any black print of a boot on the pure damask beside our plate , '  --  or any disposition in the guests to peregrinate amongst decanters , glasses and plates ' upon the top of the tables : all which , and more , appear to have been among the interludes and divertissernens of the Liverpool dinner , and may , perhaps , have become general iu the mother country . The annual dinner was announced to be given in Lucas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and considerably prior to that hour , the door was besieged by a company , of whom , as far as could be judged outwardly , it did not se&amp;rn that a good dinner was the last thing to stand in fear . Before the opening of the door , the crowd increased much in numbers , and more in impatience , and when , at length , a small crevice was made , it agreed so little with their expectation of making a full sweep upon the viands when the large folding gates should have expanded for their simultaneous ingress , that out of revenge the crushing became only more violent and determined , till it might have been doubted whether the wrong party had not been brought out of the Infirmary yard to dine , and the visiters and candidates left behind . In vain the persons keeping the entrance cried out shame , and those who were nearly in enforced upon the rear the uselessness of struggling , so long as all were sure of admission ; the hunching , and elbowing , and complaining still continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the unequivocal expressions of some of the sufferers , will be certain of allo*ving more room at the door-way on a subsequent occasion . That the affair was egregiously mismanaged was expressed in very unceremonious terms , and if the right honorable chairman had found no other means of entering the room than by enduring the compressure of such an immense mass of human bodies , till it appeared sufficient to have flattened the two sides of his ribs together as easily as it would have flattened his hat , we think he would have excepted that part of the day 's proceeding from the character of being an honor to the town of Liverpool . ' We can only say , that however such a manipulating might be sustained before dinner , it would not have done after . Amidst all this suffering , it was not to be supposed that the minor evils of rent garments , and seams split open , would be wanting : accordingly , the wo-begone aspect of many a good piece of broadcloth // attested the desperate conflict it had passed through ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , although it might be in the garb of a magpie , through the unauthorized visibility of their white under vestures . It would certainly have taken something more than ordinarily accommodating tempers withinside , to have restored good humor , after all the spleen engendered at the entrance . The opinions on the entertainment ought , therefore , in justice to be received with that qualification . The dishes supplied were of the best kind , substantial , and in sufficient abundance , and the number of the guests , which amounted to between six and seven hundred , must also be taken into consideration . This , indeed , gave occasion for some especial congratulations from the head of the table , and no one can deny that there was a satisfaction in seeing the agricultural interest of the country in such a flourishing state , and so many of its friends rallying round the cause ; but we speak of the dinner itself ; and we do think , that if , when you hkve survived the perils and punishment of the passage in , you sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split from the collar downwards , resolving to console your stomach at the table for what you have suffered in your liver at the door , some subject , much more hungry than polite , runs across the table , leaving the black print of his boot on the pure damask beside your plate , or shaking the questionable dirt from his sole over the viand upon which your mouth was already feeding by anticipation , and all this , because , having run up between two long rows of tables , and finding neither room nor escape at the top , he is obliged to scale over and peregrinate amongst decanters , and glasses , and plates , till he is lucky enough to find a location ; if you are to shift for your dinner as you best can , amidst an accumulation of the dirty plates , exhibiting the refuse of the first course in agreeable variety , simply because there are no waiters , or they will not attend to you ; if when the cheese and celery is placed on some of the tables , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you peremptorily refuse to allow the cloth to stir till it is brought , ( in which , though done for the sake of justice , you can not help taking the appearance of a greedy clownishness , ) and are at length compelled to submit with a bad grace on the solemn assurance to every successive application that there is none to be had ; if these are the ordinary concomitants of an agricultural feast , they are inconveniences for which neither the compliments of a secretary of state , nor the bad speeches and worse songs of a young heir of nobility , are an adequate recompense. ' // If we may trust to the accuracy of the anecdote related in the following paragraph , which rests , however , on merely newspaper authority , it xvould seem that our author attempted to introduce into this country the agreeable innovation of peregrinating amongst decanters , glasses and plates ' upon the dinner table , which was practised with so much success at Liverpool , and may perhaps have become general in England . We may remark , en passant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which food is bolted ,  --  to use another of his choice phrases ,  --  in this country , it would seem that on this occasion he despatched business with much more expedition than his fellow-travellers , and that he was too impatient of their delay even to wait for the retirement of the ladies . Colonel Hamilton , so called , the author of " Men and Manners in America , ** conducted himself while in this country with less of the air of a gentleman or man of good breeding , than any traveller who has visited us.for years . From all parts of the country we have anecdotes of his conduct , which reflect upon him the utmost discredit . One of them is related as follows in the Albany Argus : - " On the passage of the Hudson , in one of our most richly furnished day boats , the table arrangements of which , as well as the whole internal government , are particularly well ordered , Captain H. , seated at breakfast , on the cushioned seat inside of the table , with ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady had left the table , and attempted to step upon and across it . He was arrested by the prompt and loud command of the captain of the boat . Down , Sir ! No man puts his foot upon my table , whilst I have the honor to sit at its head . ' The Englishman shrank back , chagrined and rebuked . Indeed , such was his mortification , that although he had entered and paid his passage to Albany , he stopped at the first landing , ( West Point . ) Whether it was on this occasion that , as the N. Y. Mirror intimates , he was rebuked by the host of the West Point Hotel , for a want of civility in the ladies ' drawing-room , we are not informed . " * From the inexorable severity of our author in every thing relating to the economy of the table , one would naturally conclude that he belonged to a community in which the science of cookery was carried to the highest perfection , and the etiquette of the banqueting-room understood and practised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case in England , our readers have been enabled in part to judge from the // heresy into which he and most of his countrymen have fallen in regard to the proper manner of eating eggs , and which we have already exposed upon the unquestionable authority of one of the ex-ministers of Charles X. ,  --  a prince renowned for his love of good eating ,  --  and who , unfortunately for him , thought much more , in arranging his cabinet , of the gastronomical attainments of the candidates for his favor , than of their political principles . That this is not the only error into which the English have fallen in regard to this matter , and that the science of eating and drinking is not in general carried by them to such a degree of perfection as *o authorize a traveller , in his quality of Englishman , to come here and take us to task , cx cathedra , for some pretended infractions of the strict rules of gastronomy , is rendered sufficiently probable by the following remarks , which we borrow from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's self at table is , in France , an axiom of good sense and good company . In England , on the contrary , to *at to live , seems to be the sole object ; there the refinements of cookery are unknown . It is not , in a word , a science ; neither does the succession in which dishes should be served up appear to be studied . To cover a table with immense pieces , boiled or roasted , and to demolish them , in the confusion in which chance has placed them , appears to be the whole gastronomic science of the country . The most ordinary seasoning of the English cuzsine is a profusion of spices , unsparingly thrown into the sauces . To correct the effect of this , recourse is had to the insipid sim-. plicity of plain-boiled vegetables , which continually circulate round the table , and with which the host would fain load the guest 's plate . The meat is either boiled or roasted . The fish is always boiled , and is served invariably with melted butter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before appearing on a French table , are altogether unknown in England . Eggs are excluded from English dinner tables , and even when produced at other meals , they are served in the shell ; for the talent of making an omelette enters not into the education of an English cook . English fowls are of an indifferent quality ; and game is subjected to a process of roasting which deprives it of all its flavor . The confectionary is badly made and without variety . The vegetables , condemned only to figure as correctives of a too exciting cuisine , do not appear upon the table . The entremets are limited to a very scanty supply of creams and insipid jellies . // 227 Men and Manners in America . The following is the order in which an English dinner is nerved . The first course comprises two soups of different kinds ; one highly peppery , in which float morsels of meat ; the other a soup *t la Fran*aise . They are placed at either extremity of the table , and helped by the master and mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish , and by roast beef , of which the toughest part is served round . Where there is no plateau , a salad occupies the middle of the table . This course being removed , regular entrAcs are brought in , and the servants hand round dishes with divisions , containing vegetables . The course which follows is equivalent to the second course in France ; but , prepared without taste , it is served confusedly . Each guest attacks ( without offering to his neighbor ) the dish before him . The creams have often disappeared before the roast is thought of ; which , ill-carved , always comes cold to him who is to partake of it . The English carve on the dinner table , and as , before proceeding to this operation , each person is asked whether he wishes to taste of the dish or not , a considerable time is lost in fetching the plate of the person who accepts . A dinner never lasts less than two hours and a half or three hours , without including the time the gentlemen sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salad appears again before the dessert , flanked by some plates of cheese . After the cloth is removed , dried and green fruit with biscuit are placed on the table . These compose the not very brilliant dessert . The serving up of the dinner , however , is the part about which the English give themselves the least trouble . Their table only presents an agreeable coup d'a ? il before dinner , lit is then covered with the whitest linen , and a service of plate of greater variety , richer , and more resplendent than is to be seen in any other country . ' It will be seen , that the objections made by Baron Hanssez to the economy of an English table , are substantially the same with those which our author urges against us , the article eggs ,  --  in which we happen to be ortbodox ,  --  alWaY5 excepted . If the Americans , according to our author , pitch fork their food down their gullets , without the smallest attention to their neighbors , ' the English , in like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attack , without offering to their neighbors , the dish set before them . ' If , even at the parting feast at Niblo 's ,  --  in many respects an agreeable exception to most of our author 's experiences in this country ,  --  ' the greater part of the dishes were cold before the guests were prepared to attack them , ' so in England , according // to Baron Haussez , the rdast , ill-carved , always comes cold to him who is to partake of it . ' If , on the same great occasion in New York , there was no attempt to serve the chaotic entertainment in courses , a fashion , indeed , but little prevalent in the United States so in England , the succession in which dishes should be served up does not appear to be studied . To cover a table with immense pieces , boiled or roasted , and to demolish them in the confusion in which chance has placed them , appears to be the whole gastronomic science of the country . ' If , in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of little else than liquid grease , ' so in England , the fish is always boiled , and is served invariably with melted butter . ' This last point has in fact been for some time past a standing subject of reproach , on the part of continental travellers , against the natives of the fastanchored isle . What a country , ' - said the Neapolitan ambassador Caraccioli , after residing for some time at London , What a country for a Christian to live in ! Twenty religions and only one kind of sauce ! ' This was of course the eternal melted butter . It appears , however , that in these ,  --  and the same is true of most of the orher ,  --  points the complaints made against the American and English domestic economy are precisely the same . We suppose the real truth to be , that both these worthies ( our author and Haussez ) are , perhaps with some exaggerations , partly in the right ,  --  that the style of cooking and serving up a dinner is in fact substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the science of gastronony is not in either carried to quite the same height of perfection , as in France . For ourselves , we can not say , that this is with us a matter of very poignant regret . We are rather disposed , on the contrary , to apply to this subject the remark of Themistodes , who admitted that he played indifferently upon the flute , but consoled himself with the reflection , that he was a pretty good proficient in politics ; or , in his own language , that he knew how to make a great state out of a little one . We make no professions of insensibility to the value of a good dinner : - the man , ' as Dr. Johnson justly observes , who neglects his stomach ( employing a broader word ) , will be very apt to neglect every thing else . ' But with all our respect for this valuable member , and the art which provides for satisfying its wants , we conceive that there are other arts of still more importance , // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the want of truffled turkeys and Perigord pies . But , however this may be , it is at all events quite ridiculous for an Englishman to come here and point out , with the air of making a great discovery , as blemishes in our domestic economy , the precise usages which have been for two centuries the standing topics of reproach upon his own countrymen ; and which , as far as they occur at all , do in fact prevail to precisely the same extent on both sides of the Atlantic . But it is time to quit this subject , however interesting , and proceed to something else . We have accompanied our author to the banqueting-hall , and have found him quarrelling with his bread and butter . Let us now attend him to the ball-room . Here , at least , as a military man and a bachelor , we might have expected to find him , if ever , in good humor . Unluckily , in order to substantiate his objections to the political institutions of the country , in the mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was necessary to show , not only that the gentlemen chew tobacco , and eat eggs in an irregular way , hut that the tournure of the ladies is not exactly what it should be . If it can he made out , that the belles of New York and the other principal cities are deficient in the nameless graces ' that adorn our author 's countrywomen , it will follow as a matter of course , that the Constitution and laws of the United States are a complete failure their principal object being , as is well known , to regulate the dress and deportment of the fairer part of the creation . This consideration seems , after some resistance , to have fairly overcome our author 's gallantry , and he addresses himself to the agreeable task of finding fault with the appearance and manners of the New York fashionables , with a degree of resolution , that would have done honor to a better cause . The result is exhibited in the following extract . On the last night of the year there was a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation . The ball-rooms were , very tolerable , but the entrance detestable . It led close past the bar of the City Hotel , and the ladies , in ascending the stair , which , by the by , wa* offensively dirty , must have been drenched with tobacco-smoke . Within , however , I found assembled a great deal of beauty . At seventeen , nothing can be prettier than a smiling damsel of New York . At twenty-two , // the same damsel , metamorphosed into a matron , has lost a good deal of her attraction . I had never been in so large and miscellaneous a party before . I looked about for solecisms of deportinent , but could detect none on the part of the ladies . There was , however , a sort of Transatlanticism about them ; and even their numerous points of resemblance to my fair countrywomen , had the effect of marking out certain shadowy differences , to be felt rather than described . There was certainly an entire absence of what the French call l'air noble ,  --  of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than solicits it . Yet the New York ladies are not vulgar . Far from it . I mean only to say that they are not precisely European ; and with the possession of so much that is amiable and attractive , they may safely plead guilty to want of absolute conformity to an arbitrary standard , the authority of which they are not bound to acknowledge . But what shall be said of the gentlemen ? Why , simply that a party of the new police , furnished forth with the requisite toggery , would have played their part in the ball-room , with about as much grace . There is a certain uncontrollable rigidity of muscle about an American , and a want of sensibility to the lighter graces of deportment , which makes him , perhaps , the most unhopeful of all the votaries of Terpsichore . In this respect the advantage is altogether on the side of the ladies . Their motions are rarely inelegant , and never grotesque . I leave it to other travellers to extend this praise to the gentlemen . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under great obligations to the gallant major for the civility with which he is pleased to speak of them , and will doubtless be happy to profit by his suggestions . It is rather unfortunate , that he has not been able to describe more particularly the newly-discovered offence of Transatlanticism , which the former are supposed to have committed , or the shadowy differences ' between their manners , and those of his own countrywomen . In the absence of rules for the improvement of their tournure , our transatlantic fashionables will naturally look for examples , and with the view of aiding their researches , we beg leave to offer them the following description of a ball at Brighton ,  --  one of the residences of the Court ,  --  extracted from the late work of Prince Piickler Muscau . They will see at a glance , how much they have to gain by endeavoring to make their deportment more precisely European . // A narrow stair-case led directly into the ball-room , which was ill-lighted and miserably furnished , and surrounded with worsted cords , to divide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hung with ill-washed draperies , which looked like sheets hung out to dry . Imagine a second room near it , with benches along the walls , and a large tea-table in the middle ; in both rooms , the numerous company , raven black from head to foot , gloves inclusive ; a melancholy style of dancing , without the least trace of vivacity and joyousness , so that the only feeling you have , is that of compassion for the fatigue the poor people are enduring , and you have a true idea of the Brighton Almack 's , for so these very fashionable balls are called . The whole establishment is droll enough . Miss W. , to whom I was introduced , was by far the prettiest and most graceful girl in the room , arid I was almost tempted to dance once more , though from vanity , ( for I always danced badly , ) 1 renounced that so-called pleasure years ago . I might safely enough have attempted it here , for , God knows , no where do people jump about more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real curiosity . ' Again : we are told on the same high authority , that The tournure of the English ladies , with few exceptions , is indeed as awkward as any thing to be seen at B.-Some of them have passed a year or two in France , and are distinguished by a better tournure and style of dress . ' Baron Hausse* 's ideas on these subjects are nearly similar . He describes , in the following manner , a ball given at one of the first houses in London , and represented in the newspapers of the day , as one of the most brilliant of the season . At twelve o'clock the ball-room was thrown open . For a few minutes the other rooms were freed of the unpleasant crowd ; hut the respite was of short duration , for the carriages , which every moment continued to set down fresh company in a ratio disproportioned to the extent of the apartments , obliged , at length , a part of the assembly to take refuge in the hall , which was quietly abandoned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps outside the door . To move was now impossible for those who had not the strength to use their elbows , or the courage to leave a portion of their dress in the midst of the crowd . The supper room w*rs thronged with people who could not make their way out : they who , dying with thirst , in vain attempted // to enter this apartment , accused those within of immoderate appetite . In the ball-room there was the same crowding , the same suffocation , with this additional difference , that the male dancers opposed to the approach of the crowd effective coups de pied , and the ladies a certain portion of their person which shall be nameless . ' So much for the nameless braces ' of our author 's fair countrywomen , and the precisely European tournure , in which the New York belles are , it seems , deficient . In quoting these passages from the works of the German Prince and the French E*-minister , we desire , however , to be understood as by *no means sanctioning or approving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obviously sketched in the same spirit of wanton and malignant caricature , that distin*uishes those of our author . We quote them merely as offsets to his , for the purpose of showing that other communities , which are justly regarded by all as preeminent in civilization and refinement , and the very highest circles in those communities , are obnoxious to , and have , in fact , been made the objects of similar misrepresentation . Seek and ye s/tall find , is as true of findin bfaults as of any thing else : and it is , we think , not a little creditable to the tournure of the New York belles , that so determined a critic as our author , proceeding in the avowed intention of seeing something wrong , - looking about , as he says himself for solecisms of deportment ,  --  is compelled to invent a new word a foot and a half long , the meaning of which he does not l ) retend to know himself , in order to he able to impute to them even a shadow of variation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transailanticism , if examined , would really amount to , it will be time enough to consider , when our author shall have established his claims to the character of an arbiter elegantiarum . As the case now stands , we can not think that a person , whose manners are so offensive that he could not be tolerated in a respectable boarding-hoose ,  --  who attempted , in the presence of ladies , to walk upon the dinner-table ,  - -  and who puts into a formal journal of his travels , language too coarse for a decent forecastle ,  --  is qualified to sit in judgment upon the shadowy and indescribable differences between the manners of the fashionable circles of different countries . // Our readers will judge from the specimens which we have taken , without much choice , chiefly because they happened to stand pretty near the opening of the work , of the spirit and temper , in which it is written . We can not , of course , undertake to comment with the same detail upon all our author 's sayings and doings , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he writes , is the proper antidote to his continual ; and in many cases , obviously malignant and ungentlemanly misrepresentations . His remarks throughout the whole of his long tour , though not always destitute of shrewdness , and occasionally expressed with point and spirit , are marked , in general , with the same resolute spirit of fault-finding , and the same air of impertinent pretension , amounting at times to complete fatuity , which we have already noticed . At Providence , for example , the principal objects of attention , as our readers are aware , are the manufactories and the university . With most travellers , who might have occasion to pass a day in that city , it would have been a matter of course to visit these establishments , and to make the acquaintance of President Wayland , one of the most distinguished of our scientific and intellectual men . Our author disposes of this part of his subject in the following modest and summary way . Providence is the capital of the State of Rhode Island , and contains about 25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow of a hill , which commands a complete view of the fine bay . The great majority of the houses are built of wood , interspersed , however , with tenements of brick , and a few which are at least fronted with stone . It contains considerable cotton manufactories , which ,  --  boasting no knowledge of suck matters ,  - -  1 was not tempted to visit . The college appears a building of some extent , and is finely situated on the summit of a neighboring height . The roads were 80 obstructed by snow , as to render climbing the ascent a matter of more difficulty than I was in the humor to encounter ; and so it was decreed , that Brown 's College should remain by me unvisited . ' Instead of troubling his readers with dissertations on these unimportant topics , he selects for discussion the weightier matter of his own dinner at the tavern , upon which he descants in the following exquisite style . Having finished my ramble , I returned to the inn ; where a very tolerable dinner awaited my appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since leaving England , and , like my // countrymen generally , I am disposed to attach considerable importance to the privilege of choosing my dinner , and the hour of eating it . It is only when alone that on* enjoys the satisfaction of feeling that he is a distinct unit in creation , a being totus , teres , atque rotundus . At a public ordinary , he is but a fraction , a decimal , at most , but , very probably , a centesimal of a huge masticating monster , with the appetite of a Mastodon or a Behemoth . He labors under the conviction , that his meal has lost in dignity what it has gained in profusion . He is consorted involuntarily with people to whom he is bound by no tie but that of temporary necessity , and , with whom , except the immediate impulse of brutal appetite , he has probably nothing in common . A man , like an American , thus diurnally mortified and abased from his youth upwards , of course knows nothing of the high thoughts which visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good dinner , reposes with a full consciousness of the dignity of his nature , and the high destinies to which he is called . The situation is one , which naturally stimulates the whole inert mass of his speculative benevolence . He is at peace with all mankind , for he reclines on a well-stuffed sofa , and there are wine and walnuts on the table . He is on the best terms with himself , and recalls his own achievements in arms , literature , or philosophy , in a spirit of the most benign complacency . If he look to the future , the prospect is bright and unclouded . If he revert to the past , its " written troubles , " its failures and misfortunes are erased from the volume , and his memories are exclusively those of gratified power . He is in his slippers , and comfortable robe-de-chambre , and what to him , at such a moment , are the world and its ambitious ? 1 appeal to the philosopher , and he answers ,  --  Nothing V This is the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers about me in my branched velvet gown , having come from a day-bed , where I left Olivia sleeping ,  --  letting them know I know my place as I would they should do theirs . ' &amp;c . Even this , however , is improved upon at Philadelphia . The water-works of that city are justly reckoned among the principal curiosities of the place , and indeed of the country . These too our author declined seeing , for reasons still more extraordinary than those , which prevented him from visiting the cotton nmanufactories and the university at Providence . The Philadelphians , however , pride themselves far more on their water-works than on their State-House . Their lo Pevans on account of the former are loud and unceasing , and I must say , the annoyance whic1* these occasion to a traveller , is very // considerable . A dozen times a-day was I asked whether I had seen the water-works , and on my answering in the negative , I was told that I positively must visit them ; that they were unrivalled in the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , and by implication , that no one but an Englishman , meanly jealous of American superiority , would omit an opportunity of admiring their unrivalled niechanism . There is no accounting for the eccentricities of human character . I had not heard these circumstances repeated above fifty times , ere I began to run restive , and determined not to visit the water-works at all . To this resolution I adhered , in spite of all annoyance , with a pertinacity worthy of a better cause . Of the water-works of Philadelphia , therefore , I know nothing , and any reader , particularly solicitous of becoming acquainted with the principle of this remarkable piece of machinery , must consult the pages of other travellers . ' This we suppose to be the nec plus ultra of fatuity . That a man , possessing , no doubt , originally , the usual stock of ordinary good sense , should have permitted his head to be turned to this extent , by the little success of writing a tolerably popular second-rate novel , is a melancholy pro in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation is performed , especially when the knowledge-box happens , as was probably the case in the present instuwe , to be naturally none of the strongest . With Boston , and the society which he s*w here , our author professes to have been very much pleased , although , as far as facts are concerned , his observations are exceedingly scanty . Having travelled by mail from Providence to Boston , and resided three weeks in the latter city , he was of course qualified to pass judgment ex cathedral upon the New England character , and accordingly writes , while at Boston , two long chapters of general renarks upon that subject . As the impression made upon him by the only part of New England which he had seen , seems to have been decidedly agreeable , one would naturally have expected that any conclusions , which he might have thought proper to draw from the materials in his possession , would have been rather favorable than otherwise . Instead of this , the two chapters are written throughout in a strain of almost unmingled invective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of conduct deeper than simple thoughtlessness , or mere political // and national prejudice , and seems to require the supposition of a strong personal disgust in the writer . Whether any feeling of that kind had been generated by the gentle admonitions upon his deportment , which he is understood to have received at the hotel in New York , and on board the North River steamboat , we are not informed . He appears to have felt , that an apology was necessary for the precipitation with which he had formed his opinions . In a note upon one of the chapters alluded to , he states that the observations on the New England character would have been more appropriately deferred till a later period of the work , but having written them , they must now stand where chance has placed them . I have only to beg that they may be taken , not as the hasty impressions received during a few days ' or weeks ' residence in Boston , but as the final result of my observations on this interesting people , both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' How the contents of two chapters , written at Boston , can be regarded as the results of observations made afterwards in other places , and why it was absolutely necessary that they should stand , because he had written them , our author has not condescended to explain . The presumption undoubtedly is , that it would have derogated from the dignity of so great a personage , to correct a rough draft , or even to alter the arrangement of his matter ; and the passage affords another example of the same graceful modesty that shines so conspicuously in those which describe his proceedings at Philadelphia and Providence . We select from the two chapters in question a few of the more pointed and characteristic paragraphs , as specimens of the tone and manner of the whole . Mammon has no more zealous worshipper than your true Yankee . His homage is not merely that of the lip , or of the knee ; it is an entire prostration of the heart ; the devotion of all powers , bodily and mental , to the service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast exchange , on which he is impelled , both by principle and interest , to over-reach his neighbors if he can . The thought of business is never absent from his mind . To him there is no enjoyment without traffic . He travels snaillike , with his shop or his counting-house on his back , and , like other hawkers , is always ready to open his budget of little private interests for discussion or amusement . The only respite he enjoys from the consideration of his own affairs , is the time he is pleased to bestow on prying into yours . In regard to the latter , he evidently considers that he has a perfect right to unlimited // sincerity . There is no baffling him . His curiosity seems to rise in proportion to the difficulty of its gratification . He will track you through every evasion , detect all your doublings , or , if thrown out , will hark back so skilfully on the scent , that you are at length fairly hedged in a corner . A New Englander passes through the statutory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction , that he has mastered , if not the omne scibile , at least every thing valuable within the domain of intellect . It never occurs to him as possible , that he may have formed a wrong conclusion on any question , however intricate , of politics or religion . He despises all knowledge abstracted from the business of the world , and prides himself on his stock of practical truths . In mind , body , and estate , he believes himself the first and noblest of God 's creatures . The sound of triumph is ever on his lips , and , like a man who has mounted the first step of a ladder , it is his pride to look down on his neighbors , whom he overtops by an inch , instead of directing his attention to the great height yet to be surmounted . Jonathan is sober and industrious , but his reputation for honesty is at a discount . The whole Union is full of stories of his cunning frauds , and of the impositions he delights to perpetrate on his more simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his zeal for religion , the latter is sure to give way . He will insist on the scrupulous observance of the Sabbath , and cheat his customer on the Monday morning . His life is a comment on the text , Qui festinat ditescere , non erit innocens . The whole race of Yankee pedlers , in particular , are proverbial for dishonesty . These go forth annually in thousands to lie , cog , cheat , swindle , in short , to get possession of their neighbors ' property , in any manner it can be done with impunity . Their ingenuity in deception is confessedly very great . They warrant broken watches to be the best time-keepers in the world , sell pinchbeck trinkets for gold and have always a large assortment of wooden nutmegs , and stagnant barometers . In this respect they resemble the Jews , of which race , by the by , I am assured , there is not a single specimen to be found in New England . There is an old Scotch proverb , " Corbies never pick out corbies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One meets in them much to approve , little to admire , and nothing to love . They may be disliked , however , but they can not be despised . There is a degree of energy and sturdy independence about them , imico mpatible with contempt . Abuse them as we may , it must still be admitted they are a singular and original people // Nature , in framing a Yankee , seems to have given him double brains , and half heart . The character of the New Englanders is a subject on which , I confess , I feel tempted to be prolix . In truth , it seems to me so singular and anomalous , so compounded of what is valuable and what is vile , that I never feel certain of having succeeded in expressing the precise combination of feeling which it inspires . As a philanthropist , I should wish them to be less grasping and more contented with the blessings they enjoy , and would willingly barter a good deal of vanity , and a little substantial knavery , for an additional infusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , of course , readily occur to our readers , that this same New England character , ' which our author is pleased to represent as so very singular and anomalous , ' and which he has painted in such very flattering colors , is no other than that of his own countrymen , himself included , except so far as he may have metamorphosed , or , as he would probably say in his improved English , transmogrified himself , by his campaigns in foreign countries . Englishmen are of course Englishmen all the world over , and there is no part of the world , in which the characteristics of the common stock have been sustained with greater purity , or with a less mixture of foreign alloy , than in New England . Our author himself admits , that two centuries have done little to efface the character which our forefathers brought with them . ' All the gentillesses which we have quoted above , are therefore so many pretty compliments which the gallant gentleman has paid , apparently with a most innocent unconsciousness , to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly that the objections which are here made to the New England character , though stated in an unusually ill-natured form , are no other than the standing and hackneyed topics of reproach , which have always been urged against the English of the mother country ; such as excessive gravity , an external coldness and reserve , which are supposed to indicate the absence of kind and generous feelings ; an exclusive devotion to gain ; an indisposition to be amused , and an overweening estimate of their own advantages , political and personal . These are the charges which , for two centuries past , have rung through the continent in a thousand different forms , and are constantly repeated as often as a traveller from the south of Europe crosses the channel . In the last editions by the German Prince , and Baron llaussez , they have manifestly // lost nothing of their pungency . The morgue Anglaise is a proverb at Paris . Voltaire exhausted his wit in laughing at the milords who were accustomed to parade their weariness ,  --   - -  promener leurs ennuis ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of the English , never forgot to characterize them as a nation of shopkeepers , dead to every sentiment of honor and generosity , and actuatcd hy no motive or principle hut a paltry love of gain . Madame de Stai*l , in her Corinna , has given a picture of a Scotch tea-party , which is enough to make a man put on a fur cloak in midsummer . Count Pecchio , the last of the travellers in England , tells us , that the English of our day are so tranquil and so cold , that they seem to us men of ice , and that it is often said that they have no hlood in their veins . ' It is really not a little amusing to see these stale criticisms on the English , after having , as we have said , rung through the continent of Europe , for about two centuries , been a thousand times over examined and reexamined in England ,  --   - -  allowed as far as they are just ; refuted , denied , or explained , as far as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper value , that the whole question may he regarded as finally adjud*ed and settled in the highest courts of appeal ,  --  -  --  to see them , we say , hashed up anew , with no other change of form but an ample condiment of spleen , and brought forward by an Englishman with an air of importance and almost mystery , as faults newly discovered by himself in the New En bland character . Of the various modifications of the English character , the two which are generally supposed to resemble each other most nearly are the New England and the Scotch . This again is allowed by our author , who says that in character there are many points of resemblance between the Scotch and the New Englanders . ' The poisoned chalice , which he wishes to administer to our lips , returns therefore directly back to his own , not merely as an Englishman , but as a native of the particular part of the mother country , in which he happens to reside . It is true that he attempts to make a distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former as a horde of sharpers , going forth annually by thousands into other regions , to lie , cog , cheat , and swindle , ' while he gives to the Scotch a high character for honesty . It is of course needless to add , that this exclusively New England failing is precisely the one , which is habitually imputed by the English themselves , // though in much more decent language than our author has used , to their northern neighbors . That the Scotch are a set of tall , lean , hungry , . red-haired , crafty knaves , inhabiting a bleak and barren region , presenting only one agreeable prospect7 namely , that of the road to London , which they annually travel in crowds for the purpose of defrauding and eating out the substance of honest John Bull proper , is the fixed belief of that respectable personage , and is no doubt as well-founded as the corresponding persuasion of a considerable portion of our own countrymen , that the Yankees are employed the greater part of their time in fabricating wooden nutmegs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets of the generous , high-minded and too-confiding South . The very remark which our author here applies to New England , that , in consequence of the extraordinary acuteness of the inhabitants in matters of business , the Jews find it impossible to get a living among them , has been , a thousand times over , made upon Scotland , and sustained as often by the identical Scotch proverb which he cites with such apparent coinplaceney as an illustration of it . The charges made by our author against the New England character , being , as we have seen , precisely the same with those which are habitually ur*ed against the English character , and particularly the Scotch modification of it , whatever foundation there may really be for them7 come with rather an ill grace from a traveller , who is himself an Englishman , and from the north country . There are also some personal considerations in our author 's case , which , duly weighed , might perhaps have satisfied him , that some at least , and those the most offensive of his accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have supposed them . He lauds himself continually , throughout his work , upon the favorable reception which he met with every where , and , as far as this city is concerned , we can vouch for the correctness of his representation . Now if the Yankees are so entirely given up to the worship of Mainmon as he describes them to be : - if their homage is not merely that of the lip , or the knee , but an entire prostration of the heart , the devotion of all their powers , bodily and mental , to the service of the idol ; - how happens it , that they found so much tirneto devote to the author of Cyril Thornton ? What had they to gain , by giving him dinners and balls ,  --  by leaving their compting-roomus and offices , to accompany him on his visit // to the objects that engage the attention of a traveller , when ,  --  as did not always happen ,  --   - -  he would so far condescend from his high estate as to consent to look at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor money to buy . There was nothing very imposing in the rank of a Scotch Captain on half pay , and certainly nothing very attractive in our author 's conversation and manners . He brought , it is true , letters of introduction to respectable persons in most of our cities . These , however , he did not take the trouble of delivering in person , but , as he is careful to inform us , regularly transmitted through the post-office ,  --  a piece of rudeness , which , in any other country , would have entirely shut him out of society . How happened it then , we repeat , that an unknown foreigner ,  --  unassisted by rank , fortune , or any personal advantage ,  --  coarse and offensive in his manners , - almost unintelligible in con versation ,  --  dropping from the clouds into the midst of a community of strangers , was yet received with marked attention wherever he went ? It is needless to say , that the only effective letter of recommendation , which he brought with him , was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious to make the acquainttance of the writer of a book , which they had read with pleasure , and , in consideration of his talents , cheerfully overlooked the offensive peculiarities in his personal deportment , although they probably did not anticipate the outpouring of malignity with which their civilities have been repaid . Had they been as exclusively devoted to money as he is pleased to represent them , he might and probably would have travelled from Eastport to New Orleans , without receiving any other notice than such as befel him in the North River steamboat and the New York hotel . The devotion to literary  --  or to speak more generally-intellectual power , that prevails in this country , is , in fact , one of the remarkable traits in the national character , and is much more deep and fervent ,  --  whatever our author may think of it ,  - -  than that which is paid to wealth . Mere wealth commands in this country ,  --  as it must , and when tolerably well administered , ought to command every where ,  --  consideration and respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Intellectual eminence , especially when accompanied by ' high moral qualities , seems to operate like a charm upon the hearts of the whole community . This effect is much more perceptible here than in Europe , where the intellectual men are overshadowed by // an hereditary privileged class , who regard them every where as inferior , and in some countries refuse to associate with them at all . The highest professional or literary distinction gives no admission to most of the courts of Europe , and only on a very unequal footing to the fashionable circles . A lawyer or a clergyman of talent is occasionally allowed a seat at the foot of a nobleman 's table , but to aspire to the hand of his daughter would be the height of presumption . At the close of a long life of labor he takes his seat , too late to receive any great satfaction from his new position , in the House of Lords , as Chancellor , Chief-Justice , or Bishop . Through the whole active period of his life , be has moved , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With us , on the contrary , great wealthy the only accidental circumstance that confers distinction* is commonly the result of a life of labor . The intellectual men assume at once , and maintain through life , a commanding position among their contemporaries ,  --  give the tone in the first social circles ,  --  and , at the maturity of their powers and influence , receive from their fellow-citizens demonstrations of attachment and respect , which have rarely , if ever , been shown before to the eminent men of any other country . The Presidentships and the Governorships , the places in the cabinet , and on the bench of justice , in Congress and in the State Legislatures ,  --  the commissions in the Army and Navy ,  --  the foreign embassies ,  --  elsewbere the monopoly of a few privileged families ,  --   - -  are here the rewards of intellectual pr*emmence . Lord Brougharn , though certainly in every way one of the most illustrious and truly deserving public characters that have appeared in England in modern times , has never received from his countrymen any proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic triumph with which Mr. Clay and Mr. Webster were lately welcomed on their respective visits to the East and the West . Mr. Irving , since his late return from Europe , has been the object of more attention of a public kind , than was shown through the whole course of his life to Sir WTher Scott , undoubtedly the most popular British writer of the last century . This respect for intellectual power , which forms so remark-* able a feature in the national character , ought not to have escaped the attention of a traveller , whose pretensions to notice axe founded entirely upon that basis , and who had experienced // the operation of it so favorably in his own person . It has often been evinced , in a very pleasing way , in the testimonials of regard shown to the memory of distinguished literary men , even of foreign countries . At the late lamented decease of the illustrious British poet , just alluded to , the public feeling of regret was evidently quite as strong in this country as in England . Subscriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of Abbotsford for his family : and a monument to his memory is now in preparation at Albany . We regret to learn that the object , in which the New York subscriptions were intended to aid , is not likely to be effected . The marble tablet that covers the remains of Henry Kirke White , in the churchyard of Nottingham in England , was placed there by a gentleman of this city , no otherwise interested in his memory , than by the pleasure he had taken in reading his poems . The same disposition to honor the memory of the illustrious dead exists in England , but has not in every instance been acted upon in an equally graceful and appropriate manner . The intention , entertained by some of the citizens of London to erect a new monument to Milton , on the occasion of repairing the church of St. Giles , where his remains were deposited , led to a transaction which does but little credit to the parties concerned . The folloxving account of it was copied from the Diary of General Murray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24th August , 1790. - The church of St. Giles , Cripplegate , being in a somewhat dilapidated state , the parish resolved to commence repairing it , and this was deemed a favorable opportunity to raise a subscription for the purpose of erecting a monument to the memory of our immortal bard , Milton , who , it was known , had been buried in this church . The parish register book bore the following entry - " 12th November , 1674 , John Milton , gentleman , consump'con , chancell . " Mr. Ascough , whose grandfather died in 1759 , aged 84 , had been often heard to say , that Milton was buried under the desk in the chancel . Messrs . Strong , Cole , and other parishioners , determined to search for the remains , and orders were given to the workmen , on the first of this month , to dig for the coffin . On the third , in the afternoon , it was discovered ; the soil in which it had been deposited was of a calcareous nature , and it rested upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Milton 's father , // report having stated that the poet was buried , at his request , near the remains of his parent ; and the same register book contained the entry , " John Milton , gentleman , 15th March , 1646 . " No other coffin being found in the chancel , which was entirely dug over , there can be no uncertainty as to their identity . Messrs . Strong and Cole , having carefully cleansed the coffin with a brush , and wet sponge , ascertained that the exterior wooden case , in which the leaden one had been enclosed , was entirely mouldered away , and the leaden coffin contained no inscription or date . At the period when Milton died , it was customary to paint the name , age , &amp;c. of the deceased , on the wooden covering , no plates or inscription being then in use ; but all had long since crumbled into dust . The leaden coffin was much corroded ; its length was five feet ten inches . The above gentlemen , satisfied as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement to that effect , gave orders on Tuesday* the 3d , to the workmen to fill up the grave ; but they neglected to do so , intending to perform that labor on the Saturday following . On the next day , the 4th , a party of parishioners , Messrs . Cole , Laming , Taylor , and Holmes , having met to dine at the residence of Mr. Fountain , the overseer , the discovery of Milton 's remains became the subject of conversation , and it was agreed upon that they should disinter the body , and examine it more minutely. - At eight o'clock at night , heated with drink , and accompanied by a man named Hawksworth , who carried a flambeau , they sallied forth , and proceeded to the Church . The sacrilegious work now commences . The coffin is dragged from its gloomy resting-place . Holmes made use of a mallet and chisel , and cut open the coffin slantways from the head to the breast . The lead being doubled up , the corpse became visible ; it was enveloped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly , but the instant the shroud was removed they fell . The features of the countenance could not be traced , but the hair was in an astonishingly perfect state ; its color a light brown , its length six inches and a half and , although somewhat clotted , it appeared , after having been well washed , as strong as the hair of a living being . The short locks growing towards the forehead , and the long ones flowing from the same place down the sides of the face , it became obvious that these were most certainly the remains of Milton . The 4to print of the poet , by Fmiithorne , taken from life in 1670 , four years before he died , represents him as wearing his hair exactly in the above manner . Fountain said he was determined to have two of the teeth , but as they resisted the pressure of his fingers , he struck the jaw with a paving stone // and several teeth then fell out . There were only five in the upper jaw , and these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower jaw were seized upon by Taylor , Hawkesworth , and the sexton 's man . The hair , which had been carefully combed and tied together before the interment , was forcibly pulled off the skull by Taylor and another ; but Ellis the player , who had now joined the party , told the former that being a good hairworker , if he would let him have it he would pay a guinea bowl of punch ; adding , that such a relic would be of great service , by bringing his name into notice . Ellis , therefore , became possessed of all the hair : he likewise took a part of the shroud , and a bit of the skin of the skull ; indeed , he was only prevented carrying off the head by the sextons , iloppy and Grant , who said that they intended to exhibit the remains , which was afterwards done , each person paying 6d. to view the body . These fellows , I am told , gained near 1001. by the exhibition . Laming put one of the leg bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Thornton , that while the work of profanation was proceeding , the gibes and jokes of these vulgar fellows made his heart sick , and he retreated from the scene , feeling as if he had witnessed the repast of a vampire . Viscount C. who sat near me , said to Sir G. , " This reminds me of the words of one of the Fathers of the Church , and little boys have played with the bones of great kings. * In the elegant Latin epistle , which the minstrel of Paradise Lost addressed to his father in defence of his devotion to poetry , he ventures to anticipate , with the modest assurance of conscious merit , the posthumous honors that awaited his memory . - My features too , ' he says , the sculptor may perhaps one day design in marble , entwining the hair with a garland of Paphian myrtle or Parnassian laurel ; hut I shall be resting at the time in careless peace . Forsitan et nostros ducat de marmore vultus , Nectens aut Paphi&amp; myrti ant Parnasside lauri Fronde comas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of posthumous fame has been fully realized . His bust in marble surmounts his monument in Westminster abbey , upon which these beautiful verses appear as an inscription . The prediction of the undisturbed quiet of his last resting-place was , it seems , less fortunate . If we were disposed to retort upon the countrymen of our author the // charges of cupidity , coarseness and utter destitution of all the finer feelings of our nature , which he so liberally makes upon us , we should want no better evidence in support of them , as far at least as a single transaction may he supposed to illustrate the character of a nation , than the fact of the citizens of the metropolis itself invading by night the sanctuary where the bones of Milton were deposited with those of his honored parent , dragging them forth from their consecrated restingplace , breaking the jaw-bones to fragments with paving-stones , pulling off the hair by force from the skull , alternately quarrelling and joking about the division of the spoil , and finally exhibiting the whole to the public for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our author as a brutal barbarian , for venturing to look at him a little too sharply , we should like to know what epithets he would bestow upon the overseer and other parishioners of St. Giles , Cripplegate . We have no inclination , however , to pursue this line of argument , and are fully aware that this disgraceful transaction is in no way connected with the national character , and proves nothing but the brutality of the wretches immediately concerned in it . We have copied it , not as bearing at all upon the present question , but as a narrative , in itself very curious , and fraught with a deep and strong , though painfid sort of interest . While we have no disposition to recriminate upon our author by charging his countrymen with the base propensities which he attributes to us , it is also not our intention to enter into a formal defence of the common English character against the objections which he makes to it , as exemplified here , and which have been , as we have said , reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most offensive and at the same time the most groundless of them , is that of a want of generous and benevolent feelings , founded apparently upon a supposed reserve in exterior deportment ,  --   - -  as if a remarkable outward warmth and vivacity of manner were the natural indications of profound sensibility . Every one knows that the case is directly the reverse . The substantial benevolence of the English character , unquestionably one of its most remarkable features , displays itself here , as in the mother country , not in professions , or forms of courtesy , but in acts . There is probably nocommunity on the face of the globe , of equal resources , // where larger appropriations are annually made for objects tending to the relief of distress ,  --  -  --  the promotion of learning and good morals ,  --  -  --  the encouragement of patriotic and generous feelings , and in general for all purposes , appertaining to the higher department of our nature , than in New England . If it were worth while to go into any discussion upon the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stated , the proceedings of this description that have taken place in this city during the last year . In the course of the last winter , the project , which had been formed two or three years ago for the foundation of an institution for the Education of the Blind , came to maturity . The plan was submitted to the Legislature of Massachusetts , which made a handsome appropriation to the object . An appeal was then made to the benevolence of individuals , which was promptly answered , by the donation from an eminent citizen of his own residence ,  --  one of the best houses in the city ,  --  for the use of the Institution , on the condition that the sum of fifty thousand dollars should be contributed by ' other individuals ,  --  a condition which was satisfied within a month . Of this large sum , more than eleven thousand dollars were raised at the Fancy Fair , held by the ladies ; and it is really worthy of remark , that a much larger sum was obtained in this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , than at a similar Fair , held about the same time at London , for the interesting purpose of the relief of distressed foreigners , under the immediate patronage of the ladies of the Royal Family , and all the principal nobility . Hardly was the subscription for the Institution for the Education of the Blind closed , when a new effort was made to obtain funds for the erection of the monument on Bunker-Hill , and within a few weeks nearly fifty thousand dollars were collected for this purpose , principally by the exertions of the mechanics . While these movements were in progress , a collection of three or four thousand dollars was made for the relief of a college in the State of Ohio ,  --  another of the same amount for the Colonization Society , and several more of less importance , beside the regular and standing appropriations for literary , charitable and missionary institutions , previously in existence . Such is the extent of the sacrifices made for these purposes , during the present year : we mention them not as extraordinary , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average amount annually contributed in the same way , but simply as the facts nearest at hand that hear upon the question . The amount is certainly considerable for a community , of which the population , including that of the neighboring towns that generally join in such contributions , does not exceed a hundred thousand souls . The truth is , that our author has entirely mistaken the basis of the New England character , when he states that a selfish and calculating spirit is the leading feature in it . The New England character , like the English and German , which are different varieties of the same common type , is naturally ardent , enthusiastic and imaginative . The German race , which has spread itself over the whole north of Europe , and is now spreading itself over the whole of North America , has always exhibited in all its various locatious , and under all the names which it has borne and still bears in different parts of the world , a highly poetical temperament , the basis of which is , of course , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical or moral . We find , accordingly , that Madame de Sta*A , in her powerful analysis of the German character , considers its leading and characteristic feature as Enthusiasm ; agreeing in this opinion with the common sentiment of competent judges . Restrained in some degree in its development ,  - -  so far as the forms of ordinary social intercourse are concerned ,  --  by the natural effect of a less propitious climate , the ardor of the German temperament has turned itself chiefly to literature and action . While the manners of the nations of the south of Europe are more lively than those of their northern neighbors , the literature of the north is , on the other hand , more poetical , and the moral tone of society more lofty and generous . Count Pecchio , whom we just now quoted , has correctly seized this idea , and has expressed it in a happy manner with immediate reference to England . A variety ofcircumstances , ' lie remarks , tend to repress the passions on frivolous occasions , and to give them the reins on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in every day discussion , they ( the English ) exhibit calmness , coolness , deliberation ,  - -  in great enterprises , in war , in the perils of the country , conrage and enthusiasm . The same Englishman , who hardly returns your salute , and who sits at table with you , // like a Chinese image , in the day of battle , or in the heat of a contested election , gives himself up to unbounded enthusiasm . Where is the enterprise , by which glory may be gained , that the Englishman does not engage in , heart and soul ? Mungo Park plunges alone into the deserts of Africa : unintimidated by the mistake of his first journey , he risks a second , and perishes . Captain Cochrane returns on foot from Kamtchatka to Petersburgh , a distance of six thousand miles , alone and unfriended , as if it had been a walk in Hyde Park : he goes to America to take another stroll across the Cordilleras , and dies . Lord Byron abandons the sweet converse of the muses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a foreign soil , in defence of the freedom of a foreign land . Read the life of Sir Robert Wilson , and you will see how many perils he has voluntarily encountered in the cause of the oppressed , whether kings , nations , or individuals . Any of these men , who showed in these cases an enthusiasm worthy of a knighterrant , would have disdained in social life to be guilty of an act of impatience , even to a servant. * So far as New England is concerned , the history of the country , from its settlement up to the present day , is little else than a record of the continual sacrifice of every selfish con. * consideration to the loftiest moral principles that can operate upon the human mind . The foundation of the New England Colonies was an act of heroic self-sacrifice on the altar of Religion . So was the whole existence of the pilgrims for the first century and a half , encamped as they were , in a still unsubdued wilderness , with their muskets forever at their sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Indian with his fire-brand and tomahawk at the back-door . Was this a position to be taken and sustained by men who acted upon selfish calculations of pecuniary profit ? See them in the war of 1745 , marching out under Sir William Pepperel to the conquest of Louisburg . Was this an act of selfish calculation ? What had they to do with the fortress of Louisburg , or with the Austrian succession , which furnished the pretext for the war ? See them in the war of 1756 , rushing forward a second time with a sort of enthusiasm upon the same gratuitous service , and actually keeping on foot a larger proportion of their population than the Eh7nperor Napoleon ever did of the French , at the height of his military frenzy . The peace of 176* finally relieved our // fathers from the dangerous neighborhood of the Indians and the French , but only to expose them to another series of hostile invasions from the Government itself . What was how the dictate of selfish calculation ? Undoubtedly to pay the tea and stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole conduct , from the close of the war of 1756 until the peace of Independence , was another exhibition of the same heroic self-sacrificing spirit , which occasioned the settlement of the country . Nor was it the peculiar virtue of a few superior minds . The Adamses , the Otises , the Warrens and the Quincys embodied and exemplified the ' spirit that prevailed through the country , and carried the whole population with them at every step in their progress . Our author 's view of the New England character is , in fact , the very reverse of the truth . Instead of being governed by an exclusive devotion to gain , these Colonies are almost the only ones in the whole number , that were not founded with a view to pecuniary profit or any secular advantage . Most of the other settlements were made with the direct , avowed , and undoubtedly very honorable purpose of acquiring property . With the pilgrim fathers of New England , the service of God , as they understood it , was the exclusive principle of action ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the memorable saying of a profound writer , that no state has ever flourished , of which the foundations were not , in one way or another , laid in Religion . " That the foundations of the New England Colonies were so laid , has been the real source , not only of their unparalleled prosperity , but in a great measure of the prosperity of the whole country , which has always received , and still receives , its principal impulse from this quarter . How far the noble principles and sentiments , that uniformly actua-* ted our fathers , are sustained in the present generation of the inhabitants of New England , it is of course not for us to say : but as our author extends his censure over the whole period of our history , and specifically includes in it the venerable founders of the Colonies , it is quite apparent that his opinion , at least , is entitled to very little attention ; and that he is incapacitated , either by ignorance of facts or obliquity of moral feeling , from forming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn into a somewhat longer dissertation upon this topic than we had intended , and must // hasten to take up the few others , upon which our limits will allow us to touch . In giving an account of his visit to Washington , our author comments at some length upon the character and manners of the principal persons employed in the various departments of the Government , upon the modes of proceeding in Congress , and upon the general principles and operation of our political institutions . As the work was avowedly written for political effect , it is here , of course , if any where , that we are to look for the substantial part of it . We regret to say , that this portion has no more pretension than the rest to the praise of either accurate observation , just and deep thought , or the manly candor and generosity of sentiment , which are never forgotten even by a political opponent , who means to combine with that character the manners and feelings of a gentleman . The strain of thought is common-place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements so entirely at variance with fact , as to become at times almost ludicrous . Of this description is the attempt to make it appear that the British Parliament is a body compelled by pressure of business to be economical of time , while the American Congress does nothing , and has in fact very little to do . It is evident that such a style of discussion ,  --  if discussion it can be called ,  --  could only become prevalent in an assembly with an abundance of leisure for the enactment of these oratorical interludes . In a body like the British Parliament , compelled by the pressure of business to be economical of time , it could not possibly be tolerated . The clamorous interests of a great nation are matters too serious to be trifled with , , and time is felt to be too valuable for expenditure on speeches better fitted for a spouting club , than a grave , deliberative assembly . The truth , I believe , is , that the American Congress have really very little to do . All the multiplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State goverameilts , and the regulation of commerce and foreign intercourse practically includes all the ' important questions which they are called on to decide . ' It is a matter of curiosity , to compare with this account the real state of the case . In England , as our author says himself in another passage , the actual business of legislation is done by the Executive department of the Government . There are no standing committees of Parliament , and , as a // general rule , the ministers prepare all the bills . At the time when our author wrote his book , the House of Commons met every day during the session at 4 o'clock , P. M. If a quorum ( forty members ) was not present when the Speaker took the chair ,  --  a frequent occurrence ,  --  the sitting was immediately adjourned , and the whole day was lost . If a quorum happened to be present , the House remained in session two or three hours , and transacted business commonly with a very thin attendance . A few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important political question was to be discussed , there was a call of the House , and a pretty general attendance of the members .. On these occasions , the debates were sometimes prolonged through the night , and now and then , though very rarely , adjourned to a following one . Special Committees were from time to time appointed to examine and report upon particular subjects , and it is only in this form , that any part of the business of legislation was done by either House of Parliament in Committee . So much for the pressure of business and the economy of time in the i3ritish Parliament . Let us now see how matters stand in this country . Here , no part of the work of legislation is performed by the Executive . The business is distributed at the commencement of a session of Congress among a variety of standing committees of the two Houses , who regularly prepare all The bills . These committees commonly meet every day at ten o'clock , and remain in session till twelve . At that hour the sitting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , the members are all in attendance . They regularly remain together till four ; and towards the close of the session , when business becomes pressing , they return and sit several hours in the evening . The result is , that while in England the real work of legislation is done by the Ministry , and the actual labor of Parliament reduces itself to the attendance of from forty to fifty members two or three hours a day , for the purpose of registering without debate the bills presented to them ; in this country the whole work of legislation is done by Congress ; the members are regularly all in attendance , and are actually engaged in the despatch of business in one form or another , about six hours a day through the session . Our author 's mistakes on this head are the more palpable , inasmuch as the points of comparison between the course of proceeding in England and in this country , to which we have adverted , are all particularly // noted in other passages by himself . It is also worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was preparing his work , the British house of Commons reformed its mode of transacting business , and adopted the American usage of meeting every day at twelve o'clock . This is doubtless one of the instances alluded to with so much bitterness by the author in his preface , in which We institutions and experience of the United States were deliberately quoted by certain drivellers in the Reformed Parliament as affording safe precedents for British legislation , ' and which were the means of securing to the world the mass of valuable information and elegant language , contained in the work before us . Our author comments at considerable length upon the style of eloquence that prevails in Congress , of which he appears to entertain a very unfavorable opinion . After this follow some particular observations on the manner of Mr. Randolph , and a long analysis of a speech made by a Mr. Tristram Burges of Rhode Island , in reply to Mr. Cainbreleng . The a Mr. Burges , ' is rather comic , and brings to mind the one John Milton ' of Whitelocke . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leading member of Congress , is a person , one would think , of at least as much consequence as the author of a second-rate novel . The analysis of his speech is written in a style of gross and vulgar virulence , not often to be met with in the most licentious newspapers . Will it be believed , that the leading topics of ridicule are the changes in his personal appearance , incident to advancing years ? The orator commenced upon gray hair , and logically drew the conclusion , that , as such discoloration was the natural consequence of advanced years , any disrespectful allusion to the effect , implied contempt for the cause . Now , among every people in the world , Mahometan or Christian , civilized or barbarous , old age was treated with reverence . Even on the authority of Scripture , we are entitled to assert , that the gray head should be regarded as a crown of honor . All men must become old , unless they die young ; and every member of this House must reckon on submitting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on for about a quarter of an hour . Having said all that human ingenuity could devise about gray hair , next came bald heads ; and here the orator , with laudable candor , proceeded to admit that baldness might , in one sense , be considered a defect . Nature had apparently intended that // the human cranium should be covered with hair , and there was no denying that the integument was both useful and ornamental . I am not sure whether , at this stage of the argument , Mr. Burges took advantage of the opportunity of impressing the House with a due sense of the virtues of bear 's grease and macassar oil . I certainly remember anticipating an episode on nighteaps and Welsh wigs , but , on these , the orator was unaccountably silent . He duly informed the House , however , that many of the greatest heroes and philosophers could boast little covering on their upper region . Aristotle was bald , and so was Julius Ca*sar , &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c . It was not till the subject of baldness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unprofitable , that the audience were introduced to the vulture , who was kept so long hovering over the head of Mr. Burges 's opponent , that one only felt anxious that he should make his pounce and have done with it . Altogether , to give the vulture-like the devil-his due , he was a very quiet bird , and more formidable from the offensive nature of his droppings , than any danger to be apprehended from his beak or claws . In truth , he did seem to be somewhat scurvily treated by the orator , who , after keeping him fluttering about the hall for some three hours , at last rather unceremoniously disclaimed all connexion with him , and announced that he-Mr . Burgeswas " an eagle soaring in his pride of place , and , therefore , not by a moping owl to be hawked at , and killed ! " This was too much for gravity ; but , luckily , the day 's oration had reached its termination , and the House broke up in a state of greater exhilaration , than could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infliction . ' Whatever may be thought of the eloquence of Mr. Burges , it will hardly be doubted by any one who has read the above extract , that our author is a most acute and especially candid and liberal critic . No wonder , that with so exquisite a sensibility to the proprieties and delicacies of social intercourse , he should claim the character of an arbiter of elegance , and undertake to sit in judgment upon the shadowy differences ' between the forms of civilization in the various regions of Christendom . What unpardonable sin the distinguished Representative of Rhode Island has committed , that has drawn down upon him this tremendous visitation , ( which of course he can not hope to survive ) we are not informed . Probably the head and front of his offending is , that he has the misfortune to differ in opinion from the author of Cyril Thornton upon the question of the expediency of a legislative protec // tion for domestic industry . Mr. Cambreleng , on the other hand , by happening to agree with him upon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman of great talent , and decidedly the first political economist in the country . ' The remarks on the character and eloquence of Mr. Webster , though strongly tinged with the silly affectation in style to which we have adverted , are conceived in a better spirit , as regards the subject , and we extract them with pleasure , as one of the few passages that do some credit to the discernment and feelings of the author . The person , however , who has succeeded in rivetting most strongly the attention of the whole Union , is undoubtedly Mr. Webster . From the Gulf of St. Lawrence to that of Mexico , from Cape Sable to Lake Superior , his name has become , as it were , a household word . Many disapprove his politics , but none deny his great talents , his unrivalled fertility of argument , or his power , even still more remarkable , of rapid and comprehensive induction . In short , it is universally believed by his countrymen , that Mr. Webster is a great man ; and in this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *r . Webster is a man of whom any country might well be proud . His knowledge is at once extensive and minute , his intellectual resources very great ; and , whatever may be the subject of discussion , he is sure to shed on it the light of an active , acute , and powerful mind . I confess , however , I did meet Mr. Webster under the influence of some prejudice . From the very day of my arrival in the United States , I had been made involuntarily familiar with his name and pretensions . Gentlemen sent me his speeches to read . When 1 talked of visiting Boston , the observation urnformly followed , " Ah ! there you will see Mr. Webster . " When I reached Boston , I encountered condolence on all hands . " You are very unfortunate , " said my friends , " Mr. Webster set out yesterday for Washington . " Whenever , at Philadelphia and Baltimore , it became known that I had visited Boston , the question , " Did you see Mr. Webster ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seasons . The result of all this was , that the name of Webster became invested in my ear with an adventitious cacophony . It is not pleasant to admire upon compulsion , and the very pre-eminence of this gentleman had been converted into something of a bore . To Washington , however , I came , armed with letters to the unconscious source of my annoyance . The first night of my arrival I met him at a ball . A dozen people pointed him out to // my observation , and the first glance rivetted my attention . I had never seen any countenance more expressive of intellectual power . The forehead of Mr. Webster is high , broad , and advancing . The cavity beneath the eyebrow is remarkably large . The eye is deeply set , but full , dark , and penetrating in the highest degree ; the nose prominent , and well defined ; the mouth marked by that rigid compression of the lips by which the New Eng .. landers are distinguished . When Mr. Webster 's countenance is in repose , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation it lightens up ; and when he smiles , the whole impression it communicates is at once changed . His voice is clear , sharp , and firm , without much variety of modulation ; but when animated , it rings on the ear like a clarion . As an orator , I should imagine Mr. Webster 's f'orte to lie in the department of pure reason . I can not conceive his even attempting an appeal to the feelings . It could not be successful ; and he has too much knowledge of his own powers to encounter failure . In debate his very countenance must tell . Few men would hazard a voluntary sophism under the glance of that eye , so cold , so keen , so penetrating , so expressive of intellectual power . A single look would be enough to wither up a whole volume of bad logic . In the Senate , I had , unfortunately , no opportunity of hearing Mr. Webster display his great powers as a debater . During my stay , the subjects on which he happened to speak were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered several legal arguments , which certainly struck me as admirable , both in regard to matter and manner . The latter was neither vehement nor subdued . It was the manner of conscious power , tranquil and self-possessed . Mr. Webster may be at once acquitted of all participation in the besetting sins of the orators of his age and country . I even doubt , whether , in any single instance , he can be fairly charged with having uttered a sentence of mere declamation . His speeches have nothing about them of gaudiness and glitter . Words with him are instruments , not ends ; the vehicles , not of sound merely , but of sense and reason . He utters no periods full of noise and fury , like the voice of an idiot , signifying-nothing ; and it certainly exhibits proof that the taste of the Americans is not yet irretrievably depraved , when an orator like Mr. Webster , who despises all the stale and petty trickery of his art , is called by acclamation to the first place . In conversation , Mr. Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he mingles with his friends , to cast // 1834 . Men and Manners in America . off the trammels of weighty cogitation , and merge the lawyer and the statesman in the companion ;  --  a more pleasant and instructive one I have rarely known in any country . As a politician , the opinions of Mr. Webster are remarkably free from intolerance . His knowledge is both accurate and extensive . He is one of the few men in America who understand the British Constitution , not as a mere abstract system of laws and institutions , but in its true form and pressure , as it works and acts upon the people , modified by a thousand influences , of which his countrymen in general know nothing . ' The censures , bestowed by our author upon the style of speaking which prevails in Congress , though ridiculously exaggerated , have some foundation in truth . While the leading orators in both Houses are quite equal or perhaps superior to the first in the British Parliament , the average is a good deal lower ; in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good , precisely because there is a greater amount of speaking in proportion to the business done . In England , the debate on general questions is commonly left to some two or three of the leading members on each side . The others reserve themselves for local and particular questions , upon which they are particularly informed . Here , on the contrary , when a great question comes up , every gentleman , who can speak at all , seems to think it necessary to declare his opinion at length . The reasons for this difference are sufficiently obvious , but it is equally so , that the British practice is more favorable to a prompt and intelligent despatch of business . In connexion with the account of his visit to Washington , and in two or three other passages of his work , our author comments at some length , as we have already remarked , upon the principles and operation of the political institutions of the coun- try . His conclusions are all unfavorable , but as the premises from which they are drawn are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have thought it necessary to write a new book , for the purpose of bringing before the British public political views , which may be found about as well stated in every newspaper and review . His theory is , that a purely popular government is impracticable , especially one that involves the principle of universal suffrage , and that this is the rock upon which we must finally split that we go along very well at present , while the population is // comparatively scanty , but that , when it becomes more denser the non-proprietors will take all the power into their own bands , abolish property , and throw the whole country int@ confusion . This result he considers not only as inevitable , but as not very distant , and as likely to occur within the period of the present or the next generation . As there is no novelty in these objections , so the answer which , as our author says , was made to them repeatedly by intelligent gentlemen with whom he conversed upon this subject , is : equally familiar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear up the doubts of the worthy traveller . The general answer is , ' he says , that the state of things which I have ventured to describe is very distant . It is enough for each generation to look to itself , and we leave it to our descendants some centuries hence , to take care of their interests , as we do of ours . We enjoy all manner of freedom and security under our present institutions , and really feel very little concern about the evils that may afflict our posterity . ' To us , we must confess ; this language appears to be conformable , not merely to practical good sense , but to the soundest and deepest theories of political science . The best government for every community is that which is best adapted to its actual condition , and if the one best adapted to its actual condition be also the one actually established and in operation , it would seem to he the height of madness to make complaint , or to wish for a change . Now it is fully admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one best adapted to the actual condition of the United States ; he goes farther even , and admits with emphasis ,  --  how consistently with many observations in other parts of the work , it is not for us to say ,  --  . * that if the present Constitution could be maintained , it would be the best of all possible governments . At present , the United States are perhaps more safe from revolutionary contention , than any other country in the world . But this safety Consists in one circumstance alone . The great majority of the people are possessed of property : have what is called a stake in the hedge ; and are therefore by interest opposed to all measures , which may tend to its insecurity . It is forsuch a condition of society that the present Constitution was framed ; and could this great bulwark of government be considered as permanent as it is effective , there could be no assignable limit to the prosperity af a people , so favored. ' // The result is , then , upon the statements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation in this country the form of government which , abstractly considered , is the best of all possible forms , and which is at the same time the one best adapted to-our actual condition . Is not this enough ? It really seems to us , that a government , which can with truth be so described , is precisely the beau id*a4 upon which the patriot in every country should fix his eye as the perfect ,  --  though perhaps in his own case unattainable ,  --  model ; and that the country , in which it is actually established and in full operation , has nothing more in this respect to wish or hope . To obtain a form of government well adapted to their actual condition , and at the same time making some distant approach to those which appear most plausible in theory , has been h*eretofore the highest attainment of the most favored eommumties ,  --  we had almost said the limit *of their ambition . In our particular case , by an extraordinary concurrence of favorable circumstances , the best possible form of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , and , what is of still more importance , the one actually established . Such , we say , are the admissions of the author : and if this state of things do not satisfy him , we can only say that he is even more fastidious on the subject of political institutions , than he is on the higher matters of the mode of eating eggs and the tournure of the New York ladies . But , he says , this state of things can not last . An unfavorable change in the condition of the people is inevitable : the nonproprietors must in the course of time become the majority . What then ? Admit that all this is true : that a change in the condition of the people will have taken place before the year 2000 , and that a form of Government different from the one now established will he better adapted to that state of things , than the present one . Does it therefore follow , that we are now to destroy our present Qovernment and institute the other ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that the latter is better adapted to a different state of society , it is of course not so well adapted to the existing one ? Suppose that it were supernaturally revealed to a person , standing firmly on both his legs at the age of twenty-one , that at the age of fifty he would fracture one of them and he obliged to have it amputated . He would no doubt regard this // as a misfortune , but would he , as a prudent man , undertake to remedy the evil by sending for a surgeon and having one of his limbs amputated immediately ? Would he act wisely to deprive himself of the use of a sound leg forthirty years , because a wooden one might after a certain period he better adapted to the existing state of his body , than one of his natural ones ? This is a correct illustration of the course which appears to be recommended hy our author , and which we certainly consider as most extraordinary . If we are destined to suffer an unfavorable change in our condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we or our descendants must meet it , as we or they best may . In the mean time , we are well , and very well . Policy , duty , common sense demand of us to let very well alone . If , as our author affirms , the present Government of the United States he in theory the best of all possible systems , and be also the one best adapted to our present condition , it is of course absolutely and in all respects the best we could now have , whatever changes in it may hereafter be rendered necessary or expedient by changes in the state of the country . But , after all , how does it appear that the threatened unfavorable change in the state of the country is so inevitable as our author appears to suppose ? In this , as in many other cases , the worthy traveller , who is a little addicted to delivering oracles ex catltedrei , has not condescended to give us very explicitly the reasons on which he founds his opinion . He tells us merely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twentyfive years ; that at this rate it will amount in half a century to fifty millions ; that before that period , it is very certazn that the pressure of the population on the means of subsistence , especially in the Atlantic States , will he great : that the price of labor will have fallen , while that of the necessaries of life must be prodigiously enhanced ; that the poorer and more suffering class will want the means of emigrating to a distant region of unoccupied territory ; that poverty and misery will be abroad , and that the great majority of the people will be without property of any kind , except the thews and sinews with which God has endowed them . ' Why or how all this is so very certain , he does not say , and as the burden of proof rests upon himself , he has of course failed in sustaining his position . This is all which , for the purpose of refuting his theory , // it would be necessary for us to add upon the subject . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all possible Governments , and substitute a confessedly inferior one , he is bound , not merely to assert , but to prove to us , that the change in our condition , which would , according to him , render such a proceeding expedient , is likely to occur . We may add , however , that his conclusions as to the probable state of things half a century hence ,  --  however certain he may think them , - are directly in the teeth of the experience of the last two centuries . During that time , population has regularly advanced at a rate on the average considerably more rapid than the one he states as probable in future , but is so far from pressing on the means of subsistence , that the necessaries and comforts of life were never so abundant as they are at this moment ,  --  that the price of labor never was so high ; - that emigration is checked , not because the poorer classes want the means of emigrating , but because their labor is in such demand that they are under no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly known ;  --  and that the majority of the people are all ,  --  as he himself says ,  --  in possession of more or less property . Why this is so , is just as evident as the fact is certain . The progress of population naturally brings with it the division of labor and the improved methods of applying it , which of course render it more productive , and reward the laborer with a greater amount of the necessaries and comforts of life . No sufficient or even plausible reason can be given , why the same process should not continue for the two next centuries , that has been going on for the two last . The history of what is , as a French writer justly remarks , is the history of what has been and of what is to be . For ourselves , we are quite as confident as our author professes himself to be of the contrary , that so far as the progress of population alone is concerned , and leaving out of view all other circumstances , the changes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be for the better , and not for the worse : that for this and the two next centuries , the comforts and necessaries of life will be more abundant , in proportion to the numbers of the people , than they are now ;  --  the price of labor higher ; - emigration less considerable ; - poverty and misery less frequent ;  --  and the majority of the people better off in the way of property . Whether other circumstances of an unfavorable character may not occur during that period , that will counteract // wholly or in part these results , is a different question , and one which we need not examine for the purpose of the present argument , since our author rests his case entirely on the supposed unfavorable effect of the single cause , to which we have alluded . The views of our author , upon the general principles of the political institutions of the United States , are therefore entirely baseless and extravagant . His observations on particular points are hardly more correct , nor would it be easy to reconcile either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are respectively contained . After pronouncing , as we have seen , cx cathedral , that the Constitution is perfect , if it would only last , he finds , on examining the several parts in detail , hardly any thing to approve . The principle of elective magistracies is bad ;  --  the shortness of the time for which the President is chosen is bad ;  --  the exclusion of the Cabinet Secretaries from Congress is bad ; - and , to pass over other minor points , in the opinion of this most intelligent and judicious observer , the Union of the States is bad ! ! ! The experiment of periodically electing the chief officer of the Commonwealth has been tried and failed . While confessing the grossness of the failure , many Americans would willingly attribute it to the injudicious provisions for the collection of the national suffrage . ' This interesting piece of information is ,  --  as the newspapers say ,  --  ' important if true . ' We had hitherto supposed , in the simplicity of our hearts , that the chief officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most of the States annually , in some every three or four years , and for the United States at large every four years , in such a way that the affair , instead of being a gross and acknowledged failure , ' had passed off on the whole to the general satisfaction . Within the limited compass of our observation , we have never happened to meet with an individual who wished the present system to be changed , or with any publication , recommending a mode of designating a chief magistrate , other than that of popular election . So far as the office of President of the United States is concerned , which our author appears to have had particularly in view , we had supposed it to be generally acknowledged , not that the experiment had failed , but that it had succeeded a good deal better than perhaps could reasonably have been expected . Of the seven Presidents , who have // been elected under it , the six first , viz : Washington , the two Adamses , Jefferson , Madison and Monroe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of qualifications for the offlce ,  --  were all , by general acknowledgment , among the most eminent and best qualified persons in the country . Mr. Mon .. roe , the least conspicuous of the number , is yet spoken of by our author , deservedly , in very handsome terms , and was as much superior to the hereditary rulers of the ordi* nary European standard , as Washington was to him . As to the qualifications of the present incumbent , which are still the subject of party controversy , there would no doubt be a difference of opinion . A large and respectable portion of the citiz ens who opposed his election would probably say , that in his case the system has in fact failed . But were this even admitted , it might still be pertinently asked , whether any system can be expected to produce the best possible results oftener than six times out of seven . On the other hand , the large majority of the citizens who elected General Jackson , look upon him as the very Phrnix of Presidents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , we should have supposed that he inclined to this opinion . He certainly , if his account may be believed , retired from the interview he had with General Jackson , with sentiments of very sincere respect for the intellectual and moral qualities of the American President . ' We doubt whether he could have said as much as this , of a majority of the hereditary rulers of Europe . Add to this , that in the innumerable instances in which the same system has been applied in the several States , it bas brought out , almost uniformly , men of great respectability ,  --  often the very first men in the country , such as Jefferson , Dewitt Clinton , and Jay ,  --  .. -. and in no one case , as far as we are informed , any person notoriously incapable . We can not hut think , that instead of having grossly failed , it must be regarded on the whole , as having in a remarkable manner succeeded . In fact , the capacity of the people at large to elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. tent judges , as one of the least questionable points in the theory of government . Montesquieu , at least as high an authority on a political question as the author of Cyril Thornton , tells us that the people are admirably well qualified to elect those who are to be entrusted with any portion of their power . If there were a doubt of this , we need only to recol // lect the continual succession of astonishing elections that were made by the Athenians and the Romans , which certainly can not be attributed to chance . ' * The history of the United States , so far as we have proceeded , will be regarded by future political philosophers , as furnishing another example , not less striking than those of Athens and Rome . While , in one part of his work , our author pronounces the Constitution to be the best of all possible governments , if it could but last , and in another finds fault with almost every important provision , he finally tells us in a third , with great frankness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dijilculty of understanding the Federal Constitution , is the running title of one of his pages , and in the text beneath it he remarks , that of the Federal Government it is difficult to speak with any precision , because it is difficult to ascertain with any precision the principles on which it is founded . ' If he had had the good sense to wait till he did understand it before he wrote upon it , he would have spared himself much trouble , and the world a very useless and mischievous book . in connexion with this remark , he introduces the opinion alluded to above , that the Union of the States is a bad thing , which he developes in a passage occupying two or three pages , under the running title of The Disadvantages of the Union . These supposed disadvantages appear to resolve themselves into this : that it is difficult for States , having different climates and productions ,  --  some growing cotton , rice , tobacco and sugar , and others wheat and maize , - some agr icultural , some manufacturing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to go along comfort- ' ably together under the same government as members of one body politic . It did not occur to the worthy traveller , that the precise circumstance , of a difference in productions and occupations , constitutes a unity instead of a diversity of inter- ' est ,  --  that the opposition of interest is between different persons engaged in the same occupations ,  --  and that for South Carolina and Massachusetts to quarrel because one raises cot- ' ton and the other manufactures it , would be , as the late Mr. Dexter very properly remarked , about as reasonable as for two persons of different sexes to quarrel about the difference in their physical conformation . But without undertaking to refute these crude objections , it may he sufficient to remark // that our author 's doubts about the advantages of the Union afford the strongest proof , which he could possibly have given , how little he in fact understands the Federal Constitution or any of the political institutions of the country . To those who possess any tolerably correct notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great idea of the Union of the States is , in substance , the whole Federal Constitution : - the particulars , excepting so far as they affect the existence or non-existence of this vital principle , are mere matters of form . Differences of opinion about the construction of the instrument , with the same exception , are comparatively unimportant . The right claimed by South Carolina to annul the Constitution and laws at discretion , comes , of course , within the exception , and has fortunately been put down by the unanimous acclamation of the whole country ; but , as to the other points upon which differences of opinion have existed , such as whether the General Government has or has not a right , under the Constitution , to establish a bank or a national uni versity , to lay out new roads and make other internal improvements , and so forth ,  --  the importance of their being decided in one way or another is like dust in a balance , compared with that of the great principle of the Constitution , a real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international concern . This is the prominent , all-important , we had almost said only important feature in our political institutions ; and it is therefore not to be wondered at that an observer , who considers the union as an evil , should be at a loss to understand the nature and operation of the Government . On this subject , as on the one to which we before alluded , the true doctrine- was explained to him in this country , but seems to have been lost upon him , although it is textually set down with great candor in his hook . He is of the class of persons foretold in Scripture , who , hearing , were to hear , but not understand , in answer to his crude and puerile objections to the policy of the Union , he was told at Washington by a distinguished member of the House of Representatives , in strong and rather coarse language , provoked probably by his impertinence , that the Union was necessary to prevent us from cutting each others ' throats . ' This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our author had possessed wit enough to comprehend the meaning of this brief oracle , which is yet not very obscure , he would have gone home a wiser man than he came , // and have written a much better book than he has done . The Union relieves our great and growing family of independent States from the curse of continual war , which has always desolated Europe , and secures to them , in actual reality , what has been often regarded as the golden dream of visionary speculators ,  --  PERPETUAL PEACE . This single advantage puts a new face upon the whole political condition of the country . The continual recurrence of wars with other neighboring states ,  --  the necessity of providing for them and carrying them on with efficiency ,  --  the consequences that naturally result from them ,  --  . are the causes , that have mainly determined the form of the government in every other nation of which we know the history . The preliminary establishment on this continent of the opposite principle of union and perpetual peace , not only prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only relieves us from the destruction of life and property incident to war ,  --  but enables us to simplify our political machinery , and to go along quietly and prosperously under institutions , which in a different state of things would be impracticable . It has been said by some indiscreet citizens , in the course of the late controversies , that the true motto of the patriot is Liberty first and Union afterwards , but the truth is , that the preliminary existence of the Union is the necessary condition of the liberty we enjoy . It is owing to the Union and the permanent internal peace consequent upon it , that we are able to combine a complete security for personal rights with an extensiQn of the sphere of individual action , and a contraction of that of government , greater than were ever imagined possible before . Abolish the Union ,  --  introduce ,  --   - -  what would necessarily follow ,  --  a system of permanent war among the States , instead of the existing one of permanent peace ,  --  and you introduce , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intolerable burdens , and the passive obedience , which regularly accompany the train of that great scourge of the human race . Universal suffrage ,  --  7-elective magistracies ,  -- representative assemblies , the liberty of speech , the press and public worship ,  --  trial by jury ,  --   - -  would of course disappear at once . We hold these , and all the other personal and political privileges of which we are so justly proud , simply and solely on the condition of maintaining the Union . The Union of the States is therefore the Alpha and Omega ,  --  the A. B. C. and X. Y. Z. --   --  the beginning , middle and ends // *  --  the all in all ,  --  of our political institutions . A writer , who professes to consider it as an evil , only shows that he has not obtained the most remote insight into their true principles and character . After mentioning the answer given to him by the distinguished Representative* as above quoted , he adds , that if the Union be as important as it appears to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it were more likely to endure ; ' and predicts , no doubt with great regret , that the eral Constitution , like other bubhles , is at any time liable to burst , when the world will discover that its external glitter covered nothing but wind . ' We are glad ,  --  so far as our humble judgment can be supposed to have any weight with so great a personage ,  --  to assure him that the Union is in no danger . The experience of the last year has done much to confirm the assurance of its long duration , which the soundest thinkers have always felt from a consideration of the circumstances of the country . The Federal Constitution is not , as our author supposes , a glittering bubble , covering nothing but wind , and liable to burst at any moment . It is the beautiful and well-proportioned form , belonging by nature to a living , substantial , powerful , active and healthy political body . To destroy it would be just about as practicable , as to tear off the integuments from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either case only be effected by the complete destruction of life . The States are not only formally and by compact , but naturally and substantially , ONE PEOPLE . They are , with slight and unimportant circumstances of exception ; one in their origin ; one by their geographical position and frequent relations ; one by their community of manners , language , laws and religion . These ,  --  whatever our author may think of it ,  --  are not airy nothings , like the wind that inflates a buhble , but substantial realities . They na*ura1iy carry with them the political unity of the communities among which they exist ; and what nature , * God ,  --  has united , man can not put asunder . It is not merely impolitic and inexpedient , but impossible permanently to separate the States . If , by any accidental convulsion , ( and such an event is hardly within the compass of contingencies , ) they should be temporarily separated , they would rush together again immediately , perhaps under a different form of union - with a wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union by ordinances and speeches in Convention ,  --  the paper bullets of the brain , '  - -  - is like launching // one of our author 's glittering bubbles in the face of a strong northeaster . Every new rail road ,  --   - -  every additional steamboat , as it takes up its long line of march down the mighty Mississippi ,  --  does more to strengthen the bonds of the Union , than all the speeches that have ever been made against it have done to weaken them . The very newspaper , in which such sentiments are contained , is itself an antidote to the poison it diffuses . But this is not the time nor the place for a full development of this interesting topic . Our readers are already as much fatigued with our observations upon our author , as we are with his upon the country , and it is necessary to bring them to a close . If there be anywhere an appearance of asperity in our language , we trust that it will be considered as fully justified by the extracts we have given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray hairs of Mr. Burges . We can not *conclude without repeating the expression of our regret , at this new example of narrow-mindedness , prejudice and malignity , in the judgments of British travellers upon this country . To every impartial observer , it is apparent that in the order of Providence a great work is in progress here , which is destined to figure hereafter in the rolls of history as one of the most remarkable achievements of the Genius of Civilization . A field has been opened , upon which the intelligence and refinement of a highly cultivated portion of our race may operate without the political restraints which have generally accompanied a great intellectual and moral improvement in the state of society . A numerous and continually increasingcluster of neighboring States have substituted , as the principle of their mutual relations , perpetual peace for perpetual war . The result of the concurrence of these auspicious circumstances has been almost magical . The whole continent is like a vast bee-hive , instinct throughout with life , motion and a joyous activity . Cities ,  --  empires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise justify the statement ) rise from the bosom of the earth like exhalations . The wilderness blossoms like the rose ; the very rocks and sandbanks ( witness Nantucket ,  --  . - witness all New England , ) pour forth products more rich and abundant , than any that ever came from the gold and diamond mines of Peru and Golconda . New forms of government , that had hitherto been regarded as the visions of philosophic dreamers , too beautiful to be ever // realized on this terrestrial sphere , are going on from year to year , in quiet and tranquil operation , in the full view of an astonished and admiring world . As a political power , the country has taken , at the outset of its course , its position among the leading States of Christendom ; and the imagination is daz .. zled in looking forward to its future probable destinies . Such are the scenes , which the Western continent now presents to the eye of the philosophic traveller . If there be any thing to equal them in moral magnificence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for it in vain . With prospects like these before them , it is painful ,  --  it is pitiful ,  --  to see a succession of observers , from the most thinking nation ' in Europe , coming out , professedly on purpose to examine men and manners , and incapable of seeing or feeling any thing but some trifling and generally accidental circumstance , that happens to interfere with their national prejudice or personal pride . The shopmen look too hardly at them ; - the merchants refuse to learn Sanscrit of them ; - their fellowboarders eat eggs in a way to which they are not accustomed ; - from all which it follows of course that the people are a race of brutal barbarians ,  --  that the Union of the States is a disadvantage ,  --  and the Constitution a glittering bubble . This is worse than the folly ofthe cobbler of Athens , who , when asked his opinion of a fine statue of Venus , which had just been exhibited , said that he had remarked nothing but a wrong stitch in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sage of Bolt Court , is the worst of all blockheads ; and truly the blockheads of the modern Athens appear to be determined not to yield the palm to their ancient prototypes . The apparent motive of all this misrepresentation is cveu more revolting and ridiculous than the thing itself . If t*ere be one among the achievements of the English natiou , of which , more than any other , they have a right to be justly proud , it is the foundation of the great English empire that is now growing up on the western side of the Atlantic : yet of all the European travellers , the English alone are incapable of looking with the least complacency upon their own work . Prince Talleyrand , Baron Humboldt , C1i*teaubriand , Voln*y , the Duke de la Rochefoucault were certainly as competent judges of men and manners ,  --  as well qualified to appreciate the value of political institutions ,  --   - -  as the Fauxes , the // Fearons and the Trollopes , or even the Halls and the Hamil .. tons . All these , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe , who have published their observations upon the United States ,  --  while they have pointed out , of course , what they regarded as objectionable ,  --  ap . pear to have received , on the whole , a favorable impression of the general aspect of society . But no sooner do the Chesterfields of Holborn and St. Giles ,  --  the British Talleyrands of the sentry-box and ward-room ,  --  set foot upon our soil , than it changes at once to a wild and barren waste , the abode of nothing hut rudeness , ignorance and barbarism . Let us hope , that after a while , and under happier auspices , some pilgrim from the mother country may arrive among us , with a view sufficiently expansive to take in the wonders of improvement that are here in progress ,  --  with a heart sufficiently English to rejoice in the achievements of Englishmen , without inquiring the degrees of latitude and longitude , or the year of grace in which they were performed ,  --  -  --  and with a pen powerful enough to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen , as the result of his observations , a work more interesting and instructive than the celebrated 6*ermany of Madame de StW . Some approach to this was looked for at the hands of our author , as a person of established literary reputation . How mis*rably the expectation has been baulked , our readers have seen . The failure , though , on many accounts much to be regretted , is a'far more serious misfortune to him than to us . Another better qualified knight-errant will achieve the adventure , and carry off the prze . Perhaps we may finally owe to the graceful genius of some English De Sta*l the justice , which the men of the mother country have hitherto denied us , and which the daughter of Necker was the first to render to our kinsmen of Germany . In the mean time , we are doing very well ,  --  have the world before us ,  --  -  --  and can afford to wait . When Cardinal Fleury was Prime Minister of France , at the age of eighty-five , a young nobleman requested something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momenta little out of humor , was not inclined to grant . Sir , ' said the Cardinal , you shall never obtain what you want during my life time. * Monseigneur , replied the other , j'a ( tcndrai . I will wait , i*ny Lord . '
