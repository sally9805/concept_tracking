PREFACE . This little volume contains the writings of a child whose originality and intellectual and moral beauty made her the wonder and the pride of her native village . It seeks not emolument  --  it seeks not praise  --  it invites not criticism . The friends and acquaintance of Miss Packard will cherish it as a memorial of the early promise and early blight of its lamented author . ' If it be aught toward the general good , Set honor in one eye , and death i ' the other , And I will look on both indifferently ; For , let the gods so speed me , as I love The name of honor more than I fear death . ' Shakspeare 's Julius Csar . NOTE . ' Debe contarse entre los hroes de esta provincia Constanza Cezelli , esposa de Barri , gobernador de Leucate , pequena ciudad del hajo Languedoc Durante la guerra de la liga , Barri fu hecho prisionero por los de este partido : estaba entouces su esposa en Montpeller , instruida de la des gracia de su marido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donde reauima la guarnicion , y preparo la defensa mas vigorosa . Los de la liga y los Espanoles la atacan ; pero ella los rechaza , y los sitidores irritados de tan inopinada resistencia , lavantan delante de la muralla un cadalso , y presentando en l Barri , intiman Constanza la muerte de su marido si no entrega la plaza . Ella , en tam cruel alternativa , ofrece todos susbienes , y aun su misma persona , por la libertad de su marido , diciendo los enemigos : " Mi fortuna y my vida son mias , y las sacrificare muy gustosa por mi esposa ; pero la ciudad la debo al rey , y mi honor Dios , y debo conservalos hasta mi ultimo suspiro . " Fu Barri sacrificado la firmeza de su esposa , la cual se vengo obligando los enemigos lavantar el sitio . Henrique IV . reconocido , hizo Constanza gobernadora de Leucate hasta mayoridad de su hijo Hercules . Esta sublime accion se verifico el ano de 1590. '  --  Note from Florian 's Estella , translated by D. Vincent Rodriguez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the heroes of this province , Constanza Cezelli , the wife of Barri , Governor of Leucate , a small city of Lower Languedoc . During the war of the League , Barri was made prisoner by those of this party ; his wife was then in Montpelier , but being informed of the misfortune of her husband , she embarked at Magalona , and came to Leucate , where she re-animated the garrison and prepared the most vigorous defence . Those of the League and the Spaniards attack her , but she repels them ; and the besiegers irritated by so unexpected a resistance , raise before the wall a scaffold , and presenting Barri on it , intimate to Constanza the death of her husband , if she deliver not up the place . She , in so cruel an alternative , offers all her wealth and even her own person for the liberty of her husband , saying to the enemy : ' My fortune and my life are mine , and I will sacrifice them joyfully for my husband ; but the city I owe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to preserve them to my last breath . ' Barri was sacrificed to the firmness of his wife , who revenged herself by obliging the enemies to raise the siege . Henry IV . being informed of this , made Constanza governess of Leucate , during the minority of her son Hercules . This noble action took place in the year 1590 . DRAMATIS PERSON .

Enter Le Comte , pacing the tent . Le Comte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , and still I linger here ? could I have thought or dreamt Of this , before my honor was engaged , As it is now , to finish ere I pause , Yon walls had never mocked me thus , nor I Had ever planted ' neath their fortresses My Holy Cross , which now I must support . Gerardo too ! that it has been for him , To win the only prize there has been won , Through this whole ill-starred , soul-corroding siege  --  That he shall take this Barri , when I 've owned , Even to himself have owned , that ' t was my wish , Next to subduing this eternal city , To make its master captive ;  --  so , at least , I might possess a trophy of the prowess Which I have wasted here , if nothing more .  --  Oh it is irksome even to think of it ! They say , too , that Constanza has returned , To act another Barri ;  --  and her words Have been a charm to turn the citizens ' fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove , Which is the most , Barri or woman , in her . I 've heard , indeed , uncommon shouts to-day , And cheers , like sounds of welcome or of joy . Well , let them shout ,  --  it will be my turn next ! It shall be ! By the Holy Mass , I 've borne My penance well ; but not the Pope himself , Should doom a third !  --  two months !  --  two stupid months Another month shall not behold me here ! Enter Gerardo . Gerardo ! Gerardo . Gerardo Wilt thou suffer me To interrupt thy musings with my words ? Le Comte . Le Comte Enter ! thou are a privileged visitor , Even my solitude is free for thee . ( Aside ) Or so thou mak'st it with thy liberties . But how goes the big world ? and soldiers hopes ? Sleeps yon vain dreamer yet ? Gerardo . Gerardo What meanest thou ? The city ? No ! it wakes ! aye , gloriously , As noble natures wake , when they have fallen A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Le Comte Dost thou confirm the rumor then that this Constanza has returned ? Gerardo . Gerardo Yes , and ' t is said , The flag that waver 'd on the soldier 's wall , A woman 's hand has fastened there secure . Le Comte . Le Comte We will go shake it presently , and find How long a woman 's hand can hold it there . But may I ask if there be aught of moment This visit would imply ? Gerardo . Gerardo It is of Barri , The captive Gov'nor , I would speak with thee . Le Comte . Le Comte Ah , yes ! he is thy pris'ner ! Gerardo . Gerardo And he is A noble one ! I would the chance of war Had placed him on our side , so he had been A hero ! Le Comte . Le Comte Ha ! dost thou ?  --  I like him little . If I may speak of what concerns me not , His haughty port has more the Gov'nor still Than fits his present state . Gerardo . Gerardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is . Le Comte . Le Comte I would not have his manner taunt me so , With its proud quietness . Prison and Pride ! The terms do not agree , yet he is pleased To make their contrast stronger in himself . That spirit which he bears should learn to wear Less haughtily its chain ,  --  were I to say . But I have drawn thee from thy purpose ;  --  What Is it thou would'st have with me of him ? Gerardo . Gerardo Acceptance of him , as a warrior 's gift ,  --  An hostage , emblem of our amity . Permit me to present this token , then , To prove that War itself but seals our peace More firmly . Le Comte . Le Comte ( Aside . ) Must he rival me in all ? Even in gifts ?  --  Yet ' t is a welcome gift , Most welcome . ( To Gerardo . ) Shall I then usurp thy praise As though I had ta'en Barri , and not thou ? No ! keep the palm thou hast so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ' t has been indeed my chance To win , and therefore would I now entrust My prize to him who best can guard it . Though The gift be small , at least the motive may Enhance its value , for ' t is not alone In hollow compliment I proffer it , But earnestly , most earnestly . For thus I would devote me to our Holy Cause , And banish ev'ry selfish spring of action From what I do for common benefit . Le Comte . Le Comte Then I receive what may not be refused , And hold myself in debt for courtesy Like this ; ( Aside ) a debt of words I would infer , And that 's now paid . ( Aloud . ) But where is he ? this Barri , Leucate 's plumeless Gov'nor ? Gerardo . Gerardo I will send For him , and hasten to present him to thee . Here , Obis ! Enter Attendant . Attendant . Attendant I await my chief 's commands . Gerardo . Gerardo Go bring the pris'ner Barri hither to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy bidding . Exit Attendant . Le Comte . Le Comte Ay , the insulter 's our 's at last , the victim Of his own wiles !  --  said I not , Gerardo , The Holy Crucifix would triumph still ? And it shall be the sign of its own victory . Our enemies shall kneel and kiss this cross , Ere they may ask for mercy . Gerardo . Gerardo Some , I fear , Will not find mercy then . Le Comte . Le Comte No , not with me , Unless on my conditions . Gerardo . Gerardo That word has Sealed Barri 's fate ,  --  for he would look on death , Ay , kiss the sword which should unseal the fount Of his heart 's vital blood , rather than this . Le Comte . Le Comte Well , then , we have a talisman to prove His hardiness , or rather to disprove it . There is a power in death to humble pride , So I have heard , and Barri may evince . Gerardo . Gerardo Evince ! surely thou would'st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher nature in thee ! Le Comte . Le Comte Well , let us speak of that which deeper now Concerns us , than a pris'ner 's destiny . ' T is certain , then , this rumored warrioress ' Return ? Gerardo . Gerardo Most certain ; is ' t not time that we Should give her welcome suited to her guise ? Le Comte . Le Comte Ay ,  --  but she 's Barri 's other self , ' t is said , And comes to bolden their faint hearts . Gerardo . Gerardo I 'm glad If it be so indeed  --  our victory will Be prouder ! Le Comte . Le Comte So am I. Yet do I doubt Of any swift success . Another moon , And we perhaps might win some second bravo . But I am not disposed ten years should prove My patience ' gainst this modern Troy ; two months Have well sufficed . Gerardo . Gerardo Whither tend thy strange doubts ! Surely thou would'st not now forsake this siege ? Le Comte . Le Comte No , but I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rush forward , not crawl thus , Pace after pace , month after month , as we Have done . Thou art so slow and circumspect ! I would do something , though it were but done To be undone the moment afterwards . Gerardo . Gerardo If I 'm too slow , thou art as much too quick ; If I 'm too circumspect , thou art too careless . Let us then , each correct our special faults , One by the other . But it is not sweet To be reminded of our frailties , ev'n By friends ; and I would only caution thee Of thy quick spirit , not impute a blame To its free , natural wanderings . Now , no more Of this . Here comes the prisoner . Enter Barri , with Guards . Guards retire , And wait without , till you are called again . Exeunt Guards . Le Comte , behold thy captive ! Barri , Barri ( aside . ) Le Comte 's captive ! My very chains are bartered ! Le Comte . Le Comte I behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ,  --  The Holy Cross triumphant o'er its foes . To Barri . ) Approach yet nearer . Let me view thee well ; For I would see if thou hast not the mark Of Cain upon thee , for thy heresy ; Surely thou hast , or something blacker still ;  --  He killed a brother in his ignorance Of death ,  --  Thou wagest war upon thy brothers . Barri . Barri Yes , in defence , and in my knowledge of The truth . Le Comte . Le Comte Ha ! dost thou scoff me to my face ? But do not in thy show of scorn forget That my hand has the power of Atropos To cut thy tiny thread ,  --  or dost thou think Thou canst meet death as haughtily and fierce ? Barri . Barri Death ! ' t were the proudest laurel I could win ! Could I meet death ?  --  ay ! and I challenge thee , Thou who hast dared insult me with the doubt !  --  Yet I forget ,  --  I am thy pris'ner now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , In silence . But thou can'st not chain my thoughts . Gerardo . Gerardo Thou should'st have been a Spaniard for thy spirit ! Le Comte . Le Comte And thou may'st be a papist for thy soul . Barri . Barri I am content to be the pris'ner Barri , Fortune 's blown bubble that your breaths would break ! Le Comte . Le Comte ' T is well thy wishes are so limited ; Yes , well for thee ,  --  the worm should not essay To reach the eagle 's height . Yet there is hope Ev'n for the worm . It may avoid the step Whose crush is death ! Then , are thy hopes all crushed ? A moment since thou wouldst have challenged me ! Now thou ' rt content , forsooth , to be my pris'ner ! Yet thou , ev'n thou may'st hope ,  --  vile as thou art ! Vile as thou hast been ! For our Holy Church Turns not from penitents ,  --  thou may'st return , Confess thy guilt , ev'n be forgiven still , As madmen are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if thou wilt , Behold this pledge of mercy ! ( Lifts a cross ) . I extend Even to thy stained lips its holy touch , Kiss this , and thou art free !  --  not from our power Alone , which bows to this and owns itself Nothing , but from the power of error o'er Thy higher part !  --  Barri . Barri Ay , that 's beyond thy reach ! Thou hast said well ;  --  there is a higher part , Far , far above thy bribings ; though thou dost Besiege it , like yon walls , its sanctu'ry . Never , no , never , shall my honor yield ! And is it honor in thee to seduce , If I might be seduced ?  --  Call me not vile ! Art thou not vilest to insult thy victim ? To offer , what it were vileness to accept ? But thou may'st offer , I can still deny ; Not even thou can'st force thy will on me ; Thou can'st but only use thy utmost power Of earth on me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set me free from earthly power ! Go on , insult me as thou wilt !  --  for I Can answer , and I will not smooth my speech , No more than I would blunt my weapon 's point , If I might meet thee in the battle field , And sign thee for the mark of its direction . Le Comte . Le Comte Who speaks of insult ? am not I insulted ? Brav 'd , bearded ? Gerardo . Gerardo Le Comte , hold !  --  is this thy promise ? Is this , indeed , thy honor ? Deem'st thou thus To hasten victory ? For we did not come To form new partizans , but conquer cities : Silence ! for shame at least , if not for else ! Le Comte . Le Comte Thou , too , Gerardo !  --  Dost thou countenance Yon thing ? Yet I forget ; such heroism Accords with thee , but ' t is not of my nature ; And thou , methinks , should know its windings well Enough , to be more cautious how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if thou must be My arbiter in using it ; I want No gifts , when I must have the giver too To counsel me , and never be released From the vast obligation of the debt . Not I ! Gerardo . Gerardo Le Comte ,  --  dost thou insult me too ? But I excuse thee , for I know thy nature , As thou hast said , too well to hope for else Than insult in its anger ; but restrain This sudden passion ; dost thou rule an army , And can'st thou not govern thine own words ? Le Comte . Le Comte Right , right ! I own myself in fault ; yet forgive ; For thou , who fail'st in nothing , can'st forgive As well as censure ,  --  and thou fail'st not there ; But I am little versed in keeping peace , Much less in asking it , as thou may'st deem .  --  The battle , not the camp , were made for me ,  --  And I am ruffled with the tediousness Of this ,  --  I 've lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such sep'rate , petty siege ! I would not seek the hare in his hid covert , While others trace the stag ! Gerardo . Gerardo What would'st thou do ? Or what has happened thus to ruffle thee , For thou , indeed , art strangely moved ? Le Comte . Le Comte Oh nothing ! Nothing but thought , and that might ruffle Satan , If he could pause in his demoniac task To think !  --  I 've passed the bound of all endurance ; My patience is exhausted , spent , worn out ; I 've thought , and thought :  --  Now I will act ! And I will be revenged for this delay At least , though it is past redeeming now . There is one present who shall answer all ,  --  One who has even dared me to exert My power on him ,  --  and he shall find I can ; Ay , and I will ;  --  his city or its lord ! My camp shall be within you stirring walls , Or he shall be their ransom ! Gerardo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoman 's voice , Who bids her knights defend her ? Le Comte . Le Comte Thou hast said What would have called my blood , another time , In hasty rushings ; but no matter now ,  --  I will return the compliment of pardon . I am not mad nor frighted , Don Gerardo , But I 'm resolved !  --  resolved to do at once , What months have not accomplished yet . Thy gift Comes in good time to second my intent , For which I 'm doubly debtor . Gerardo . Gerardo Le Comte , pause ! Dost thou indeed mean as thou say'st ? Le Comte . Le Comte ' T is not My habit to speak lightly . Yes I mean , And by our Holy League I swear  --  Gerardo . Gerardo Swear not ! Till I may be the partner of thine oath , As I am in the cause by which thou tak'st it . Le Comte . Le Comte Well then , I say , affirm , declare ,  --  and mark ! I mean withal , the gov'nor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had a palace ,  --  Barri , or Barri 's city , shall be mine . Speak I not plainly ? can'st thou not ev'n yet Conceive my purpose ? Gerardo . Gerardo No ! I will not think Thou mean'st aught else than Le Comte should intend . Le Comte . Le Comte I mean to end this siege ! Let Barri choose Between himself and what was his ! Barri . Barri Ay , let me choose ; Turn him not ,  --  let him prove me ! Doubt'st thou I Can stand his proof ?  --  O might it be indeed For me to choose between my city 's fall And my own single death ,  --  my city 's honor On my slight pain ,  --  how soon the choice were made ! Le Comte . Le Comte Rather how soon ' t were thought , or said , or dreamt ,  --  Made is a nearer test ! But let that pass . Thou dost not know yon walls contain a treasure More precious than the rubies of the East That monarchs fought for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thy High vaunting it may be too hard a trial . Constanza , thy Constanza has returned ,  --  Returned to save thee ,  --  Heaven and she know how ! And shall she coo amid yon towers in vain ? Wilt thou forsake her in this doubtful siege , To die from very spite ?  --  when thou might'st be The one to ransom her ?  --  Barri . Barri Ay , by disgracing Her and myself ! Le Comte . Le Comte Rather by saving both From double death ! Gerardo . Gerardo Le Comte , no more of this , If thou would'st have me own thee Le Comte still . Think'st thou , this woman , if she has the heart Of woman in her , will not sooner faint At the first burst of our artillery , Than mail her fears when soldiers ' nerves grow weak ? Trust me , we 're nearer conquest now than ever . Le Comte . Le Comte We might be ! Gerardo . Gerardo We may be ! Prove if my words Are true or not ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us not our own selves Destroy the only trophy of our toils , And for no purpose . Le Comte . Le Comte Well , I yield to thee Gerardo , as the elder and the wiser , ( Aside ) . In self-esteem , at least , and that 's thy standard . Guards , there ! Enter Guards . Lead Barri to his tent again , And keep your stations by him closely . Pris'ner Farewell !  --  and thank Gerardo for thy safety . Barri . Barri I owe my safety to a higher Will Than his or thine ;  --  and I will only thank Him who has giv'n it , and who has the power To make it endless , if He please . Farewell ! God judge between us and support his cause ! ( Exit Barri , guarded . ) Le Comte . Le Comte He 's gone !  --  the viper !  --  but his sting will turn Upon himself . Gerardo . Gerardo Divert thy thoughts from him ; T is time that we salute this lady-chief . Le Comte . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt she might not choose such serenade . Gerardo . Gerardo It is not at her option to decide , But let us go prepare the instruments ! Exeunt . Scene 2 . A hall in the palace of Barri . Enter Constanza and Francoli . Constanza . Constanza Sweet home ! my home and his ! Ah ! now I feel All that I could not realize before ! Yes , he is lost indeed !  --  My widowed heart , There is no home for thee . ( To Francoli ) O teach me now The firmness I have taught to bolder nerves , If that thou say'st be true . Teach me the hope That I have giv'n to others , but to make Mine own despair more desperate . Francoli . Francoli Are there , then , None left to welcome thy return , ev'n yet ? No other loved ones , still ? Constanza . Constanza Where is that friend , Who ever was the first to welcome me ? But tell me , Oh !  --  what of my Hercules ? My boy , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet left to me ? Or have they taken This last one too ? Speak ! Is he well and safe ? O answer , quickly answer ! That alone May soothe me now , to know my child is safe . Francoli . Francoli Thy child is safe , and if there be a might In firm resolve to do the thing it means , His father shall be so ! Constanza . Constanza My darling boy ! Unmindful yet of ill ! He can not know His father 's grief , his mother 's agony . And may he not ! He shall remain to me A sunbeam in the tempest . All around , How dark ! How beautiful that one bright spot ! But of Genevra ,  --  is she left me still ? Have I a sister and a child indeed ? Francoli . Francoli Yes , and forget not that thou hast , too , souls Which vibrate to thy touch ! be thou but firm , And they are armed in adamant . But yield To feelings that flow forth so naturally ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be checked ,  --  And all of man in them yields too . Constanza . Constanza What need For me then to be firm , since thou hast said That all are weak but me ! Who calls those brave Whose courage wavers at a woman 's voice ? If I must steel my heart , to strengthen theirs  --  Francoli . Francoli Then Barri may be saved ! Constanza . Constanza Ah yes ! I feel The force of thy reproof . I should be calm , I must be , can be , and I will ! There is A strength in love even to restrain itself , And I will prove it . Deep , deep in my soul , Too far for grosser thought to penetrate , Shall be this silent sorrow  --  sacred there My grief shall be mine own , my cherished treasure ! Nought but the spirit of my ancestors May be for other eyes to look upon . Yes , yes , I can be firm ! For Barri 's sake I can be anything ;  --  I even can seem That which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou seem'st ,  --  A happy omen sent to reassure Our failing hopes ! Now we are strong again ! Thou see'st the visible change thy words have caused , From lowest despair to highest confidence , Through all our garrison . And let me be The first to speak a city 's gratitude For this so opportune encouragement . But citizens ' hearts and soldiers ' are not things To trust too far ;  --  let not their fears relapse ! That were more dangerous even than what has been . And pardon me this freedom ,  --  for thou knowest How much of zeal thy fortitude inspires , How much his safety , in whose place thou art , Rests on devoted zeal . Constanza . Constanza I know it all ! And thank thee for thy words which have revived Cezelli 's spirit in me . Tender thoughts And softer feelings I have cherished ; now , The time to weep has passed . Be done with such ! The universal care should claim us now , The universal effort ; and of that , ( So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort , ) I would ask One simple question ;  --  simply answer me ; Might thou be free to choose thy part , unbound By all which binds thee now ,  --  what were that choice ? Francoli . Francoli Were I to choose for safety , on which side My fortunes should embark , it would be this ! Were I to choose for loyalty my side , It would be this ! And might my choice be made The dictate of the still small voice alone , It would be this ! Safety and loyalty And conscience fight for us , and Doubt is not Admitted to their counsels.  --  As my soul Reveres the truth , so have my words declared it ; But would'st thou now my farther services ? Or would thy musings rather be alone , And grant me leave of absence ? I but wait To know and do thy pleasure . Constanza . Constanza Go then now , Francoli , with my grateful approbation . Thy services are written on my soul , Not even grief shall blot their memory thence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now farewell . Exit Francoli . Constanza . Constanza ( Sola . ) My husband , and my sister ' and my boy ! My soul is with them all ! Yet I am here , Alone , away from all ! Oh let me haste To clasp those treasures , which I still may clasp , To this poor trembling heart . Hark ! heard I not That little well known step upon the stair , As light as when it leaped in happier days To seek a father 's presence ? Enter Genevra and Hercules . Yes ! my child ! Come , come , thou hast a mother left thee yet ! Hercules , Hercules ( running to Constanza ) . Mamma ! my dear mamma ! How very glad I am to see thee ! for I almost thought Thou never would'st come back again . Constanza . Constanza Genevra ! Thou too ! ah , all but one ! Genevra . Genevra Yes , all but one ! And that one all ! O when we parted last Who could have dreamt of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only meet to mourn ! Constanza . Constanza Yet do not yield thus to such gloomy fears ; Try , try to be more firm . Genevra . Genevra More firm , indeed ! No , let me weep ! Sure I may weep at least ! Yes , that allowance even the captive claims ; It is the common privilege of grief ! They can not chain her tears , no more than they Could number mine ! O , try to be more firm ! Make thou the trial . Let me weep alone ! Constanza . Constanza Say not alone ; thou hast the sympathy Of tears at least , thou hast the sympathy Of a crushed heart , still in its wretchedness ! Yet , dear Genevra , wilt thou not at least For my sake be more calm ? and for thine own , And for his sake for whom even thy gay spirit Has learned what sadness is ? I too could yield To all the dark thoughts which despair might dream ! And I have yielded , and my heart still yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul shall not yield ! no , I have known Barri too long to love him selfishly ! What are our griefs , what our most anxious fears , To the so many griefs , so many fears , Of all the citizens ? They look to us For firmness and support , and shall they look In vain to Barri 's wife , or Barri 's sister ? Genevra . Genevra And do they look to us for confidence ? We who must feel the most , must we be too The ones to bear the most ? Must we seem calm ? Dissemble even sorrow ? Shall we not Even have grief 's indulgence  --  tears , at least ? But break not yet , my heart ! Thou canst not have Much longer to endure ! Constanza . Constanza And break not yet , My heart ! Thou must endure !  --  O think of me ! Should not my sorrow even be more than thine ? Yet I must bear it all , and hide it all ! I may not even weep , lest I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if It is for Barri , what can I not bear ? At least I will not yield . My heart indeed , May break beneath its torture of restraint , But I will stretch it to the farthest nerve Of suffering , first ! Genevra . Genevra 165 I would , I could , endure All , everything but this , with fortitude . But I have loved him too devotedly To hush one cry , even for a city 's sake ! What is a city ? Is not Barri more Than all the world to me ? And shall I know His precious safety hazarded , and seem Still to be firm because my looks are watched By cowards , whose faint hearts are moved to fear , To see me yield to natural feeling ? No ! Thou mayest he calm  --  I can not , would not be . Constanza . Constanza Yet hear me , hear ; Is ' t not for Barri 's sake That I would have thee so ? His precious safety , His city 's honor , all , thou knowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might move Leucate 's wavering firmness , even thy tears , So frail has loyalty become , Genevra ! Think not my soul unfeeling as my words ; That , that can feel ! But thy grief needs no aid From mine ! Genevra . Genevra O do not check one sigh for me ! For I had rather hear his name , though breathed In mournfulness , than aught beside . Still speak Of him , and I will listen . Constanza . Constanza ' T is not well That we should still increase each other 's doubts By telling them : No , let us weep alone , Endure together ! ' t is for Barri 's sake ! Enter Bernis . Bernis ! thou art most welcome ! Bernis . Bernis Rather I Should welcome thee , thou art indeed most welcome ! At least Leucate proves how thou art welcomed ! Confidence comes with thee , and Hope and Will Which most have failed before , are firmest now . And soldiers look on thee , and learn to be Soldiers indeed , who have been baser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And heroes wake , as kindred , at thy coming ! Constanza . Constanza And thou hast been the hero in mine absence ; Said I the hero ? The preserver rather ! Thou hast indeed preserved life , honor , friends ,  --  All that is still mine own I owe to thee ! But one , alas , thy care has failed for one , Dearer I 'd almost said , dearer than all ! And that one , tell me now the real truth Of him ; O shall I ever welcome him Back to his royal home again ? Bernis . Bernis We know not , We may not say what shall be ; but we trust , And we have trusted , and beholding thee Our trust increases ,  --  for there is a charm , A heavenly charm which angels might employ , Bound to thy words , as though some spirit breathed Upon them with the breath of prophecy , To tell our trust of good ; and thou who hast Ever brought happiness before , art now Deemed but the messenger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond belief ; We hoped in doubt , but now we hope in trust . Genevra . Genevra O that we had a mirror for our hopes , A little fairy gift , such as we read of In ancient tales ,  --  a magic oracle , Where one side would reflect our every wish , And all incumbent on ourselves would be To turn the glass , and find them realized ! Bernis . Bernis One gift we have , better than fairy gift , Where we may learn , not what our wishes are , ( For that , unaided , we can find too oft , ) But what they should be ,  --  then we turn the page And read , that there is One who hears our prayers And answers them in mercy , though too high And infinite in his almighty purpose For our weak finite minds to comprehend Always ; yet always merciful , the more Perhaps , the less our senses can compass His boundless goodness , all too vast for us ! And we should thank him , even when the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has still preserved us from a bitterer grief . Genevra . Genevra Yes , father , I can listen to thy words , And know that all thou sayest should be so ; But ah ! not even thou canst guide my heart , And make it learn to beat less audibly . Joy dwells unclouded there , or sunless grief , The Northen Winter , or the Equator 's heat . Calmness and patience were not made for me ! The avalanche should be my covering , I would be crushed at once ! Bernis . Bernis But would'st thou not Avert the avalanche from others ' heads ? Genevra . Genevra Ah yes ! thou hast reproved me with just cause ; I do forget of others in myself , When I should not remember self for them .

Genevra 264 O thou art generous , and would'st not have A flower be withered by thy sorrow 's breath ; But I am so absorbed in my one thought , I love my brother so ,  --  I can not think , I can not speak of anything but him . Constanza . Constanza I wish thee not ,  --  it is the dearest subject , And the most grateful . Yet I would not have Doubt mingle with our holy trust for him . His fate is with a Higher Power than ours , And on that power we will , we do rely ; Our love is pure ,  --  it should be confident , For innocence is ever confident . Genevra . Genevra O I am confident , whatever be The sequel of his fate , it will be right . Yet how , how could I know of what I dread , But that my earthly part would bear me down ? And though I must submit , how heavily My heart would bear the weight of its submission ! Bernis . Bernis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though our hope be almost foolishness . What were ev'n heaven without ? And he whose grief Is inconsolable despair , but shows That his own pleasure was his dearest life , And when that failed , he would not live for else . But now I will not farther interrupt you ; I know that sorrow seeks no witnesses To its free gushings ; and I will not be A check upon you , when I may not aid . But do not let the o'erflowing of your grief Be marked by vulgar eyes , lest they construe , According to their lower feelings , yours ; And deem that fear alone could move you thus . And now farewell ! the trying moment comes When woman 's heart grows faint . Genevra . Genevra What dost thou say ? Is it the time for blood to flow again ? Is there any show Of preparation , as if they would come For farther victims soon ? Bernis . Bernis There is indeed ! But think upon our Holy Cause , and trust And fear not !  --  There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Yes , if we do believe in earnestness , And cherish not a doubt , though scarcely known To our most secret thoughts , we shall at last Find our reward . Constanza . Constanza Yes , father !  --  But thou know'st That there are times when the full burthened heart , Surcharged by earth , may not be raised above Its narrowness ,  --  and now mine will be linked To earthly thoughts ,  --  it must ! Bernis . Bernis And ev'n on earth Our self restraint will find its recompence In its own memory , if in nothing else . Constanza . Constanza Well , we will try to do as thou hast said . Bernis .

Genevra . Genevra Then , if sincerity finds its reward In what it seeks , O ours must be regarded . But come , let us retire awhile , Constanza ; Sure thou must need repose . Constanza .

Citizens Yes , yes , we 'll pay this compliment to her . They play a martial symphony . Enter Constanza from the palace .

And if you thus will seek my words before The contest , may it be for me , the first , To hail you victors , when the strife is o'er To which your zeal would haste . Till then , farewell . Farewell , indeed !  --  My soul breathes out that prayer In earnestness . Think , should the foe advance With Herculean strength , think on the cause For which you struggle , and a might will come To arm your nerveless frames against the force Of those , whose power is strengthened by the chance Of earthly fortune only ; and whose war Is leagued in vice against a holier strife ! This is your native city !  --  It has seen Your birth , and it may look upon your death , But shall it see you yield to else than death ? No , never !

Go ;  --  I will not restrain your eagerness With farther words . Go , and God speed your cause ! Citizens . Citizens We go to do as thou hast said .

It will be time enough when they will come Unasked , unsought , to thee  --  the gifts of knowledge . But it is ever thus ; we will not learn From others ' sad experience , or believe Their warnings of our fate , till we have proved , Ourselves , by knowing , all they felt before . Knowing the world ! That is , to know ourselves Upon a larger scale , and learn to be A portion of the wretched things around . Yet all are not mere worldings ! I have felt That they are not ,  --  and that may prove my grief ! For if he were more like the common mass Of cold but kindred earth , I had not loved So well , or felt , so deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I not feel it ? Yet They say I should be calm , and hoard my grief With miserly care , as though I would belie it , As misers do possession of their wealth . But that would be mere mockery , worse than mock'ry !

Trust in the God of battles , and be firm ! The word is given !  --  the soldiers have gone forth ! All , all is ready , but this poor weak heart , And this too shall be !  --  Hark ! did I not hear ? Yes , there it is ,  --  the voice of mortal hate !

Thou hast to use thyself to them , Constanza , If thou would'st be of us . Alas , my brother ! He hears those sounds too , but they are to him Only a higher degree of misery , for I know that his high spirit ill can brook A pris'ner 's helplessness , while others strive For his sake , in the cause which should be his . I know all the quick thoughts that come and go O'er his mind 's surface , and the deeper ones That linger in its depths ; yes , I can feel With Barri , being the twin to all the frailties Which I could never find , or if I did , I should but love him dearer , by the increase Of our alliance thence ; and for his virtues , If I have any , ' t is because he is So virtuous , and I have learned to love Virtue by loving him , its noblest boast .

Constanza Yes , but thy tidings first ? Bernis . Bernis The strife begins ! Its issue brave hearts may not beat to know , But trusting ones may wait , to learn . Genevra . Genevra And what , What is the part for anxious love to do ? Ah yes ;  --  to wait , to doubt , to hope , to dread , O had I but a Lethe for my thoughts , Till I might know ! Constanza .

Genevra . Genevra Oh , dear Constanza ! What shall I do ? Teach me ! But no , it were vain , Forgive me then , the wildness of my passion Stops not to con its wish ere it be said . Bernis . Bernis There is no need of passion , but of patience ; There is no need of wildness , but of calm . Sister of Barri ! where is that proud spirit , Which marked your kindred best ?  --  yields it to fear Before thy brother 's foes ?  --  He does not fear , Should'st thou ? Genevra . Genevra Thou know'st me not  --  thou can'st not know , Not having such a brother . But thou say'st That Barri fears not . True ! the eagle 's eye May look upon the Sun , and quiver not , But is there other eye can follow it In its high gaze ? My brother too may meet , Unshaken , ay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think upon For him . There is a strength in the tried soul To bear its own companionless sufferings Calmly , and clasp them to itself like blessings But not another 's ! Could I change with him , Thou would'st see if I shamed our kinsmanship ! But speak not of patience or of calmness , ' T is not the time to hear thy homilies . Bernis . Bernis But thou at least wilt hear . Genevra . Genevra No , no . I 'm deaf ! Waste not thy arguments on me !  --  Of what Avail are they ? Has argument the power To save my brother ? If it has , O haste , Haste to restore him ; but pause not to cast One word away on me ! Alas ! those sounds ! Bernis . Bernis Shrink'st thou to hear them ? Dost thou then forget Those are glad sounds to captives ' ears ,  --  the watch word , To tell them that their friends are aiding them ? Genevra . Genevra Thou mean'st to tell them that their friends would and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter thy distrust ? Thou art a most suspicious proselyte ! Genevra . Genevra I would believe ! And there are many too Who would be atheists , but feel the force , Ev'n while they speak , of what they would deny . When I have clasp 'd my brother to my heart , Then I will laugh and call these idle fears , And trust , another time . Bernis . Bernis That other time ! Deem'st thou that God may be more powerful ? or Can'st thou not trust his power as confident Now as another time ? Genevra . Genevra O chide me not ! God will forgive . Thou dost not know my soul ! Enter Francoli . Constanza . Constanza Thou here , Francoli ? Com'st thou then to crush The last left hope ? But no ; thy looks are bright With happy tidings ; share their happiness With us .

Francoli When we are victors ; And have established by the only means By which we may , the freedom of our souls To use the powers which God has given them , According as the voice of God within May dictate . Would'st thou look upon the contest ? Genevra . Genevra Oh no ! my heart 's not mailed like your breasts ! Constanza . Constanza But I would . Genevra . Genevra Dear Constanza , do not go ! Stay , stay with me !  --  I can not be alone . Constanza . Constanza Well I will stay , so thou will be more calm . There is no farther need for these wild fears ; Our cause is prosperous . Francoli . Francoli 1 67 Ay , prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word for us ! Nor time , nor place , nor cause , that we should fear . Fear not !

Constanza . Constanza O no ! We would not Detain one citizen Leucate calls . We would not have one loyal soul inactive . Go Bernis , do thy part ! ' T is ours alas , To be unable to do aught , but feel ! Francoli . Francoli Not so !  --  t is thou dost all . Exeunt Francoli and Bernis . Constanza .

Genevra . Genevra ( interrupting her . ) Ay , and my brother ! That ' t is for him To be the sacrifice ! There has a sad foreboding seized my soul , Which other days may prove , perhaps ev'n this . ' T is said , such thoughts come but a little time Before their warning be fulfilled . Constanza . Constanza Thou'rt wild , Genevra . Thy words are passionate , Without a meaning . Genevra . Genevra To my soul they have A fearful meaning ! Constanza . Constanza Oh Genevra , hush ! These fears are idle , worse than idle , impious ! Be , be thyself again  --  be Barri 's sister , And not the foolish thing thou seemest now , Deeming whate'er thy fancy dreams , prophetic ; Would Barri own thee thus ? Genevra . Genevra Would Barri own me ! And was it thou , Constanza , spoke that word ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to deem her heart as passionless As thine own high , yet too unbending , firmness ! But do not mock my soul 's deep oracle , Nor call me foolish ,  --  for I can not help Believing what seems stamped and written here , In such , ( it may be false ,  --  O may it prove so ! ) Yet in such seeming of reality . Oh no ! these thoughts are something more than idle . It can not be that a mere dream should thus Hang o'er my spirit with its misty fear , And still I try , and can not shake it off ! Constanza . Constanza But dost thou try ? Genevra . Genevra No , not like thee indeed ! I do not speak of hopes , and think despair . I can not so disinterest myself From all my former selfishness , to be The patriot , not the sister , as thou can'st . And why , why should I try ? Why should I hope ? Thou tell'st me that our cause is prosperous , Yet what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will they then restore the only prize Which two months ' toil has gained ? And do they win , Then all is in their power ; and think'st thou that The vulture will relent , because be finds His prey increased ? ( Constanza , who has been standing , sinks on a chair . ) What have I said , Constanza ? O could I but have thought !  --  But heed me not , I wander ,  --  rave . Constanza . Constanza How could'st thou speak such things ? Would thine own words prohibit every hope , Ev'n to thyself ? Genevra . Genevra O do not , do not heed me ! Or make me too a pris'ner , if thou list , Till I can learn to prison such wild thoughts , And keep them to myself . Hercules . Hercules Mamma , what ails thee ? Shall I go ring the bell ? Constanza . Constanza No , stop my love ! Thy voice alone recovers me , sweet truster ! Thou art so sure in thy simplicity , I can not look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not tempt my soul again . Genevra . Genevra O leave me , leave me , let me rave alone ! Constanza . Constanza Not so ! but I will try the power of song To soothe thy passion , not abandon thee To its wild sway ; and though it fail in that , At least ' t will speed this heavy hour along ; It is the song which Barri loved so well . Constanza sings . Home ! first and dearest spot ! The young thoughts boundary ! O can the wide world offer , Another place like thee ? Where memory wreathes so fadeless , Her fadeless evergreen ? And a charm is on the very air , To mark where joy has been ? Here sorrow finds a balm , And care a sweet relief  --  And joy may blend its happiness With those who soothed its grief , And here our hearts would linger , In thought of scenes gone by ,  --  What are the world 's wild dreams to this , The souls first sanctu'ry ! O there are ties that bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But the strongest and the dearest , Are those which bind us here . Home !

Bernis That the righteous cause will prosper ! The foe retreats  --  They can not rally long  --  The city is our own ! Genevra . Genevra Whose is its gov'nor ? Bernis . Bernis The city 's ! for they must deliver him To us at last . Constanza . Constanza Is that thy real thought ? Bernis . Bernis Most certainly ,  --  it is not of my order To trifle ever  --  least at such a moment , And with anxiety like thine  --  nor could I have a motive that I should propose Falsely to encourage thee ; ' t would but make truth More dreadful when revealed .

Exit Constanza . Genevra . Genevra There , she 's gone ! The calm ! the unmoved ! O , I would rather rave Till I were mad indeed , than be like her ! Bernis . Bernis Genevra , my profession pardons me For speaking to thee thus ,  --  I know thy grief ; I 've ever known thy brother worthy all The love thou givest him ; yet I have spoke In accents of encouragement to thee , And I have tried to stimulate thy pride , And to excite thy loyalty , in vain ,  --  Genevra . Genevra Say not in vain ! But there are deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , For me ! A sister 's love ! what purer friendship ? Can I be calm to think on that dear brother , And know his fate uncertain ? I must speak , Else would the passion checked gush out within , And cause a wilder ruin there . Bernis . Bernis Then thou Wilt place thy slightest ease before the pang , The inward pang , which every word of thine Wakes in another 's heart ; her grief is not The less excessive that it is controlled . She would anticipate a brighter change , But that thy dark anticipations pall Her hope , ere it be sure . Genevra . Genevra O say no more ! For her sake I will try to seem more calm . Bernis . Bernis And may'st thou be supported in thine effort , And feel the thing thou seem'st ! Genevra . Genevra That can not be ; But I will try . Bernis . Bernis Then I again depart . Let not thy firmness vanish with my presence . Exit Bernis . Genevra . Genevra 344 We too will seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh sounds may not intrude so much . Exeunt Genevra and Hercules .

The voice of war unsheaths all swords but mine ; And mine  --  where is it ? in my goaler 's keeping ! Enter a Guard . How goes the contest , sir , who tend'st my cage ! Waves my gay streamer , freely , proudly , yet ? Guard . Guard Ay , but hands haste ev'n now to pull it down . Barri .

Now others say To me  --  Remain ! And I may not depart .  --  I was a lord ! This is my heritage ! Man ! man ! how crooked is thy destiny ! Thy web is wov'n with every changing tint That ever shaded joy , or brighten 'd grief .  --  But this is not a time for quiet thought , And calm reflection on the busy turns Of man  --  that silk-worm ! my mind shall contend With passions , though my body may not strive With outward foes !

O I must rest in feebleness , and know My dearest ones unstrengthened , by the might Of love , to mail this arm ! beset by foes , A wall alone between them , and the spears Of eager ruffians , and their rosaries ! And my sweet , gentle boy ! how bears he still This siege , unsheltered by a father 's presence ? Pales not the rose upon his faded cheek ? Has not fear breath 'd too roughly on that form , Sporting , till now , in luxury 's choicest bowers ? Bursts the young dimple out so merrily , To speak the laughing spirit of his soul ?

Alas ! he may not know that father 's fate , Too pure to think of ill ! nor would I have His gay , young humor damp 'd so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Too well , and feel too sensibly this loss !

Yes ! for her sake , I would excuse awhile That she should hush a love which must be sorrow ! But these are tender thoughts ;  --  My soul must not Yield to a softer mood than fits this place , This living sepulchre of warrior 's fame ! Yes , I am buried here ! my name effac 'd From Glory 's brilliant record . Who will turn From all the illustrious names which grace her page , To read the captive 's humble signature , Whose prison-barrier bounded his exploits ?

But for one instant now , When I might rush forth , fiercer from this curb Which has been put on me ! Ah ! would the fiends Accomplish what they call 'd a threat , and give me Indeed the choice with which they mocked my weakness ,  --  Leucate should not then have cause to blush That Barri was of her ! And must that holy sanctu'ry be stain 'd With its own life-stream ?

Gerardo 180 No ! but I would forget them  --  all except The last  --  My mem'ry needs no quickening ! But sure thou would'st not now renew designs So useless ? Barri is no longer Gov'nor ; Let his perverseness irritate himself , But he is not an object to excite Our anger or regard , till deeper int'rests Have been regarded first . ' T is not on him We would revenge ourselves , but on Leucate ; And not from passionate rage , but holy zeal . Le Comte . Le Comte Thou may'st be zealous , I will be reveng 'd ! I 've sworn most sacredly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Barri , is he not The only instrument which we possess ? Gerardo . Gerardo Which thou possess'st ;  --  use not my name conjoint With such intents ! Le Comte . Le Comte And has he not defied me ?  --  Dar 'd me to make him arbiter between Himself and what shall not be his again ? Ay , thou hast heard him ; but his empty vaunts Shall not avert , but hasten  --  Gerardo . Gerardo Can'st thou doubt What would be Barri 's choice ? And knowing it , Wilt thou , by making him a sacrifice , Incense still more our foes , and strengthen them With fury , where their fortitude might fail ! Le Comte . Le Comte But ' t is not Barri who shall make the choice , He shall not be a self devoted martyr , For so their heretic blasphemy would term him ; No ! we will change our ordinance . ' T will be seen If she who keeps Leucate 's keys so well , Will be as patriotic , when the cause For which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall decide Between her Barri , and his ,  --  our Leucate ! Gerardo , Gerardo ( as if to himself . ) But ' t is not like a Spaniard to avail me Of such advantage ; to obtain from weakness , What strength could not obtain . Le Comte . Le Comte And is it then , More like a Spaniard to sit lonely thus , And let a woman shame , ay , conquer him ? I ever heard it was a Spanish maxim , Eye for an eye , revenge for injury , Ever till now !  --  Gerardo . Gerardo And now ' t is more than ever ! Yes , let her choose , and if it be for Barri , Why , then Leucate will be ours without The trouble of a farther siege ;  --  and if She ev'n can yield him to save the city , At least ' t will be her own free choice . Le Comte . Le Comte Think not That she can so belie her womanly nature ; Yet ev'n though that were possible , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerardo With this slight difference , We should be stained with innocent , noble blood ! But why take I such interest in him ? He ' s nought to me . Le Comte . Le Comte But an instrument For thy revenge ! Gerardo , Gerardo He is no instrument Of mine . It is for thee alone to do With him as suits thee best . Le Comte , Le Comte ( to the Guards . ) Call Barri forth ! Exeunt guards . Now I will sound him to the very depth Of his proud soul ! Enter Barri from the inner part of the tent , guarded . Pris'ner ! I call thee here To bid thee be prepared for death , that is , If she who is to be thy judge , decree it . Constanza is that judge ; and ' t is with her To ransom thee and all thy citizens , You having first renounced your heresy By the surrender of Leucate 's keys , And all the arms of its defenders , to Us , in the name of our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she decrees Thy death . Leucate 's Gov'nor , or Leucate ! That is the word ! And , ho ! guards , soldiers , there ! See that a scaffold be erected , just Before the wall , within ten paces thence . Barri , Barri ( aside ) . Oh God ! the measure of my shame is full ! A scaffold !  --  But ' t is better than a traitor ! Le Comte . Le Comte And sound on armistice , and hasten ! Hours Are years in war 's account . Exeunt Soldiers , &c; And , pris'ner , thou Prepare thyself for thy swift pending fate , Of death ,  --  or life , a living death to all Thy vaunted honor ! Barri . Barri I 'm prepared already ! And thank thee that thou enablest me To die for that Immortal Cause , which now My life no more may benefit . Have you Farther to speak with me ? For I would pass My waning hours with God , and with my soul , Unbiased by men 's converse , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exit Barri . Art thou recovered yet , Gerardo , Enough to leave this place ? For thou should'st be In a more fitting quarter for thy rank . Gerardo . Gerardo What is my rank in such a scene , which equals All rank ? But as thou choos'ts . I am recovered  --  ' T was nothing but a bruise ;  --  A paltry scratch ! Lend me thine arm ; see , how my strength returns ! I will go undeceive the one that gave A stroke so feeble , if he deem 'd it harsh . Exeunt omnes . ACT . III . Scene I. Hall in the palace of Barri , as before . Enter Constanza , tearing a rose in pieces . Constanza . Constanza When shall I clasp thee , Barri , once again To this lone heart , and hush the last faint doubts Which linger still in sad rebellion here ? O could I share captivity with thee ! But that may not be !  --  I will hasten then , Its period with my hopes , for I will hope Till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hercules Oh mama ! Thou'st torn my fairest rose ! Genevra . Genevra Ah ! I have read , The fairest flower will be the first to fade , The dearest friend will be the first to die . Constanza . Constanza Thus ever all thou sayest terminates . Genevra . Genevra Thus even all I think must terminate ; My words are but the echo of my soul . Constanza . Constanza But must they always echo to despair ? Genevra . Genevra Yes , when I feel it !  --  Oh Constanza , had'st Thou seen the thing which I have seen , thou would'st not Have asked that question !  --  Had'st thou seen that scaffold ! Oh God !  --  my brain is giddy now ! Constanza . Constanza What said'st thou ? What hast thou seen ? A scaffold ! Mean'st thou so ? Or have thy fears but dreamt of such a thing ? Genevra . Genevra Ay , scaffold ! Hercules should learn the name ! His father 's scaffold ! Enter Bernis . Oh , thou art come To read the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope at once ! ' T were better Than to live on the very sport of hope . Constanza . Constanza Oh speak ! Hercules , Hercules ( presenting Bernis a chair . ) Here is a chair . Bernis . Bernis Bless thee , my child ! Constanza . Constanza Oh father , bless me too ! I need thy blessing ! Bernis . Bernis God blesses those whom he chastises most . We can not tell his purpose , but we know His mercy , and in thankfulness should meet His heaviest chastisement . Genevra . Genevra Then all is true ! O I did hope till now ! Constanza . Constanza What , what is true ? Speak out ! There is no need of glossing o'er With words of consolation , our despair . Is there a scaffold ? Bernis . Bernis Thou hast heard it then ? That word is all !  --  ' T is but a slender choice ; Thy husband 's honor , or his life , is doomed ! Constanza . Constanza His honor , or his life ! Oh God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me ! How could'st thou thus encourage ? Bid me hope , Till hope seemed certainty , and I believed Fondly , that all was certain , but to crush My soul the heavier now ? ( Falls fainting . ) Hercules . Hercules Help , help mama ! Look ! she is dying ! Aunt Genevra ! Bernis ! Will you not come to her ? Constanza . Constanza Oh could I die Indeed ! Bernis . Bernis Thy time has not yet come ! Thy cup O'erflows not yet with all the bitterness Which earth must add to it , ere thou may'st taste The last . Genevra . Genevra I thought till now my heart would break ! Yet I live on , and hear my gloomiest fears Verified . What new power has strengthened me ? But ' t is not true  --  ' t is all a scheme , a feint ; They dare not harm one hair on Barri 's head ! Who said there was a scaffold ? ' T is all false ; Bernis would frighten me , because I heed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as calm and tranquil as Constanza . Constanza . Constanza As calm ! And have I then been calm for this ? Yet I am calm ; I do not rave ! Oh here , Here is the conflict ! Here my tears are checked And frozen ; how they press upon my heart ! O might they flow and bear my life-stream too ! ( To Bernis . ) But did'st thou say my cup was not yet filled With all its bitterness ? that can not be  --  His honor , or his life ! I know the choice Barri will make . Bernis . Bernis What were Constanza 's choice ? Constanza . Constanza Father ! I thank thee that this draught is spared ! I could not choose ! For Barri might not be Without his honor ; and could I decree Mine own , my son 's , Genevra 's wretchedness , For a mere name ? Bernis . Bernis And could'st thou then decree , Thine own , thy son 's , Genevra 's , Barri 's shame , For mere existence ? Constanza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doubled yet ? If thou hast any sharper pang to add , Spare not ,  --  tell all at once . But speak , O speak ! Despair loves to hear o'er and o'er its tale . Bernis . Bernis I have indeed a sharper pang to add , But this will give the fortitude to bear it . ( Presenting Constanza a Bible . ) Constanza . Constanza O do not think but I can bear it all ! I can bear anything , but not to know What I must bear ! Bernis . Bernis Then , thine must be the choice . The city or its Gov'nor ! They have said , That thou should'st choose between them . Yield the one , Or by denial doom the other 's death ! Genevra . Genevra Ah ! is there any chance ? can he be saved ? Bernis . Bernis The city is his ransom ! Ail the lives Of these brave citizens are forfeited , Or his ! One life for all , or all for one ! Genevra . Genevra And dost thou hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! They have mocked me with a choice , Which is not mine ! As though it were for me , To balance destinies , and make myself An arbiter of life , who would resign Mine own with joy ! I can not hesitate ; But Oh ! my voice can never utter it ! Speak for me ! Thou art gifted to express Thy grief in words ! What were thy choice , Genevra ? Genevra . Genevra My choice ! O were the world to be his ransom , And had I worlds to give , how easily My choice were made ! Bernis . Bernis And would'st thou sacrifice The world for one ? Others can love as purely As thou dost , and as strong , though not  --  Genevra . Genevra So selfish  --  I know what thou would'st say , yet ' t is not all My selfishness ! And might the universe Be pledged indeed for him , there were not found A soul more noble to redeem the pledge . And here in this faint city , which has shrunk To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half of Barri 's life . Ay , call me selfish ! But it is not that  --  ' T is the close tie which ever knit our hearts , From their twin growth , in twinness of affection , Which makes me place his life before all else , Or place my life , for his . For I would die , Willingly , joyfully , but to know he lived ; And is that selfishness ? Constanza . Constanza My God !  --  I know That thou art merciful ! And Oh , I feel That thou art inscrutable ! But till This proof , I ever thought the consciousness Of doing right would balance every grief That sacrifice of present joy might cause . Bernis . Bernis And think so still ! Thy thoughts are passionate now , And quick and changing ; but when thou art calm And quiet in thy suffering , thou wilt find That inward approbation will repay The sacrifice of every selfish hope To duty , and to honor , and to God . Thou can'st not doubt what Barri 's choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constanza . Constanza Oh no ! I can not doubt of Barri 's choice , and mine Were made as readily , were I the victim ! ' T is easier to suffer all the woes Of others , than to add one pang to them ! To be onesself the only sacrifice , Than to condemn another to endure The slightest , swiftest pain . Oh ! did I say Condemn ? Oh that I could condemn all hope Of other earthly pleasure to myself , So that were all my judgment might affect ! And shall Constanza 's hand seal Barri 's fate ? And shall her voice pronounce it ? Oh that word Would be the last ! Ay , look reproof at me , ( to Bernis . ) Thou dost not know how hard a thing it is To part with all the soul holds dear on earth , Even though returned to heaven ! But O , I feel ! No ! no ! I do not feel , it passes feeling ! Bernis . Bernis Did not the patriarch give his only son To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give His Son to be a ransom for the world ? And ' t is His cause in which we struggle now , And ' t is to him this sacrifice is given ! Constanza . Constanza Yes , yes  --  I know  --  I know my fearful task . Thou who hast willed , support me to perform it ! But leave me now , all leave me ! Thou , my child ! My child ! yes thou art still mine own ! Their power Could not extend to thee ! But go , my love ! And thou , my sister ; ah ! we are indeed Sisters in sorrow as in kinsmanship ; O leave me too . I must not hear thy voice , Nor listen to thine eloquence of wo . Thou must not make me weaker than I am , Nor wake my senses from the fearful trance Which will not let me realize my loss . And Bernis , thou too go a little space , For I would be alone in wretchedness . Bernis . Bernis I go ; but to thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  I give it thee To be thy consolation and thy guide . ( giving her the Bible . ) O thou wilt be rewarded for thy struggle At last , and Barri will approve thee ! Constanza . Constanza Now Thou'st touched the string which vibrates . Genevra . Genevra I depart To seek in solitude more sure despair , Where once I loved to go and seek relief From my almost satiety of bliss , In other , happier , unreturning days . The foxes have their holes , the birds their nests , Genevra hath not where to lean her heart In this wide world , and not be shaken off . Come boy ! all places are alike henceforth To me and misery , my future twin . Exeunt Genevra , Bernis and Hercules . Constanza , Constanza ( sola . ) They 're gone ! And this is left to counsel me . O here , at least , I may find consolation ! ( Opens at this passage . ) ' Blessed are they that mourn , for I will be Their comforter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will come to thee and seek that rest Thou promisest to all who seek it thus . ( She kneels . ) O Thou to whom the sorrowful may come , And tell their sorrows ! thou who know'st my soul , And know'st how purely , truly it has loved , ' Thy will be done ! ' O teach thy supplicant Who kneels before thee in her lowliness , To love thy pleasure though it be her grief ! My spirit shrinks ! Oh God ! I know the part Which I must do  --  Support my weak resolve ! Thou call'st me to resign what thou hast given . O have I loved the gift too well to think Of thee the Giver as I ought ?  --  But now The dream is past  --  I wake to earth again , O ' t was a vision of such ecstacy ! My God ! I thank thee for it ! Yet ' t is right That thou should'st take it from me , for it bound My love too much to earth , to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fate ? I , who would die for him , to cause his death ? Father , forgive me if my soul revolts To make its dreadful choice ! But it is made ! Put , put an iron firmness in my heart Till all is over ; and then ,  --  O might it break ! ( She rises . ) I have resolved ! My purpose shall not shake ! No ! no ! ' T is fixed , irrevocably fixed ! I have done right ; but all the agony Of guilt is tearing me  --  yet it was right ! Oh Barri ! when we parted in this hall One little moon ago , who could have thought We parted then forever , or to meet Only again in such a scene  --  the last ! Where I should be the judge and thou  --  the doomed ! Yet might I save thee ! No ! It were an insult To thine high spirit ! I might save my love , But Barri , never ! I should but preserve thee A little while to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearted ! Traitor , or patriot ! Do I hesitate To choose the name for Barri ? But my boy ! O may he live to thank me for depriving His childhood of its guardian , rather than Deprive his manhood of its dignity , Or rob his father of a warrior 's name ! Yes , I am fixed ! No power shall shake me now , Save His who has decreed this trial to me . Enter Francoli . Francoli . Francoli I have been sent  --  to  --  to  --  Constanza . Constanza Ah ! well I know Thy message !  --  ' T is no need that I should hear Those fiendish words again . Francoli . Francoli I would not speak then . At sunset thou wilt choose . Our Holy Cause Aid thee ! Constanza . Constanza At sunset did'st thou say ? So soon ? Well , it is better so than that my purpose Should waver , in its lingering to be done . At sunset I shall be alone on earth ! Francoli . Francoli O say not so ! Thou wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear the willow Rather than tear the laurel from his brows . Constanza . Constanza I thank thee for thy words ; they strengthen me ! I would remember nothing now but Barri , The warrior , not the friend ! But let me go , And breathe my  --  sentence  --  in the open air , Lest here it should be stifled ere confirmed . Exeunt Constanza and Francoli . Scene . II . Scene ,  --  on the rampart of Leucate , and the plain below . A scaffold just before the wall ,  --  Sun seen not far above the horizon . Enter on the plain , Gerardo leaning on Le Comte , Barri , and guards . Le Comte . Le Comte ( To Barri . ) Behold thy deathcouch ! Or thou shalt behold A wider wreck in yonder teeming herd ! Thou hast but one alternative , to die The death before thee , or to live and be A by-word , a reproach , a shame to life ! Ay , we have said it , who shall dare unsay ? Le Comte has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yon sun which waneth now To close thy life , or tarnish its bright fame , Shall never rise for thee again , or rise But to beheld thy brand forever fixed . Gerardo . Gerardo Hush ! it is not a hero 's part to mock The fallen with their wo ! Barri . Barri I am content To bear thy words . They but reprove thyself , And can not mar the inward consciousness Of my own soul 's approval . Le Comte . Le Comte Shall I never , Not ev'n in this last effort humble thee , Thou insect in my path ? Barri . Barri It is not thus , Nor by such efforts thou may'st humble me ! But thou hast bound me in thy gratitude , ( Which I may not leave unexpressed , ) by this Regard to my last pleasure , here to place , Before the very wall which I redeem , This sign of its redemption ; here to grant That I may breathe my soul out in the arms Almost , of those for whom ' t was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die ! ( Ascending the scaffold . ) My part is done ! My goal is reached ! I stand in triumph here ! Yes , it is triumph thus to guard my trust Ev'n to the scaffold ! What is in that name , That I should dread to have it linked with mine ? It can not brand me at the higher bar To which I hasten . Nor can it ever blot My mem'ry from fond hearts I leave behind , ' T is but its union with the perjured names Of those who did , what I die to avoid , That makes it infamous . The warrior dreads not A warrior 's death , and is not martyrdom More glorious than that ? Le Comte . Le Comte Hold ! not so fast ! There is another to pronounce thy fate , Ere it be sure . Thy foot may yet retrace Its path to earth again ; and thou may'st clasp Thy dearest , who contemns all trusts for thee , Once more to thy freed heart . Barri . Barri No ! never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith betrayed . I will not clasp dishonor to my heart , Nor pass to earth again to be a stain On its fair surface . Here I stand to die ! Le Comte . Le Comte Die then ! But do not burst with thy big purpose Before thou may'st fulfil it ! Thou would'st lose The glory then of dying for thy cause , By dying for thy temper . But they come ! The Angel of Deliverance is nigh ! Now , thou who art so prodigal of life , Pause , till the voice of love restore its power . Enter on the rampart Constanza and Francoli . Barri Barri ( aside . ) Ah yes ! they come . She comes ! mine own Constanza ! Comes to redeem my honor , comes to be Her husband 's judge !  --  And must I take farewell Of that dear one forever ? Death ! I thought Thy bitterness was past ! Constanza , Constanza ( leaning on Francoli . ) Oh now it comes With its full force , upon me ! I was stunned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! support me through my fearful task ! Le Comte , Le Comte ( addressing Constanza . ) A warrior 's salutation welcome thee ! We sheathe our swords and wait for thee to say , If we again shall draw them here . Thou'st heard Our message ; ' t is thy part then to surrender Thy city on our terms , or him who was Its Gov'nor , on what terms thou see'st , by still Preserving that . We ask thy choice between them . Barri . Barri O let Cezelli 's daughter make the choice Cezelli would approve , or Barri dictate . Forget our love ! Yes , now forget ev'n that ! Think but of Barri 's honor ; be not thou The one to set the seal upon its fall . Do not betray my trust ev'n for my life ! What is a traitor 's life ? And that were mine Should'st thou  --  Le Comte . Le Comte ' T is not for thee to guide her choice ! Let it be free , uninfluenced , her own . Constanza , Constanza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , I knew He was mine own , my noble Barri still ! Gerardo . Gerardo Let not the sun set on thy hesitation ! Constanza . Constanza I do not hesitate ! My choice is made ! But I would find the words to utter it . O can not I die ? May not my life fill The measure , of your stern barbarity ? My fortune , life , accept ! For they are mine ! And willingly , God knows how willingly I would resign them for his sake ! Ay , thank Your clemency , which would receive them from me ! But must I choose ?  --  And is there no reprieve ? O would you but accept the sacrifice Of all save him ! Le Comte . Le Comte We asked thy choice alone , On our conditions . Constanza . Constanza Then , that choice is made . All that is mine I give to ransom him ; The city is the King 's ,  --  my honor , God 's ! Not ev'n for Barri may I forfeit them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee space Still further to reflect , ere thou shalt say The final word which may not be recalled . Constanza . Constanza I ' ve said it ! Are the words so pleasant to you That you would hear them o'er again ? Le Comte . Le Comte We wait For softer humor to revoke their sternness . Barri . Barri Monster ! unfeeling , waste thy taunts on me ! Mock not at her , because her soul can feel , And thine is senseless ! Le Comte . Le Comte Does the victim 's cry Stay the raised knife that wavers over it ? Gerardo . Gerardo Le Comte ! I blush for thee ! Restrain thy speech ! Is death a merriment , that thou should'st sport With those who stand the nearest on its brink ? Le Comte . Le Comte Only from thee would I endure such show Of sovereignty , nor always ev'n from thee . Break thou our league , and I will break our friendship . I am not tamely bound to bear thine insults , Because ' t is thou insultest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not mistake equality for pride . I would not break our league , nor mar our friendship , Nor would I make my friendship less for thee By suffering faults where I might teach improvement . Le Comte . Le Comte Thou art intolerable ! But we will speak Another time of this ;  --  Now let us haste To bring the crisis on , of life , or death . Gerardo . Gerardo But ' t is not sunset yet . Le Comte . Le Comte Right , she may play Till then the patriot . She may yet retain Her lion 's skin . That moment will unmask her . Enter Hercules on the rampart , running to Constanza . Constanza . Constanza My child ! my fatherless child , art thou too come To see thy father die ? But linger not In such a place , my boy , lest thy pure blood Congeal , and pause in ice-drops at its source . The veil must not be lifted to unfold Such sights as thy young soul ne'er dreamt of yet . Trust still that earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will darken at thy gaze ! Barri , Barri ( aside . ) My son ! my son ! My little orphan boy ! O it is hard To leave this clinging earth , too sweet , alas , With all its bitterness ! Hard ! Did I murmur ? It is thy will , Oh God ! Then be it mine ! Le Comte . Le Comte Time wanes : perhaps thy firmness , now May fail ! If so , thou may'st e'en yet recall Thine answer , for we would not have thee war Against thy nature . And if tears are signs Of its returning power , thy second thought May prove indeed less patriotic , but More like a wife 's , a woman 's , and a mother 's . Constanza . Constanza Thou dost mistake me then ! My answer 's made , Or choice , or judgment , or whatever name You give to that which had no need till now Of any , and I do not sport with words ; ' T is Barri 's choice , ' t is honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled ! I know my heart May break , but it would still retain that purpose , With its last gasp . Francoli . Francoli But let me urge thee now , To seek some rest from grief . The sun declines , Thou hast endured too much already ; more Thou may'st not bear . Thy soul is tir 'd with anguish . Let me support thy steps , but linger not ! Constanza . Constanza Shall I desert his death-bed ? Yes , that is His death-bed , though a scaffold . I will watch Till all is o'er . This comfort shall be his , To know at least friends look on him , when more They may not do . Barri . Barri O this is bliss indeed , To see thee to the last ! But thou can'st not Endure the shock , the rush from life to death . No ! no ! thou must not let me die alone , Unpitied and unmoved . Gerardo . Gerardo And we must tear Such nobleness from earth ? Le Comte . Le Comte Thou'st said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . Enter Genevra on the rampart . Genevra . Genevra Then all is lost indeed ! Constanza ! Oh , Where shall I turn ? My brother  --  do I see thee Thus , like a guilty thing ? And thou art doomed , And I have now no brother ! Barri . Barri Do not mourn My gentle sister , for I do not mourn To die for those I love , when I could live , Only to be an infamy to them . Genevra . Genevra 195 An infamy ? A blessing ! Thou hast been A thing for me to twine my soul around , And live but in the embrace ! Yet can I not Die , though I would , with thee . Ye iron men , Whose armor is your emblem , if there be One spark of mercy left within your breasts , O change the victim  --  let me die for him ? Barri . Barri Genevra ! be my sister still ! I die , I must . There is no chance or wish remaining , That I should live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let not thy pleading change me ! Do not regret me thus , but think of me When I am gone , as of a happy spirit Which hovers near thee , till it may recall Its loved ones to it , in that blessed sphere Where friends part not , and malice may not come . Till then farewell , my sister ! Do not weep For me , but joy that I may die at last For that my life has failed to benefit . Genevra . Genevra My brother ! O my brother , speak not thus ! Say not farewell ! O say it not ! ' t will be Enough to know the dreadful certainty Without this quiet parting . Enter on the rampart , Bernis and Citizens . Ah ! thou'st come . Bernis , and thou , and thou , brave citizens ! Come to behold your Gov'nor sacrificed , A pleasant spectacle , and well attended ! What is your fee , my chiefs , for such a sight ? Le Comte . Le Comte Lady , had'st thou not better seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost The balance of discretion . Genevra . Genevra Yes , I know , That I am wild  --  ' t is strange I should be ! There is no cause , not any for such passion ! I come to see my brother die , that ' s all ! I 've seen him live , but that is ended now . And I would trespass on your courtesy For this last sight of him . My gallant friends , Look well and measure by his nobleness Your own degeneracy ! Citizen . Citizen O might my blood Be shed for his , it should revoke those words . Genevra . Genevra It can not be , so thou may'st safely boast . Citizens . Citizens Boast ? ' t is not boasting ! By his blood I swear That mine should be the first to flow for him . Ay , and it shall be , fellow citizens ! Stand we thus tamely to behold him die Who should stand first among us ? One bold stroke And all is ours ; and Barri is restored . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? who would the readiest prove His patriotism , his loyalty , his valor , Let him stand forth and join me ! Sound the alarm ! The drum ! The drum ! Ho ! to the rescue ! All ! To Barri 's rescue ! Strike ! The day 's our own ! Constanza . Constanza His rescue ! O my God ! My soul was nerved ' Gainst every misery , but not for this . This weight of joy ,  --  it is too much ! Support me ! Francoli . Francoli Had'st thou but gone before ! Bernis . Bernis Ye madmen , pause ! Touch not your arms ! Is't thus you 'd sacrifice Leucate too , with Barri ? For ' t were vain To speak of rescuing him with such a band ! Look to the foe ! They 're armed , prepared . The guards Have closed round Barri . Citizens . Citizens Let them be prepared ! We are resolved ! Bernis . Bernis Resolved for what ? To break Your word , your faith , given in a soldier 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , So traitorous to his cause ? Let him stand forth , And abdicate all claims henceforth to rights He would annihilate , by his example ! Besiegers Besiegers ( shout . ) Come on ! Come on ! We 'll give you welcoming ! Genevra . Genevra What have I caused ? What have I done ? Ah me ! Le Comte , Le Comte ( to besiegers . ) Peace ! Peace ! It is from you  --  Leucate 's chiefs , I ask an explanation . What are we To deem from this ? Do you decline to keep Engagements with your foes ? Or know you not The practices of War ? Bernis . Bernis Ask not of us ! We keep engagements , but we can not keep Men 's passions always bridled at our will . ' T was but a sudden swell , a passing gust , A flash , like summer lightning , leaving all As tranquil as before . Genevra . Genevra Why said'st thou not As horrible as death ? Bernis . Bernis But hasten now Before the thunder gathers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we once more permit The lady to declare if still her choice Be firm . Constanza . Constanza Firm ! Firm ! Am I not firm ?

Let him speak , if aught He has to say to those who fain would hear . Le Comte . Le Comte We want no dying speeches ! Gerardo . Gerardo Thou can'st not Deny this only privilege to one , Who , I dare pledge myself , will not betray it . Genevra . Genevra O then my time has come ! And have I lived To see this hour ? Hercules . Hercules Mamma ! mamma ! Constanza . Constanza My child ! Turn not thine eyes that way . O I am faint ! Francoli . Francoli Had'st thou not better go , ev'n now ? Constanza . Constanza Go ! where ? Away from Barri , at this latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! Seek not Again to move my purpose ! I will never Leave him in life , nor can death long divide us . ' T is sweet to breathe the air he breathes , to catch The breeze which wafts his parting sigh to me . But hark ! he speaks ! That voice ! Thine arm again ! Barri . Barri My fellow-citizens ! Ye who have been Even the strong in hand and brave in heart , He who was once of you , would now express His hearty thanks for all your services , While yet he may . Our path has ever been , Till now , together ; but the parting comes . Yours , fellow-citizens , I know will be , As it has been before , a glorious one . My course must cease on earth  --  Oh God ! resume Its thread where earthly passions can not come To serve it again !  --  To you , Defenders Of what was once my city and my home , But can not now be ev'n my grave ,  --  I leave All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , My sister , friends , companions of that life Which now has reached its limit .

I should more need your pity if I lived , But now I need it not , I wish it not ! My nearer , dearer , most familiar friends , Farewell ! Constanza ! O , I thank thy choice , Ev'n with my dying words !  --  And I would speak Of many things to thee , my love ! But now That were but aggravation , for thou know'st Well all that I would say ; and well I know All thou would'st answer . Let that pass , my soul Has little more to do with words of earth .

I had wished , Could I have lived with honor , to have seen My son the pride and glory of my years . I too had other dreams , ev'n of myself ; And brilliant hopes of fame ; but they are past ! All , all is past , and earth is passing from me , And I shall pass from earth ; yet there are hearts I shall not pass from .  --  But I would not have My mem'ry there be sorrowful , but sweet . O I will pray , thus leaning o'er the grave , For those loved ones !  --  Be theirs a happier fate ! Father ! be thou the father of my child , And lead him through life 's wildering maze , still thine ! Be thou her father ! be thy holy word Her consolation and her happiness ! And never let a murmur , though unsaid , Find echo in her farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all , I pray ! My friends and foes !  --  They are alike to one Who stands before his Maker .

Once more , my friends , farewell !  --  God ! in thy hands I leave them , for their trust is in thy power . And to that power I yield submissively ; Not to the might of man . Farewell ! farewell ! Sister , and wife ! and child !  --  O think of me , But not with sorrow . Citizens , farewell ! And I would gaze once more upon those towers . Where I have often lingered at this hour . Adieu , dear native scenes ! I gaze on ye For the last time !  --  And thou , bright Sun ! Yet stop Till I have taken my last fond look of earth ; To night we go together !
