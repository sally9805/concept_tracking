txt There is much in the political history of the United States , from the first formation of the Government up to the present day , of an entirely novel , and at the same time highly gratifying character . If we are not mistaken , the proceedings that have recently taken place in reference to the economical policy of the country , will be regarded as belonging to this class . The approaching extinction of the public debt , which will render it practicable to effect a considerable reduction in the revenue , has naturally called the attention of the people to the form , in which this reduction may best be made ; and the varieties of opinion and feeling which prevail on this subject in different parts of the country , have given to the discussion a degree of interest , which it might not otherwise have possessed . Under these circumstances , it would have been natural enough to expect , that the partisans of the two leading opinions would have exhibited a good deal of intemperance , and , perhaps , have resorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so frequently employed for the attainment of political objects . We are able to say , however , and we say it with satisfaction and patriotic pride , that the question has , thus far at least , been argued , for the most part , on both sides , with a gravity and good temper entirely suited to its importance , and highly honorable to the American character . For the purpose of presenting their respective views to the // consideration of Congress and the People in a distinct and authoritative form , the friends and opponents of the protection of domestic industry have respectively assembled in Convention by their delegates , including , in both cases , many citizens of the highest eminence for character and talent , and composed , in general , of the best informed and most intelligent members of the community . The Philadelphia Convention , which represented the interests that support the character of plaintiffs in this great l ) olitical cause , published an address to the People , setting forth the nature and extent of their supposed grievances . To this declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Convention , and the case has thus been fsirly opened before the country . Arrangements have been made on both sides for presenting to Congress , during the approaching session , a memorial and a countermemorial , respectively affirming and contesting the conclusions of the two addresses . Measures were also taken by the New York Convention , for spreading before the People in the form of reports from various committees , as full and distinct an account as could be procured of the present state of our domestic industry in all its branches , and of the manner in which it is affected by the protecting policy . Where the discussion is left by the two memorials , it will be taken up by the members of Congress , who will express their opinions on the sub ject , and the case having thus been argued in a more solemn and imposing form , than , perhaps , any other of the same description ever was before , will be finally submitted to the consideration of the People ,  --  -  --  the jury , which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot*.boxes , upon every question of law or fact which comes up in the administration of the Government . These proceedings have thus far been marked , at every stage , and in every important particular , with a decorum and propriety , in the highest degree creditable to the individuals immediately concerned in them , and to the character of the country . The two Conventions were composed and organized , with a fi*ted determination on both sides , to keep them entirely free from any connexion with the local and personal politics of the day . Although the Philadelphia Convention was made up for the most part of delegates from States , which support the present administration of the General government , some of the most active and conspicuous mem // bers were from other quarters of the Union , and of opposite parties . The address was drafted by a gentleman , who had been just before drawn by circumstances into very direct collision with the President of the United States . The New York Convention , on the other hand , consisting to a considerable extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placed one of its warm adherents at their head as President , and employed others on their principal committees . Pains were taken in both to repress all unsuitable demonstrations of feeling , to avoid the wasting of time in tedious and unprofitable debates , and to give a practical , business-like character to the proceedings . The result , with some trifling exceptions , corresponded remarkably well in both cases with these intentions , and without disparagement to the wisdom and talent habitually displayed in the great council of the nation , we think that even that august body might derive some useful lessons , in regard to the manner of transacting business , from the doings of these two assemblies . Spontaneous meetings of this description have been frequent in this country at every period of its history . It was justly remarked at the close of the New York address , that such Conventions originated our glorious Revolution and our admirable Constitution . ' The holding of these two assemhlies was , therefore , a measure entirely in accordance with the genius of our Government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are inclined to think that they will be reckoned hereafter among the most interesting and memorable meetings of the kind , and that their general effect will be decidedly good . However sectional or personal views and interests may ,  --  as they always must to a considerable extent ,  --  affect the course of political affairs , it is next to im. * possible , that a discussion , conducted in this grave and dignified manner , with a deliberation which gives the people opportunity for mature reflection at every stage of the process , should not greatly enlighten the public tuind , and tend ultimately to the promotion of the real interests of the country . We are strongly disposed to believe , as we sincerely hope , that the decision to which the people may come after so long , so dis- passionate , and so anxious an examination of the subject , will be universally satisfactory , and will settle this great question for ever . The two addresses respectively issued by the two Conven .. // tions , though somewhat different in character , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantageous form the opinions of the two parties . That of the Philadelphia Con-. vention , considered as a mere literary composition , is , perhaps , more finished and elegant than the other ; but , as an argument , is certainly much less elaborate and complete , and to us much less satisfactory . The general outline of the plan is the same in both . They take up successively the great questions of the constitutionality and the policy of the protection of domestic industry , and allege such facts and arguments , as are fitted to influence the public mind in favor of their respective views . In the Philadelphia address , the argument against the constitutionality of protecting duties is not , however , presented as the opinion of the members of the Convention , but as that of a numerous and respectable portion of the American people . ' A numerous and respectable portion of the American people , ' says the address , do not merely complain that the system is unjust , but they question the right to establish it . They do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to enact it . ' It is understood that most of the delegates from the Southern States , constituting a majority of the whole body , were of this opinion . Most of the delegates from the North , on the other hand , while they denied the expediency of a protecting tariff , admitted its constitutionality , and rather than permit it to be even called in question , by any act to which they were parties , had made up their minds to secede from the Convention . Under these circumstances , it was agreed , for the purpose of avoiding an open rupture , and the consequent complete failure of all the objects of the meeting , that the argument on the constitutional question should be brought into the address , in the indirect form in which it appears . Even this arrangement was regarded by many of the Northern members as too large a concession ; and Mr. Gallatin , decidedly the leader of this party , moved , as an amendment to the address , that the whole section should be struck out . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly improved . The constitutional argument is , undoubtedly , much feebler than any other part , and whatever strength or plausibility is to be found in the address , must be looked for in the discussion of the respective economical results of the two systems . // In the New York address , on the contrary , the constitutional argument is decidedly the strongest part , and will be regarded ,  --  we think ,  --  by every competent and impartial judge ,  --  as unanswerable . The economical discussion ,  - -  although occasionally deficient in firmness and precision ,  - -  is elaborate , powerful , rich in details , and , on the whole , exceedingly satisfactory . The tone of both these documents is candid , temperate and conciliatory ; such , in short , in all respects , as became the dignity of the bodies from which they proceeded . It is much to be desired , that these examples of good temper and moderation in the high places of the two parties , may have their effect upon the minor organs of the same opinions , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bitterness that occasionally exhibits itself , especially in the anti-tariff p*ipers . We have remarked above , that the solemn and deliberate examination which this great question is now going through by the Government and People of the United States , must produce in the end much good ; and we will now add , that it has already , in this first stage of its progress , produced one most important and valuable result , that of settling the question respecting the constitutionality of protecting duties . We have expressed on former occasions , and need not here recapitulate , the opinions we entertain on this subject . They are substantially the same with those , which are embodied in a far superior form in the New York address . The opposite opinions , on the other hand , have been urged in various quarters with much earnestness and apparent conviction . In a controverted case of this description , it is difficult for the parties themselves to form a coi'rect estimate of the weight and value of their own argumnents ,  --  and still more so for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one way or another an actual trial of strength . Such trials have , no doubt , been had previously on a limited scale , in the numerous encounters of wits that have taken place in reference to this question in Congress and elsewhere . Some of these have been of a highly interesting character , and managed on both sides with great ability , particularly the debate on the tariff of 1824 , in the House of Representatives of the United States , in which Mr. Clay and Mr. Webster stood forth respectively *s the champions of the opposite opinions . But at that time , the constitutional question had been scarcely suggested , and was // but little dwelt upon by the distinguished opponents , who , as they are now entirely agreed upon the whole subject , would at that time have hardly differed upon this point . Even in 1828 , this objection had not acquired the importance which it has since assumed , and did not , of course , engage in a very great degree the attention of the leading debaters . Since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until it had come to be considered by the opponents of protection , as their principal argument . It was , therefore , natural and proper , that on this great and solemn occasion , it should be fairly met . In the New York address , it is accordingly brought forward as the leading topic , and treated in a full , deliberate ,  --  and we think we may say , without fear of contradiction by any impartial person competent to judge ,  --  decisive way . We consider it impossible for any such person to read with proper care the argument on the two sides of this question , as stated in these two addresses , without acknowledging ,  --  what .. ever may have been his previous impressions ,  --  that the objection is answered . Even the authors of the Philadelphia address must , . - we think ,  --  feel this . The public , at all events , can not but see it . It is not , however , merely the superiority of the argument brought forward on this occasion in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been urged on the other side , which makes us regard the question as settled , although this , perhaps , might fairly be considered as sufficient ground for such an opinion . We are confirmed in it by the diversity of sentiment , which exhibited itself at the Philadelphia Convention , upon this subject . If all those who disapprove a protecting tariff , believed it to be unconstitutional , and all who approve it believed it to be constitutional , there might be room to suspect in this , as in other parts of the subject , the influence of some sectional interest or prejudice . But this is not the case ; for while , on the one hand , the friends of the protecting policy universally believe it to be constitutional , its opponents are not agreed in the opposite opinion . It was known before , and has been more distinctly shown by the proceedings at Philadelphia , that of those who doubt or deny the expediency of the tariff , a large and most respectable portion , including many of the ablest members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be constitutional . With these persons , there is no room for the suspicion of any im // 184 The Two Conventions . proper influence from personal or sectional interests . The bias , if there be any , is all the other way . It was in direct opposition to the strong inclination , which every man naturally feels to adopt all the opinions of the party with which he generally agrees , as well as at the risk of an open rupture and a complete failure of all the purposes of the meeting , that the minority of the Philadelphia Convention refused even to take the question of constitutionality into consideration . It was necessarily in opposition to the same strong influences , and under the impulse of the mere force of truth , that Mr. Verplanck has since written his letter to Colonel Drayton , containing by far the ablest and most lucid exposition which has yet appeared of the single point , decisive in itself of the whole question , which he undertook to treat . This mass of unsuspected testimony from the other party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the affirmative side , does , we confess , appear to us to place the question beyond dispute . A few heated partisans may continue to profess , and , perhaps , to feel the same conviction , which they professed and felt before ; but the community at large can not shut their eyes upon these things , and seeing them as they must , can not resist the conclusion to which they necessarily lead . We repeat , therefore , that we consider the question of the constitutionality of the protecting duties as settled for ever . We do not believe that any statesman , who values his reputation , will in future undertake to contest it ,  --  that any writer of judgment will venture to make it a matter of serious argument . The tribe of secondary politicians may be for a while as clamorous as ever in the newspapers , and , perhaps , in Congress , but not finding themselves countenanced by men in whom the public repose confidence , they will gradually change their tone , and the doctrine of the constitutionality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally acknowledged and uncontroverted truths . We consider this result as a great point gained . The settlement of this question takes the sting out of the opposition to the , protecting policy , and throws the matter open ,  --  like any other of ordinary legislation ,  --  to fair , dispassionate discussion . It deprives the nullifiers of the only pretext , upon which they have yet ventured to justify their extravagant pretensions . It is not ,  --  even on their own showing ,  --  any abuse // of power , however open and oppressive , that *viI1 authorize a resort to the grand newly-discovered remedy . There must be , in the language of the Virginia Resolutions , an open , palpable , and dangerous assumption of powers not granted by the Constitution . The courts of justice had before solemnly decided , in repeated instances , that in the case of tle pro-. tecting duties there is no assumption of pow/er not granted by the Constitution . But the nullifiers would not admit the competency of the courts of justice , to pass upon this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interests which they undertook to support , so peculiar and sacred , as to place them entirely out of the reach of all common rules . The case has now been still more solemnly argued , and we undertake to say , not less distinctly decided against them in the open court of public opinion . To the jurisdiction of this tribunal no exception can be taken , and from its decree no appeal can be made . The quiet and bloodless ol ) eration of the ballot-box , more effective than the marshal 's truncheon or the terrors of the posse comitatus , enforces it at once against the fiercest opposition . Vaporing and violence are lost upon the returning officer . When the public opinion has fully declared itself at the polls , the citizen must acquiesce or return to private life . When this alternative is fairly presented to them , it is not uncommon for a new light to burst very suddenly on the most determined adherents of the unsuccessful party . One great good has , therefore , already resulted from this discussion , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting duties . From the farther progress and termination of the inquiry , we anticipate , as we have already remarked , a similar result in regard to the question of expediency , the other principal point connected with the sUbject . This is a question of somewhat larger scope than the other , and not so readily decided by a few striking facts and cogent arguments . The principles involved in it are less certain , or , at least , less universally acknowledged ; and the application of them requires the knowledge of a great variety of details , which have not yet been fully spread before the public . Much has , however , been done within a few years to supply this deficiency , and the proceedings of the New York Convention will aid very powerfully in the accomplishment of the object . Coinmittees were there appointed upon all the principal branches // of domestic industry . Some of them reported immediately to the Convention , while others reserved their reports to be transinitted to the permanent committee of that body . There is reason to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light all the facts which are important to be known : and when facts are clearly ascertained and agreed upon , there is rarely much dispute among intelligent men about principles ; that is , about the general propositions , in which these facts are to be expressed . The extent to which our domestic fabrics have advanced under the influence of the protecting policy , the rapidity with which they are advancing , and the beneficial effect which their progress has produced upon the comfort of all classes of society , are not yet fully appreciated by the public . The present discussion will throw a strong light upon all these points , and ,  --  if we are not greatly deceived ,  --  will satisfy the most prejudiced minds . A system founded on the immovable basis of truth , and carrying with it , as this does , triumphant proof of its value in its steady , brilliant , and constantly progressive success ,  --  must surely make proselytes very rapidly , and command , at no distant period , the universal acquiescence of the people . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal examination of the argument upon either of the great branches of the subject . We could scarcely hope to add any thing to the elaborate and perspicuous statements , that are given in the New York address . Nor is the moment , when new researches have been instituted into the state of facts , particularly favorable for a discussion of principles . We shall , therefore , on the present occasion , confine ourselves to a few observations on the effect of the approaching extinction of the public debt , upon the financial and economical measures of the Government . r1*he public debt ,  --  should no unforeseen circumstances occur ,  --  will be extinguished on the 1st of January , 1833 , and the annual appropriation of ten million dollars , which is now by law regularly made for this purpose , will no longer be required . If the duties remain the same as before , this sum would , of course , be added to the ordinary surplus of the revenue over the expenditure . This surplus amounts , for the last year , to seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three . With the addition of the ten millions that become disposable by the extinction of the debt , it // would rise , of course , to about twelve . After the period of the extinction of the debt , and supposing the sources of revenue to be the same as before , there xviii remain , therefore , in the hands of the Government , an annual surplus of revenue over expenditure , of about twelve million dollars . How is this surplus to be appropriated ? What financial measures ought to be adopted , to meet this crisis of a new description ? The plan which naturally suggests itself at once , as the appropriate remedy for the difficulty in question , is to reduce the revenue by repealing a part of the duties , and as the occurrence of this crisis furnishes no motive for changing the policy of the country in regard to the protection of domestic industry , it is equally apparent that the necessary reduction should he made , by repealing the duties on such foreign articles as do not enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly , been proposed already in various quarters , and particularly in the New York Convention . It appears to have met with general approbation , and xviii be found , we apprehend , on full examination , completely adequate to the emergency . The precise extent to which the revenue may be reduced , by a repeal of the ditties on such foreign articles as do not enter into competition with the products of our own industry , has not yet been ascertained with perfect exactness .

This surplus is the fund out of which tile Government IntIst regularly provide for accidental deficiencies in the reventie , unforeseen excesses of expenditure , and internal improvements . Four or five millions would be considered ,  --  we suppose ,  --  as a moderate estimate of the amount necessary for these objects , taking them all on the very lowest scale . It is apparent , 188 Jan. // therefore , that even on the system of those , who are most anxious to reduce the revenue of the country as nearly as possible to a level with the ordinary expenditure , the ap-with proaching crisis in our finances will not be attended any real difficulty , or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the anti-tariff writers , who are anxious to turn this crisis to account for the purpose of prostrating the manufactures of the country , and who are apparently aware , that it may be fairly met by a repeal of the duties on articles which do not enter into competition with our own products , have endeavored to throw odiun upon this measure , by representing it as favoring the wealthy at the expense of the poor . It is unjust , they say , and impolitic to repeal the duties on foreign luxuries , and leave them in force upon the necessaries and comforts of life . Such is substantially the language of the New York Evening Post , a paper from which ,  --  considering the well known intelligence of the editor and principal contributors ,  --  we should have expected a more correct and statesman-like view of the subject . What , in fact , is the real operation of a repeal of the duties on tea , coffee , wines , and the other articles enumerated in the above estimate ? Obviously to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comfort and luxtiry , which are now exclusively enjoyed by the rich . The latter can afford to purchase their tea , coffee , wines and spices , at wlmtsoever rates they may be sold . The difference in their prices , resulting from a repeal of the duties , would be hardly felt as an advantage by men of large property . But there are numerous families , comprising , in fact , what may be called the mass of the community , whose incomes are limited , and who can not afford to ptmrchase these articles , excepting at certain limited prices . Here , then , is a measure , which brings within the reach of this extensive and important portion of the peoJ ) le , a variety of comforts and luxuries , which they either could not enjoy at all before , or could only enjoy in much more limited quantities . In good earnest , is this favoring the rich at the expense of'the poor ? The antitariff writers are not entirely destitute of intelligence . They are not , we hope , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it to their candor and good sense , to say , whether a law , which , without conferring any material benefit upon the rich , puts the middling and lower classes in possession // of comforts and luxuries which they would not otherwise enjoy , is a tax upon the poor for the benefit of the rich ? Can such a proposition , fairly stated , be maintained for a moment ? Will the most daring , the least scrupulous of the party writers undertake to say a single word in support of it ? Yet such is the doctrine , which has been gravely advanced in papers of high authority ,  --  papers , which , on former occasions , have put forth claims to all the light that there is in circulation on the subject of political economy , and have denounced the friends of the protection of domestic industry as a set of ignorant pretenders . In the same way , the protecting duties on foreign manufactures are often represented as taxes on the poor . What is the real state of the case ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging the production of the domestic one , which can be furnished without any charge for transportation , reduces the price , and supplies the consumer at a lower rate than before . This is the general principle laid down by all the writers on political economy , from the time of Adam Smith and Alexander Hamilton to the present day . If there were any doubt about it , the experience of the United States has amply demonstrated its truth . Every article that has been made the subject of a protecting duty , is now sold cheaper than it was before the duty was imposed . In some important cases , the present price of the protected article is below the rate of duty on the corresponding foreign one , although we are gravely told in tho Philadelphia address , that the reduction of prices , ' occasioned , as the authors suppose , by certain accidental causes , has necessarily stopped at a point which is ascertained by adding the amount of duty to the price of the imported article . ' If it were necessary , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop at this point , and we find , in fact , that prices have fallen a great deal lower , does not this very circumstance prove , that their system is false ? Will they continue to adhere to it , when its leading principles are thus directly at variance with acknowledged facts ? However this may he , the people of the United States are of course intelligent enough to perceive , that a law , which reduces the price of most of the ordinary necessaries and comforts of life , is not a tax upon the poor for the benefit of the rich . In fact , the operation of the American system , as it will probably be modified by the approaching crisis in our financial affairs , while it is in a great measure indifferent to the wealthy , is // directly favorable in all its principal features to the middling and poorer classes of the community . The duties levied on foreign articles of common use , by encouraging the production of domestic articles of a similar kind at less expense , enable the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper rates , while the repeal , which will probably take l ) lace of most of the duties on foreign articles not coming into competition with our own 1 ) roducts , will bring within the reach of the same classes a variety of comforts and luxuries , which they could not enjoy before . Sophistry may do its best , but will never be able to convince the mass of the people , that such a system is opposed to their interests . It is apparent , however , as we have already remarked , that even on the view of those who are most inclined to reduce the revenue to the level of the ordinary expenditure , there is no real difficulty in the approaching financial crisis . We have shown , satisfactorily as we trust , that all the reduction which is necessary to meet this crisis , even on this view , may be made without infringing on the principle of protection . For ourselves , we do not profess to feel any peculiar anxiety on the subject , and although we shall cheerfully acquiesce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into competition with our own products , should such a measure be thought expedient by the Government , we should be quite willing to dispense with it , and to leave the Government for a few years in possession of an annual surplus of twelve or fourteen millions . By the force of circumstances , this surplus would gradually diminish . The object of protecting duties is to build up home manufactures , and discourage the importation of the corresponding foreign articles . As fast as they accomplish this object , they of course become less productive , until they finally cease to afford any revenue at all . The duty on cotton is merely nominal ; that on cotton fabrics will soon become so ; and the case will be the same with all the others , as soon as the domestic manufactures protected by them are sufficiently flourishing to supply the market . The surl ) lus , therefore , would be constantly diminishing , and , in the mean time , might , while it lasted , be turned to very good account for the promotion of internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great distrust on the expenditure of money for this purpose , by the General Government ; some denying the constitutional power , and others the expediency of // exercising it , if it exist . But when we recollect , how often tens and hundreds of millions have been annually expended for many years in succession , by almost all nations , for the insane purpose of destroying life and capital , we should not regret to see one nation trying for once the experiment of a liberal annual appropriation to objects of general utility . Supposing a stirl ) 1u5 of ten millions to be applied to such objects for only ten years , what important results might not be obtained ! How many roads and canals might be laid out through regions , that are now suffering from the absence of such communications ! How many literary , benevolent , and pious institutions , might be founded , or restored from the languishing state into which they have sunk for want of funds ! A single annual appropriation of the amount just mentioned , would place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public library , or establish in each a well endowed university , and thus open , in either cas2 , a perpetual and never-failing spring of knowledge , virtue , and civilization , through all the coming ages . When we reflect , how much of the success and prosperity of a whole community has often resulted from the influence of some one good institution , we may venture to say , without passing the bounds of moderation , that an expenditure for purposes of internal improvement , of the amount and for the time just mentioned , would , in many important particulars , l ) ut a new face upon the country , and materially affect , in the most favorable manner , the future fortunes of the people . We are aware , that works of every kind are executed under the direction of the Government with somewhat less economy than by individuals , and that in the disposal of a fund of this description , there would necessarily creep in a good deal of favoritism and jobbing . Some States would obtain a little less , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common benefit . But what then ? The State that should be least favored in the distribution , would make more progress in these ten years , in the way of public works and improvements , than she could possibly do by any other means in a century . To renounce these solid and permanent advantages , because some other State might derive still greater ones from the same source , would argue a very slender portion of worldly wisdom , as well as of that purer spirit of kindness and union , that ought to prevail among the different members of a family of sister Republics . For these reasons , we should not be opposed , individually , // to the continuance , for a while , of all the duties on their present footing , and an appropriation of the surplus revenue , whatever it might be , to works of internal improvement . We have little expectation , however , that this course will be adopted ; hut we trust , that whatever reduction may be made , a definite , and not too scanty sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a million or even half a million a year to public works , would in time effect great things . At all events , we feel a pleasure in reflecting , that , according to every view which may be taken of the subject , there will he no necessity for extending the repeal of the duties so far , as to interfere with the principle of protection . The last of the works , of which the titles are prefixed to the present article , is an address delivered at New York , hy Mr. Edward Everett , before the American Institute , at their annual fair , which was held a short time previous to the meeting of the New York Convention . It is a simple , lucid , and dispassionate statement of the argument on all the leading points of the subject , and is said to have contributed much , in connexion with the proceedings of the Convention , towards the production of the change of sentiment in regard to the protecting policy , which is now so rapidly taking place in the great emporium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlarge on the topics successively treated in the address ; and this is the less necessary , as it has already obtained a very general circulation through the newspapers . For those who have not yet perused it , the following passages , which form the conclusion , will serve as a specimen . The present manufacturing system of the United States may be considered , partly as the result of the revenue laws of 1789 , which remained without essential changes till the embargo of 1807 , and partly as the effect of that and the other restrictive measures , and of the war which followed them . Those branches of industry , which are commonly called the mechanic arts , received , for the most part , though not without exception , an ample protection under the former laws ; manufactures on a large scale , requiring great capital and skill , owed their existence to the total interruption of commerce . In the combined result , a very large amount of American capital was , at the peace of 1815 , found invested in manufactures . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those of the South among the foremost , that this capital ought to be protected ; and the success which // had attended some of the manufactures , on a large scale , had produced some change in the public opinion , as to the capacity of the country to support them . At this period , however , and for several years after , it is well known , that the current of opinion ran strongly against the protection of manufactures , by high duties , in the commercial parts of the Union . By slow degrees , the manufacturing system has won its way to greatly increased favor , even in those parts of the country where our commerce principally centres . The question , both as one of principle and fact , is better understood by the lights of experience . It is now recollected , that our navigation , at the moment of its extreme depression , was raised up under a system of protecting duties . The obligation of protecting capital invested under the pledge of the public faith , against foreign legislation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every evil predicted as likely or certain to follow from the manufacturing system , has failed to arrive . High prices were foretold . The acquisition of skill and the perfection of machinery have enabled the manufacturer to afford his fabrics at greatly reduced , but not unprofitable prices . A defalcation of the revenue was predicted . The revenue , instead of falling off , has steadily sustained itself ; and instead of being obliged to resort to direct taxes , which , it was supposed as late as 1824 , both by friend and foe , we should have to do , we are now threaten9d with a national crisis proceeding from an overflowing treasury . Our manufacturing establishments , instead of proving seminaries of vice , as was apprehended , are honorably distinguished for order and morality , as I know from my own observation of the largest in the United States . It was said , that the grass would grow up between the paving stones of our principal commercial cities . It is not so in Boston . You best know how it is in Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and navigation have suffered no diminution . Our ship-yards are in a state of the most profitable activity ; our coasting trade and internal commerce have greatly increased , and a general prosperity pervades the country . One drawback only , and that much to be regretted , exists to the general satisfaction , which this state of things is calculated to inspire ; -I allude , of course , to the dissatisfaction pervading a portion of the Planting States , by whom the laws passed for the protection of American industry , are deemed unconstitutional , and severely oppressive upon their interests . I certainly shall not at this hour engage in a constitutional argument ; but I may observe , that , under a Government organized upon a written constitution , almost every measure is likely to be represented , by its opponents , as unconstitutional . Few prominent measures of // the G&amp;vernment , from its organization , have failed to be considered as unconstitutional , by those opposed to them . The funding system and the assumption of the State debts ,  --  the iBank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alien and Sedition Laws ,  --  the purchase of Louisiana ,  --  the embargo ,  --  the use of the militia in time of war ,  --  the system of internal improveinents ,  --  the provisions of the judiciary act ,  --  and the protection of manufactures , have been successively opposed as unconstitutional . It is , however , an important fact , that this last measure , the protection of manufactures , has but of late years been opposed on that ground . By the first Congress , and many succeeding Congresses , it was not so regarded ; and I have already attempted to show , that , but for the firm belief and ardent hope , that the Federal Constitution would protect and encourage the manufactures of the United States , it would never have been adopted . With the opinion , however , which now prevails at the South , that the application of the Revenue System to the encouragement of manufactures is unconstitutional , it is natural that it should be viewed with particular hostility , as the supposed cause of the depression that exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the real cause of this depression , I firmly believe ; and such is asserted to be the fact , by some of the most intelligent citizens of the Southern States . But it would be gratifying to find reasons to believe , that as a whole , the planting interest in the country is not excluded from a participation in its general prosperity ; and such , I am strongly inclined to believe as well as hope , is the fact . Such is certainly the inference which we should draw from the last census . The State of Louisiana , whose industry is divided between the great staples of cotton and sugar , * regards the present modification of the Revenue System as the source of her prosperity , and has lately been pronounced by the best authority to be in a very prosperous condition . Georgia has , within a year or two , been declared on equal authority to be in a state of almost unexampled prosperity , The State of Tennessee has within a few days been pronounced by her chief magistrate , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says he , has the general welfare of our citizens been more obvious and satisfactory . ' The depression , which for some years has fallen upon the staple of cotton , has not , it is believed , extended to that of rice ; a proog as it would seem , that it can not be the effect of the tariff , which would operate on rice as unfavorably as on cotton ; and even the culture of cotton itself , low * What would be the effect on the cotton planting interest , if , by a repeal of the tariff , the capital and labor employed on sugar , should be turned into cotton ? ' // as the price has sunk , there is good reason to think , is still , with thrift and economy , a profitable branch of industry . I have been lately favored with a minute statement of the average product of five or six cotton plantations in two of the South-western States , ascertained by putting together the income of a good and a bad year . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these plantations yields from fifteen to twenty per cent . clear ; and that the net profit accruing to the proprietor , for the labor of each efficient hand , is two hundred and thirty-seven dollars fifty cents per annum ,  --  being a clear gain of four dollars fifty cents per week . It further appears , that on one of these plantations , ( and the same , though not stated , is believed to hold of the others , in due proportion , ) worth , altogether for land , labor , and stock , ninety-two thousand dollars , the entire amount of articles paying duty annually consumed , is two thousand three hundred dollars . The average crop of this plantation , taking a good and bad year , is fourteen thousand five hundred dollars . Suppose the duties to be thirty-three and a third per cent , . and the whole amount of the duty to be actually assessed , in the shape of an enhanced price of the article , ( the contrary of which is known to be true , for in several articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ) it would amount to less than seven hundred and thirty dollars per annum , on a clear profit of fourteen thousand five hundred dollars . The great wealth of the South is , of course , the product of the labor there performed . The productiveness of this labor must greatly depend on the cost , at which it is sustained . This cost must consist chiefly of that of food and clothing . Food is subject to no duty , nor is there any duty which , except in the most remote and indirect manner , can enhance its price . The annual cost of clothing in the South-western States ,  --  probably in all the States south of thirty-five degrees ,  --  is said to be eight dollars per head . Suppose this supply to come enhanced one third , it is a very small sum , when assessed upon the annual product of the industry of the laborer . These statements are furnished to me on the very highest authority . There is no reason why the plantations , to which they refer , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may he conducted with greater skill and prudence . But there never existed , and never will exist , any branch of industry , which in the long run , will be profitable , in any but skilful and prudent hands . But it is high time to draw these reflections to a close ,  --  which I can not do , without reverting to the agreeable occasion , which has called us together . If any one had before doubted of the // efficacy of a system of legislative protection , it would seem that he might be convinced , by this display of the perfection of the American arts , not one of which , in some stages of its progress , could have sustained itself against the competition of Europe . And should any political catastrophe , now inconceivable , again bring this country under the British Government , the curse of so deplorable a downfall would be chiefly visited on this healthful industry and these productive arts . In that calamitous event , the culture of our Southern staples would again be stimulated by premiums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursery of seamen for the navies of the mother country . Our navigation ( like a chained beast of the forest ) would be again allowed to roam , discontented and daring , between the Antilles and Cape Finisterre ; while the iron arm of the colonial system would fall on our mechanics and manufacturers . The hum of business in our work-shops would cease ; the tilt hammer and the furnace ,  --  where you are daily forging the mute giants , which labor has harnessed to her cars ,  --  would be broken down as a nuisance ; the music of the water-fall would again be wasted on the idle air ; the walls of our capacious factories be left tenantless to crumble ; and the soil of the villages which support them and which they support ,  --  like the soil of captured Jerusalem ,  - -  would be turned with the plough-share and sowed with salt . Every part of the country would , of course , be involved in the wide-spread ruin ; but none so soon and none so utterly , as this magnificent metropolis ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agriculture of the country ,  --  this mighty heart , where the great pulses of its industry beat ,  --  to which the life-blood of two thirds of the Union flows up by a thousand channels , to be again propelled to the farthest villages in the West . New York was not always what it is now . The Revolution found your city small and almost stationary . The return of peace cut off the only existing resource , that of the subsistence of the forces of the enemy , which occupied it ; the influx of foreign fabrics and the navigation laws of Europe confirmed its depression . The mechanics and manufacturers of New York grasped at a General Government with the eagerness of desperation . In the Federal and State Conventions , which framed and adopted the Constitution , they were heard by one of the most persuasive voices that ever spoke through the lips of man ,  --  the voice of the immortal Hamilton , the first great champion of American maimufactures .

It consists of two lectures , which were originally delivered before the Salem Lyceum , and may be regarded as a favorable evidence of the tendency of such institutions to diffuse information , which it is important to the community to acquire , as well as just sentiments upon subjects , that lie within the range of con*mon observation and curiosity Every one has heard of the witchcraft delusion in Salem ; and most of those who are at all familiar with the history of the age in which it appeared , know very well how to estimate the prejudice , which for a long time fastened upon our neighbors of that place a reproach , from which the rest of Ne*v England and the world at large were . ( hsposed to triumph in being wholly free . It is not the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this reproach , by transferring to others their just portion of responsibility ; his historical statement alone would be sufficient for this ; but to give a clear and philosophical view of the origin and progress of this strange imposture , and incidentally , of superstitious notions in general . He has performed this task in a manner , which can not fail to add to the reputation , which he had acquired by his former writings . His style is unaffected and elegant , and his illustrations and re-. flections appropriate and happy . // The plan of Dr. Thacher is rather more extensive . His design is , to take a general and comprehensive view of superstition in its various forms , and to explain the manner in which it is illustrated by reason and philosophy . In the prosecution of this plan , he is naturally led to examine the same portion of history , to which Mr. Upham had already directed the public attention ; but it is proper to state , that his work was written before that gentleman 's ap* ) eared . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting facts , particularly in regard to the power of imagination in producing some of those phenomena , which have confounded the ignorant , and perplexed the wise ; and his publication is valuable , as presenting the views of a clear and judicious observer in an important field of speculation , though somewhat too broad to be comprehended within the limits of so short a treatise . In fact , the history of superstition is more than half of the history of man . But if the errors of former times are only partially unveiled , something may be gained towards the correction of those , which continue to exist ; if we do not reach the highest attainable point of elevation , we may yet be placed high enough , to see that portion of the valley below , from which the mist has rolled away . We are sometimes inclined to believe , that the present generation are raising the shout of victory over superstition , before the enemy has left the field . It would be hazardous to maintain , that the drafts of imposture are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe are deserted by their worshippers . There are yet delusions , and dark ones , too ; we cling with a convulsive grasp to errors , because it seems impossible to us , that any delusion should walk in the noonday of our intellectual light . We look on those of old with indignation and scorn ; and wonder , perhaps , that our fathers should have been so much inferior in sense and reason to ourselves . Yet many a dark page is yet to he written in the history of our race . There are not a few , who listen to the acclamations of military triumph as they would to the trumpet of jubilee , and crown the conqueror with laurels fit only for an angel 's brow , whose hearts burn within them , when they number the victims which witchcraft has hurried to the dungeon and the stake ; while all the blood which superstition ever shed , would be but a rivulet in comparison with that of a single battle-field . This is but one example of the delusions , which // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they have only subdued those errors , which have nothing magnificent about them , to bind them closely to the heart . All will , doubtless , eventually vanish , as spirits are said to disappear with the morning twilight ; but many will outlast the present generation of men ; and while they survive , it is idle to talk of the complete downfall of superstition . In fact , the progress of reason has hardly yet dispelled many of those absurdities , which would seem most likely to fall before it . The mass of mankind are not philosophers , and they regard their own hereditary prejudices as too venerable to be surrendered without an age or two of deliberation , if not of positive and doubtful struggle . They are like those who dwelt near the mountain in Greece , on whose summit the sun shone for hours , before it lighted the valleys . Faith in witchcraft has been banished from the high places of the earth ; it is no more found in the pulpit or the judgment-seat ; but it is still entwined around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely , as the consciousness of their existence . There is no one , whose recollection will not furnish him with abundant evidence of the truth of this remark . It has been our fortune to meet with more than one individual , who did not feel a moment secure from the invasion of evil spirits , unless he carried with him a staff of witch-hazel ; and we remember one in particular , who , having left his talisnan behind him , in his hurry to attend an election , was waylaid by them as he returned home at night , and rolled heels over bead in the most fearful manner . He often related the circumstance with horror ; and , as if anticipating the most natural solution of the mystery , asseverated , that he had partaken no more liberally of the most formidable spirit of all , than he usually did on similar occasions . We have heard of another , who had unfortunately incurred the displeasure of an old woman in his neighborhood . One evening , as he was passing her door with his wain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only parts of their anatomy at all calculated for such an evolution , were lifted straight upwards , by some mysterious impulse ; where they remained , until he was relieved from his dilemma by negotiating a treaty with the author of the mischief . Five years ago , a physician in a neighboring State was indicted for tampering with a pretty material word in a promissory note for nine dollars , so that it was converted into ninety . The only // witness to the forgery was the maker of the note , whose testimony was explicit as to the fact of the alteration . On his cross-examination , he acknowledged , that he had been for a long time , like Andrew Fairservice , fiey 'd wi ' a ghaist , ' until he was compelled to apply to the physician for relief , who exorcised him in part by throwing in the fire a quart of his blood ; and this was the consideration of the note in question . The witches , he said , commonly assumed the shape of some impertinent old ladies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his express commands to the contrary , and smoke their pipes at discretion , without uttering a word . It is , perhaps , needless to say , that this testimony , which might have been sufficient to hang all the parties concerned two centuries ago , produced in this instance only the acquittal of the physician ; hut examples like these , however the wise may scorn them , serve to show that superstition has not yet lost its hold upon the minds of all . In saying , that reason and philosophy have not yet banished all these errors , we do not forget the good they have already done , or under-value their power to do more ; we simply mean , that much of their appropriate work remains to be performed . Their task will be the more arduous , for the reason , that much of what passes under the name of superstition , when divested of its absurdities , is natural to the mind . So far as it merely implies a belief in the existence of spirits , freed from the incumbrances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast ; there is no example of an age or nation , scarcely of the most degraded savage tribe , in which it is not found ; and it is confirmed by the voice within us , which proclaims our victory over the grave . Nor is there any thing very absurd in the persuasion , almost as universal as the other , that the spirit , thus separated from the body , may become obvious to human sense . Many have considered it enough to say in refutation of this , that the abstract idea we form of spirit implies its want of every quality , which could enable it to make its presence perceptible ; and if we could form a perfect idea of what spirit is , the answer would be complete . But the deepest researches of philosophy have left us ignorant of its essence ; we know its existence only through certain of its qualities ; so that , however we may doubt , we can not well deny , that separated spirits may , in some mysterious manner , hold communion with our own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 // enough in favor of ' this persuasion , to induce the great body of mankind to adopt it as an article of faith . With the general mass of superstitious notions , the case is far otherwise . They have scarcely even the slender basis of imagination to stand upon ; and , in treating of superstition in general , it is no easy matter to separate the absurd from the probable , the extravagant from the partially reasonable , blended as they are like the primary colors in all the hues of nature . Their multiplicity , also , is a serious stumbling-block in the way of the inquirer . A venerable divine , two centuries ago , undertook to write a sermon upon every verse of the epistle to the Colossians . We have no recollection , whether his folio was edifying in proportion to its dimensions ; but we doubt , whether that roost ponderous volume would be large enough , to contain the history of superstition . Sir Walter Scott was evidently much embarrassed by this very difficulty ; and one nay rise from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more precise ideas of any particular branch of the science , than he had when he took it up . We are told by Pliny , of a fish , whose various members were so widely extended in the Mediterranean , that it could not pass the Straits of Gibraltar ; and it is about as difficult to give an accurate view of universal superstition , as it would be to make a scientific description of this monopolist of the sea . There is one branch of it , however , which is separate and peculiar . It is the subject of witchcraft , which , as we have already said , occupies the whole of one of the works before us , and a portion of the other ; and the modern history of which can be regarded with no other feelings , than those of disgust and horror . The mind may well be humbled by the reflection , that a wild and fatal delusion like this , springing solely from a mis-apprehension of the meaning of certain terms used in the Scriptures , should have been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the impulses of humanity and mercy . No one at this day believes , that the witches of later ages belonged to the same class with those , against whom Moses denounced the punishment of death . The last were justly regarded by the Hebrew lawgivei ' as a common nuisance , pretending , as they did , to the power of divination and sorcery , and resorting sometimes to the use of poisons , from which their name is derived , to effect their purposes . They seduced the Israelites to the adoration of false // deities ; and this was a crime of peculiar aggravation among a people , who were set apart for the worship of the true God , but were always too ready to return to idolatry . The witchcraft of later times , as Mr. Upham very justly observes , implied a deliberate and formal compact with the Spirit of evil , negotiated with all the precision of a modern indenture ; by which , on the one hand , the witch bound herself to become his subject , and to use all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other , with a portion of his own attributes , engaging , at the same time , to exercise his own supernatural powers , for her advantage and protection . What the witch of the Hebrews really was , is explained in that remarkable passage of Scripture , which relates the interview of Saul with the witch of En-dor . This personage belonged to a class of impious pretenders , against whom the king , in one of the religious intervals of his wayward career , had undertaken to enforce the penalties provided by the ancient law ; and who were obliged , in consequence , to practise their unholy arts in retirement and obscurity . But when he persisted in violating the commands of the Most High , the hour of their revenge was come . The hosts of his enemies were mustering at his very gates ; the ominous sounds of disaffection and revolt grew louder within his borders ; and misfortune and disaster were gathering around him , like dark clouds around the setting sun . The warning voice of dreams , and Urim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prayers , and he resorted in terror and despair , to one of these very impostors whom he had persecuted , to open to him the mysterious pages of the book of fate . He sought her dwelling at midnight and in disguise , weighed down by the anguish of a broken spirit , and exhausted by the abstinence , which was then , as it is at this day in the East , required to prepare him for the unusual scene . The woman of En-dor reminded him of the fearful doop*-which the king had menaced against the exercise of her art ; but with the quick and proud decision of authority , he asstires her of his protection . This circumstance alone would have been sufficient to convince her of the rank and dignity of her guest ; but even without this evidence , how could a disguise have concealed from her penetrating eye , the lofty bearing and commanding stature of the goodhiest of the sons of Israel ? He commands her to call up the spirit of Samuel ; and affecting to see spirits ascending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the first time appears to recognise her royal visiter . To remove all fear of deception , he commands her to describe the form , which he can not see ; and when she speaks of an old man enveloped with a mantle , his imagination presents the image of the venerable prophet , and he addresses to him the story of his apprehension and distress . In the heart-broken accents of despair , he complains , that the hosts of his enemies are gathered against him , and that he is forsaken by his God . It was an easy task to predict the fate of a spirit thus crushed and broken . The voice confirms the sentence , which had already been pronounced by his fears ; and he hurries to the field of battle , where , after witnessing the discomfiture of his army , and the death of his sons , he seals the fatal prediction , and falls by his own hand . Such , at least , appears to us to be the true construction of this mysterious passage ; though we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different one ; believing , that the venerable prophet did miraculously appear at the call of the sorceress , to announce to Saul his approaching doom . Sir Walter Scott , though with some hesitation , inclines to the same view , which is also taken by Mr. Upham . On either supposition , the case is not wholly flee from difficulty ; but neither would give us reason to believe , that the witch of En-dor bore the least resemblance to modern personages of the same name . During the ascendency of the Catholic faith , though some enormous instances of cruelty occurred , the clergy in general were not disposed to punish with great severity a crime , which they believed it fully in their power to prevent ; and the mass of the people , being interdicted the use of the Scriptures , could only derive false impressions in regard to them , from the ignorance or fraud of others . With the reformers , the case was far different . They came forth from the lowly walks of life , sharing many of the prejudices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Word of God . They went forth to battle against principalities and powers ; and they knew that it was no light or easy task , nor the struggle of an hour . The whole vast edifice of the gorgeous hierarchy , consecrated by the veneration of countless ages , was to be overthrown , from its topmost battlement to the corner-stone ; and they summoned all their commanding energies to the work . No wonder , that with stern defiance in the // heart , there should have been gloom upon the brow ; no wonder , that their spirits should have been quickened into madness by the contest ; no wonder , when the red light of the fagot and the stake were before them , that they should have felt that the hand of the arch fiend was there . The religious principie with them became a dark and gloomy principle . Firmly persuaded themselves of the existence and active agency of the Spirit of evil , they recognised his power in all the obstacles that heset their progress , and this persuasion was confirmed in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If reason and philosophy attempted to teach them the impossibility of such a compact , as their own definition of witch. * craft implied , they regarded them as little as the painted windows of a Gothic cathedral . There was the divine injunction ,  - -  the word itself ; Lie that hath a familiar spirit , must die . It was one of the earliest acts of the pilgrims , to prepare an abstract of a criminal and civil code , which was afterwards made the basis of the statute law of Massachusetts . This paper was drawn by one of the most eminent divines of the day ; who , following the same error which had misled so many others , copied that provision of the Levitical law , which made witchcraft punishable with death , and applied it to a wholly different crime ; if indeed such a crime as modern witchcraft can be said to have ever been committed . But if there were ever a people who had an apology for being superstitious , it was that portion of the Puritans who came over to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more inclined to superstition , than those who dwell in the most grand and solitary scenes ; and , apart from the circumstances of their own situation , there was enough in the wildness and solitude around them , to excite the imagination . Before them was the broad sea , over whose bosom the Providence of God had guided them in the extremity of danger and suffering : and behind them the forests , whose depths were never penetrated by the footsteps of civilizcd man . It must have seemed like intrusion to enter its mysterious gloom , as if the quick footstep , or the careless voice might break the deep repose of nature , which had been only broken before by the cry of the wild beast , or the dashing of the ocean on its shore . Every thing around them led the mind to high and serious contemplation : every thing was fitted to excite emotions of sublimity and awe . Their reliance upon divine protection was firm and constant ; // its superintending power was visible in all occurrences that threw light at intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they felt the agency of an evil principle , whose strength was exerted for the trial of their virtue , or the punishment of their deviations from duty . Human nature itself was revealed to them in a mode of existence wholly new , but well calculated to cherish aid confirm their persuasion of this agency of evil powers . All their vigilance was necessary to guard them from the assaults of savage foes , whose wildness and ferocity , no less than the fearful suddenness of their midnight blow , were such as well became the ministers of darkness , whose path might be traced by the blood of the murdered , or the conflagration of villages . So far from wondering that our fathers shared the superstitious ideas , which prevailed at the period in every other country , it is rather matter of surprise , that the influence of those ideas was so limited here ; for it must be remembered , that they were every where sanctioned by the convictions of the pious , and the apprehensions of the wise ; cherished by the most eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright judges , whom England ever saw . Their own strong , practical sense , a quality which rarely deserted them , preserved them in a considerable degree from this fatal influence ; and the punishment of witchcraft was rare , until an unusual concurrence of circumstances , acting on the popular conviction , swelled the tide of superstition , and it came heaving in like a resistless flood . It was in February , 1692 , that this fatal delusion arose ; and it was preceded by many of those portents , which even now , are apt to cast a spell over the minds of men , and recall the fierce denunciations of the insane prophet , and the ominous voice which issued from the Holy of Holies , when the last hour of Jerusalem was at hand . Within , the colonists were agitated by ferocious political strife , driven from the ordinary paths of commercial industry by the pirates who infested their shores , and crushed beneath the weight of ponderous debt ; the light of some of the most eminent and virtuous among them had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty vicissitudes abroad , were borne to them upon every breeze from the sea . The French were combined with their savage enemies in unnatural union , and hung like a thunder-cloud upon the edges of the western forest , ready to break upon them in a fiery tempest of desolation and death . // The wild apprehension that the spirits of evil were unchained , and moving with unusual power on the earth , weighed down their hearts , which were commonly sustained by the conscious presence of the Divinity . Every thing seemed preparing for some great and fearful consummation ; all things combined to render them open and sensible to the impressions of sonic startling event . There was gloom in every heart , and on every brow . When the tidings at length came , of the visitation of those malignant spirits , which they believed Providence had permitted to exist , to accomplish purposes that no human intelligence could see , they fell upon hearts irritated almost to madness ; ready to throw aside all the restraints of their better nature , in the vain persuasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of darkness . We shall not attempt to retrace the incidents of that sangui .. nary drama , of which Salem was the principal seat , though the delusion was fully shared by all the surrounding country . The mind turns shuddering a way from the sickening details of its atrocity ; our nature recoils with horror from the history of men converted into demons . We can hardly go back in fancy to that period , when this superstition was living and real to the apprehensions of all ; we can as little realize the power of this conviction now , as in witnessing the representation of Macbeth , we can feel the impression which must once have been created by those mysterious beings , who met the victorious soldier on the midnight heath ; there is nothing to mitigate the feelings of disgust and aversion , with which we regard the melancholy exhibition of fanaticism and guilt . Mr. Upham has relieved us of the task ; in pursuing the plan which he proposed to him . self , he has given a sufficiently minute and most interesting narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and withholding none of its palliations . We regret that we are compelled to differ from him in any particular ; but we can not admit the correctness of the remark , in the sense in which he would have it understood , that no blame should be attached to judges and jurors , so long as the law of the land required the punishment of witches , for carrying that law into effect ; it assumes the very point which we deny . Doubtless , these officers were hound to execute the law ; but they were equally bound to refrain from conviction and sentence , until the law was shown to be violated ; this , however , was never done ; but a more disgraceful violation of all law , human or divine , to say // nothing of mercy or humanity , than was exhibited throughout the whole of these trials for witchcraft , by those who urged them on , never blackened the history of man . All the safeguards which a wise and just precaution had set for the security of innocence , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown aside with contempt ; those leading questions , which the criminal law of the time , not over-merciful , regarded with aversion , were the only sort of examination permitted ; confessions , wrung by the extremity of torture from a broken and exhausted spirit , were not only received , but demanded and prayed for , as the evidence of guilt . The witnesses , who represented themselves , as no one can doubt they were , in another sense than they intended , as under the influence of Satan , were cheered on by the insane applauses of an exasperated mob ; no contradictions , no evasions , not even the plainest peflury , took any thing from the weight of their declarations ; while the denial , the arguments , and characters of the prisoners , were treated with indignity and scorn . Were not such jurors and judges bound to reflect , that the same power , which was falsely said to torture the accusers , might have relieved the wretched in their extremity , by making those who sat in judgment suffer under the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same measure of justice which all others might have asked for , in order to examine , if they could not check , so miserable a delusion ? We doubt whether an impartial judgment can clear them of the guilt of blood . It may be said , as it was said by Cotton Mather , that the confessions were of themselves sufficient for eonviction ; but a very limited knowledge of human nature might have taught them , that there is no duress like that of fear and horror , and the hope of life ; while the agony of such an accusation , with the aversion and dread reflected from the faces of all itround , might even have induced , in minds thus overwhelmed , a persuasion that they were really subject to some supernatural influence . At all events , the lesson is one whose instruction ought not to be lost . We can , however , hardly conceive of the depravity , which hurried the youthful accusers on to such a work of death . At first , it was probably no more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the follies of the old* but when the alarm had spread , the dread of detection was added to the passion for notoriety , until their united influence overwhelmed // every other feeling ; and there was no counteracting influence to weaken their effect . It is a pity , that the experiment resorted to by Boerhaave in the alms-house at Haerlem , had not been tried upon them . Its youthful inmates were seized , one after another , with the most violent convulsions ; the expe. rienced physician directed furnaces to be erected , in which the arm of the first new patient was to he burned to the bone ; and the remedy was so efficacious , that the afflicted were all healed with miraculous despatch . There is another species of superstition , of a less fatal character . We allude to apparitions of various kinds , which every one is ready to explain in the most satisfactory manner , while almost every one can detect in himself an inclination to believe in their reality ; as the physician , who was attempting to demonstrate to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted by a skeleton , was somewhat startled by his patient 's assurance , that the skull was at that moment visible over his shoulder . Sir Walter Scott believes , that the influence of certain states of mind upon the fancy , or of ill-health , is the cause of most of these spectral visitations ; but he adds a pretty broad qualification of the doctrine , by way of proviso , before he leaves the subject . Dr. Thacher 's scepticism is rather more confirmed ; he appears to think , that all the instances on record will admit of a rational explanation , without resort to supernatural agency . We are inclined to believe , that the full power of the imagination is hardly yet realized ; it is curious to observe , how often and how readily it gets the better of the judgment . The case of animal magnetism is sufficient to show , that it can sometimes heal diseases ; and a story related by Dr. Thacher proves , that it may have equal efficacy in producing them . He tells us of a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatiguing contest , and on returning home to announce his victory , seized by mistake his son 's waistcoat , instead of his own more ample one ; but finding all efforts to adapt it to his person entirely vain , he at once perceived , that he must have been bitten by his foe , and that he had become distended by the virulence of the poison in the most alarming manner ; three physicians were summoned , but the presence of the whole faculty would have availed nothing , until the son made his appearance , with the garment of the patient hanging in graceful folds about him . Physicians are even at this day somewhat reluctant to appeal to the imagination for the cure of maladies , // lest they should seem to aspire to the reputation and honors of a quack ; but there is no reason to doubt its power ; nor is there any , why the most active principle of our nature should not be fully investigated and understood . President Smith of New Jersey has given us an explanation of apparitions , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the motions or vibrations of the nervous system of a man in full health are undisturbed and regular , and present only just images to the mind ; but that , by disease or infirmity , they may be affected either wholly or in part , and made to present only false and fantastic ones . Perhaps this is no more than an attempt to explain the mechanical operation of the causes previously suggested . Dr. Rush resolves illusions into a disease , in which false perceptions take place in some of the senses , depending on the excitement of motion in a particular organ , which does not vibrate with the impression made upon it , but communicates it to another part on which a similar impression was formerly made . We do not pretend to be able to determine the accuracy of these solutions ; and it is quite as satisfactory to the general reader to know , that such illusions are commonly attributed to excited feeling , arising from a variety of causes , among which anxiety , over-exertion , and disease , are the most prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention of any of these causes . These explanations have at least this advantage , whether they be satisfactory or not , that if they can not be established by demonstration , it is just as difficult to prove them to be false ; and nothing is more annoying to the pride of philosophy , than to be unable to assign a cause for any of this world 's phenomena . The case of Lord Lyttelton is one of the most striking on record . This noble profligate , as is well known , declared , that he had been warned by the apparition of his mother , that he should die within three days ; and his death took place at the expiration of the time appointed . All these various modes of solution have been repeatedly applied , with various degrees of probability , to this case ; but the more modern explanation is , that he put an end to his own life by poison ; and there was nothing in his character to induce us to believe , that he would hesitate at such an unseasonablejest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disordered action of his nervous system , exhausted as he was by unlimited excess , might have conjured up precisely such a vision . The spectres which beset Nicolai of // Berlin , more numerous than those that assailed the muchenduring St. Anthony , are universally ascribed to disease , the same cause to which he himself attributed them ; as , when he went back to the practice of blood-letting , which he had discontinued for a time , the whole train disappeared together . We find some interesting statements in the work of l ) r . Thacher , of cases not very dissimilar ; among others , of a worthy divine in Virginia , who was compelled by sickness to relinquish his pastoral duties , and was distressed by the consciousness , when his health was partially restored , that he had not properly availed himself of his ability to resume them . While in this state , he was warned by the apparition of an old man of imposing air and stature , to return to his labors , and to undertake the additional task of restoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The good man would willingly have declined this apostolical mission , as somewhat beyond his abilities ; but so fully convinced was he of the supernatural character of his visiter , that he did not dare to disobey his injunctions ; and he applied to Dr. Thacher for advice , who , finding it impossible to convince him of his delusion , very judi* ciously advised him to begin his reform by preaching up those points of doctrine in regard to which there was no controversy , anti to wait the further ord*rs Of the spectre ; but the plan , upon which he had actually entered , was broken off by his death . One of the most singular cases of the kind , of which we have any knowledge , is taken by Dr* Thacher from the Edinburgh Journal of Science , and was communicated to Dr. Brewster by the husband of the lady , who was the subject of the illusion . Her health was considerably impaired at the time when the circumstances related by her husband took place . He says , that On the 30th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about four o'clock , Mrs. B. came down stairs into the drawing.room , which she had quitted a few moments before , and on entering the room , saw me , as she supposed , standing with my back to the fire . She addressed me , asking how it was I had returned so soon ( I had left the house for awalk half an hour before . ) She said I looked fixedly at her with a serious and thoughtful expression of countenance , but did not speak . She supposed I was busied in thought , and sat down in an arm-chair near the fire , and within a couple of feet at most of the figure she still saw standing before her . As , however , the eyes still continued to be fixed upon her , // after a few moments , she said , " Why do n't you speak ? " The figure , upon this , moved off toward the window , at the farther end of the room , the eyes still gazing on her , and passed so very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the circumstance of hearing no step nor sound , nor feeling her clothes brushed against , nor even any agitation of the air . The idea then arose for the first time in her mind , that it was no reality , but a spectral illusion. * It was unfortunate , that the lady , in the consternation of the moment , forgot to resort to an experimentum crucis , which had been previously recommended by Dr. Brewster , and may be found extremely convenient to all who have occasion to inquire into the character of such unexpected guests ; namely , pressing the eye , in order to produce the effect of seeing double ; in which case the optical illusion , if it be such , will remain single , while duplicates will be presented of every other object . On the whole , there is no doubt , that most of these apparitions , perhaps all of which we have any account , are the mere offspring of disordered health or fancy ; though it would have been hard to induce the clergyman , who was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in opposition to the evidence of two of his most confidential senses . We are almost tempted to agree on this subject with the chaplain in Old Mortality , when he undertook to explain to Lord Evandale the apparition of Henry Morton ; it was his deliberate opinion , that either the said Morton himself , or his ghost , had really appeared , or that the whole was a deceptio visus ; which of the three hypotheses was the true one , it was impossible to pronounce with certainty ; but he was ready to die in the belief , that one of the three was the cause of the disturbance . We are not to confound the persuasion entertained by many , of the possibility of some mysterious communication of the death of others , with the fanciful superstitions of earlier times ; with that of the Banshie , for example , so beautifully used by Moore in the melody , where he alludes to the loss of him of the hundred fights , ' or that of the Brownie of the Highlands , and the other spectres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than men are willing to confess ; and many of the cases , by which it is supported , are familiar to the recollections of all . In connexion with this subject , the mind involuntarily turns to the instance , in which the early death of one of the brightest of the sons of genius in this city , // was revealed at the moment of its occurrence , to his venerable father , himself just sinking beneath the pressure of infirmity , at a distance from his home . We have also heard , on authority which we can not question , another instance , in which a lady of no vulgar mind communicated to her friends her impression of the loss of a favorite daughter , from whom she had long been separated , and where the iml ) ression was justified by the event . A curious example of a similar kind , is related by Isaac Walton in his Life of Dr. Donne ; and we are almost tempted to embrace the beautiful theory of the worthy old biographer , who accounts for it by supposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string of one of two lutes in the same apartment has been touched , a soft responsive note will be echoed fiom the other . Of all the kinds of superstition , this , if this indeed be one , is the kind which we are most reluctant to cast away ,  --  the idea , that there may be some communion , of which we can not comprehend the nature , between the spirits of the dead and ours ; though it may be , that there is deception in the evidence on which these examples rest ; it may be , that in this case , as in others , our fancies assume the aspect of bright and living realities . It would be unpardonable not to notice the ancient and universal art of divination , considering the earnestness with which men have labored to display their superstition , in attempting to penetrate the mysterious veil of the future . Their efforts have been zealous , in proportion to the difficulty of the task ; if half the perseverance which they have exhibited in this pursuit had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimating the results to which it might have led . Even here , they seem in general to have been tolerably contented with their success ; having regularly made a point of forgetting all the false responses of the oracle , and of proclaiming with unspeakable triumph , any solitary instance of a prophecy fulfilled . The art is certainly not without pretensions on the score of antiquity ; the witch of En-dor was a fortune-teller , though her mystery was in less vogue than it afterwards became . In Rome , it was converted into the religion of the State ; it would be ludicrous , if any thing relating to the Romans can excite that feeling , to examine the machinery by which they labored to draw future events from darkness into light ; and we are inclined to apprehend , that Cato was not the only one who ridiculed it , even in thttt day , when heresy was as little tolerated // as it has been since . On the eve of an election , tents were pitched without the city , at which he who presided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there they watched carefully the appearance of the heavens , and the singing and flight of birds , and if the magistrate happened to hear thunder , or observe any unpropitious omen , as he well might do when his own party were not on the ground in sufficient force , the auspices were unfavorable , and the election was forthwith adjourned to another day . Even if it appeared , six months afterwards , that there was some mistake about the omens , the election was set aside . We have sometimes wished , that this practice had never been exploded . So when a ship was crowned with garlands , and the trumpet had sounded for its departure , the alighting of a swallow on the rigging , or an unhappy sneeze upon the left , outweighed all the favorable indications of the wind and tide . t ) rawing of lots was an authentic mode of ascertaining one 's destiny . The Eternal City was overspread with gloom , when the appetite of the sacred chickens appeared less vigorous than usual ; and , on the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate as if consuming a corporation dinner . There is no end to the devices , by which the Romans endeavored to read the book of fate ; most of them were abandoned as the world grew older ; but there was one which descended to them from the earliest antiquity , and was preserved until a comparatively recent time . This was astrology , founded on the notion , that the star which was rising at the hour of one 's birth , ever afterwards influenced , or at least foreboded his destiny ; a persuhsion , supposed to be derived from those who watched the stars from the plains of Chaldea. it is worthy of remark , that in Rome , as in modern Europe , the great could not condescend to travel the same path to futurity with the vulgar ; the rich applied to the astrologers , who carried a mysterious ephemeris , the prototype of our modern almanac , in which the rising and setting , the conjunction , and other appearances of the stars , were set down ; while the poor were fain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls the deceitful Circus Maximus , who gave them a destiny brilliant in proportion to their ability to pay . In the sixteenth century and later , the heavenly bodies , in the same manner , were supposed to indicate the fortunes of the great , as well as the vicissitudes of nations ; while the inspection of the face or // hand was sufficient to prognosticate the destiny of the poor . This most singular of fancies , that the movement of worlds was regulated with a view to the destiny of an inhabitant of one of the smallest of the whole , pervaded the loftiest intellects of the time ; even the miraculous discernment of Bacon was not insensible to its influence ; and Scott has given some striking illustrations in Kenilworth and Quentin Durward , of its power over nobles apd kings . Every one remembers the story of Napoleon pointing to thesun of Austerlitz , and watching , from the forsaken halls of the Kremlin , his waning star , which soon went down in blood . The astrologer was once invested with every honor , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally as mysterious , as the response of the Delpliic oracle to Pyrrhus ; but wo to the prophet , when the horoscope proved false . Mr. Partridge is the last of these worthies on record ; he fell on evil days , when the artillery of the Royal Society had battered down all the high pretensions of his art ; and his most unlucky star was in the ascendant , when he encountered the fatal ridicule of Swift . The vulgar mystery of fortune-telling has escaped the same fate with astrology , because it wisely avoided the attempt to soar so high ; it has been kept in tolerable preservation by the gypsies ; and there is scarcely a village so poor , as to be without its wise woman , who reads one 's fortune in the lines of his hand , or the grounds of an exhausted tea-cup . Mr. Upham gives us an interesting account of a venerable lady by the name of Pitcher , who enjoyed an enviable reputation in this neighborhood , some twenty years ago . Her power , it seems , was inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic spot in Lynn , near the borders of the sea , was resorted to by many a curious pilgrim . Her skill was most signal , in ascertaining the deposit of stolen goods ; a branch of the arts , which is somewhat liable to mis-interpretation ; but a story is related of her by Mr. Whitman , in his Lecture on Popular Superstition , which indicates that her power in discovering lost persons was rather more questionable . He assures us , that application was made to this lady , respecting a person who had suddenly disappeared ; she without hesitation pronounced him murdered , and charged an unlucky family of negroes with the crime , who were immediately arrested and imprisoned ; but were at length discharged by the unimpeachable testimony afforded by the re-appearance of the lost personage himself . // There are various other branches of the subject , to which we would willingly turn our attention ; particularly , the thousand omens which have descended from early times to ours , and the beautiful vision of the fairies , which perished some centuries ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been observed , that much of the superstition in the world springs from that conviction of the immortal nature of the spirit within us , which is found among the rudest tribes , as well as the most refined communities . The strength of this conviction certainly varies in proportion to the degree of refinement ; as there are instances , in which humanity is degraded to the level of irrational existence , and no one requires to he shown the effect of advancement in knowledge , in dispelling the phantoms of ignorance , or presenting them in their real form and proportions ; but it is the cause , to which we owe the boasted dignity of our nature . It is striking to witness the efforts of the mind , even when sunk in debasement , or crushed beneath the accumulated weight of error , to escape from its darkness and cast away its chains , speculating where it can not reason , and pressing onward , in obedience to the intimations of the active principle within , even when it wanders ip**nn obscure and doubtful way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being to the least enlightened of our race , how does the soul burn to penetrate the shadows , which hide it from the view ! If it speak of superior intelligences , exempted from the stern law of decay and dissolution , how do we labor to invest them with reality ! Thus the wildest notions eventually spring from a high and honorable principle , which only requires a guide to conduct it in the proper paths . Its activity is beyond its strength , until wisdom and knowledge have enlightened and confirmed it ; it loses its way , because it has too much confidence in itself ; it relies on its own power to discover hidden things , as well as to explain those which are seen ; believing , that the faculty which can catch a faint glimpse of distant objects , can bring them fully to the view . All this is well , so long as the right end is pursued by the right means ; but the difficulty is , that the intellect is apt to bewilder itself with speculation , and to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the eye , which is wearied by being long fixed on some object too remote . Such was the radical error of ancient philosophy , if a vast edifice of theory erected on a slender basis of fact , be fairly entitled to // the name ; a breath was sufficient to overturn the whole ; it formed hypotheses , instead of ascertaining facts ; it undertook to explain phenomena , rather than to observe them ; and in this way , instead of leading men to the knowledge of the real nature of things , it led them in the very opposite direction . iNor was it wonderful , when philosophy itself became the fertile source of error , that the minds of those , who were not philosophers , should have been misled by the example . It was reserved for the most commanding intellect of modern times , who has won the highest honors that can crown an earthly name , to reveal the true divining rod , the unfailing oracle , comprehended in the simple terms , experiment and observation ; to teach the only just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This error of the ancient world was not , however , an unnatural one ; it was merely the result of the principle to which we have alluded , misled by the eagerness of its just and laudable efforts ; and there are instances enough , o*the operation of the same causes in later times . Whenever any event is presented to the mind , its first step is to inquire the cause , and this is generally found in some other event immediately preceding in the order of time . A curious instance of this occurred no longer ago than the last century . The fish , on which many of the inhabitants of Norway depended for subsistence , suddenly vanished from their coasts ; the practice of inoculation for the small-pox had just then been introduced , and was instantly fixed upon as the cause of the calamity ; and , as the people considered the risk of that disorder a trifle in comparison with starvation , nothing could exce*d their righteous indignation against all who undertook to cure them . Sometimes , where no event of sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , the imagination lends its aid in furnishing a cause ; witness the plague of Athens , which was attributed to the poisoning of the fountains , a delusion precisely similar to that prevailing at this day in Hungary in regard to the disease , which is traversing the whole breadth of the Eastern hemisphere , like a destroying angel . Most commonly , however , the popular fancy inclines to neither of these modes of explanation , but resorts to that favorite acknowledgement of ignorance , a supernatural cause ; thus , prayers and processions , two centuries ago , were considered the sovereign specific for the plague . The voice of some // malignant demon is uttered in the thunder , and the fierce conflicts of contending spirits are visible in the northern light ; while the aspect of some benignant deity is revealed in the tranquil beauty of ocean , earth and sky . The world becomes a divided empire ;  --  a battle-field for two great principles , of equal , but opposing power . A fearful barrier , indeed , it is , which these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of intellectual light . From their very nature , they become incorporated with religion , and debase it ; even Christianity , pure , elevated , and powerfui'as it is , either bows before them , or is darkened by their influence . In Athens , they who undertake to explain the . causes of lightning and thunder , become the enemies of the gods ; Galileo is condemned in Rome , to one hundred and fifty repetitions of the seven penitential psalms . These prejudices , thus con* firmed , pervert the natural tendencies of the mind , and convert ignorance into delusion ; at first they are the offspring of error , then they become its cause , by the penalties which they denounce against all who deny them . Zoroaster was converted by them into a magician , Roger Bacon into an enemy of religion , and De Villa Nova was hurried to the stake . Is it wonderful , that the fetters of error should be so slow to fall , when such a price is to be paid for truth ? Such are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we have not yet adverted . It is the abuse of superior knowledge for the purposes of imposition . We can not better explain this , than by using the illustration which Mr. Upham has afforded us . Let us suppose , for instance , that some person belonging to an ignorant and superstitious tribe , had received information through the channel of secret tradition , or had ascertained by a lucky conjecture , or by profound reflection and calculation , the very minute , or hour , or day , within which a solar eclipse would take place . How easy would it be for that person to induce the whole community to believe him to be in secret connexion with the higher powers , and to enjoy the confidential intercourse of the deities who rule the world ! Let us suppose , that he gives out word in an oracular and mysterious manner , that in consequence of the unwillingness of the people to receive law from him as from their rightful sovereign , or their true prophet and priest , his friends and protectors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw the light of the sun and leave them to dwell in a world of eternal night , or dissolve the system of the uni // verse . His threat might not at first be regarded ; perhaps it would be laughed to scorn . Many , however , would be in suspense , and wait in anxious doubt the approach of the day that was to determine its truth . On that day the sun would rise as bright , perhaps brighter than usual , it would mount through a clear sky with an undiminished and glowing radiance up toward the highest heaven . The whole people would watch its course with solicitous attention , and as it moved on steadily and triumphantly in its accustomed path , the belief that the prediction was about to prove false would gain strength in their minds . The pretended prophet would pass round them with a calm complacency of demeanor that indicated entire confidence , and a feeling of satisfaction in the doom that was about to fall on those who had denied his authority , derided his pretensions , and scorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to be discerned in the atmosphere , the gazers would exclaim , that the sun was dissolving , that its disk was breaking , and its whole face disappearing from the heavens . The terror and awe of the people would spread and deepen in every direction . The sun 's rays would fall feeble and dim upon the earth ; a tint of mingled blue and yellow would be spread over the fading , sickening , dying world ; the darkness of a night , even more awful than that which closed the primal day of the first parents of the human family , would gradually settle upon the earth , and the stars would begin to beam in the sunless sky ! The whole population , confounded , terrified , and driven to distraction , would rush in penitence and despair to the presence of their prophet ; they would supplicate his forgiveness for their rebellious disregard of his authority and warnings , and would promise to honor , to serve revere , and obey him forever , if he would use his influence with the higher powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dissolution and ruin that were coming upon the world . The dignified and apparently displeased impostor , after much affected reluctance , listens to the request , mutters forth some unintelligible sounds , goes through a soiemn.ceremnony , looks up on high , waves his hand , and promises , upon the condition that they will acknowledge the diviniy of his mission and yield entire obedience to him , that the sun shall be restored in the heavens . The grateful multitude await the fulfilment of the promise ; and soon their eyes behold the glorious luminary re-appearing , the light of day is again diffused abroad , and the world goes on in its usual course . In this manner , was the confidence of the people secured and abused . ' Whenever we enumerate the causes of superstition , we suggest the remedy . It is almost superfluous to remark , that // it lies in the progress of reason and knowledge . The advancement of physical science destroys the thousand errors and delusions , which spring from ignorance of physical causes ; since the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaking lightning for the exhibition of a malignant demon 's influence ; and a child may laugh at the grave pretensions of astrology . In the same proportion as this knowledge is diffused , is intellectual and moral science aided in its progress ; each in its measure , promotes and cherishes the other ; each and all carry on the great work of improvement , urging us onward to the attainment of the end of all true science , the elevation , if we may not say the perfection , of our nature . We conclude , with borrowing on this point the intelligent remarks of Dr. Thacher . The present is an era , pre-eminently distinguished for improvement in physical and moral philosophy ; and forgetting the things that are behind , we are pressing forward in the race with rapid strides to the melioration of the condition of the physical and moral world . Had the stupendous works performed , and those contemplated at the present day , been predicted to our fathers in the seventeenth century , they would have trembled with alarm , lest their posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The paralyzing idea , that the present state of knowledge is as perfect as our nature will admit , should be utterly reprobated ; for knowledge is eternally progressive ; and we can have no claim to be estimated as the benefactors of posterity , unless by our own efforts and toils we add to the achievements of our ancestors . '
