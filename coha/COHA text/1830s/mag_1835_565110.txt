txt I THINk if II were to write a book of travels in the United States , it xvould be more shocking than Captain Hall 's , or Major Hamilton 's , or even Mrs. Trollope 's . I know of only one book of the sort written by an American - The Notions of a Travelling Bachelor ; ' and this was by Cooper , whose bead has been lately proved to be so full of notions , that nobody minds them now-a-days . A book , of a different kind from his , written by an American , yet telling his countrymen , in sober earnest , that they actually have faults , that their country is great only in size and prospect , that there is more elegant society in older countries , &amp;c. &amp;c. , is yet a desideratum , and might do some good ; and I have little doubt that it would be better received too , than the impertinent hints afforded us by foreigners ; for it is always the case with nations as with families , that the members quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all good understanding ; but , if any interloper presumes to appear , they all turn upon him en masse - and it is lucky for him if he comes off without a broken head . It has often occurred to me to ask whether-considering that numerous travelers , from England and other countries , coining here at different periods , unknown to each other and with different objects , some remaining longer , others less time , and still all speaking with nearly the same voice , and condemning , with equal severity the same things , - there may not possibly be some truth in what they say ? - or have they all come here with malice prepense , and instigated by the devil to abuse and misrepresent our unhappy land , and gall the feelings of our skinless people , as Mrs. Troliope calls them ? Having cogitated upon all these things , it came into my bead to write a sort of journal of my own wanderings over this country , a few pages of which I offer here for the edification of any who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 133- . Arrived this day in New-York . I had visited the city in my childhood , and had some indistinct recollection of the lay of the land - so steered for Broadway ; it was but a short distance from the wharf where I had landed , and I felt sure that I could find it . Turning a corner , I was in a street which I knew ought to be Broadway ; but the houses appeared so low and small , no two of them alike , that it seemed to me I had found my way into a large encampment rather than the principal street of New-York ; and it was only upon being assured that this was Broadway , that I could bring myself to believe that I was actually in a scene which had made such a strong impres // sion upon my youthful recollection . Everything appeared diminutive to me - coming , as iii had , directly from the old world , where I had resided for several years ; and I made some sad blunders . For instance : inquiring the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked , What , is it near the small chapel , yonder ? ' No , sir - near the large church , ' was the answer , given in all simplicity ; we both meant the same building . I found excellent accommodations at the Clinton house ; and , being alone , preferred eating at the ordinary . What the throats and stomachs of my countrymen are made of , is a wonder to me ; the tremendous rapidity with which they devour their food , is a ceaseless subject of amazement . Many of them finished their breakfast before I had drunk my first cup of coffee ; some even before it was brought to me ; and as for dinner , it was a fearful thing ; a cotton factory is stillness , compared to the horrible clatter which the knives and forks and the plates so rapidly changed , kept up . There was one comfort , however ; the whole business was finished in fifteen minutes , and I was left to eat my dinner in peace . Twelfth . Walked up Broadway ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paraded this afternoon . Dear creatures - how sweetly they looked ! I was proud to be a native of the same land . Yet , Pbmbus ! - what dresses ! what gaudy materials ! what an absolute dazzle of ribands and laces and muslins ! I have no hesitation in saying , that a New-York lady would be robbed if she walked on the Boulevard3 in Paris , in the dress she was accustomed to wear in Broadway . Visited the battery - a beautiful walk , but small . Fourteenth . Dined at Mr. ****** Am told that his house is one of the most elegant in the city . It is built of brick , which seems to me a pity - ( no one should attempt to build a brick palace , especially where marble abounds , as at New-York ; ) the interior is neat and well furnished , but no pictures nor sculpture , except the marble fire-places , which seemed rather strange , as the owner is said to be very wealthy . In the evening , visited Miss ***** ; met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every principal city of America - as cultivated , polished , refined , and charming , as the best that the old world can boast of . Such people , however , are not appreciated in the more extensive and self-named fashionable , but in reality vulgar , circles of New-York . Take it all in all , New-York is the most disgusting and abominable place of the size , I was ever in . If we may believe the reports of their own statistics , the amount of crime perpetrated there , and the low debauchery of every kind , and the revolting population , with which some parts of the city are crowded , ronder // it , in proportion to the number of inhabitants , the most wicked place in the whole civilized world . There is one god in NewYork - and this is money ; there is one absorbing passion - the craving for wealth . The whole place is rather like an encampment than a city , where young adventurers , broken-down merchants and penniless foreigners come to stay a few years and repair their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , when they talk about the beauty of their city . if they mean the natural beauties of the place , I agree with them : the location is extremely fine - and I trust that , one day , there will be a city worthy of its site ; but , in all that constitutes the beauty of a city , fine architectural monuments , noble churches and public edifices , broad , open squares and promenades , statues and fountains , New-York is utterly deficient . The only building which makes any pretence to architecture is the City Hall , which is plain , and of tolerable proportions , but only remarkable , in American architecture , as not being deformed by any very striking absurdity , unless the cupola be considered as such . There are a few open places , or promenades , such as . the Park , the Battery , and Hudson square ; but these are so small , compared with the extent of the city , as to be almost contemptible . If I were going to shew a foreigner the pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should lead him to the wharves , where he would behold a scene , almost without a rival in the world . I would show him there the true palaces of America - the packet ships ; of unequaled beauty , strength and swiftness ; managed with a dexterity and boldness , which claim the admiration of all nations , and furnished with a degree of splendor that might become the saloons of a prince . I would show him the passage to the high seas whitened with a thousand sails ; the magnificent steamboats , ever in motion , waiting like haudmaids on the city of their inventor ; the forests of masts and the croxvded shipping , stretching for miles along the quays , and pouring the merchandize of the whole earth into the lap of the Commercial Emporium - the everlasting stir and bustle thus accompanying the increasing wealth ; and then I would bid him reflect upon the elegancies and refinement to which this accumulation of wealth will finally lead ; but , the Lord forbid that I should boast , to an intelligent European , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' So much for what I would say of New-York , from the impressions made by a visit there , after an absence of several years . Since the journal , from which I have here extracted a passage , was written , I have been there two or three times , but have never found any cause to change my mind . Perhaps now , New-York may // not be pleased to have such remarks made about her . I hope she will not he offended , for my remarks are no more than the fly lighting on the horn of the ox . But if she does take it amiss , I would pat her on the shoulder , and say to her , as I would to a pouting sister - Now do n't be offended , dear ! you know it is all true - but we 11 keep it in the family ; and though you know that you are the very devil at home , still we 11 keep up appearances , and make you look as amiable to strangers as you can - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now and then : and besides this , you are beginning to grow more agreeable , in reality  --  and I have no doubt you will be quite decent , some time or other ; only you must get rid of your vermin , such as pigs , &amp;c . ' However , I will continue my journal . . May sixteenth- Philadelphia . I could , almost always , distinguish a Philadelphian in Europe , because Philadelphians dress better , speak better English , and look more like gentlemen , than the generality of those whom I met from the other cities of the United States . Philadelphia is vastly superior to New-York , in every respect , unless it be in the facilities for making money . The streets are generally broader and more neat , and the public buildings , which are worthy of notice for their architecture , outnumber those of New-York , ten to one . Some of them are really superb - not the churches , however : the costliest edifices of the American cities , are the temples to Mammon - the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States bank is commonly spoken of as the most deserving of attention , and is , in reality , a most chaste and perfect specimen of architecture . I prefer it , on the whole , to the Bourse , ' at Paris , which is spoken of as one of the master-pieces of modern times . The white marble , used in its construction , is in fine harmony with the massy Doric , and adds much to the effect . But , for symmetry and delicate proportion , I preferred a small Ionic building , used , I believe , as a bank , also of white marble . I do not remember the name of the bank , nor the street in which it stands ; it is in sight of the Exchange , and at no great distance from it , on the side towards the Delaware . One curious feature of Philadelphia is , that the dwelling-houses have wooden shutters outside the xvindows , which makes them all look like shops or stores . Seventeenth . Called on Mr. * ; a very agreeable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mightily absorbed in politics . Went to * to a small party , in the evening ; very pleasant ; the ladies have more of the manners of Europeans than at the north . I observed many of them talking French , which one would not see in Boston . Still , they are not so well-educated as the Boston ladies . But , what use is there in educating our ladies , if they are to lose their influence in V0L* IX . 23 // society the moment they are married ? This detestable custom of shuffling married ladies out of society prevails everywhere in the United States , and the place which they ought to hold , is usurped by pert young misses , in their teens , who have not half the qualifications of education , maturity and judgement , to render themselves agreeable , which are to be found in those whom they drive from the leading places in society . I think Miss * sings better than any amateur I ever heard . There was much good music at this party . I believe the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union. * July eighth . Went to the book-store of Carey , Lea and Blanchard - a set of detestable publishers , who have inundated the country with more ugly editions , wretchedly printed on semibroxvn paper , than they can atone for , if they devote the rest of their lives to the making of handsome hooks . A publisher who puts out a novel in a cheap form , upon ugly paper , like the horrible editions of these men , has a great deal to answer for . If he were tried before the tribunal of literature , he would , undoubtedly , be found guilty of high-treason , and sentenced to be burnt in a fire made of his own execrable editions ; and , if the ghosts of books go to another world , I doubt if his punishment would cease here . Saw a small pamphlet of caricatures of Mrs. Butler , published by Johnston , of Boston - the most vile attempts at wit ever made . I have no patience with men who , masking the love of lucre under countenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen , as well as violate the decencies of society . The same may be said of the abusive paragraphs which have appeared in so many of the newspapers . If I were a reviewer , I would write about them somewhat in this style : It is a misfortune universally attendant upon caricature-makers , that their works are more apt to reflect disgrace upon the authors , than upon those against whom they are directed . At the very best , caricaturing is the lowest species of wit ; and the more one excels in it , the more surely is he to be set down as a man of a low and degraded mind . This species of satire is only to be tolerated when directed against those who are deservedly the objects of public odium or contempt . When , on the other hand , it is used as an engine of party malice , or descends to the still lower purpose of flattering the tastes of the most debased portion of a * The most charming amateur-performer on the piano-forte we ever heard , is a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brilliancy , with which she executes the most difficult pieces , and her perfect command of the instrument , are unrivaled ; and we can not omit to add , that a seeming unconsciousness of her extraordinary powers , and a reluctance to anything like display , render her performances vastly more pleasing , and attract the admiration of the listener from the skilful musician to the modest and lovely girl . - ED. // populace , it deserves no consideration nor mercy . Still , if well executed , it may elicit a smile even from those who are the objects of its rancor . We remember hearing Lafayette describe , with great glee , some caricatures of himself , which he had just seen in a shop window . But , when caricatures are made of persons who deserve the consideration and respect of all , and when , at the same time , they have not even the poor recommendation of the low wit which they aim at ; when they are utterly devoid of interest , wit , or sense , we know not where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can find anything so entirely stale , flat and unprofitable , ' so thoroughly deserving of contempt , so completely disgraceful to its author . Such is the case with regard to the work in question . The newspaper editors have lavished their abuse upon the Journal ' ; and these wretched caricatures have been added to the heap . And yet , the most respectable periodical in the country has joined with the sentiments of the best portion of the community , in ranking Mrs. Butler 's journal , as it deserves - as the work of a highspirited and talented lady , and as one of the most interesting book of travels in the United States , that has yet appeared . Meantime , the unhappy author of the caricatures has leisure to chew the hitter cud of reflection ' upon the sad blunder he has made . There is always a moment of satisfaction succeeding exertion , before it can be ascertained whether success is to follow or not and we have no doubt that Johnston has enjoyed this moment ; but this has undoubtedly passed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disgust , which universally accompany the contemplation of one 's own failures . We doubt not , that the unfortunate caricaturist xvould be glad to gather in his whole mistaken edition , and commit it to the flames . But , we can not allow him to do this ; it is proper , rather to hold up the pages before his eyes , and ask him if the ugly faces do not seem to grin maliciously at him , while he laments over his blunders . It is a disagreeable , though necessary , office to remove the remains of loathsome abortions , which occasionally present themselves in our path , and which would otherwise infect the atmosphere but , when the work has to be done , as in the present case , it ought to be faithfully done . Had not this disgusting production been accompanied by various newspaper paragraphs , constituting a load of abuse nearly as disgusting as itself , it would probably have appeared too contemptible to notice ; but , when so many nuisances present themselves at once , they must be scraped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I think I should say something of this kind , if I were a writer of reviews ; and I hope somebody will take the hint , and give // Johnston a handsome lashing , for his very bad caricatures I am sure he deserves it . But my journal is growing quite long , and I close for the present . I intend , at some future time , to visit the good city of Boston especially if my comments on the other cities are relished.
