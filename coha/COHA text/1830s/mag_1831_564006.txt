txt NO . III . A man 's best friends are his books ; they never desert , they never betray him . With a kindness , true as it is rare , they accommodate themselves to his caprices . Is he grave or gay , sad or merry , would he learn , would he philosophize , would he be comfortably idle , he may find among his books some one or more exactly fitted to his purpose . THE COMPLETE LIBRARY , Vol. ii . p. 303 . WhEN Plato was called upon to give a brief description of man , at once comprehensive and characteristic , he declared him to be a featherless biped . This description was not a little ridiculed by one of Plato 's rivals , who stripped a cock of his feathers , drove him screaming through the gardens in which the philosopher was accustomed to meet his disciples , and having attracted the attention of the whole company , suddenly stopped , and , pointing to the cock , inquired , with great gravity , " Sirs , is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort ; and , Plato 's definition being completely discredited , others have since attempted to mend the matter ,  --  but , as I am going to show , with little success . Of the two definitions most generally received , one declares man to be a talking , the other , a laughing animal . If the former of these two definitions were confined exclusively to the fairer half of the species , it might not , perhaps , be very easy to find fault with it ; - though even in // that case , it see m* hardly peculiar enough ; for monkeys and magpies both chatter ,  --  and chat and chattering are , I am afraid , as nearly allied in meaning as in sound . But when we come to include in it the nobler half of creation , its impropriety is manifest ; for how many men are there who rise to great eminence in the world , the secret of whose success simply is , that they look wise , and say iiothing ? Still less , can man he properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , who laugh under the lash of the slave-driver , ( as our southern friends assure us is positively the fact , ) might fall properly enough under this definition ; but what shall we do with the long-visaged New-Englander , who inherits from his sober ancestors a set of muscles , which relax not easily into a smile , and the idea , that laughter is idle and dangerous , if not positively sinful ? And what will become of those Chesterfieldian fine gentlemen , who hold audible laughing to be absolutely vulgar ? Having thus , after the manner of philosophers , exposed the absurdity of my predecessors , I am encouraged to propose a definition of my own ,  --  a definition , which , I doubt not , will hand down my name to the latest posterity , coupled with those of St. Thomas Aquinas and Dr. Watts , as a great master of logical precision . In proposing this definition , I do not wish to triumph , unreasonably , over Plato and those other eminent wits , who have heretofore given their attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that my definition , striking and excellent as it is , would hardly have been hit upon , and might , perhaps , have been not very appropriate , in former times . My definition describes men , not as they were two thousand years ago , in the childhood of the world , but as they are now , in its manhood ,  --  now in the nineteenth century . I define man to be a READING ANIMAL . But alas ! it is the fate of genius to be assailed on all sides by the shafts of envy ; and I do not doubt that many of my readers , ( and , of course , all the world reads the Limping Philosopher , ) wrought upon by a certain malevolence , natural to the human heart , will affect to despise this definition of mine , notwithstanding I have taken the pains to have it printed in capital letters . Ah Science ! thy reward is not of this world ; like thy sister Virtue , thou bringest not secular honor , nor terrestrial riches ; thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration ; in the thought , in the certainty , that thou art exalting us towards that heaven , whence we draw our origin ! But what hoarse voice is that I hear , breaking in upon my rhapsody ? What senseless objector is it , that says with a sneer ,  --  " Friend , thy definition is lame of one leg ; t is true that , of all animals , man only reads ; but then all men are not readers . " Sir , I thank you for the objection ,  --  it gives me an opportunity to set this incomparable definition of mine in a new light ,  - -  to show what an amiable definition it is ,  --  and to show , too , its wonderful pliability ,  --  to prove that it will never become antiquated , but will still continue to grow more appropriate as the world grows older . T is true , all men are not now readers ; but , Sir , will you think of ( lenying , that all men ought to be so ? And am I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the poet , I describe " men as they ought to be , not as they are ? " Is this the way you repay my good nature ? True , all men are not now readers ;  --  but then , secondly , all men soon will be so . For has it not been demonstrated , by the most satisfactory // and profound calculations , in my friend Charles Timothy Augustus Teachabout 's Discourse at the annual meeting of the Universal Lyceum , that , in the year eighteen hundred and fifty-two , there will not exist , on the face of the earth , a single human being who can not read ? The march of mind sweeps on , at no snail 's pace , and as it advances , every minute is my definition growing more appropriate . We take it , then , for granted , that man is properly defined a reading animal . But the variety of the human species ,  --  though fast wearing out , under those late improvements in the art of education , by which all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drilled into men of genius ,  --  still in some measure prevails , and readers are to be found of various sorts . Compare , for instance , the German professor , who studies eighteen hours a day , wears shirts of black silk , that he may lose no time in changing his linen , and , instead of wasting five or six hours at his meals , swallows , at intervals , a cup of coffee , or a dish of black broth , while he peruses the Talmud with one eye , runs over the Bhagavut-Gita with the other , and dictates , all the while , to his wife , who ,  --  excellent example ! patiently acts the part of scribe ,  --  a treatise on Egyptian Hieroglyphics ; - compare this diligent German student with the young lady who lolls , dinner over , on the sofa , and with eyes half shut , skims skippingly along the loves of Lucy and Paul Clifford , debating with herself ; at intervals , what dress she shall appear in , at the approaching ball ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner will ask her to dance ; - compare these two pictures , and admit , that all variety in the species is not yet absolutely extinct . But these varieties , marked as they are , are apt to be overlooked . The multitude judges upon hearsay , and is as often wrong as right . If it be said of a man that he studies , the world good-natqredly declares him learned ; if it be reported of a woman that she reads , the world maliciously proclaims her a blue . Whereas , it is my own private opinion , that men may study without growing wise , and ladies may read without growing disagreeable ; - however , this is a private thing between the reader and me , and not at all to the present purpose . Readers may be divided into four classes . The first class , great , perhaps , in merit , but small in numbers , consists of those who read , from a desire to learn . How small this class is , may be readily proved by the single fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of those who belong to it . For of the books that come daily from the press , not one in a hundred teaches any thing at all ; and not one in a thousand teaches any thing new . But this first kind of readers is of small note ; they make little noise in the world , and it is hardly worth our while to spend much time upon them . The second class of readers consists of those who read , in order to write . This class , once small , is rapidly increasing , and threatens soon to include the whole human race . The pia mater of this sort of readers , may justly enough be compared to the bar-room of a tavern , where travelers stop a moment , till they can be shown into a better room ; or to an eastern caravansary , where abundance of rich merchandise is lodged from night to night , which is regularly carried away the next // morning , leaving nothing behind but bare walls . The heads of these readers , who read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere thorough-fare , a sort of conduit pipe , through which a mingled flood of sense and nonsense flows out upon the world . These worthy personages are a sort of literary brokers , who add nothing to the stock of knowledge , but serve to keep in circulation what we already possess . So far they are useful ; but they have an unlucky habit of diluting and corrupting the information which they circulate . They understand , as well as any body , the art of making one equal to two . They possess something of the science of the cook , famous in French history , who served up a dinner of ten courses , out of no better materials , than the hind quarter of a rabbit and a handful of herbs . The matter that might perhaps have made , in less skillful hands , a neat little essay of a page and a half ,  - -  being duly concocted by one of these artists , swelled with commonplaces , sweetened with flattery of our worthy patron , the public , and puffed up with words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the dignity of an article of five and forty pages , which has no fault in the world ,  --  except that it is dull and empty . These readers who write , are like retailers of essences , who buy , indeed , the essential oil , but sell a weak mixture of essence and water ; or rather , like manufacturers of wines , who suffer neither Port , Claret , nor Madeira , to pass out of their hands , till they have doubled its original bulk , and destroyed all its flavor by a most vile addition of brandy , water , acids , and dye-stuffs . The third class of readers are those , who read to say they have read . When conversation happens to turn on literary matters , and a reader of this sort chances to be by , and the new novel or the last review is mentioned , it does one good to hear the- " 0 yes , I ye read it , " which is so eagerly thrust in at the very first opening . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence is pronounced in so soft and gentle , but withal so confident a tone , that the airs and affectations of a first-rate actress could not be more delightful . I love , of all things , to watch these little scenes , when nature shows herself in spite of all disguise . The follies of mankind , when properly improved , are a never-failing source of amusement ; but then they must not be regarded with bitterness , but rather in that spirit of good-natured indulgence , with which we watch the frolics of a favorite child . The fourth class of readers , a most numerous and respectable body , consists of those who read to kill time . These are the true patrons of editors , booksellers , authors and printers . These are they , that devour three editions in succession of thrice distilled nonsense . This is the enlightened public , whose decision is like the irreversible laws of the Medes and Persians ,  --  whose voice is the voice of God ,  --  the voice of wisdom , justice and truth . The Turk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the civilized Christian reads ,  --  and opium , tobacco , books , all alike tend to produce that dizzy , dreaming , drowsy state of mind , which forms , without doubt , the most delicious mode of existence . Such , and so many , arc the various kinds of readers , and such are my reasons for defining man , a reading animal . But , after all ,  --  and notwithstanding every thing that has been said , and proved , and demonstrated , by my worthy friend , Charles Timothy Augustus Teachabout , and his illustrious associates of the Universal Lyceum , it some . // times does strike me , as a little doubtful , whether the increase of reading argues , beyond all doubt , an exactly proportionate increase of wisdom . There is a certain point , beyond which , things can not go . Not all the powder burnt at Waterloo can drive a bullet through the air , beyond a certain degree of swiftness ;  --  and my mind misgives me , that human skulls can contain but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goose quills and printing presses , to the contrary notwithstanding.
