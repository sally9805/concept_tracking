VIII ASTOR HOUSE , BROADWAY . 1839 . Entered according to the Act of Congress , in the year 1839 , by S. COLMAN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , for the Southern District of New-York . New-York : Printed by Scatcherd and Adams , No. 38 Gold Street . PREFACE .  --  I am extremely anxious to guard against any misconception of the design of this little work . I therefore take the liberty of apprising the reader beforehand , that it is not a Play . It was not intended for the stage , and properly is not capable of representation . I have chosen the form of the Dialogue as best suited to my purpose in presenting anew the passions and events of a day long buried in the past , but it is the dialogue in scenes arranged simply with reference to the impressions of the Reader , and wholly unadapted to the requirements of the actual stage . The plan here chosen , involves throughout the repose , the thought , and sentiment of Actual life , instead of the hurried action , the crowded plot , the theatrical elevation which the Stage necessarily demands of the pure Drama . I have only to ask that I may not be condemned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I have not attempted . The story involved in these Dialogues is essentially connected with a well-known crisis in our National History ; nay , it is itself a portion of the historic record , and as such , even with many of its most trifling minuti , is imbedded in our earliest recollections ; but it is rather in its relation to the abstract truth it embodies ,  --  as exhibiting a law in the relation of the human mind to its Invisible protector  --  the apparent sacrifice of the individual in the grand movements for the race ,  --  it is in this light , rather than as an historical exhibition , that I venture to claim for it , as here presented , the indulgent attention of my readers .

DIALOGUE I. Scene . The road-side on the slope of a wooded hill near Fort Edward . The speakers , two young soldiers ,  --  Students in arms . 1st Student . These were the evenings last year , when the bell From the old college tower , would find us still Under the shady elms , with sauntering step And book in hand , or on the dark grass stretched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunset warble . Ah ! that world ,  --  That world we lived in then  --  where is it now ? Like earth to the departed dead , methinks . 2nd Stud . Yet oftenest , of that homeward path I think , Amid the deepening twilight slowly trod , And I can hear the click of that old gate , As once again , amid the chirping yard , I see the summer rooms , open and dark , And on the shady step the sister stands , Her merry welcome , in a mock reproach , Of Love 's long childhood breathing . Oh this year , This year of blood hath made me old , and yet , Spite of my manhood now , with all my heart , I could lie down upon this grass and weep For those old blessed times , the times of peace again . 1st Stud . There will be weeping , Frank , from older eyes , Or e'er again that blessed time shall come . Hearts strong and glad now , must be broke ere then : Wild tragedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make , must yet ere then Be acted here ; ay , with the genuine clasp Of anguish , and fierce stabs , not buried in silk robes , But in hot hearts , and sighs from wrung souls ' depths . And they shall walk in light that we have made , They of the days to come , and sit in shadow Of our blood-reared vines , not counting the wild cost . Thus ' t is : among glad ages many ,  --  one  --  In garlands lies , bleeding and bound . Times past , And times to come , on ours , as on an altar  --  Have laid down their griefs , and unto us Is given the burthen of them all . 2nd Stud . And yet , See now , how pleasantly the sun shines there Over the yellow fields , to the brown fence Its hour of golden beauty  --  giving still . And but for that faint ringing from the fort , That comes just now across the vale to us , And this small band of soldiers planted here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The afternoon amid the valley sleeps . 1st Stud . Yet in the bosom of this gentle time , The crisis of an age-long struggle heaves . 2nd Stud . Age-long ?  --  Why , this land 's history can scarce Be told in ages , yet . 1st Stud . But this war 's can . In that small isle beyond the sea , Francis , Ages , ages ago , its light first blazed . This is the war . Old , foolish , blind prerogative , In ermines wrapped , and sitting on king 's thrones ; Against young reason , in a peasant 's robe His king 's brow hiding . For the infant race Weaves for itself the chains its manhood scorns , ( When time hath made them adamant , alas !  --  ) The reverence of humanity , that gold Which makes power 's glittering round , ordained of God But for the lovely majesty of right , Unto a mad usurper , yielding , all , Making the low and lawless will of man Vicegerent of that law and will divine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the struggle :  --  here , we 'll fight it out . ' T was all too narrow and too courtly there ; In sight of that old pageantry of power We were , in truth , the children of the past , Scarce knowing our own time : but here , we stand In nature 's palaces , and we are men ;  --  Here , grandeur hath no younger dome than this ; And now , the strength which brought us o'er the deep , Hath grown to manhood with its nurture here ,  --  Now that they heap on us abuses , that Had crimsoned the first William 's cheek , to name ,  --  We 're ready now  --  for our last grapple with blind power . Exeunt . DIALOGUE II . Scene . The same . A group of ragged soldiers in conference . 1st Soldier . I am flesh and blood myself , as well as the rest of you , but there is no use in talking . What the devil would you do ?  --  You may talk till dooms-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ?  --  and that 's three months yet . Ay , there 's the point . Show me that . 2nd Sol . Three months ! Ha , thank Heaven mine is up to-morrow ; and , I 'll tell you what , boys , before the sun goes down to-morrow night , you will see one Jack Richards trudging home ,  --  trudging home , Sirs ! None of your bamboozling , your logic , and your figures . A good piece of bread and butter is the figure for me . But you should hear the Colonel , though , as the time draws nigh . Lord ! you 'd think I was the General at least . Humph , says I. 3d Sol . Ay , ay ,  --  feed you on sugar-candy till they get you to sign , and then comes the old shoes and moccasins.  --  2nd Sol . And that 's true enough , Ned . I 've eaten myself , no less than two very decent pair in the service . I 'll have it out of Congress yet though , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your figures for me ! I say , boys , I am going home . 1st Sol . Well , go home , and  --  ca n't any body else breathe ? Why do n't you answer me , John ?  --  What would you have us do ?  --  4th Sol . Ask Will Wilson there . 1st Sol . Will ?  --  Where is he ? 4th Sol . There he stands , alongside of the picket there , his hands in his pockets , whistling , and looking as wise as the dragon . Mind you , there 's always something pinching at the bottom of that same whistle , though its such a don't-care sort of a whistle too . Ask Will , he 'll tell you . 3d Sol . Ay , Will has been to the new quarters to-day . See , he 's coming this way . 5th Sol . And he saw Striker there , fresh from the Jerseys , come up along with that new General there , yesterday . 3d Sol . General Arnold ? 5th Sol . Ay , ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , boys  --  4th Sol . What 's the matter , Will ? 6th Sol . Do you want to know what they say below ? All . Ay , ay , what 's the news ? 6th Sol . All up there , Sirs . A gone horse !  --  and he that turns his coat first , is the best fellow . 4th Sol . No ? 6th Sol . And shall I tell you what else they say ? 4th Sol . Ay . 6th Sol . Shall I ? All . Ay , ay , What is it ? 6th Sol . That we are a cowardly , sneaking , good-for-nothing pack of poltroons , here in the north . There 's for you ! There 's what you get for your pains , Sirs . And for the rest , General Schuyler is to be disgraced , and old Gates is to be set over us again , and  --  no matter for the rest . See here , boys . Any body coming ? See here . 3d Sol . What has he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proclamation ! Will you be good enough to let me see if there is not a picture there somewhere , with an Indian and a tomahawk ? 6th Sol . Now , Sirs , he that wants a new coat , and a pocket full of money  --  3d Sol . That 's me fast enough . 2nd . Sol . If he had mentioned a shirt-sleeve now , or a rim to an old hat  --  4th Sol . Or a bit of a crown , or so . 6th Sol . He that wants a new coat  --  get off from my toes , you scoundrel . All . Let 's see . Let 's see . Read  --  read . 7th Sol . ( Spouting . ) " And he that do n't want his house burned over his head , and his wife and children , or his mother and sisters , as the case may be , butchered or eaten alive before his eyes  --  " 3d Sol . Heavens and earth ! It'ant so though , Wilson , is it ? 7th Sol . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeensborough , on or before the 20th day of August next . Boo  --  boo  --  boo  --  Who but I. Given under my hand . "  --  If it is not it  --  it is something very like it , I can tell you , Sirs . I say , boys , the old rogue wants his neck wrung for insulting honest soldiers in that fashion ; and I say that you  --  for shame , Will Willson. 4th Sol . Hush !  --  the Colonel !  --  Hush ! 2nd Sol . And who is that proud-looking fellow , by his side ? 4th Sol . Hush ! General Arnold . He 's a sharp one  --  roll it up  --  roll it up . 6th Sol . Get out ,  --  you are rumpling it to death . ( Two American officers are seen close at hand , in a bend of the ascending road ; the soldiers enter the woods . ) DIALOGUE III . Scene . The same . 1st Officer . I can not conceal it from you , Sir ; there is but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had some chances in my brief journey  --  2nd Off . Were you at head-quarters ? 1st Off . Yes ,  --  and every step of this retreating army only makes it more desperate . I never knew any thing like the mad , unreasonable terror this army inspires . Burgoyne and his Indians !  --  " Burgoyne and the Indians ! "  --  there is not a girl on the banks of the Connecticut that does not expect to see them by her father 's door ere day-break . Colonel Leslie , what were those men concealing so carefully as we approached just now ?  --  Did you mark them ? 2nd Off . Yes . If I am not mistaken , it was the paper we were speaking of . 1st Off . Ay , ay ,  --  I thought as much . 2nd Off . General Arnold , I am surprised you should do these honest men the injustice to suppose that such an impudent , flimsy , bombastic tirade as that same proclamation of Burgoyne 's , should have a feather 's weight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather 's , ay a feather 's , just so ; but when the scales are turning , a feather counts too , and that is the predicament just now of more minds than you think for , Colonel Leslie . A pretty dark horizon around us just now , Sir ,  --  another regiment goes off to-morrow , I hear . Hey ? Leslie . Why , no . At least we hope not . We think we shall be able to keep them yet , unless  --  that paper might work some mischief with them perhaps , and it would be rather a fatal affair too , I mean in the way of example .  --  These Green Mountain Boys  --  Arnold . Colonel Leslie , Colonel Leslie , this army is melting away like a snow-wreath . There 's no denying it . Your General misses it . The news of one brave battle would send the good blood to the fingers ' ends from ten thousand chilled hearts ; no matter how fearful the odds ; the better , the better ,  --  no matter how large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred better would stand on the field ;  --  Leslie . But then  --  Arnold . By all that 's holy , Sir , if I were head here , the red blood should smoke on this grass ere to-morrow 's sunset . I would have battle here , though none but the birds of the air were left to carry the tale to the nation . I tell you , Colonel Leslie , a war , whose resources are only in the popular feeling , as now , and for months to come , this war 's must be ; a war , at least , which depends wholly upon the unselfishness of a people , as this war does , can be kept alive by excitement only . It was wonderful enough indeed , to behold a whole people , the low and comfort-loving too , in whose narrow lives that little world which the sense builds round us , takes such space , forsaking the tangible good of their merry firesides , for rags and wretchedness ,  --  poverty that the thought of the citizen beggar can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with the news perchance of a home in ashes , or a murdered household , and , last of all , on some dismal day , the edge of the sword or the sharp bullet ending all ;  --  and all in defence of  --  what ?  --  an idea  --  an abstraction ,  --  a thought :  --  I say this was wonderful enough , even in the glow of the first excitement . But now that the Jersey winter is fresh in men 's memories , and Lexington and Bunker Hill are forgotten , and all have found leisure and learning to count the cost ; it were expecting miracles indeed , to believe that this army could hold together with a policy like this . Every step of this retreat , I say again , treads out some lingering spark of enthusiasm . Own it yourself . Is not this army dropping off by hundreds , and desertion too , increasing every hour , thinning your own ranks and swelling your foes ?  --  and that , too , at a crisis  --  Colonel Leslie , retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgoyne once set foot in Albany , and the business is done ,  --  we may roll up our pretty declaration as fast as we please , and go home in peace . Leslie . General Arnold , I have heard you to the end , though you have spoken insultingly of councils in which I have had my share . Will you look at this little clause in this paper , Sir . The excitement you speak of will come ere long , and that at a rate less ruinous than this whole army 's loss . There 's a line  --  there 's a line , Sir , that will make null and void , very soon , if not on the instant , all the evil of these golden promises . There 'll be excitement enough ere long ; but better blood than that shed in battle fields must flow to waken it . Arnold . I hardly understand you , Sir . Is it this threat you point at ? Leslie . Ca n't you see ?  --  They have let loose these hell-hounds upon us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes ;  --  beings that we have sheltered from the air of heaven , brows that have grown pale at the breath of an ungentle word , must meet the red knife of the Indian now . Oh God , this is war ! Arnold . I understand you , Colonel Leslie . There was a crisis like this in New Jersey last winter , I know , when our people were flocking to the royal standard , as they are now , and a few fiendish outrages on the part of the foe changed the whole current in our favor . It may be so now , but meanwhile  --  Leslie . Meanwhile , this army is the hope of the nation , and must be preserved . We are wronged , Sir . Have we not done all that men could do ? What were twenty pitched battles to such an enemy , with a force like ours , compared with the harm we have done them ? Have we not kept them loitering here among these hills , wasting the strength that was meant to tell in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paralyzing them with famine , wearying them with unexciting , inglorious toil , until , divided and dispirited , at last we can measure our power with theirs , and fight , not in vain ? Why , even now the division is planning there , which will bring them to our feet . And what to us , Sir , were the hazards of one bloody encounter , to the pitiful details of this unhonored warfare ?  --  We are wronged  --  we are wronged , Sir . Arnold . There is some policy in the plan you speak of ,  --  certainly , there is excellent policy in it if one had the patience to follow it out ; but then you ca n't make Congress see it , or the people either ; and so , after all , your General is superseded . Well , well , at all events he must abandon this policy now ,  --  it 's the only chance left for him . Leslie . Why ; howso ? Arnold . Or else , do n't you see ?  --  just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps in , and receives it all ; and the laurels which he has been rearing so long , blow just in time to drop on the brow of his rival . Leslie . General Arnold ,  --  excuse me , Sir  --  you do not understand the man of whom you speak . There is a substance in the glory he aims at , to which , all that you call by the name is as the mere shell and outermost rind . Good Heavens ! Do you think that , for the sake of his own individual fame , the man would risk the fate of this great enterprize ?  --  What a mere fool 's bauble , what an empty shell of honor , would that be . If I thought he would  --  Arnold . It might be well for you to lower your voice a little , Sir ; the gentleman of whom you are speaking is just at hand . Other officers are seen emerging from the woods. 3d Off . Yes , if this rumor holds , Lieutenant Van Vechten , your post is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gentlemen  --  Ha !  --  General Arnold ! You are heartily welcome ;  --  I have been seeking you , Sir . If this news is any thing , the movement that was planned for Wednesday , we must anticipate somewhat . Leslie . News from the enemy , General ? Gen. Schuyler . Stay  --  those scouts must be coming in , Van Vechten . Why , we can scarce call it news yet , I suppose ; but if this countryman 's tale is true , Burgoyne himself , with his main corps , is encamping at this moment at the Mills , scarce three miles above us . Arnold . Ay , and good news too . Leslie . But that can not be , Sir  --  Alaska  --  Gen. Schuyler . Alaska has broken faith with us if it is , and the army have avoided the delay we had planned for them .  --  That may be .  --  This man overheard their scouts in the woods just below us here . Arnold . And if it is ,  --  do you talk of retreat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hour 's work perchance , to make those lying enemies of yours in Congress eat the dust , to clear for ever your blackened fame . Why , Heaven itself is interfering to do you right , and throwing honor in your way as it were ! Do you talk of retreat , Sir , now ? Gen. Schuyler . Heaven has other work on hand just now , than righting thewrongs of such heroes as you and I , Sir . Colonel Arnold  --  I beg your pardon , Sir , Congress has done you justice at last I see ,  --  General Arnold , you are right as to the consequence , yet , for all that , if this news is true , I must order the retreat . My reputation I 'll trust in God 's hands . My honor is in my own keeping . Exeunt Schuyler , Leslie , and Van Vechten . Arnold . There 's a smoke from that chimney ; are those houses inhabited , my boy ? Boy . Part of them , Sir . Some of our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the old parsonage there ? Ay , there are ladies there Sir , but I heard Colonel Leslie saying this morning ' t was a sin and a shame for them to stay another hour . Arnold . Ay , Ay . I fancied the Colonel was not dealing in abstractions just now . Exeunt . DIALOGUE IV . Scene . A room in the Parsonage ,  --  an old-fashioned summer parlor.  --  On the side a door and windows opening into an orchard , in front , a yard filled with shade trees . The view beyond bounded by a hill partly wooded . A young girl , in the picturesque costume of the time , lies sleeping on the antique sofa . Annie sits by a table , covered with coarse needle-work , humming snatches of songs as she works . Annie , ( singing . ) Soft peace spreads her wings and flies weeping away . Soft peace spreads her wings and flies weeping away . And flies weeping away . The red cloud of war o'er our forest is scowling , Soft peace spreads her wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the war dogs are howling , Already they eagerly snuff out their prey  --  The red cloud of war  --  the red cloud of war  --  Yes , let me see now ,  --  with a little plotting this might make two  --  two , at least ,  --  and then  --  The red cloud of war o'er our forest is scowling , Soft peace spreads her wings and flies weeping away . The infants affrighted cling close to their mothers , The youths grasp their swords , and for combat prepare ; While beauty weeps fathers , and lovers , and brothers , Who are gone to defend  --   --  Alas ! what a golden , delicious afternoon is blowing without there , wasting for ever ; and never a glimpse of it . Delicate work this ! Here 's a needle might serve for a genuine stiletto ! No matter ,  --  it is the cause ,  --  it is the cause that makes , as my mother says , each stitch in this clumsy fabric a grander thing than the flashing of the bravest lance that brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking in the dell , Tul la lul , tul la lul , The brooks are talking low , and sweet , Under the boughs where th ' arches meet ; Come to the dell , come to the dell , Oh come , come . The birds are singing in the dell , Wee wee whoo , wee wee whoo ; The birds are singing wild and free , In every bough of the forest tree , Come to the dell , come to the dell , Oh come , come . And there the idle breezes lie , Whispering , whispering , Whispering with the laughing leaves . And nothing says each idle breeze , But come , come , come , O lady come , Come to th ' dell . Mrs. Grey enters from without . Mrs. G. Do not sing , Annie . Annie . Crying would better befit the times , I know ,  --  Dear mother , what is this ? Mrs. G. Hush ,  --  asleep  --  is she ? Annie . This hour , and quiet as an infant . Need enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect damask mother ! Mrs. G. Draw the curtain on that sunshine there . This sleep has flushed her . Ay , a painter might have dropped that golden hair ,  --  yet this delicate beauty is but the martyr 's wreath now , with its fine nerve and shrinking helplessness . No , Annie ; put away your hat , my love ,  --  you can not go to the lodge to-night . Annie . Mother ? Mrs. G. You can not go to the glen to-night . This is no time for idle pleasure , God knows . Annie . Why , you have been weeping in earnest , and your cheek is pale .  --  And now I know where that sad appointment led you . Is it over ? That it should be in our humanity to bear , what in our ease we can not , can not think of ! Mrs. G. Harder things for humanity are there than bodily anguish , sharp though it be . It was not the boy ,  --  the mother 's anguish , I wept for , Annie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his dying day , a crippled thing . But yesterday I saw him springing by so proudly ! And the mother  --  Mrs. G. " Words , words , " she answered sternly when I tried to comfort her ; " ay , words are easy . Wait till you see your own child 's blood . Wait till you stand by and see his young limbs hewn away , and the groans come thicker and thicker that you can not soothe ; and then let them prate to you of the good cause . " Bitter words ! God knows what is in store for us ;  --  all day this strange dread has clung to me . Annie . Dear mother , is not this the superstition you were wont to chide ? Mrs. G. Ay , ay , we should have been in Albany ere this . In these wild times , Annie , every chance-blown straw that points at evil , is likely to prove a faithful index ; and if it serve to nerve the heart for it , we may call it heaven-sent indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the enemy , so at least goes the rumor , are nearer than we counted on this morning , and  --  hush , not a word . Annie . She is but dreaming . Just so she murmured in her sleep last night ; twice she waked me with the saddest cry , and after that she sat all night by the window in her dressing-gown , I could not persuade her to sleep again . Tell me , mother , you say and  --  and what ? Mrs. G. I can not think it true , ' t is rumored though , that these savage neighbors of ours have joined the enemy . Annie . No ! no ! Has Alaska turned against us ? Why , it was but yesterday I saw him with Leslie in yonder field . ' T is false ; it must be . Surely he could not harm us . Mrs. G. And false , I trust it is . At least till it is proved otherwise , Helen must not hear of it . Annie . And why ? Mrs. Grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add to the idle fear with which she regards them all , already . Some dark fancy possesses her to-day ; I have marked it myself . Annie . It is just two years to-morrow , mother , sinc Helen 's wedding day , or rather , that sad day that should have seen her bridal ; and it can not be that she has quite forgotten Everard Maitland . Alas , he seemed so noble ! Mrs. G. Hush ! Never name him . Your sister is too high-hearted to waste a thought on him . Tory ! Helen is no love-lorn damsel , child , to pine for an unworthy love . See the rose on that round cheek ,  --  it might teach that same haughty loyalist , could he see her now , what kind of hearts ' t is that we patriots wear , whose strength they think to trample . Where are you going , Annie ? Annie . Not beyond the orchard-wall . I will only stroll down the path here , just to breathe this lovely air a little ; indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exit . Mrs. G. Did I say right , Helen ? It can not be feigned . Those quick smiles , with their thousand lovely meanings ; those eyes , whose beams lead straight to the smiling soul . Principle is it ? There is no principle in this , but joy , or else it strikes so deep , that the joy grows up from it , genuine , not feigned ; and yet I have found her weeping once or twice of late , in unexplained agony . Helen ! Helen . Oh mother ! is it you ? Thank God . I thought  --  Mrs. G. What did you think ? What moves you thus ? Helen . I thought  --  ' t is nothing . This is very strange . Mrs. G. Why do you look through that window thus ? There 's no one there ! What is it that 's so strange ? Helen . Is it to-morrow that we go ? Mrs. G. To Albany ? Why , no ; on Thursday . You are bewildered , Helen ! surely you could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do . Mrs. G. My child , yesterday , when the question was debated here , and wishing might have been of some avail , ' t is true you did not say much , but I thought , and so we all did , that you chose to stay . Helen . Did you ? Mother , does the road to Albany wind over a hill like that ? Mrs. G. Like what , Helen ? Helen . Like yonder wooded hill , where the soldiers are stationed now ? Mrs. G. Not that I know of ? Why ? Helen . Perhaps we may cross that very hill ,  --  no  --  could we ? Mrs. G. Not unless we should turn refugees , my love ; an event of which there is little danger just now , I think . That road , as indeed you know yourself , leads out directly to the British camp . Helen . Yes  --  yes  --  it does . I know it does . I will not yield to it . ' T is folly , all . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my child . Put on your hat , and go into the garden for a little , the air is fresh and pleasant now ; or take a ramble through the orchard if you will , you might meet Annie there ,  --  no , yon she comes , and well too . It 's quite time that I were gone again . I wish that we had nothing worse than dreams on hand . Helen , I must talk with you about these fancies ; you must not thus unnerve yourself for real evil . Exit . Helen . It were impossible ,  --  it could not be !  --  how could it be ?  --  Oh ! these are wild times . Unseen powers are crossing their meshes here around us ,  --  and , what am I ?  --  Powers ?  --  there 's but one Power , and that  --  " He careth for the little bird , Far in the lone wood 's depths , and though dark weapons And keen eyes are out , it falleth not But at his will .

A young British Officer appears , attended by a soldier in the American uniform ; the latter with a small sealed pacquet in his hand . Off . Hist ! Sol . Well , so I did ; but  --  Off . Hist , I say ! Sol . A squirrel it is , Sir ; there he sits . Off . By keeping this path you avoid the picket on the hill . It will bring you out where these woods skirt the vale , and scarcely a hundred rods from the house itself . Calling without . Sol . Captain Andre  --  Sir . Off . It were well that the pacquet should fall into no other hands . With a little caution there is no danger . It will be twilight ere you get out of these woods  --  Sol .

For God 's sake , Andre ! ( motioning silence . ) Are you mad ? Andre . Well , who are they ? Mait . Who ? Have you forgotten that we are on the enemy 's ground ? Soldiers from the fort , no doubt . They have crossed that opening twice since we stood here . Andre . Well , let them cross twice more . I would run the risk of a year 's captivity , at least , for one such glimpse . Nay , come , she will be gone . Mait . Stay ,  --  not yet . There , again ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pass just now . It must have cost the rogues an infinite deal of pains though . A regular , handsome sword-cut is nothing to a dozen of these same ragged scratches , that a man ca n't swear about . After all , Captain Maitland , these cunning Yankees understand the game . They will keep out of our way , slyly enough , until we are starved , and scratched , and fretted down to their proportions , meanwhile they league the very trees against us . Mait . As to that , we have made some leagues ourselves , I think , quite as hard to be defended , Sir . Andre . It may be so . Should we not be at the river by this ? Mait . Sunset was the time appointed . We are as safe here , till then . Andre . ' T is a little temple of beauty you have lighted on , in truth . These pretty singers overhead , seem to have no guess at our hostile errand . Methinks their peaceful warble makes too soft a welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's American . One might win bloodless laurels here . Will you stand a moment just as you are , Maitland ;  --  ' t is the very thing . There 's a little space in my unfinished picture , and with that a la Kemble mien , you were a fitting mate for this young Dian here , ( taking a pencil sketch from his portfolio , )  --  the beauty-breathing , ay , beauty-breathing , it 's no poetry ;  --  for the lonesome little glen smiled to its darkest nook with her presence . Mait . What are you talking of , Andre ? Fairies and goddesses !  --  What next ? Andre . I am glad you grow a little curious at last . Why I say , and your own eyes may make it good if you will , that just down in this glen below here , not a hundred rods hence , there sits , or stands , or did some fifteen minutes since , some creature of these woods , I suppose it is ; what else could it be ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offend you , Sir ; but this I 'll say , a young cheek and smiling lip it had , whate'er it was , and round and snowy arm , and dimpled hand , that lay ungloved on her sylvan robe , and eyes  --  I tell you plainly , they lighted all the glen . Mait . Ha ? A lady ?  --  there ? Are you in earnest ? Andre . A lady , well you would call her so perchance . Such ladies used to spring from the fairy nut-shells , in the old time , when the kings ' son lacked a bride ; and if this were Windsor forest that stretches about us here , I might fancy , perchance , some royal one had wandered out , to cool the day 's glow in her cheek , and nurse her love-dream ; but here , in this untrodden wilderness , unless your ladies here spring up like flowers , or drop down on invisible pinions from above , how , in the name of reason , came she here ? Mait . On the invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust me . Andre . Come , come ,  --  see for yourself . On my word I was a little startled though , as my eye first lighted on her , suddenly , in that lonesome spot . There she sat , so bright and still , like some creature of the leaves and waters , such as the old Greeks fabled , that my first thought was to worship her ; my next  --  of you , but I could not leave the spot until I had sketched this ; I stood unseen , within a yard of her ; for I could see her soft breath stirring the while . See , the scene itself was a picture ,  --  the dark glen , the lonesome little lodge , on the very margin of the fairy lake  --  here she sat , motionless as marble ; this bunch of roses had dropped from her listless hand , and you would have thought some tragedy of ancient sorrow , were passing before her , in the invisible element , with such a fixed and lofty sadness she gazed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing to your eye ; for me , it will serve to bring the whole out at my leisure . Indeed , the air , I think , I have caught a little as it is . Mait . A little  --  you may say it . She is there , is she ?  --  sorrowful ; well , what is't to me ? Andre . What do you say ?  --  There ?  --  Yes , I left her there at least . Come , come . I 'll show you one will teach you to unlearn this fixed contempt of gentle woman . Come . Mait . Let go , if you please , Sir . She who gave me my first lesson in that art , is scarcely the one to bid me now unlearn it , and I want no new teaching as yet , thank Heaven . Will you come ? We have loitered here long enough , I think . Andre . What , under the blue scope  --  what the devil ails you , Maitland ? Mait . Nothing , nothing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my wife . Andre . Nonsense ! Mait . There lacked  --  three days , I think it was , three whole days , to the time when the law would have given her that name ; but for all that , was she mine , and is ; Heaven and earth can not undo it . Andre . Are you in earnest ? Why , are we not here in the very heart of a most savage wilderness , where never foot of man trod before ,  --  unless you call these wild red creatures men ? Mait . You talk wildly ; that path , followed a few rods further , would have brought you out within sight of her mother 's door . Andre . Ha ! you have been in this wilderness then , ere now ? Mait . Have you forgotten the fortune I wasted once on a summer 's seat , some few miles up , on the lake above ? These Yankees did me the grace to burn it , just as the war broke out . Andre . Ay , ay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those blackened ruins we passed last evening , perchance ;  --  and the lady  --  my wood-nymph , what of her ? Mait . Captain Andre , I beg your pardon , Sir . That sketch of yours reminded me , by chance perhaps , of one with whom some painful passages of my life are linked ; and I said , in my haste , what were better left unsaid . Do me the favor not to remind me that I have done so . Andre . So  --  so ! And I am to know nothing more of this smiling apparition ; nay , not so much as to speak her name ? Consider , Maitland , I am your friend it is true ; but , prithee , consider the human in me . Give her a local habitation , or at least a name . Mait . I have told you already that the lady you speak of resides not far hence . On the border of these woods you may see her home . I may point it out to you securely , some few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of the American army , this must content you . Andre . A wild risk for a creature like that ! Have these Americans no safer place to bestow their daughters than the fastnesses of this wilderness ? Mait . It would seem so . Yet it is her home . Wild as it looks here , from the top of that hill , where our men came out on the picket just now so suddenly , you will see as fair a picture of cultured life as e'er your eyes looked on . No English horizon frames a lovelier one . Andre . Here ? No ! Mait . Between that hill and the fort , there stretches a wide and beautiful plain , covered with orchards and meadows to the wood 's edge ; and here and there a gentle swell , crowned with trees , some patch of the old wilderness . The infant Hudson winds through it , circling in its deepest bend one little fairy isle , with woods enough for a single bower , and a beauty that fills and characterizes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and far away in the east , this same azure mountain-chain we have traced so long , with its changeful light and shade , finishes the scene . Andre . You should have been a painter , Maitland . Mait . The first time I beheld it  --  one summer evening it was , from the woods on the hill 's brow ;  --  we were a hunting party , I had lost my way , and ere I knew it there I stood ;  --  its waters lay glittering in the sunset light , and the window-panes of its quiet dwellings were flashing like gold ,  --  the old brown houses looked out through the trees like so many lighted palaces ; and even the little hut of logs , nestling on the wood 's edge , borrowed beauty from the hour . I was miles from home ; but the setting sun could not warn me away from such a paradise , for so it seemed , set in that howling wilderness , and  --  Andre . Prithee , go on . I listen . Mait . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly down the shady road , for the first time in years of worldliness , the dream that had haunted my boyhood revived again . Do you know what I mean , Andre ?  --  that dim yearning for lovelier beings and fairer places , whose ideals lie in the heaven-fitted mind , but not in the wilderness it wakes in ; that mystery of our nature , that overlooked as it is , and trampled with unmeaning things so soon , hides , after all , the whole secret of this life 's dark enigma . Andre . But see ,  --  our time is well-nigh gone ,  --  this is philosophy  --  I would have heard a love tale . Mait . It was then , that near me , suddenly I heard the voice that made this dull , real world , thenceforth a richer place for me than the gorgeous dream-land of childhood was of old . Andre . Ay , ay  --  go on . Mait . Andre , did you ever meet an eye , in which the intelligence of our nature idealized , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look forth ? Andre . One such . Mait.  --  That reflected your whole being ; nay , revealed from its mysterious depths , new consciousness , that yet seemed like a faint memory , the traces of some old and pleasant dream ? Andre . Methinks the heavenly revelation itself doth that . Mait . Such an eye I saw then shining on me . A clump of stately pines grew on the sloping road-side , and , looking into its dark embrasure , I beheld a group of merry children around a spring that gurgled out of the hill-side there , and among them , there sat a young girl clad in white , her hat on the bank beside her , tying a wreath of wild flowers . That was all  --  that was all , Andre . Andre . Well , she was beautiful , I suppose ? Nay , if it was the damsel I met just now I need not ask . Mait . Beautiful ? Ay , they called her so . Beauty I had seen before ; but from that hour the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stones of this dull earth were precious to me . Beautiful ? Nay , it was she . I knew her in an instant , the spirit of my being ; she whose existence made the lovely whole , of which mine alone had been the worthless and despised fragment . There are a thousand women on the earth the artist might call as lovely ,  --  show me another that I can worship . Andre . Worship ! This is Captain Everard Maitland . If I should shut my eyes now  --  Mait . Well , go on ; but I tell you , ne'ertheless , there have been times , even in this very spot ,  --  we often wandered here when the day was dying as it is now ,  --  here in her soft , breathing loveliness , she has stood beside me , when I have ,  --  worshipped ?  --  nay , feared her , in her holy beauty , as we two should an angel who should come through that glade to us now . Andre . True it is , something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its intenser forms , repels with all its winningness , until the lowliness of love looks through it . Well  --  you worshipped her . Mait . Nay , you have told the rest . I would have worshipped ; but one day there came a look from those beautiful eyes , when I met them suddenly , with a gaze that sought the mystery of their beauty ,  --  a single look , and in an instant the drooping lash had buried it forever ; but I knew , ere it fell , that the world of her young being was all mine already . Another life had been forever added unto mine ; a whole creation ; yet , like Eden 's fairest , it but made another perfect ; a new and purer self ; and in it grew the heaven , and the fairy-land of my old dreams , lovelier than ever . You have loved yourself , Andre , else I should weary you . Andre . Not a bit the more do I understand you though . You talk most lover-like ; that 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part worse played . Why , here 's your ladye-love , this self-same idol of whom you rave , at this moment perchance , breathing within these woods ,  --  years too  --  two mortal years it must be , since you have seen her face ; and yet  --  you stand here yet , with folded arms ;  --  a goodly lover , on my word ! Mait . Softly , Sir ! you grace me with a title to which I can lay no claim . Lover I was , may be . I am no lover now , not I  --  not I ; you are right ; I would not walk to that knoll 's edge to see the lady , Sir . Andre . Well , I must wait your leisure , I see . Mait . And yet , the last time that we stood together here , her arm lay on mine , my promised wife . A few days more , and by my name , all that loveliness had gone . There needed only that to make that tie holy in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but needed there that , or any thing to make it such in ours . Why , love lay in her eye , that evening , like religion , solemn and calm .  --  We should have smiled then at the thought of any thing in height or depth , ending , what through each instant seemed to breathe eternity from its own essence ;  --  we were one , one ,  --  that trite word makes no meaning in your ear ,  --  to me , life 's roses burst from it ; music , sunshine , Araby , should image what it means ; what it meant rather , for it is over . Andre . What was it , Maitland ? Mait . Oh ,  --  well ,  --  she did not love me ; that was all . So far my story has told the seeming only , but ere long the trial came , and then I found it was seeming , in good sooth . The Rebellion had then long been maturing , as you know ; but just then came the crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my king 's part against these rebels , and at once I was outraged , wronged beyond all human bearing . Her mad brother , her 's , her 's what a world of preciousness , Andre , that little word once enshrined for me ; and still it seems like some broken vase , fragrant with what it held . Andre . And ever with that name , a rosy flash Paints , for an instant , all my world . Nay , ' t is a little love-poem of my own ; go on , Maitland . Mait . This brother I say , quarrelled with me , though I had borne from him unresentingly , what from another would have seemed insult . We quarrelled at last , and the house was closed against me , or would have been had I sought access ; for I walked sternly by its pleasant door that afternoon , though I remember now how the very roses that o'erhung the porch , the benched and shaded porch , that lovely lingering place , seemed to beckon me in . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open window ,  --  even now those lowly rooms make a brighter image of heaven to me than the jewelled walls that of old grew in the pageant of our sabbath dreams . Andre . And thus you abandoned yourlove ? A quarrel with her brother ? Mait . I never wronged her with the shadow of a doubt . Directly , that same day , I wrote to her to fix our meeting elsewhere , that we might renew our broken plans in some fitter shape for the altered times . She sent me a few lines of grave refusal , Sir ; and the next letter was returned unopened . Andre . ' T was that brother ! Pshaw ! ' t was that brother , Maitland . I 'll lay my life the lady saw no word of it . Mait . I might have thought so too , perchance ; but that same day ,  --  the morning had brought the news from Boston ,  --  I met her by chance , by the spring in the little grove where we first met ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother , sisters !  --  What was their right to mine ? All that the round world holds , or the universe , what could it be to her ?  --  that is , if she had loved me ever ; which , past all doubt , she never did . Andre . Maitland ! Heavens , how this passion blinds you ! And you expected a gentle , timid girl like that to abandon all she loved . Nay , to make her home in the very camp , where death and ruin unto all she loved , was the watchword ? Mait . I beg your pardon , Sir . I looked for no such thing . I offered to renounce my hopes of honor here for her ; a whole life 's plans , for her sake I counted nothing . I offered her a home in England too , the very real of her girlhood 's wish ; my blighted fortunes since , or a home in yonder camp ,  --  never , never . But if I had , ay , if I had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , it is not love , to which such barriers were any thing . Andre . Oh well , a word 's a word . That 's as one likes . Only with your definition , give me leave to say , marvellous little love , Captain Maitland , marvellous little you will find in this poor world of ours . Mait . I 'll grant ye . Andre . If there is any thing like it outside of a poet 's skull , ne'er credit me . Mait . Strange it should take such shape in the creating thought and in the yearning heart , when all reality hath not its archetype . Andre . Hist ! Mait . A careful step ,  --  one of our party I fancy . Andre . ' T is time we were at the rendezvous . If we have to recross the river as we came , on the stumps of that old bridge , we had best keep a little day-light with us , I think . Exeunt . DIALOGUE II . Scene . A chamber in the Parsonage . Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Helen Grey , where on earth have you been ? Wood flowers ! Helen . Come and look at this sunset . Annie . Surely you have not , you can not have been in those woods , Helen : and yet , where else could this periwinkle grow , and these wild roses ?  --  Delicious ! Helen . Hear that flute . It comes from among those trees by the river side . Annie . It is the shower that has freshened every thing , and made the birds so musical . You should stand in the door below , as I did just now , to see the fort and the moistened woods stands out from that black sky , with all this brightness blazing on them . Helen . ' T is lovely  --  all . Annie . There goes the last golden rim over the blackening woods ; already even a shade of tender mourning steals over all things , the very children 's voices under this tree ,  --  how soft they grow . Helen . Will the day come when we shall see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills ? Annie . Nay , Helen , why do you mar this lovely hour with a thought like that ? Helen . And in another life , shall we see light , when his , for us , shines no more ?  --  What sound is that ? Annie . That faint cry from the woods ? Helen . No ,  --  more distant ,  --  far off as the horizon , like some mighty murmur , faintly borne , it came . Annie . I wish that we had gone to-day . I do not like this waiting until Thursday ;  --  just one of that elder brother 's foolish whims it was . I can not think how your consent was won to it . Did you meet any one in your walk just now ? Helen . No  --  Yes , yes , I did . The little people where I went , I met by hundreds , Annie . Through the dark aisles , and the high arches , all decked in blue , and gold , and crimson , they sung me a most merry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not think how like long-forgotten friends they looked , smiling up from their dark homes , upon me . Annie . You have had chance enough to forget them indeed ,  --  it is two years , Helen , since you have been in those woods before . What could have tempted you there to-day ? Helen . Was there danger then ?  --  was there danger indeed ?  --  I was by the wood-side ere I knew it , and then ,  --  it was but one last look I thought to take  --  nay , what is it , Annie ? George met me as I was coming home , and I remember something in his eye startled me at first ; but if there was danger , I should have known of it before . Annie . How could we dream of your going there this evening , when we knew you had never set your foot in those woods since the day Everard Maitland left Fort Edward ? Helen . Annie ! Annie . For me , I would as soon have looked to see Maitland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Annie ! Annie Grey ! You must not , my sister  --  do not speak that name to me , never again , never . Annie . Why , Helen , I am sorry to have grieved you thus ; but I thought  --  Look ! look ! There go those officers again ,  --  there , in the lane between the orchards . Scarcely half an hour ago they went by to the fort in just such haste . There is something going on there , I am sure . ( Helen rises from the window , and walks the room . Annie . In truth there was a rumor this afternoon ,  --  you are so timid and fanciful , our mother chose you should not hear it while it was rumor only ; but ' t is said that a party of the enemy have been seen in those woods to-day , and , among them , the Indians we have counted so friendly . Do you hear me , Helen ? Helen . That he should live still ! Yes , it is all real still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pageant to me , is still real somewhere . Those eyes  --  they are darkly shining now ; this very moment that passes me , drinks their beauty ;  --  that voice ,  --  that tone ,  --  that very tone  --  on some careless ear , even now it wastes its luxury of blessing . Continents of hail and darkness , the polar seas  --  all earth 's distance , could never have parted me from him ; but now I live in the same world with him , and the everlasting walls blacken between us . Those looks may shine on the dull earth and senseless stones , but not on me ; on uncaring eyes , but not on mine ; though for one moment of their lavished wealth , I could cheaply give a life without them ; never again , never , never , never shall their love come to me . Annie . Who would have thought she could cherish in secret a grief like this ? Dear sister , we all believed you had forgotten that sad affair long ago ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy ?  --  I am , you were right ; but I have been to-day down to the very glen where we took that last lovely walk together , and all the beautiful past came back to me like life .  --  I am happy ; you must count me so still . Annie . With what I have just now heard , how can I ? Helen . It is this war that has parted us ; and so , this is but my part in these noble and suffering times , and that great thought reaches over all my anguish . But for this war I might have been  --  hath this world such flowers , and do they call it a wilderness ?  --  I might have been , even now , you know it , Annie , his wife , his wife , his . But our hearts are cunningly made , many-stringed ; and often much good music is left in them when we count them broken . That which makes the bitterness of this ot , the inconceivable , unutterable bitterness of it , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it God 's kindness too . Annie . I do not understand you , sister . Helen . What if this young royalist , Annie , when he quarrelled with my brother , and took arms against my country , what if he had kept faith to me ? Annie . Well . Helen . Well ? Oh no , it would not have been well . Why , my home would have been with that pursuing army now , my fate bound up with that hollow cause ,  --  these very hands might have fastened the sword of oppression ; nay , the sword whose edge was turned against you , against you all , and against the cause , that with tears , night and morning , you were praying for , and with your heart 's best blood stood ready to seal every hour . No , it is best as it is ; or if my wish grows deeper still , if in my heart I envy , with murmuring thought , the blessed brides , on whose wedding dawns the laughing sun of peace , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering times .  --  It is best as it is . I am content . Annie . I wish I could understand you , Helen . You say , " if he had kept faith to you ; "  --  carried you off , you mean ! Do you mean , sister Helen , that of your own will you would ever have gone with him , with Everard Maitland ,  --  that traitor ? Helen . Gone with him ? Would I not ? Would I not ? Dear child , we talk of what , as yet , you know nothing of . Gone with him ? Some things are holy , Annie , only until the holier come . Annie . ( looking toward the door . ) Stay , stay . What is it , George ? ( George Grey comes in . ) George . I was seeking our mother . What should it be , but ill news ? This tide is against us , and if it be not well-night full , we may e'en fold our arms for the rest . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every face you see looks as if a thunder-clond were passing it . I heard one man say , just now , as I came in , that the war would be over in a fortnight 's time . There 'll be some blood spilt ere then , I reckon though . Helen . What paper is that that reddens her cheek so suddenly ? Annie . The McGregor 's !  --  think of it , Helen ,  --  gone over to the British side , and St. John of the Glens , and  --  who brought you this letter , George ? ' T is false ! I do not believe it , not a word of it . Why , here are twenty names , people that we know , the most honorable , too ,  --  forsaking us now , at such a crisis ! George .

What sort of barracks think you , would that fine country-seat of McGregor 's make ?  --  and St. John 's  --  he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with beautiful grain , that a week will ripen , and so , he is for turning his sword into a sickle ;  --  besides , there are worse things than pillage threatened here . Look , ( unfolding a hand-bill . ) Just at this time comes this villainous proclamation from Skeensborough , scattered about among our soldiers nobody knows how , half of them on the eve of desertion before , and the other half  --  what ails you , Helen ? Helen . There he stands ! Annie . Is she crazed ? Why do you clasp your hands so wildly ? for Heaven 's sake , Helen !  --  her cheek is white as death .  --  Helen ! Helen . Is he gone , Annie ? Annie . As I live , I do not know what you are talking of . Nay , look ; there is no one here , none that you need fear , most certainly . Helen . I saw him , his eye was on me ; there he stood , looking through that window , smiling and beckoning me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name ? This is fancy-work . Helen . I saw him as I see you now . He stood on that roof ,  --  an Indian ,  --  I saw the crimson bars on his face , and the blanket , and the long wild hair on his shoulders ; and  --  and , I saw the gleaming knife in his girdle ,  --  Oh God ! I did . George . Ay , ay , ' t was that scoundrel that dogged us in our way home , I 'll lay my life it was . Helen . In our way home ? An Indian , I said . George . Well , well , and I say an Indian , a rascal Indian , was watching and following us all the way home just now . Helen . George ! George . Then you did not see him after all . In truth , I did not mean you should , for we could not have hurried more , but all the time we sat in that shanty , while it rained , about as far off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushes , watching us , or rather you . And you saw him here ? He might have crept along by that orchard wall . What are you laughing at , Annie ?  --  I will go and see what sort of a guard we have . Annie . If you knew as much of Helen 's Indians as I do , you would hardly be in such a hurry , George , I mean about this one that was here just now , for there are Indians in yonder forest I suppose ; but since we were so high , I never walked in the woods with her once , but that we encountered one , or heard his steps among the bushes at least ; and if it chanced to be as late as this , there would be half a dozen of them way-laying us in the road ,  --  but sometimes they turned out squirrels , and sometimes logs of wood , and sometimes mere air , air of about this color . We want a little light , that is all . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen of them with a candle 's beams . ( George goes out . ) Helen . Do not laugh at me to-night , Annie . Annie . But what should the Indians want of you , pry'thee ; tell me that , Helen ? Helen . God knows . Wait till the sun sets to-morrow , and I will laugh with you if you are merry then . Annie . Why to-morrow ?  --  because it is our last day here ? Tuesday  --  Wednesday  --  yes ; the next day we shall be on the road to Albany . Exit . Helen . I am awake now . Watched me in the glen ?  --  followed me home ? Those woods are full of them .  --  But what has turned their wild eyes on me ? It is but one day longer ;  --  we have counted many , in peril and fear , and this , is the last ;  --  even now how softly the fearful time wastes . One day !  --  Oh God , thou only knowest what its shining walls encircle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Two years ago I stood here , and prayed to die .  --  On that same tree my eye rested then . With what visions of hope I played under it once , building bowers for fairies I verily thought would come , and dreaming , with yearning heart , of glorious and beautiful things this world hath not . But , that wretched day , through blinding tears , I saw the sunlight on its glossy leaves , and I said , let me see that light no more . ' Surely the bitterness is deep when that which hath colored all our unfolded being , is a weariness . For what more hath life for me I thought , its lesson is learned and its power is spent ,  --  it can please , and it can trouble me no more ; and why should I stay here in vain and wearily ? It was sad enough , indeed , to see the laughing spring returning again , when the everlasting winter had set in within , to link with each change of the varied year , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , one by one , all hope 's blessed spells , withered and broken forever ,  --  the moonlight , the songs of birds , the blossom showers of April , the green and gold of autumn 's sunset ,  --  it was sad , but it was not in vain .  --  Not in vain , Oh God , didst thou deny that weeping prayer . ( A merry voice is heard without , and a child 's face peeps through the window that overlooks the orchard . ) Child . Look ! look ! sister Helen ! see what I have found on the roof of the piazza here ,  --  all covered with wampum and scarlet , and here are feathers too  --  two feathers in it , blue and yellow  --  eagle 's feathers they are , I guess . Helen ( approaching the window . ) Let me see , Willy . What , did you find it here ? Willy . Just under the window here . Frank and I were swinging on the gate ; and  --  there is something hard in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very curious ; but  --  Willy . There comes Netty with the candle ; now we can see to untie this knot . Helen . Willy , dear Willy , you must give it to me , you must indeed , and  --  I will paint you a bird to-morrow . Willy . A blue-bird , will you ? A real one ? Helen . Yes , yes ;  --  run down little climber ; see how dark it grows , and Frank is waiting , see . Willy . Well . But mind you , it must be a blue bird then . A real one . With the red on his breast , and all . Exit . ( She walks to the table , unfastening the envelope . ) Helen . What sent that thrill of forgotten life through me then ?  --  that wild , delicious thrill ? This is strange , indeed . A sealed pacquet within ! and here  --  ( She glances at the superscription , and the pacquet drops from her hand . ) No  --  no . I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always .

( Handing him a glass . ) See , they are beginning to form again . It looks for all the world like a funeral train . 5th Sol . What was the Stamp Act to us , or all the acts beyond the sea that ever were acted , so long as they left us our golden fields , our Sabbath days , the quiet of the summer evening door , and the merry winter hearth . The Stamp Act ? It would have been cheaper for us to have written our bills on gold-leaf , and for tea , to have drunk melted jewels , like the queen I read of once ; cheaper and better , a thousand times , than the bloody cost we are paying now . 4th Sol . It was not the money , Will ,  --  it was not the money , you know . The wrong it was . We could not be trampled on in that way ,  --  it was not in us  --  we could not . 5th Sol . Ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that when we sat in the door of a moonlight evening and the day 's toils were done . It was easy talking then . Trampled on ! I will tell you when I was nearest being trampled on , Andros ,  --  when I lay on the ground below there last winter ,  --  on the frozen ground , with the blood running out of my side like a river , and a great high heeled German walking over my shoulder as if I had been a hickory log . I can tell you , Sir , that other was a moon-shiny sort of a trampling to that . I shall bear to be trampled on in figures the better for it , as long as I live . Between ourselves now  --  4th Sol . There 's no one here . 5th Sol . There are voices around that corner , though . Come this way . They pass on . ( Another group of Soldiers. ) 1st Sol . Then if nothing else happens , we are off now . Hillo , Martin ! Here we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say now ? Hey , M r.Martin , what do you say now ? 2nd Sol . ( Advancing . ) What I said before . 1st Sol . But where is all this to end , Sir ? Tell us that  --  tell us that . 3d Sol . Yes , yes ,  --  tell us that . If you do n't see Burgoyne safe in Albany by Friday night , never trust me , Sirs . 1st Sol . A bad business we 've made of it . 4th Sol . Suppose he gets to Albany ;  --  do you think that would finish the war ? 3d Sol . Well , indeed , I thought that was settled on all hands , Sir . I believe the General himself makes no secret of that . 4th Sol . And what becomes of us all then ? We shall go back to the old times again , I suppose ;  --  were n't so very bad though , Sam , were they ? 1st Sol . We have seen worse , I 'll own . 3d Sol . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress and its army , and all these presidents , and gene als , and colonels , and aide-de-camps ?  --  wont it look like a great baby-house when the hubbub is over , and the colonies settle quietly down again ? 2nd Sol . Faith , you take it very coolly . Before that can happen , do you know what must happen to you ? 1st Sol . Nothing worse than this , I reckon . 2nd Sol . ( makes a gesture to denote hanging. ) 4th Sol . What would they hang us though ? Do you think they would really hang us , John ? 2nd Sol . Wait and see . 1st Sol . Nonsense ! nonsense ! A few of the ringleaders , Schuyler , and Hancock , and Washington , and a few such , they will hang of course ,  --  but for the rest ,  --  we shall have to take the oath anew , and swallow a few duties with our sugar and tea , and  --  2nd Sol . You talk as if the matter were all settled already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , than that you and I stand here this moment . Why , they are flocking to Skeensborough from all quarters now , and this poor fragment ,  --  this miserable skeleton of an army , which is the only earthly obstacle between Burgoyne and Albany , why , even this is crumbling to pieces as fast as one can reckon . Two hundred less than we were yesterday at this hour , and to-morrow  --  how many are off to-morrow ? Ay , and what are we doing the while ? Bowing and retreating , cap in hand , from post to post , from Crown Point to Ticonderoga , from Ticonderoga to Fort Edward , from Fort Edward onward ; just showing them down , as it were , into the heart of the land . Let them get to Albany  --  Ah , let them once get to Albany , they 'll need no more of our help then , they 'll take care of themselves then and us too . 2nd Sol . They 'll never get to Albany . 1st Sol . Hey ? 2nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sol . What 's to hinder them ? 2nd Sol . We ,  --  yes we ,  --  and such as we , cravenhearted as we are . They 'll never get to Albany until we take them there captives . 3d Sol . Then they 'll wait till next week , I reckon . 1st Sol . Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! How many prison ers shall we have a-piece , John ? How many regiments , I mean ? They 'll open the windows when we get there , wo n't they ? I hope the sun will shine that day . How grandly we shall march down the old hill there , with our train behind us . I shall have to borrow a coat of one of them though , they might be ashamed of their captor else . 3d Sol . When is this great battle to be , John ? This do n't look much like it . 4th Sol . I think myself , if the General would only give us a chance to fight  --  2nd Sol . A chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you . A chance to fight , you will have ere long ,  --  doubt it not . Our General might clear his blackened fame , by opposing this force to that ,  --  this day he might ;  --  he will not do it . The time has not yet come . But he will spare no pains to strengthen the army , and prepare it for victory , and the glory he will leave to his rival . Recruits will be pouring in ere long . General Burgoyne 's proclamation has weakened us ,  --  General Schuyler will issue one himself to-day . 1st Sol . Will he ? will he ? What will he proclaim ?  --  As to the recruits he gets , I 'll eat them all , skin and bone . What will he proclaim ? You see what Burgoyne offers us . On the one hand , money and clothing , and protection for ourselves and our families ; and on the other , the cord , and the tomahawk , and the scalping-knife . Now , what will General Schuyler set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer us ?  --  To lend us a gun , maybe ,  --  leave to follow him from one post to another , barefooted and starving , and for our pains to be cursed and reviled for cowards from one end of the land to the other . And what will he threaten ? Ha , we were cowards indeed , if we feared what he could threaten . What thing in human nature will he speak to ?  --  say . 2nd Sol . I will tell you . To that spirit in human nature which resists the wrong , the fiendish wrong threatened there . Ay , in the basest nature that power sleeps , and out of the bosom of Omnipotence there is nothing stronger . It has wakened here once , and this war is its fruit . It slumbers now . Let Burgoyne look to it that he rouse it not himself for us . Let him look to it . For every outrage of those fiendish legions , thank God .  --  It lays a finger on the spring of our only strength . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A chance to live , or to die ,  --  men ,  --  ay , to leave a sample of manhood on the earth , that shall wring tears from the selfish of unborn ages , as they feel for once the depths of the slumbering and godlike nature within them . And Burgoyne ,  --  oh ! a coat and a pair of shoes , he offers , and  --  how many pounds ?  --  Are you men ? 4th Sol . What do you say , Sam ?  --  Talks like a minister , do n't he ? 1st Sol . Come , come ,  --  there 's the drum , boys . You do n't bamboozle me again ! I 've heard all that before . 3d Sol . Nor me.  --  I do n't intend to have my wife and children tomahawked ,  --  do n't think I can stand that , refugee or not . 2nd Sol . Here they come . ( Other Soldiers enter. ) 5th Sol . All 's ready , all 's ready . 6th Sol . ( singing . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are howling , "  --  Exeunt . DIALOGUE II . Scene . Before the door of the Parsonage . Trunks , boxes , and various articles of furniture , scattered about the yard . Two men coming down the path . ( George Grey enters . ) George . Those trunks in the forward team . Make haste . We 've no time to lose . This box in the wagon where the children are .  --  Carefully  --  carefully , though . ( A Soldier enters . ) Sol . Hurra , hurra , the house there ! Are you ready ? Ten minutes more . George . Get out . What do you stand yelling there for ? We know all about it . Sol . But your brother , the Captain , says , I must hurry you , or you 'll be left behind . George . Tell my brother , the Captain , I 'll see to that . We want no more hurrying . We have had enough of that already , and much good it has done us too . Stop , stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians to take their tea in . Workman . But the lady said  --  George . Never mind the lady . Well , Annie , are you ready ? Do n't stand there crying ; there 's no use . We may come back here again yet , you know . Many a pleasant sunrise we may see from these windows yet . Heaven defend us , here is this aunt of ours .  --  What on earth are they bringing now ? ( A Lady in the door with a couple of portraits , followed by others bringing baskets and boxes , etc . ) Lady . That will do , set them down ; now , the Colonel and his lady , on the back room wall , just over against the beaufet . Stop a moment . I 'll go with you myself . Betty . ( In the door . ) Lord ' a mercy ! Here it is broad day-light . What are we waiting for ? I am all ready . Why do n't we go ? George . I tell you , Aunt Rachael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , and there 's the end of it . St. George and the Dragon  --  Miss Rachael . Never mind this young malapert  --  do as I bid you . Betty . Lord ' a mercy , we shall all be murdered and scalped , every soul of us . Bless you  --  there it is in the garret now !  --  just hold this umberell a minute , Mr. George ,  --  think of those murderous Indians wearing my straw bonnet . Lord bless you ! What are you doing ? a heaving my umberell over the fence , in that fashion ! George . These women will drive me mad I believe . Let that box alone , you rascal . Lay a finger on that trumpery there I say , and you 'll find whose orders you are under ; as for the Colonel and his lady , they 'll get a little drink out of the first puddle we come to , I reckon . Goes out . Miss R. ( Coming from the house . ) That will do . That is all ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children  --  Miss R. Do n't stand there , prating to me at a time like this . Make haste , make haste ! How perfectly calm I am ! I would never have believed it ;  --  just tie this string for me , child , my hands twitch so strangely ,  --  they say the British are just down in the lane here , with five thousand Indians , Annie . Annie . It is no such thing , Aunt Rachael . The British are quietly encamped on the other side of the river ; three miles off at least . Miss R. I thought as much . A pretty hour for us to be turned out of house and home to be sure . Not a wink have I slept this blessed night . Hark ! What o'clock is that ? George , George ! where is that boy ? Just run and tell your mother , Annie , just tell her , my dear , will you , that we shall all be murdered . Maybe she will make haste a little . Well , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ,  --  yes 'm . But Miss Kitty 's a crying , and says as how she wo n't go , and there 's the other one too ; because , Ma'am , their toes  --  you see there 's the trunk in front gives ' em a leetle slope inward , and then that chest under the seat  --  If you would just step down and see yourself , Ma'am . Miss R. I desire to be patient . They go out . ( Annie sits on the bench of the little Porch , weeping . Mrs. Gray enters from within . ) Annie . Shall I never walk down that shady path again ? Shall I enter those dear rooms no more ? There are voices there they can not hear . From the life of buried years , ten thousand scenes , all vacancy to other eyes , enrich those walls for us ; the furniture that money can not buy , that only the joy and grief of years can purchase . They will spoil our pleasant home ,  --  will they not , mother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been to us . God 's will be done . Do not weep , Annie . We have counted the cost ;  --  many a safe and happy home there will be in the days to come , whose light shall spring from this forgotten sorrow . God 's will be done . Annie . Mother , they are all ready now ; is Helen in her room still ? Mrs. G. Go call her , Annie . Hours ago it was I sent her there . I thought she might get some little sleep ere the summons came . Call her , my child . How deadly pale she was ! Annie goes in . DIALOGUE III . Scene . A Chamber partly darkened , the morning air steals faintly through the half-open shutters . Helen before the mirror , leaning upon the toilette , her face buried in her hands , her long hair unbound , and flowing on her shoulders . ( Annie enters . ) Annie . Helen ! Why , Helen , are you asleep there ? Come , we are going now . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come at last . Indeed , there is hardly time for you to dress . Shall I help you ? Helen . ( Rising slowly . ) God help me . Bid my mother come here , Annie . Annie . What ails you , Helen ?  --  there is no time ,  --  you do not understand me ,  --  there is not one moment to be lost . Let me wind up this hair for you . Helen . Let go !  --  Oh God  --  Annie . Helen Grey ! Helen . It was a dream ,  --  it was but a foolish dream . It must not be thought of now ,  --  it will never do . Bid my mother come here , I am ready now . Annie . Ready , Helen !  --  ready ?  --  in that dressing-gown , and your hair  --  see here ,  --  are you ready , Helen ? Helen . Yes ,  --  bid her come ; Annie . Heaven only knows what you mean with this wild talk of yours , but if you are not mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of this precious time . Helen . No , no ,  --  we must not indeed . It was wrong , but I could not  --  go ,  --  make haste , bid her come . Annie . She is crazed , certainly ! Goes out . ( Helen stands with her arms folded , and her eye fixed on the door . ) ( Mrs. Grey enters . ) Mrs. G. My child ! Helen , Helen ! Why do you stand there thus ? Helen . Mother  --  Mrs. G. Nay , do not stay to speak . There  --  throw this mantle around you . Where is your hat ?  --  not here !  --  Bridal gear ! ( George enters . ) George . On my word ! Well , well , stand there a little longer , to dress those pretty curls of yours , and  --  humph  --  there 's a style in vogue in yonder camp for rebels just now ; we 'll all stand a chance to try , I think . Helen . George !  --  George Grey !  --  Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that . It was a dream . George . Is my sister mad ? Helen . Mother  --  Mrs. G. Speak , my child . Helen . Mother  --  my blessed mother ,  --  ( aside . ) ' T is but a brief word ,  --  it will be over soon . Mrs. G. Speak , Helen . Helen . I can not go with you , mother . Mrs. G. Helen ? George . Not go with us ? Mrs. G. Helen , do you know what you are saying ? George . You are in jest , Helen ; or else you are mad ,  --  before another sunset the British army will be encamping here . Helen . Hear me , mother . A message from the British camp came to me last night ,  --  Mrs. G. The British camp ?  --  Ha !  --  ha ! Everard Maitland ! God forgive him . Helen . Do not speak thus . It was but a few cold and careless lines he sent me ,  --  my purpose is my own . Mrs. G. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen Grey , this passes patience . Helen . He does . Here is the answer that has just now come ; for I have promised to meet him to-day at the hut of the missionary in yonder woods .  --  I can hardly spell these hasty words ; but this I know , he will surely come for me ,  --  though he bids me wait until I hear his signal ,  --  so I can not go with you , mother . Mrs. G. Where will you go , Helen ? Helen . Everard is in yonder camp ;  --  where should the wife 's home be ? Mrs. G. The wife 's ? Helen . These two years I have been his bride ;  --  his wedded wife I shall be to-day . Yonder dawns my bridal day . George . What does she say ? What does Helen say ? I do not understand one word of it . Mrs. G. She says she will go to the British camp . Desertions thicken upon us . Hark !  --  they are calling us . George . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go down . Your sister talks wildly and foolishly , what you should not have heard , what she will be sorry for anon ; go down , and tell them they must wait for us a little ,  --  we will be there presently . George . Hark ! ( going to the door. )  --  another message . Do you hear ?  --  Helen may be ready yet , if she will . Mrs. G. Blessed delay ! Go down , George ; say nothing of this . There is time yet . Tell them we will be there presently . ( George goes out . ) Mrs. G. Did you think I should leave you here to accomplish this frantic scheme ?  --  Did you dream of it , and you call me mother ?  --  but what do you know of that name 's meaning ? Do not turn away from me thus , my child ; do not stand with that fixed eye as though some phantom divinity were there . I shall not leave you here , Helen , never . Come , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is time yet ,  --  let us look at this moonlight scheme of yours a little . Would you stay here in this deserted citadel , alone ? My child , our army are already on their march . In an hour more you would be the only living thing in all this solitude . Would you stay here alone , to meet your lover too ?  --  Bethink yourself , Helen . Helen . This Canadian girl will stay with me , and  --  Mrs. G. A girl !  --  Helen , yesterday an army 's strength , the armies of the nation , the love of mother , and brothers , and sisters , all seemed nothing for protection to your timid and foreboding thought ; and now , when the enemy are all around us ,  --  do you talk of a single girl ? Why , the spirit of some strange destiny is struggling with your nature , and speaks within you , but we will not yield to it . Helen . You have spoken truly , mother . There is one tie in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where that leads , there lie those iron ways that are of old from everlasting . This is Heaven 's decree , not mine . Mrs. G. Do not charge the madness of this frantic scheme on Heaven , my child . Helen . Everard !  --  no , no . I can not show to another the lightning flash , that with that name reveals my destiny ,  --  yet the falling stone might as soon question of its way . Renounce him ?  --  you know not what you ask ! all there is of life within me laughs at the wild impossibility . Mother , hear me . There is no danger in my staying here ,  --  none real . The guard still keep their station on yonder hill , and the fort itself will not be wholly abandoned to-day . Everard will come for me at noon .  --  It is impossible that the enemy should be here ere then ; nay , the news of this unlooked-for movement will scarce have reached their camp .  --  Real danger there is none , and  --  Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the bitter cost I have counted all , already , all  --  all . That Maitland is in yonder camp , that  --  is it not a strange blessedness which can sweeten anguish such as this ?  --  that he loves me still , that he will come here to-day to make me his forever ,  --  this is all that I can say , my mother . Mrs. G. Will you go over to the British side , Helen ? Will you go over to the side of wrong and oppression ? Would you link yourself with our cruel and pursuing enemy ? Oh no , no no ,  --  that could not be  --  never . Amid the world of fearful thoughts that name brings , how could we place your image ? Oh God , I did not count on this . I knew that this war was to bring us toil , and want , and fear , and haply bloody death ; and I could have borne it unmurmuringly ; but  --  God forgive me ,  --  that the child I nursed in these arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against us  --  I did not count on this . Helen . Yes  --  that 's the look ,  --  the very look  --  all night I saw it ;  --  it does not move me now , as it did then . It is shadows of these things that are so fearful , for with the real comes the unreckoned power of suffering . Mother , this dark coil hath Heaven wound , not we . The tie which makes his path the way of God to me , was linked ere this war was ,  --  and war can not undo it now . It is a bitter fate , I know ,  --  a bitter and a fearful one . Mrs. G. Ay , ay ,  --  thank God ! You had forgotten , Helen , that in that army 's pay , nay , all around us even now are hordes and legions . Helen . I know it ,  --  I know it all . I do indeed . Mrs. G. Helen , will you place yourself defenceless amidst that savage race , whose very name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange fear ? Yesterday I chid you for those fancies ,  --  I was wrong ,  --  they were warnings , heaven-sent , to save you from this doom . What was that dream you talked of then ? Helen . Dreams are nothing . Will you unsay a life 's lessons now when most I need them ? Mrs. G. Yesterday , all day , a shadow as of coming evil lay upon me , but now I remember the forgotten vision whence it fell . Yesternight I had a dream , Helen , such as yours might be ; for in my broken and fevered slumbers , wherever I turned , one vision awaited me . There was a savage arm , and over it fell a shower of golden hair , and ever and anon , in the shadowy light of my dream , a knife glittered and waved before me . We were safe , but over one ,  --  some young and innocent and tender one it was  --  there hung a hopeless and inexorable fate . Once methought it seemed the young English girl that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eye upon me  --  Ha !  --  I had forgotten that glance of agony  --  surely , Helen , it was yours . Mrs. G. Helen ! my child  --  ( Aside ( . ) There it is , that same curdling glance ,  --  ' t was but a dream , Helen . Why do you stand there so white and motionless  --  why do you look on me with that fixed and darkening eye ?  --  ' t was but a dream ! Helen . And where were you ?  --  tell me truly . Was it not by a gurgling fountain among the pine trees there ? and was it not noon-day in your dream , a hot , bright , sultry noon , and a few clouds swelling in the western sky , and nothing but the trilling locusts astir ? Mrs. G. How wildly you talk ; how should I remember any thing like this ? Helen . I will not yield to it ; tempt me not . ' T is folly all , I know it is . Danger there is none . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ; and who knows that I am left here alone , and who would come here to seek me out but he ? Oh no , I can not break this solemn faith for a dream . What would he give to know I held my promise and his love lighter than a dream ? I must stay here , mother . Mrs. G. No , my child . Hear me . If this must be indeed , if all my holy right in you is nothing , if you will indeed go over to our cruel enemy , and rejoice in our sorrows and triumph in our overthrow  --  Helen . Hear her  --  Mrs. G. Be it so , Helen ,  --  be it so ; but for all that , do not stay here to-day . Bear but a little longer with our wearisome tenderness , and wait for some safer chance of forsaking us . Come . Helen . If I could  --  Ah , if I could  --  Mrs. G. You can  --  you will . Here , let me help you . we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme but your brother and myself , no one else shall ever know it . Come . Helen . If I could . ' T is true , I did not know when I sent him this promise you would leave me alone ere the hour should come . Perhaps  --  no , it would never do . When he comes and finds that , after all , I have deserted him , once with a word I angered him , and for years it was the last between us ;  --  and what safer chance will there be in these fearful times of meeting him ? No , no . If we do not meet now , we are parted for ever ;  --  if I do not keep my promise now , I shall see him no more . Mrs. G. See him no more then . What is he to us  --  this stranger , this haughty , all-requiring one ? Think of the blessed days ere he had crossed our threshold . You have counted all , Helen ? The anguish that will bring tears into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  did you think of her lonely and saddened youth ? You counted the wild suffering of this bitter moment ,  --  did you think of the weary years , the long sleepless nights of grief , the days of tears ; did you count the anguish of a mother 's broken heart , Helen ? God only can count that . You did not  --  there come the blessed tears at last . Here 's my own gentle daughter , once again . Come , Helen , see , they are waiting for us . There stands the old chaise under the locust tree . You and I will ride together . Come , ' t is but a few steps down that shady path , and we are safe  --  a few steps and quickly trod . Hark ! the respite is past even now . Do you stand there marble still ? Helen , if you stay here , we shall see you no more . This lover of yours hates us all . He will take you to England when the war is over if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . I shall see you no more , Helen , my child ; my child , I shall see you no more . ( She sinks upon the chair , and weeps aloud . ) Helen . Has it come to this ? Will you break my heart ? If it were continents and oceans that you bade me cross , but those few steps  --  Ah , they would sever me from him for ever , and I can not , I can not , I can not take them ,  --  there is no motion so impossible . Yes , they are calling us . Do not stay . ( Annie enters ) . Annie . Mother , will you tell me what this means ? Mrs. G. Yes , come in . We will waste no more time about it . She will stay here to meet her lover , she will forsake us for a traitor . We have nursed an enemy among us . The babe I cherished in this bosom , whose sleeping face I watched with a young mother 's love , hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thee ? Annie . Helen ! my sister ! Helen ! Mrs. G. Ay , look at her . Would you think that the spirit which heaves in that light frame , and glances in those soft eyes , held such cruel power ? Yesterday I would have counted it a breath in the way of my lightest purpose , and now  --  come away , Annie  --  it is vain , you can not move her . ( George enters . ) George . Mother , if Helen will not go now , we must leave her to her fate or share it with her . Every wagon is on the rod but ours . A little more , and we shall be too late for the protection of the army . Shall I stay with her ? Mrs. G. No , never . That were a sure and idle waste of life . Helen , perhaps , may be safe with them . Oh yes , the refugees are safe , else desertion would grow out of fashion soon . Annie . Refugees ! Refugee ! Helen ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . You will grow used to it soon . Helen belongs to the British side , she will go over to them to-day , but she must go alone , for none of us would be safe in British hands , at least I trust so  --  this morning 's experience might make me doubtful , but I trust we are all true here yet beside . Annie . Have I heard aright , Helen ?  --  or is this all some fearful dream ? You and I , who have lived together all the years of our lives , to be parted this moment , and for ever ,  --  no , no ! ( A young American Officer enters hastily . ) Capt . Grey . Softly , softly ! What is this ? Are you in this conspiracy to disgrace me , mother ? Oh , very well ; if you have all decided to stay here , I 'll take my leave . Annie . Oh , Henry , stay . You can persuade her it may be . Capt . G. Persuade ! What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's this that 's risking all our lives , waiting to be persuaded now ? Mrs. G. That Tory , Henry ! We should have thought of this . Ah , if we had gone yesterday ,  --  that haughty Maitland ,  --  she will stay here to meet him ! She will marry him , my son . Capt . G. Maitland !  --  and stay here ! Helen . Dear Henry , let us part in kindness . Do not look on me with that angry eye . It was I that played with you in the woods and meadows , it was I that roamed with you in those autumn twilights ,  --  you loved me then , and we are parting for ever it may be . Capt . G. ( To the children at the door . ) Get you down , young ones , get you down . Pray , mother , lead the way , will you ?  --  break up this ring . Come , Helen , you and I will talk of this as we go on , only in passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pranks of your novel ladies , this caps the chief . You have outdone them , Helen ; I 'll give you credit for it , you have outdone them all . Why you 'll be chronicled ,  --  there 's nothing on record like it , that ever I heard of ; I am well-read in romances too . We 'll have a new love-ballad made and set to tune , under the head of " Love and Murder , " it will come though , if you do n't make haste a little . Come , come . Helen . Henry ! Capt . G. Are you in earnest , Helen ? Did you suppose that we were mad enough to leave you here ? You 'll not go with us ? But you will , by Heaven ! Helen . Henry ! Mother !  --  Nay , Henry , this is vain . I shall stay here , I shall  --  I shall stay here ,  --  so help me Heaven . Capt . G. Helen Grey ! Is that young lioness there my sometime sister ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron , and the strength of twenty men nerving her arm ? Helen . Let go .  --  I shall stay here . Capt . G. Well , have your way , young lady , have your way ; but  --  Mother , if you choose to leave that mad girl here , you can ,  --  but as for this same Everard Maitland , look you , my lady , if I do n't stab him to his heart 's core , never trust me . ( He goes out  --  Mrs. Grey follows him to the door . ) Mrs. G. Stay , Henry ,  --  stay . What shall we do ? Capt . G. Do !  --  Indeed , a straight waistcoat is the only remedy I know of , Madam , for such freaks as these . If you say so , she shall go with us yet . Mrs. G. Hear me . This is no time for passion now Hear me , Henry . This Maitland , Tory as he is , is her betrothed husband , and she has chosen her fate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay , with what we have now seen , it would be vain to think of it , to wish it even . She must go to him ,  --  it but remains to see that she meets him safely . Noon is the hour appointed for his coming . Could we not stay till then ? Capt . G. Impossible . Noon ?  --  well .  --  Oh , if its all fixed upon ;  --  if you have settled it between yourselves that Helen is to abandon us and our protection , for Everard Maitland 's and the British , the sooner done , the better , She 's quite right ,  --  she 's like to find no safer chance for it than this . Noon ,  --  there is a picket left on yonder hill till after that time , certainly , and a hundred men or so in the fort . I might give Van Vechten a hint of it  --  nay , I can return myself this afternoon , and if she is not gone then , I will take it upon me she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be likely to care for her safety . At all events there 's nothing else for us to do , at least there 's but one alternative , and that I have named to you . They go out together . Helen . ( She has stood silently watching them . ) He has gone , without one parting look  --  he has gone ! So break the myriad-tied loves , it hath taken a life to weave . This is a weary world . ( She turns to her sister , who leans weeping on the window-seat . ) Come , Annie , you and I will part in kindness , will we not ? No cruel words shall there be here . Pleasant hath your love been unto me , my precious sister . Farewell , Annie . Annie . Shall I never hear your voice again , that hath been the music of my whole life ? Is your face henceforth to be to me only a remembered thing ? Helen , you must not stay here . The Indians ,  --  it was no idle fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they will murder you , yes , you . The innocence and loveliness that is holy to us , is nothing in their eyes , they would as soon sever that beautiful hair from your brow  --  Helen . Hush , hush . There is no danger , Annie . The dark things of destiny are God 's ; the heart , the heart only , is ours . ( Mrs. Grey re-enters . ) Mrs. G. ( to Annie ) Come , come , my child . This is foolish now . All is ready . Janette will stay with you , Helen . ( Laughing voices are heard without , and the children 's faces are seen peeping in the door . ) Willy . Dear mother , are you not ready yet ? We have been in the wagon and out a hundred times . Oh , Helen , make haste . The sun is above the trees , and the grass on the roadside is all full of diamonds . The last soldiers are winding down the hollow now . Is not Helen going , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . Come in and kiss her once , and then make haste  --  you must not all be lost . ( They enter . ) Willy . Ah , why do n't you go with us , sister ?  --  Such a beautiful ride we shall have . You never heard such a bird-singing in all your life . Frank . We shall go by the Chesnut Hollow , George says we shall . Smell of these roses , Helen . Must she stay here ? Hark , Willy , there 's the drum . Good-bye . How sorry I am you will not go with us . Willy . So am I. What makes you stand so still and look at us so ? Why do n't you kiss me ? Good-bye , Helen . Helen . ( Embracing them silently . ) Annie . Will you leave her here alone , mother ? Will you ? Mrs. G. No . There is a guard left on yonder hill , and the fort is not yet abandoned wholly . Besides , the army encamp at the creek , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ere then , though . Helen . Those merry steps and voices , those little , soft clinging hands and rosy lips , have vanished forever . For all my love I shall be to them but as the faint trace of some faded dream . This is a weary world . Come , George , farewell . How I have loved to look on that young brow . Be what my dreams have made you . Fare you well . George . Farewell , Helen . He goes out hastily . Helen . Will he forget me ? Mrs. G. And farewell , Helen . Fare ye well . Helen . Will she leave me thus ? Mrs. G. Do not go to the hut  --  do not leave this door until you are sure of the signal you spoke of , Helen . Helen . She will not look at me.  --  Mother ! Mrs. G. Farewell , Helen ; may the hour never come when you need the love you have cast from you now so freely . Helen . Will you leave me thus ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solemn Hereafter our ways may meet again ; but by the light of sun , or moon , or candle , or underneath these Heavens , no more . Oh ! lovely , lovely have you been unto me , a spirit of holiness and beauty , building all my way .  --  Part we thus ? Mrs. G. Farewell , Helen . Helen . Part we thus ? Mrs. G. Fare ye well , Helen Grey , my own sweet and precious child , my own lovely , lovely daughter , fare ye well , and the Lord be with you . The Lord keep you , for I can keep you now no more . The Lord watch over you , my helpless one , mine , mine , mine , all mine , though I leave you thus ; my world of untold wealth , unto another . Nay , do not sorrow , my blessed child ,  --  you will be happy yet . Fear nothing ,  --  if this must be , I say , fear nothing . You think that you are doing right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . If in the strength of a pure conscience you stay here to-day ,  --  be not afraid . When you lay here of old , a lisping babe , I told you of One whose love was better than a mother 's . Now farewell , and trust in Him . Farewell , mine eye shall see thee yet again . Farewell . Helen . No , no ; leave me not . Mrs. G. Unclasp these hands , I can not stay . Helen . Never  --  never . Mrs G. Untwine this wild embrace , or , even now ,  --  even now  --  Helen . Farewell , mother . Annie Grey , farewell . They go . Helen . This is a weary world . Take me home . To the land where there is no crying or bitterness , take me home . ( The noise of retreating steps is heard , and the sound of the outer door closing heavily . ) Helen . They are gone ,  --  not to church ,  --  not for the summer 's ride . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ; but by the twilight hearth , or merry table , at morn , or noon , or evening , in mirth or earthly tenderness , no more . Hark ! There it is !  --  that voice ,  --  I hear it now , I do . A dark eternity had rolled between us , and I hear it yet again . They are going now . Those rolling wheels , oh that that sound would last . There is no music half so sweet . Fainter  --  fainter  --  it is gone  --  no  --  that was but the hollow .  --  Hark  --  Now they are gone , indeed . So breaks the sense 's last link between me and that world . PART FIFTH .  --  FULFILMENT . Page image - Page 120 . DIALOGUE I. Scene . The hill . A young Soldier enters . How gloriously , with what a lonely majesty the morning wastes in that silent valley there ; with its moving shadows , and breeze and sunshine , and its thousand delicious sounds mocking those desolate homes  --  ( He stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is strange , indeed . This feeling that I can not analyze , still grows upon me . Presentiment ? Some dark , swift-flying thought , leaves its trace , and the causeseeking mind , in the range of its own vision finding none , looks to the shadowy future for it . He passes on . ( Two Indian Chiefs , in their war-dress , emerge from the thicket , talking in suppressed tones. ) 1st Chief . Hoogh ! Hoogh ! Alaska fights to revenge his son ,  --  we spill our blood to revenge his son , and he thinks to win gifts besides . Hugh ! A brave chief he is ! 2nd Chief . Your talk is not good , Manida . They are our enemies ,  --  we shall conquer them , we shall see their chestnut locks waving aloft , we shall dance and shout all night around them , and the eyes of the maidens shall meet ours in the merry ring , sparkling with joy , as we shout " Victory ! victory ! our enemies are slain ,  --  our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies ! " What more , Manida ? Is it not enough ? 1st Chief . No . I went last night with Alaska to the camp above , to the tent of the young sachem of the lake , and he promised him presents , rich and many , for an errand that a boy might do . I asked Alaska to send me for him , and he would not . 2nd Chief . The young white sachem was Alaska 's friend , many moons ago , when Alaska was wounded and sick .  --  He must revenge young Siganaw , but he must keep his faith to his white friend , too . 1st Chief . Ah , but I know where the horse is hidden and the paper . When the tomahawks flash here , and the war-cry is loudest , we will steal away . Come , and I will share the prize with you . 2nd Chief . No , I will tell my brother chief that Manida is a treacherous friend . 1st Chief . You can not . It is too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the trees . ( Another Soldier emerges from the wood-path , singing , ) " Then march to the roll of the drum , It summons the brave to the plain , Where heroes contend for the home Which perchance they may ne'er see again . " ( Pausing abruptly . ) Well , we are finely manned here ! ( 1st Soldier re-enters. ) 2nd Sol . How many men do you think we have in all , upon this hill , Edward ? 1st Sol . Hist !  --  more than you count on , perhaps . 2nd Sol . Why ? What is the matter ? Why do you look among those bushes so earnestly ? 1st Student . It is singular , indeed . I can hardly tell you what it is , but twice before in my round , precisely in this same spot , the same impression has flashed upon me , though the sense that gives it , if sense it is , will not bide an instant 's questioning . There ! Hist ! Did nothing move there then ? 2nd Sol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you should have slept . Though as to that , I have nothing to complain of , certainly . I had to thank your taste that way , last night , for an hour of the most delicious slumber . It was like that we used to snatch of old , between the first stroke of the prayer-bell and its dying peal . 1st Sol . I am glad you could sleep . For myself , such a world of troubled thoughts haunted me , I found more repose in waking . 2nd Sol . Then I wish you could have shared my dream with me , as indeed you seemed to , for you were with me through it all . A blessed dream it was , and yet  --  1st Sol . Well , let me share it with you now . 2nd Sol . I can not tell you how it was , that in honor and good conscience we had effected it , but somehow , methought our part in this sickening warfare was accomplished , and we were home again . Oh the joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dream , methought we questioned its reality , so unearthly in its perfectness , it seemed . We stood upon the college-green , and the sun was going down with a strange , darkling splendor ; and from afar , ever and anon came the thunder roll of battle ; but we had nought to do with it ; our part was done ; our time was out ; we were to fight no more . And there we stood , watching the student 's games ; and there too was poor Hale , merry and full of life as e'er he was , for never a thought of his cruel fate crossed my dream . Suddenly we saw two ladies , arm in arm , come swiftly down the shady street , most strangely beautiful and strangely clad ; with long white robes , and garlands in their hair , and such a clear and silvery laugh , and something fearful in their loveliness withal ; and one of them , as she came smiling toward us  --  do you remember that bright , fair-haired girl we met in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hers wore the lady in my dream . Then , into the old chapel we were crowding all ; that long-deferred commencement had come on at last ; we stood upon a stage , and a strange light filled all the house , and suddenly the ceiling swelled unto the skiey dome , and nations filled the galleries ; and I woke , to find myself upon a soldier 's couch , and the reveille beating . 1st Sol . Well , if it cheered you , t was a good dream most certainly , though , yet  --  the dream-books might not tell you so . Will you take this glass a moment ? 2nd Sol . What is it ? 1st Sol . That white house by the orchard , in the door  --  do you see nothing ? 2nd Sol . Yes , a figure , certainly ;  --  yes , now it moves . I had thought those houses were deserted ,  --  it is time they were I think , for all the protection we can give them . How long shall we maintain this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st Sol . Till the preparations below are complete , I trust so at least , for we have watchers in these woods , no doubt , who would speedily report our absence . 2nd Sol . Well , if we all see yonder sun go down , ' t is more than I count on . 1st Sol . A chance if we do  --  a chance if we do . Will the hour come when this infant nation shall forget her bloody baptism ?  --  the holy name of truth and freedom , that with our hearts ' blood we seal upon her in these days of fear ? 2nd Sol . Ay , that hour may come . 1st Sol . Then , with tears , and blood if need be , shall she learn it anew ; and not in vain shall the bones of the martyrs moulder in her peopled vales . For human nature , in her loftiest mood , was this beautiful land of old built , and for ages hid . Here  --  her cradle-dreams behind her flung ; here , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long vistas turned , in a new and nobler life she shall arise here . Ah , who knows but that the book of History may show us at last on its long-marred page  --  Man himself ,  --  no longer the partial and deformed developments of his nature , which each successive age hath left as if in mockery of its ideal ,  --  but , man himself , the creature of thought ,  --  the high , calm , majestic being , that of old stood unshrinking beneath his Maker 's gaze . Even , as first he woke amid the gardens of the East , in this far western clime at last he shall smile again ,  --  a perfect thing . 2nd Sol . In your earnestness , you do not mark these strange sounds , Edward . Listen . ( He grasps his sword . ) ( A Soldier rushes down the path. ) 3nd Sol . We are surrounded ! Fly . The Indians are upon us . Fly . Rushes on . ( Another Soldier bursts from the woods. ) 4th Sol . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand here ! Rushes down the hill . 2nd Sol . Resistance is vain . Hear those shrieks ! There is death in them . Resistance is vain . 1st Sol . Flight is vain . Look yonder ! Francis ,  --  the dark hour hath come ! 2nd Sol . Is it so ? Mother and sister I shall see no more . ( A number of Indians , disfigured with paint and blood , and brandishing their knives , come rushing down the road , uttering short , fierce yells . Others from below , bringing buck the fugitives. ) 1st Sol . We shall die together . God of Truth and Freedom , unto thee our youthful spirits trust we . ( The Indians surround them . Fighting to the last , they fall . ) DIALOGUE II . Scene . The deserted house  --  the chamber  --  Helen by the table  --  her head bowed and motionless . She rises slowly from her drooping posture . Helen . It is my bridal day . I had forgotten that . ( Looking from the window . ) Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ? The army gone ? brothers and sisters gone , and those woods full of armed Indian ? I am awake . This is not the light of dreams ,  --  ' t is the sun that 's shining there . Not the fresh and tender morning sun , that looked in on that parting . Hours he has climbed since then , to turn those shadows thus ,  --  hours that to me were nothing .  --  Alone ?  --  deserted  --  defenceless ? Of my own will too ? There was a law in that will , though , was there not ? ( Turning suddenly from the window . ) Shall I see him again ? The living real of my thousand dreams , in the light of life , will he stand here to-day ?  --  to-day ? No , no . Is this swift flow of being leading on to that ? Oh day of anguish , if in thine awful bosom , still , that dazzling instant sleeps , I can forgive the rest . ( She stands by the toilette , and begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly a low voice at the door breaks the stillness . The Canadian servant looks in . ) Jan . I ask your pardon  --  Shall I come in , Ma'amselle ? Helen . Ay , ay , come in . How strangely any voice sounds amid this loneliness . I am glad you are here . Jan . ( Entering . ) Beautiful ! Santa Maria ! How beautiful ! May I look at these things , Ma'amselle ? ( Stopping by the couch strewn with bridal gear . ) Real Brussels ! And the plume in this bonnet , was there ever such a lovely droop ? Helen . Come , fasten this clasp for me , Netty . I thought to have had another bridesmaid once , but  --  that is past  --  Yes , I am a bride to-day , and I must not wait here unadorned . ( Aside . ) He shall have no hint from me this day of " altered fortunes . " As though these weary years had been but last night 's dream , and my wedding day had come as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Yet I thought to have worn my shroud sooner than this robe . Jan . This silk would stand alone , Ma'amselle ,  --  and what a lovely white it is ! Just such a bodice as this I saw my Lady Mary wear , two years ago this summer , in Quebec ; only , this is a thought deeper . But , Santa Maria ! how it becomes a shape like yours ! Helen . What a world of buried feeling lives again as I feel the clasp of this robe once more ! Will he say these years have changed me ? Jan . ( Aside . ) I do not like that altered mien . How the beauty flashes from her ? Is it silk and lace that can change one so ? Here are bracelets too , Ma'amselle ; will you wear them ? Helen . Yes . Go , look from the window , Janette , down the lane to the woods . I am well-nigh ready now . He will come ,  --  yes , he will come . ( Janette retreats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Jan . I have seen brides before , but never so gay a one as this . It is strange and fearful to see her stand here alone , in this lonesome house , all in glistening white , smiling , and the light flashing from her eyes thus . She looks too much like some radiant creature from another world , to be long for this . Helen . He will come , why should he not ? Netty , fix your eye on that opening in the woods , and if you see but a shadow crossing it , tell me quickly . Jan . I can see nothing  --  nothing at all . Marie sanctissima !  --  how quiet it is ! The shadows are straight here now , Miss Helen . Helen . Noon  --  the very hour has come ! Another minute it may be .  --  Noon , you said , Netty ? ( Joining Janette at the window . ) Jan . Yes , quite  --  you can see ; and hark , there 's the clock . Oh , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses look , with the doors all closed and the yards and gardens still as midnight . If we could but hear a human voice !  --  whose , I would not care . Helen . How like any other noon-day it comes ! The faint breeze plays in those graceful boughs as it did yesterday ; that little , yellow butterfly glides on its noiseless way above the grass , as then it did ;  --  just so , the shadows sleep on the grassy road-side there ;  --  yes , Netty , yes , ' t is very lonely .  --  Hear those merry birds ! Jan . But I would rather hear that signal , Miss Helen , a thousand times , than the best music that ever was played . Helen . I shall see him again . That wild hope is wild no longer . To doubt were wilder now . Ay , Fate must cross my way with a bold hand , to snatch that good from me now . And yet ,  --  alas , in the shadowy future it lieth still , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blossom on its threshold are not ours  --  It may be , even now , darkness and silence everlasting lie between us . Jan . Hark  --  Hark ! Helen . What is it ? Jan . Hark !  --  There !  --  Do you hear nothing ? Helen . Distant voices ? Jan . Yes  --  Helen . I do  --  Jan . Once before ,  --  ' t was when I stood in the door below , I heard something like this ; but the breeze just then brought the sound of the fall nearer , and drowned it . There it is !  --  Nearer . The other window , Miss Helen . Helen . From that hill it comes , does it not ? Jan . Yes  --  yes , I should think it did . Oh yes . There is a guard left there  --  I had forgotten that . Mon Dieu ! How white your lips are ! Are you afraid , Ma'amselle ? ( Helen stands gazing silently from the window . ) Jan . There is no danger . It must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of some wild animal roaming through yonder woods  --  it might have been ,  --  how many strange sounds we hear from them . At another time we should never have thought of it . I think we should have heard that signal though , ere this ,  --  I do , indeed . Helen . What is it to die ? Nor wood nor meadow , nor winding stream , nor the blue sky , do they see ; nor the voice of bird or insect do they hear ; nor breeze , nor sunshine , nor fragrance visits them . Will there be nothing left that makes this being then ? The high , Godlike purpose  --  the life whose breath it is ,  --  can that die ?  --  the meek trust in Goodness Infinite ,  --  can that perish ? No.  --  This is that building of the soul which nothing can dissolve , that house eternal , that eternity 's wide tempests can not move . No  --  no  --  I a m not afraid . No  --  Netty , I am not afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen . Well . Jan . Look among those trees by the road-side  --  those pine trees , on the side of the hill , where my finger points .  --  Helen . Well  --  what is it ? Jan . Do you see  --  what a blinding sunshine this is  --  do you see something moving there ?  --  wait a moment  --  they are hid among the trees now  --  you will see them again presently  --  There !  --  there they come , a troop of them , see . Helen . Yes  --  Indians  --  are they not ? Jan . Ay  --  it must have been their yelling that we heard .  --  We need not be alarmed .  --  They are from the camp  --  they have come to that spring for water . The wonder is , your soldiers should have let them pass .  --  You will see them turning back directly now . Helen . ( Turning from the window . ) Shelter us  --  all power is thine . Jan . Holy Virgin !  --  they are coming this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . Yes , there they come . This strip of wood hides them now . What keeps them there so long ? Ay , ay ,  --  I see now  --  I am sorry I should have alarmed you so , Ma'amselle , for nothing too  --  They have struck into those woods again , no doubt ; they are going back to their camp by the lower route . Helen . No . Jan . It must be so . There is no doubt of it . Indeed , we might be sure they would never dare come here .  --  They can not know yet that your army are gone . Besides , we should have heard from them ere this . They could never have kept their horrid tongues to themselves so long , I know .  --  Well , if it were to save me , I can not screw myself into this shape any longer . ( Rising from the window . Helen . Listen . Jan . ' T is nothing but the sound of the river . You can make nothing else of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you hear . I wish they would cease their everlasting din a moment . How that breeze has died away ! Every leaf is still now ! There 's not a cloud or a speck in all the sky . Helen . Look in the west  --  have you looked there ? Jan . Yes , there are a few little clouds beginning to gather there indeed . We shall have a shower yet ere night . ( The war-whoop is heard , loud and near . ) Jan . Mon Dieu ! Here they are ! It is all over with us ! We shall be murdered ! ( She clasps her hands , and shrieks wildly . Helen . Hush ! hush ! Put down that window , and come away . We must be calm now . Jan . It is all over with us ,  --  what use is there ? Do you hear that trampling ?  --  in the street !  --  they are coming ! Helen . Janette  --  Hear me . Will you throw away your life and mine ? For shame ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here . They will see these houses all deserted . Why should they stop to search this ? Hush ! hush ! they are passing now . Jan . They have stopped !  --  the trampling has stopped !  --  I hear the gate ,  --  they have come into the yard . ( A long wild yell is heard under the window . They stand , looking silently at each other . Again it trembles through the room , louder than before . ) Helen . I am sorry you stayed here with me . Perhaps  --  Hark ! What was that ? What was that ? Was it not Maitland they said then ? It was  --  it is  --  Do n't grasp me so . Jan . Nay  --  what would you do ? Helen . I must speak with them . Let go my arm ! Do you not hear ? ' T is Maitland they are talking of . How strangely that blessed name sounds in those tones ! Jan . You must not  --  we have tempted Heaven already  --  this is madness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you they seek . You can conceal yourself . You shall be safe . Jan . She is wild ! Nay , I was mad myself , or I should never have stayed here . It were better to have lived always with them , than to be murdered thus . ( Helen opens the window , and stands for a moment , looking silently down into the court . She turns away , shuddering . ) Helen . Can I meet those eyes again ? ( Again the name of Maitland mingles with the wild and unintelligible sounds that rise from without . ) Helen . Can I ? ( She turns to the window . ) What can it mean ? His own beautiful steed ! How fiercely he prances beneath that unskilful rein . Where 's your master , Selma , that he leaves me to be murdered here ? A letter ! He bids me unfasten the door , Janette . Jan . And will you ? Helen . They are treacherous I know . This will do .  --  ( Taking a basket from the toilette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the basket from the window , and draws it up , with a letter in it . ) Helen . ( Looking at the superscription . ) ' T is his ! I thought so . Is it ink and paper that I want now ? ( Breaking it open . ) Ah , there 's no forgery in this . ' T is his ! ' t is his ! Jan . How can she stand to look at that little lock of hair now ?  --  smiling as if she had found a bag of diamonds . But there 's bad news there . How the color fades out , and the light in her eye dies away . What can it be ? Helen . ( Throwing the letter down , and walking the floor hastily . ) This is too much ! I can not , I can not , I can not go with them ! How could he ask it of me ? This is cruel . He knew , perfectly well , how I have always feared them  --  I can not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( Reading . ) " Possible "  --  " If it were possible "  --  he does not read that word as I did when I kept this promise  --  Possible ?

" Trust me , trust me . Wo n't I ? Jan . She is beckoning them , as I live ! Helen . Bring me that hat and mantle , Netty . I must go with these savages . Jan . Go with them ! Helen . There is no help for it . Jan . With these wild creatures ,  --  with these painted devils ?  --  No  --  Like nothing human they look , I am sure . Ah see , see them in their feathers and blankets , and that long wild hair . See the knives and the tomahawks in their girdles ! Holy Mary ! Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stands  --  there 's life in it now .  --  There they stand  --  the chesnut boughs wave over them  --  this is the filling up of life . They are waiting for me . ' T is no dream . Jan . Dare you go with them ? They will murder you . Helen . If they were but human , I could move them  --  and yet it is the human in them that is so dreadful . To die were sad enough  --  to die by violence , by the power of the innocent elements , were dreadful , or to be torn of beasts ; to meet the wild , fierce eye , with its fixed and deadly purpose , more dreadful ; but ah , to see the human soul , from the murderers eye glaring on you , to encounter the human will in its wickedness , amid that wild struggle  --  Oh God ! spare me . Jan . If you fear them so , surely you will not go with them . Helen . This letter says they are kind and innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause for fear . In his haste he could not find no other way to send for me.  --  The army will be here soon ,  --  I must go with them . Jan . But Captain Grey will come back here again this afternoon . Stay ,  --  stay , and we will go with him . Helen . You can  --  yes , you will be safe . For myself , I will abide my choice . Surely I need not dread to go where my betrothed husband trusts me so fearlessly . I count my life worth little more than the price at which he values it . Clasp this mantle , Netty.  --  And is it thus I go forth from these blessed walls at last ?  --  Through all those safe and quiet hours of peace and trust , did this dark end to them lie waiting here ?  --  Are they calling me ?

Farewell , Netty , you will see my mother  --  you will see them all  --  that is past .  --  Tell her I had seen the Indians , and was not afraid . She goes out . Jan . It wo n't take much to make an angel of her , there 's that in it . ( Looking cautiously through the shutters . ) There she comes ! How every eye in that wild group flashes on her !

( Sipping his wine , and carefully examining a plan of the adjacent country . ) About here , we must be  --  let me see .  --  I heard the drum from their fort this morning , distinctly . Turn that curtain ; we might get a faint breeze there now . Ser't . But the sun will be coming that side , Sir . It 's past two o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , well ,  --  we 'll take our breakfast in Albany on Friday morning , and if our soldiers fast a day or two ere then , why they 'll relish it the better ;  --  once in the rich country beyond  --  Ay , it will take more troops than this General will have at his bidding by that time , to drain the Hudson 's borders for us . ( A Servant enters with a note . ) Off . ( Reading . ) " The Baroness Reidesel 's compliments  --  do her the honor  --  Voisin has succeeded . "  --  Ay , ay ,  --  Voisin has succeeded ,  --  I 'll warrant that . That caterer of hers must be in league with the powers of the air , I am certain . General Burgoyne will be but too happy , my Lady  --  ( writing the answer . ) The Servant goes out . Off . Past two ! The cannon should be in sight ere this . This to Sir George Ackland . Exit the Attendant . Off . Tuesday  --  Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One hundred teams  --  ( Another Officer enters the tent. ) 1st Off . How goes it abroad , Colonel St. Leger ? 2nd Off . Indeed , Sir , the camp is as quiet as midnight . It 's a breathless heat . But there are a few dark heads swelling in the west . We may have a shower yet ere night . Bur . Good news that . But here is better , ( giving the other an open letter . ) St. Leger . Ay , ay , that reads well , Sir . Bur . And here is another as good . Yes Sir , yes Sir ,  --  they are flocking in from all quarters  --  the insurgents are laying down their arms by hundreds . It must be a miserable fragment that Schuyler has with him by this . St. L. General Burgoyne , is not it a singular circumstance , that the enemy should allow us to take possession of a point like that without opposition ,  --  so trifling a detachment , too ? Why , that hill commands the fort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are pretty much reduced , I fancy , Sir . We shall hardly hear much more from them . Let me see ,  --  this is the hill . St. L. A pity we could not provoke them into an engagement , though ! They depend so entirely upon the popular feeling for supplies and troops , and the whole machinery of their warfare , that it is rather hazardous reckoning upon them , after all . If we could draw them into an engagement now , the result would be certain . Bur . Yes , yes ; we must contrive to do that ere long . Rather troublesome travelling companions they make , that 's certain . Like those insects that swarm about us here ,  --  no great honor in fighting them , but a good deal of discomfort in letting them alone . We must sweep them out of our way , I think , or at all events give them a brush , that will quiet them a little . St. L. Or they might prove , after all , like the gadfly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any disadvantage in the end , General . Bur . Not a whit  --  not a whit  --  they have needed this , It will do them good , Sir . St. L. The fact is , these colonies were founded in the spirit of insubordination , and all the circumstances of their position have hitherto tended to develope only these disorganizing elements . Bur . It will do them good , Sir . Depend upon it , they 'll remember this lesson . Pretty well sickened of war are they all . They 'll count the cost ere they try it again . St. L. We can hardly expect the news from General Reidesel before sunset , I suppose . Bur . If my messenger returns by to-morrow 's sunrise , it is better fortune than I look for . ( Col. St. Leger goes out . ) ( Burgoyne resumes his plan . ) A Ser't . ( At the door . ) Capt . Maitland , Sir . Bur . Capt . Maitland ! Ser't . From Fort Ann , Sir . ( Maitland enters . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were at Skeensborough by this ,  --  what has happened ? or am I to congratulate myself that the necessity of your embassy is obviated . You met them , perhaps ?  --  Maitland . There 's but little cause of congratulation , Sir , as these dispatches will prove to you . I returned only because my embassy was accomplished . Bur . Do you mean to say , Captain Maitland , that you have seen the waters of Lake Champlain , since you left here this morning ? Mait . I do , Sir . Bur . On my word , these roads must have improved since we travelled them some two days agone . I am sorry for your horses , Sir . You saw General Reidesel ? Mait . I left him only at nine o'clock this morning . ( Burgoyne examines the dispatches . ) Bur . " Twelve oxen to one batteaux ! "  --  " and but fifty teams ! " This news was scarcely worth so much haste , I think ,  --  but fifty teams ?  --  Captain Maitland , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were just landing this morning as I left , but only one-fourth of the number contracted for . Bur . Humph ! I would like to know what time , at this rate  --  sit down , Captain Maitland , sit down  --  we are like to spend the summer here , for aught I see , after all . ( A long pause , in which Burgoyne resumes his reading . ) Mait . General Burgoyne , I am entrusted with a message from General Reidsel to the Baroness . If this is all  --  Bur . What were you saying ?  --  The Baroness  --  ay , ay  --  that 's all well enough ,  --  but Captain Maitland is aware , no doubt , there are more important subjects on the tapis just now than a lady 's behests . Mait . Sir ?  --  Bur . ( Pushing the papers impatiently from him . ) This will never do . St. George ! We 'll give these rebels other work ere many days , than driving away cattle and breaking down bridges for our convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or we may starve to death among these hills yet . Captain Maitland , I have a proposal to make to you . You are impatient , Sir . Mait . General Burgoyne !  --  Bur . Nay , nay ,  --  there 's no haste about it . It were cruel to detain you now , after the toil of this wild journey . You 'll find your quarters changed , Captain Maitland . We sent a small detachment across the river just now . Some of our copper-colored allies had got into a fray with the enemy there . Mait . Ha ! ( returning . ) Bur . Nothing of consequence , as it turns out . We hoped it would have ended in something . A few of the enemy , who were stationed as a guard on a hill not far from Fort Edward , were surprised by a party of Indians , and killed , to a man , I believe . Afterwards , the victors got into a deadly fray among themselves as usual . A quarrel between a couple of these chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of it , a party from the fort drove them from the ground ;  --  this is Alaska 's own story at least . Mait . Alaska 's ! Bur . Alaska ?  --  Alaska ?  --  yes , I think it was ,  --  one of these new allies we have picked up here . Mait . ( In a whisper . ) Good God ! Bur . By the time our detachment arrived there , however , the ground was cleared , and they took quiet possession . Are you ill , Captain Maitland ? Mait . A little ,  --  it is nothing . I am to cross the river . Bur . Yes . You will take these papers to Captain Andre . You have over-fatigued yourself . You should have taken more time for this wild journey . ( Maitland goes out . ) Bur . I do not like the idea of division , but it can not be helped now . This gallant young soldier were a fitting leader for such an enterprize . DIALOGUE IV . Scene . The ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief , Manida , enter . ) Mait . This is well . ( He writes on a slip of paper , and gives it to the Indian . ) Take that , they will give you the reward you ask for it . Let me see your face no more , that is all . Manida . Ha , Monsieur ? Mait . Let me see your face no more , I say . Do you understand me ? Manida . ( Smiling . ) Oui . ( Maitland turns from him . The Indian goes off in the opposite direction . He stops a moment , and steals a look at Maitland ,  --  throws his head back with a long silent laugh , and then goes on toward the woods . ) Mait . ( Musing . ) I like this . This is womanly ! Nay , perhaps there is no capriee about it . I may have misinterpreted that letter in my haste last night . Very likely . Well ,  --  better this , than that Helen Grey should come to evil through fault of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horrible misgivings that haunted me amid my journey . And so pass these faery visions ! Nay , not thus . It will take longer than this to unlink this one day 's hope from its thousand fastnesses . I thought , ere this , to have met the spirit of those beaming eyes , to have taken to my heart for ever this soft , pure being of another life . And yet , even as I rode through those lonely hills this morning , with every picture my hope painted , there came a strange misgiving ;  --  like some scene of laughing noon-day loveliness , darkening in the shadow of a summer 's cloud . Strange that Alaska should abandon my trust ! I can not understand it . Why , I should never have trusted her with this rascal Indian . There was something in his eye , hateful beyond all thought ,  --  and once or twice I caught a strange expression in it , like malignant triumph it seemed . It may be  --  no , he must have seen her  --  that glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God !  --  what if  --  I think my old experience should have taught me there was little danger of her risking much in my behalf . Well  --  even this is better , than that Helen Grey should have come to evil through fault of mine . PART SIXTH .  --  RECONCILIATION . Page image - Page 149 . DIALOGUE I. Scene . The slope of the Hill near Fort Edward . The road-side , shaded with stately pines and hemlocks . ( Two British Officers , coming slowly down the road. ) 1st Off . Yes , here has been wild work upon this hill to-day . They were slaughtered to a man . 2nd Off . I saw a sight above there , just now , that sickened me of warfare . 1st Off . And what was that , pry'thee ? 2nd Off . Oh nothing ,  --  ' t was nothing but a dead soldier ; a common sight enough , indeed ; but this was a mere youth ;  --  he was lying in a little hollow on the road-side , and as I crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brow . Such a brow it was , so young , so noble , and the dark chesnut curls clustering about it . I think I never saw a more classic set of features , or a look of loftier courage than that which death seemed to have found and marbled in them . Hark  --  that 's a water-fall we hear . 1st Off . I saw him , there was another though , lying not far thence , the sight of whom moved me more . He was younger yet , or seemed so , and of a softer mould ; and , torn and bloody as they were , I fancied I could see in his garb and appointments , and in every line of his features , the traces of some mother 's tenderness . 2nd Off . Listen , Andre ! This is beautiful ! There 's some cascade not far hence , worth searching for . Andre . Yes , just in among those trees you 'll find a perfect drawing-room , carpeted , canopied , and dark as twilight ; its verdant seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , nay , deserted rather , for the music wastes on the lonely air , as if the fairy that kept state there , in gossip mood had stolen down some neighboring aisle , and would be home anon . I would have bartered all the glory of this campaign for leave to stretch myself on its mossy bank , for a soft hour or so . Mor . Ay , with Chaucer or the " Faery Queen . " If one could people these lovely shades with the fresh creations of the olden time , knight and lady , and dark enchantress and Paynim fierce , instead of Yankee rebels  --  Andre . ' T were well your faery-work were of no lasting mould , or these same Yankee rebels would scarce thank you for your pains ,  --  they hold that race in little reverence . Alas ,  --  No grot divine , or wood-nymph haunted glen , Or stream , or fount , shall these young shades e'er know . No beautiful divinity , stealing afar Through darkling nooks , to poet 's eye thence gleam ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach not to the blessed fairy-land That once all lovely in heaven 's stolen light , To yearning thoughts , in the deep green-wood grew . Ah ! had they come to light when nature Was a wonder-loving , story-telling child !  --  The misty morn of ages had gone by , The dreamy childhood of the race was past , And in its tame and reasoning manhood , In the daylight broad , and noon-day of all time , This world hath sprung . The poetry of truth , None other , shall her shining lakes , and woods , And ocean-streams , and hoary mountains wear . Perchance that other day of poesy , Unsung of prophets , that upon the lands Shall dawn yet , thence shall spring . The self-same mind That on the night of ages once , for us Those deathless clusters flung , the self-same mind , With all its ancient elements of might , Among us now its ancient glory hides ; But , from its smothered power , and buried wealth , A golden future sparkles , decked from deeper founts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song undreamed of now , That shall make Romance a forgotten world , And the young heaven of Antiquity , With all its starry groups , a gathered scroll . Mor . Ay , Andre , you were born a poet , and have mistaken your art . Prythee excuse me , who am but a poor soldier , for marring so fine a rhapsody with any thing so sublunary ; but , methinks , for an enemy 's quarters , youder fort shows as peaceable a front of stone and mortar as one could ask for . What can it mean that they are so quiet there ? Andre . That spy did not return a second time . Mor . The rogues have made sure of him ere this , I fancy . They may have given us the slip ,  --  who knows ? Andre . I would like to venture a stroll through that shady street if I thought so . A dim impression that I have somewhere seen this view before , haunts me unaccountably . Mor . How I hate that sober , afternoon air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can see it in the sunshine on those white walls , you can hear it in the hum of the bee from the bending thistle here . Andre . Of the mind it is . This were lovely as the morning light , but for the shade it gathers thence , from the thought of decline and the vanishing day . ' T is a pretty spot . Mor . Yes , but the quiet goings-on of life are all hushed there now . Andre . Ay , this is the hour , when the home-bound children swing the gate with a merry spring , and the mother sits at her work by the open window , with her quiet eye , and the daughter , with the beauty of an untamed soul in her 's , looks forth on the woods and meadows , and thinks of her walk at even-tide . I thought it was something like a memory that haunted me thus ,  --  ' t is the spot that Maitland talked of yesterday . Mor . Captain Maitland ? I saw him just now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill ? Mor . Yes ,  --  something struck me in his mien ,  --  and there he stands with Colonel Hill , above , on the other side .  --  Mark him now . Your friend is handsome , Andre ; he is handsome , I 'll own ,  --  but I never liked that smile of his , and I think I like it less than ever now . Andre . Why , that 's the genuine Apollo-curl ,  --  a line 's breadth deeper were too much , I 'll own . ( Maitland and another Officer enter . ) Off . That is all ,  --  that is all , I believe , Captain Maitland . Yonder pretty dwelling among the trees seems an old acquaintance of yours . It has had the ill manners to rob me of your eye ever since we stood here , and I have had little token that the other senses were not in its company . Andre , has your friend never a ladye-love in these wilds , you could tell us of ? Mor . He is sworn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love ! I hold it a pretty theme for the ballad-makers , Colonel Hill ; but for myself , I have scarce time for rhyming just now . Captain Andre , here are papers for you . He walks away , descending the road . Col. Hill . So ! So ! What ails the boy ? ( Looking after him for a moment , and then ascending the hill . ) Andre . ( Reading . ) Humph ! Here 's prose enough ! Will you walk up the hill with me , Mortimer ? I must cross the river again . Mort . First let me seek this horse of mine ,  --  the rogue must have strayed down this path , I think . ( He enters the wood . ) ( Andre walks to and fro with an impatient air , then pauses . ) Andre . Well , I can wait no longer for this loiterer . Exit . ( Mortimer re-enters , calling from the woods . ) Mor . Andre ! Maitland ! Colonel Hill ! Good Heavens ! Where the devil are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . ) Mor . For the love of Heaven ,  --  come here . Mait . Nay ,  --  but what is it ? Mor . For God 's sake , come . DIALOGUE II . Scene . A little glen , darkly shaded with pines . A fountain issuing from one side , and falling with a curious murmur into the basin below . Mortimer and Maitland enter . Mor . This is the place !  --  Well , if hallucinations like this can visit mortal eyes , I 'll ne'er trust mine again . ' T is the spot , I 'm sure of it ,  --  the place , too , that Andre was raving about just now .  --  The fairies ' drawing-room ,  --  palace rather ,  --  look at these graceful shafts , Maitland ,  --  and fairies ' work , it must have been in good earnest . Mait . If it 's to admire this clump of pine trees you have brought me hither , allow me to say you might have spared yourself that trouble . I have seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mor . Come this way a little ,  --  yes , it was just above there that I stood ,  --  it must have been . Mait . If you would give me some little inkling of what you are talking about , Lieutenant Mortimer , I should be more likely to help you , if it 's help you need . Mor . I do not ask you to believe me , but ,  --  as I was springing on my horse just now above there , the gurgling of this spring caught my ear , and looking down suddenly  --  upon my word , Captain Maitland , I am ashamed to describe what can not but seem to you such an improbable piece of fancy-work ; and yet , true it seemed , as that I see you now . I was looking down , as I said , when suddenly , among those low evergreens , the brilliant hue of a silken mantle caught my eye , and then a woman 's brow gleamed up upon me . Yes , there in that dark cradle , calmly sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright vision of olden time , methought there lay  --  a lady ,  --  a girl , young and lovely as a dream ;  --  the white plume in her bonnet soiled and broken , and the long bright hair streaming heavily on her mantle ,  --  and yet with all its loveliness , such a face of utter sorrow saw I never . I saw her , I saw her , as I see you now ,  --  the proud young form with such a depth of grace , in its strange repose , and  --  where are you going ?  --  what are you doing , Maitland ? Mait . Helen Grey !  --  Mor . You are right . I did not mark that break  --  yes  --  there she lies . Said I right , Maitland ? Mait . Helen Grey !  --  Mor . Maitland ! Heavens !  --  what a world of anguish that tone reveals !  --  Why do you stand gazing on that lovely sleeper thus ? Mait . Bring water . There 's a cup at yonder spring . Here has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . We must unclasp this mantle . The treasure of the earth lies here .  --  Now doth mine arm enfold it once , at last . ' T is sweet , Helen , mine own true love ; ' t is sweet , even thus . Mor . This letter ,  --  see  --  from those loosened folds it just now dropped . This might throw some light , perchance  --  Mait . Let it be . There 's light enough . I want no more . Water ,  --  more water ,  --  do you see ? Mor . Maitland ,  --  this is vain . Mark this dark spot upon her girdle  --  Mait . Hush , hush ,  --  there , cover it thus  --  ' t is nothing . Loosen this bonnet  --  so  --  ' t was a firm hand that tied that knot ; so  --  she can breathe now . Mor . How like life , those soft curls burst from their loosened pressure ! But mark you  --  there is no other motion . I am sorry to distress you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mait . Dead ! Lying hell-hound ! Dead ! Say that again . Mor . God help you ! Mait . Dead ! Helen Grey , open these eyes . Here 's one that , never having seen them , talks of death . Oh God ! is it thus we meet at last ? At last these arms are round her , and she knows it not . I look upon her , but her eye answers me not . Dead !  --  for me ? Murdered !  --  mine own hand hath done it . Mor . Why do you start thus ? Mait . Hush !  --  hush ! There !  --  again  --  that slow heavy throb  --  again ! again ! Mor . Good God ! she breathes ! This is life indeed . Mait . ( Solemnly . ) Ay , thank God . This moment 's sweetness is enough . Mor . How like one in troubled sleep she murmurs ! Mark those tones of sweet and wild entreaty . Listen ! Mait . I have heard it again !  --  from the buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here . ' T is she . This is no marble mockery . She is here ! Her head is on my bosom . Death can not rob me of this sweetness now . ( Talking without . ) A Lady . This way  --  I hear their voices . Down this pathway  --  here they are . ( Lady Ackland and Andre enter the Glen . ) Lady A. I knew it could not be . They told us she was murdered , Maitland . ( Starting back . ) Ah  --  ah  --  God help thee , Maitland ! Mait . Listen , listen . She was speaking but now . There  --  again ! Lady A. And this is she ! Can the wilderness blossom thus ? And did God unfold such loveliness  --  for a waste so cruel ? Helen . ( In a low murmur . ) We are almost there . If we could but pass this glen . Oh God ! will they stop here ? Go on ,  --  go on . Was not that a white tent I saw ? Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  do not weep . Mait . Look at me , Helen .  --  Open these eyes . One more look  --  one more . Andre . She hears your bidding . Mait . Oh God ! Do you see those eyes  --  those dim , bewildered eyes ?  --  it is quenched  --  quenched . Let her lean on you . Lady A. Gently  --  gently , she does not see us yet . Helen . Oh Mother , I am ill and weary . Here 's this dream again ! Blue sky ? and pine-tree boughs ? Am I here indeed ? Yes , I remember now ,  --  we stood upon that cliff  --  I am dying . Is there no one here ? Whose tears are these ? Lady A. Dear child , sweet one , nay , lean on me . Helen . My mother , oh my mother , come to me . Come , Annie , come , come ! Strangers all ! Mor . Her eye is on him . Hush ! Andre . See in an instant how the light comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye that I saw yesterday . Lady A. That slowly settling smile ,  --  deeper and deeper  --  saw you ever any thing so gay , so passing lovely ? Helen . Is it  --  is it  --  Everard Maitland  --  is it thee ? The living real of my thousand dreams , in the light of life doth he stand there now ? Doth he ? ' T is he ! Mait . Helen ! Helen . ' T is he ! That tone 's spell builds around me its all-sheltering music-walls , and death is nothing . Oh God , when at thy dark will dimly revealed , I trembled yesterday , I did not think in this most rosy bower to meet its fearfulness . Mait . Helen ,  --  dost thou love me yet ? Helen . Doubter , am I dying here ? Mait . ' T is her own most rich and blessed smile , even as of old in mirth it shone upon me . Your murderer , you count me then ? Helen . Come hither ,  --  let me lean on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that is fading now , the sun !  --  doth mine eye see thee , then , at last ? Oh ! this is sweet ! On its own holy home my head rests now . Everard , in this dark world Love leans on Faith . How else , even in God 's love and loveliness , could I trust now for that strange future on whose bloody threshold I am lying here ; yes , and in spite of prayers and trust , and struggling hopes . And yet  --  how beautiful it is  --  that love invisible , invisible no more . Like glorious sunshine it is streaming round me ,  --  lighting all . The infinite of that thy smile hath imaged , as real ,  --  it beams on me now . Have faith , in him I mean ; for  --  if we meet again  --  we 'll need it then no more ; and  --  how dim it grows  --  nay , let me lean on you ,  --  and  --  through this life 's darkening glass I shall see you no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where art thou ?  --  Everard !  --  He is gone  --  gone ! Lady A. Dead !  --  Mor . She is dead ! Andre . This was Love . Lady A. See how her eyes are fixed on you . The light and love of the vanished soul looks through them still . Cruelly hath it been sent thence ; and no other gleam of its changeful beauty will e'er dawn in them . Sadly , oh lovely stranger , I close for ever now these dark-fringed lids upon their love and beauty . Yes  --  this was love ! Andre . And so there was a need-be in its doom . I 'll ne'er believe that genuine , that is blessed . The fate of this life would not suffer it . Ah ! if it would , if Heaven should leave a gem like that outside her walls , we should none of us go thither . Mait . Dead ? How beautiful ! Yes  --  let her lie there  --  under that lovely canopy . Dead !  --  it 's a curious word  --  How comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  is it you ? Andre . I heard the tale as I crossed just now , from an Indian , who was one in the ambuscade this noon  --  and in the woods on the other side , I found this lady , with her attendants , abiding the promise she made you last night , to welcome this lovely stranger with her savage guides . Mait . Hush , hush . Let it pass . See ,  --  a bride ! Mor . ( Aside . ) Did he trust her with these murderers ? Mait . Ay  --  say yes . Andre . Indeed , Maitland , you wrong yourself . It was the treachery of this savage Manida that crossed your plans , working the mission of some Higher power ,  --  as for Alaska , you might as soon have doubted me . The Chief he sent for her was one he had known years  --  but , unfortunately , he was one in the ambuscade this morning  --  nay , the leader of it ; for the murdered Indian was his son ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Maitland 's tent last night , and heard the promised reward , found means to steal from its concealment the letter , with which he easily won this trusting lady to accompany him . Mor . Ah !  --  there it lies . Andre . It was here in this glen that Alaska , discovering the treachery , lay in wait for them with a band of chosen warriors , and on that cliff above they fought . Lady A. ( Aside. ) and she stood there , amid those yelling demons alone ! Methinks the angels should have come from their unseen dwellings at her prayer . Can our humanity 's darkest extremity wring no love from the invisible ?  --  Andre . Alaska had regained his charge ; but the malignant eye , and the deadly arrow of the vanquished Indian followed her . She fell , even in the place where you found her ; for at that same instant a party from the fort drove them hence , victor and vanquished . Alaska fled ; but the murderer , with a tale cunning enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mor . Mark his changed mien . I would rather see tears for a grief like this , than that calm smile with which he gazes on her now . ( Burgoyne and St. Leger are seen talking in the road above ,  --  they enter the glen . ) Bur . At a crisis like this we might better have lost a thousand men in battle ! Ah ! ah !  --  a sight for our enemies , Lady Ackland ! Where is this Indian ? St. L. We have sent out for him . No one has seen him as yet . Bur . Let him be found . Look to it . We will give them an example for once . I say , at a crisis like this we might better have lost a thousand men in battle , for it will turn thousands against us , and rouse the slumbering spirit of resistance here , at the very crisis when , had it slumbered on a little longer , all was ours . St. L. But this was a quarrel among the Indians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will see what Schuyler will make of it . His wordy proclamation will have its living sequel now . A young and innocent girl , seeking the protection of our camp , is inhumanly murdered by Indians in our pay . A single tale like this is enough to undo at a blow all that we have accomplished here . With ten thousand will aggravations , it will be told in every cottage of these borders before to-morrow 's sunset . ( Another Officer enters hastily . ) Off . Here is Arnold , with a thousand men , on the brow of the next hill . One of the rebel guard escaped , and the news of the massacre here has reached their camp below . Bur . Said I right ? ( The three Officers go out together . ) Andre . This story is spreading fast , there will be throngs here presently . Maitland ,  --  nay , do not let me startle you thus , but  --  Mait . Is it you ? What was it we were saying yesterday ?  --  we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencilling now . Those silken vestments ,  --  that long , golden hait ,  --  this youthful shape ,  --  there 's that same haughty grace about it , that the smile of these thought-lit eyes would disown with every glance . Then that letter ,  --  and the Lady Ackland here ,  --  Weeping ?  --  This is most strange . I know you all ,  --  but ,  --  as I live I ca n't remember how this chanced . How comes it that we all stand here ? Pearls ?  --  and white silk ?  --  a bridal ?  --  Ha ha ha ! ( Laughing wildly . ) Lady A. Take me away . This is too terrible ! I can stay here no longer . Take me away , Andre . Exeunt Andre and Lady A. ( An Officer enters . ) The Officer . We are ordered to withdraw our detachment , Captain Maitland . The rebels are just below , some two thousand strong , and in no mood to be encountered . Mor . He does not hear you . We must leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of parting them . Come . Exeunt Mortimer and Officer . Mait . They are gone at last . They are all gone . I am alone with my dead bride . I must needs smile  --  I could not weep when those haughty and prying eyes were upon me , but now  --  I am alone with my dead bride .  --  Helen , they are all gone ,  --  we are alone . How still she lies ,  --  smiling too ,  --  on that same bank . She will speak , surely she will . How lightly those soft lashes lie , as if a word would lift them .  --  Helen !  --  I will be calm and patient as a child . This lovely smile is deepening , it will melt to words again .  --  Hark ! that spring ,  --  that same curious murmur ! We have checked our sweetest words to hear it , we have stood here listening to it , till we fancied , in its talk-like tones , wild histories , beautiful and sad , the secrets of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories no power here now ? In mine ear alone doth the spring murmur now . Death ! what is't ?  --  Awake ! awake ,  --  by the love that is stronger than death ,  --  awake !  --  I thought that scene would shift . It had a heavy , dream-like mistiness . This is reality again . These are the pine trees that I dreamed of . See ! how beautiful ! With the sharp outline and the vivid hue such as our childhood 's unworn sense yields , they are waving now . Look , Andre , there she sits , the young and radiant stranger ,  --  there , in the golden sunset she is sitting still , braiding those flowers ,  --  see , how the rich life flashes in her eye , and yet , just now I dreamed that she was dead , and  --  and  --  Oh my God ! ( A voice without . ) Let go , who stays me ?  --  where 's my sister ? ( Captain Grey enters . ) Grey . Ha ! Murderer ! art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mock me , Sir ? Mait . Let her be . She is mine !  --  all mine ! my love , my bride ,  --  my bride ?  --  Murderer ?  --  Stay !  --  Do n't glare at me ! I know you , Sir . I can hurl off these mountain shadows yet .  --  They 'll send some stronger devil ere they wrench this hold from me ! I know you well . What make you here ? Grey . Madness !  --  there 's little wonder !  --  It 's the only good that Heaven has left for him ! My lovely playfellow ,  --  my sister , is it so indeed ? Alas ! all gently lies this hand in mine . There is no angry strength here now . Helen !  --  Ah ! would to God our last words had not been in bitterness . Mait . He weeps . I never thought to see tears there . List !  --  she should not lie there thus . Strange it should move you so !  --  Think it a picture now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if one but thinks so . See ,  --  ' t is but a sleeping girl , with the red summer light upon her cheek , and the slight breeze stirring her golden hair . Mark you that shoulder 's grace ?  --  They come . ( Leslie , Elliston , and others enter . ) Leslie . Oh God , was there none other ? My lovely cousin , and  --  were you the victim ? In your bridal glory chosen ,  --  nay , with your heart 's holiest law lured to the bloody altar ! Yet this day 's history , and something in that calm , high mien , tells me , as freely you had moved unto it , though God had spoken by a higher voice , and with a martyr 's garland beckoned you . Elliston . Our cause is linked unto that ancient one , the cause of Love and Truth ; in which Heaven moves with unrelenting hand , not sparing its own loveliest ones , but unto bloody death freely delivering them . ( Grey and Leslie converse apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' T is a fitting spot ; and unto distant days , this lonely grave , with its ever-verdant canopy , shall be even as Love 's Shrine . Thither , in the calm and smiling summers of those bloodless times shall many a fair young pilgrim come , to wonder at such love ; and living eyes shall weep , and living hearts shall heave over its cruel fate , when unto her the long-told tale , and all the anguish of this far-off day , shall be even as the dim passage of some troubled dream . A martyr 's garland she hath won indeed ; true Love 's young Martyr there she lies . Elliston . Yet was that love but the wreathed and glittering weapon of a higher doom . In that holy cause , whose martyrs strew a thousand fields , truth 's , freedom 's , God 's , darkly , by Power Invisible hath this young life been offered here . A thousand graves like this , over all this lovely land , in lanes and fields , on the lonely hill-side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a silent wood , to distant days shall speak  --  of blood-sealed destinies ; with voices that no tyrant 's power can smother , they shall speak .  --  Leslie . The light of that chamber window , through the soft summer evening will shine here ; no mournful memory of all the lovely past will it waken . The autumn blaze will flicker within those distant walls , and gather its pleasant circle again ; but she will lie calmly here . For ever at her feet the river of her childhood shall murmur on , and many a lovely spring-time , like the spring-times of her childhood , shall come and go , but no yearning hope shall it waken here ; the winter shall sing through the desolate boughs , and rear its fairy temples around her , but nought shall break her dreamless rest .  --  Mait . Graves ! Is it graves they are talking of ? Will they bury this gay young bride ! ' T is but the name ; there 's nothing sad in it . In the lovely summer twilight shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridal array , with the glory of the crimson sunset shining through the trees ;  --  see what a fearful glow is kindling on her cheek , and that faint breeze  --  or , is it life that stirs these curls ? Stay !  --  whose young brow is this ?  --  Ha ! whose smile is this ? Who is this they would hurry away into the darkness of death ? The grave ! Could you fold the rosy and all-speading beauty of heaven in the narrow grave ? Helen , is it thee ?  --  my heaven , my long-lost heaven ; and , even now , but for mine own deed  --  Oh God ! was there no hand but mine ?  --  but for me  --  They shall not utter it ,  --  there , thus . There 's but one cry that could unfold this grief , but that would circle the round universe and fill eternity . A sad sight this ! Is't known who killed this lady , Sir ? Leslie . Of all the wrecks of beautiful humanity that strew these paths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mark you those groups of soldiers loitering on the road-side there ? An Officer . Curiosity . The regiment that was dismissed to-day . They 'll be here anon . Leslie . Ay , let them come . Off . Look ,  --  who comes up that winding pathway through the trees , with such a swift and stately movement ? A woman ! See how the rude soldiers turn aside with awe . Ah , she comes hither . ( A voice without . ) Where is she ?  --  stand aside !  --  What have you here in this dark ring ?  --  Henry  --  nay , let me come . ( Mrs. Grey enters the glen . ) Grey . For God 's sake , Madam , let me lead you hence . This is no place for you . Look at this group of men , officers , soldiers  --  Mrs. G. Would you cheat me thus ? Is it no place for me ? What kind of place is't then for her , whose  --  Oh God !  --  think you I do not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and whose plumed bonnet is it that lies crushed there at their feet ?  --  unhand me , Henry . Leslie . Nay , let her come ,  --  ' t is best . ( She passes swiftly through the parting group . ) Mrs. G. My daughter !  --  Blood ? My stricken child smile you ? No pity was there then ? Speak to me , speak ! Your mother 's tears are on your brow , and heed you not ? Nay , tell me all , my smitten one . This day 's dark history will you never pour into my ear , that bath treasured so often your lightest grief ? Alone through that wild anguish have you passed , and smile you now ? I bade her trust in God . Did God see this ? ( Arnold , and a group of Soldiers , enter the glen . ) Arnold . Look there . Ay , ay , look there . You were right , Leslie ;  --  this is better than a battle-field . They 'll find that this day 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who loves as mothers love their babes , see this ? Had I been there , with my love , in the heavens , could I have given up this innocent and tender child a prey to the wild Indians ? No !  --  and legions of pitying angels waiting but my word . No ,  --  no . Elliston . Had you been there ,  --  from that far centre whence God 's eye sees all , you had beheld what lies in darkness here . Forth from this fearful hour you might have seen Peace , like a river , flowing o'er the years to come ; and smiles , ten thousand , thousand smiles , down the long ages brightening , sown in this day 's tears . Had you been there with God 's all-pitying eye , the pitying legions had waited your word in vain , for once , unto a sterner doom , for the world 's sake he gave his Son . Mrs. G. Words !
