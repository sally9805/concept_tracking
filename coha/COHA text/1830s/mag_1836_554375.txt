txt Tun two works , whose titles stand at the head of this article , appear to have attracted not a little of the public attention the former having reached a second edition within six months from its first appearance , and the latter having been thought worthy of a reprint in this country , with the imprimatur of a Professor of Theology in one of our most popular institutions . At first sight , they seem to possess many points of close resemblance to each other , and one who had not actually read them , might expect to find some general similarity , to say the least , in the views which they present . The three clergymen , whose names are given on their title-pages , are all engaged in actual instruction , direct or indirect , on the subjects of which they treat . In their respective denominations , they are held to occupy a high rank , and from the supposed tenets of those denominations , might he presumed to agree , at all events very nearly , so far as theology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its relation to the great principles of right and duty , and of the mode in which those principles are to he ascertained and proved . This , however , is very far from being the case . It is hardly indeed too much to say , that on these points the two books are absolutely contradictions to one another . Both written with evident care and ability , by men who could not previously have been supposed to differ widely from each other ; both adopted as standard works hy classes of men in the same predicament ; they nevertheless proceed on altogether different principles , and of course arrive at very different results . If either one is right , the other must he radically wrong . The object of the Scottish divine is to prove the insufficiency // and even danger of all moral speculations , based on any other ground than that of biblical interpretation . In his view , every Moral Philosopher who has preceded him , Butler himself included , has fallen into serious error , from this inherent vice of the whole system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Theology ; and the seeker after truth , instead of reading , or attempting to read , as well that copy of the law of God which was " graven with his own finger on the table of the heart , " as that other copy which was afterward " graven on a stone , " - instead of by this means adding at once to his understanding of its requirements , and to his confidence in its authority , is hereafter to regard the one of these two books as sealed ; lest , after having read it , his views should not precisely square with those of his fellow-inqui:er , whose attention has been wholly given to the other . To use his own language , " if the authority of the document be established , and the verity of its statements consequently ascertained , then it becomes , on all matters of which it treats , i/ic only philosophy ; " " the sole object of investi0ation comes to be , the meaning of the language in which the intimations of the Divine Oracles are conveyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a mere learner , a listener and asker of questions at the feet of Prophets and Apostles ; " setting himself " with his grammar and his dictionary , to find out what it is that these men say ; and in every point of which they treat , to bow without gainsaying to their authoritative decisions . " The adoption of any other course , can lead only to a " science falsely so called . " The " amalgamation of Philosophy and Theology , has , from the beginning , been a copious source of error . " " We should be unfaithful to our God , and throw a disparaging insult on His name , were we thus to consent that the wisdom of the only wise , ' should make its obeisance to the chair of human science ; or were we to admit that he has left his word with less conclusive evidence in its behalf , than that by which the wise men of this world can vindicate the dictates of their own sagacity . " Dr. Wayland , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue the older course in regard to Moral Science , and has given us a text-book on the subject , in which other authorities , besides those allowed by Dr. Wardlaw 's system , are acknowledged and referred to . Human nature , which the author of the " Christian Ethics " // declares to be so corrupted , from its original character , that the study of its actual manifestations can afford us no real clue to its true design , is made in even greater measure than has been common in previous works on Morals , the basis of Dr. Wayland 's arguments . His whole system , indeed , is mainly founded on the view which he has taken of it . Here and there , as we shall have occasion presently to remark , he has not altogether followed out this plan ; but in the ablest and most interesting portions of his work , it is to be clearly traced . Scripture is referred to throughout , in confirmation of the views which lie presents , hut the general line of argument is by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of Dr. Wayland 's book proceeds on the supposition , which the " Christian Ethics " controvert , that a careful study of human nature , as now manifested in its various states of corn- parative vice and virtue , may , and indeed will lead us , so far as it will lead at all , to right results as to its true character just as a careful study of any other portion of God 's creation , will enable us to ascertain much that is true concerning it , and need not conduct us to anything that is erroneous . The appearance of two works , thus seriously opposed in principle to one another , and each receiving so considerable a degree of attention to its views , seems to offer a fit occasion for some general remarks , bearing on the main point at issue between them . This course will enable us to give our judgment on the general merits and defects , as they appear to our mind , of the books themselves . In adopting it , it may be well to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in this case requires , and to consider somewhat in detail , a question which has not yet received its full share of attention from the public , viz. " What is the true foundation of Moral Science , as a branch of Philosophical Study ? " Is the distinction between right and wrong to be referred , as some of our controversialists would seem to intimate , only to the prescriptions of human law , or of public opinion , or even of the written law of God ; or is it not rather to be traced back to the very constitution of the human mind ? Are we , in order to follow it out satisfactorily , in all its details of practical application , to confine our attention to any simply written institutions , to any special decisions , of what sort soever ; or are we not rather , by a careful analysis of the mental faculties which God has given us , of their rela // tions to each other and to the world around us , to ascertain the great principles of his government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of our species ? Are we not , by the faithful pursuit of such an inquiry , to derive new confirmation of our faith in revelation ; new sources of light and knowledge , to enable us to understand its meaning ; new motives to induce us , with gratitude and hope , to aim at rendering obedience to its commands ? If , in the discussion of this question , we should dissent altogether from Dr. Wardlaw 's positions , we yet trust , that the general tenor of our views , will serve to acquit us of the charge of holding Scripture in any lower esteem than those do who take an opposite view . We are aware that in proposing such a discussion , we ask attention to a subject which is very far from popular , in regard to which , indeed , there exists a strong and deeply rooted prejudice in the public mind . The question as to the foundation of moral science has not , as we have said , received the share of attention which its importance merits . We may indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle of the mental and moral sciences , and their dependencies . Metaphysical studies , as they have been unfortunately styled , are not the fashion . The revival , that has wrought such wonders for those departments of science which relate to the world without us , has not yet reached them ; and our system of intellectual education presents to the reflecting observer , a strange mixture of zeal for the diffusion of every other kind of knowledge , as of the utmost value to man , with comparative indifference to , and contempt for , that course of study , by which alone he can acquire a knowledge of himself . Ask the pupil of the modern system to give his attention to any one of what are called the physical sciences , and he will admit , to some extent at least , the propriety of your advice ; but direct his notice to the laws of his own mental nature , ask him to observe and analyse his various emotions , and processes of thought , t&amp;compare his own ideas , feelings , and actions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other men ; in a word , ask him to study the human mind , and he will plead his want of time to spare from his other and practical pursuits . It is enough for him that he does actually think and feel . As to the inodus operandi in the case , that is of very secondary consequence . // He xviii compass sea and land that he may know , and thereby render subservient to himself the powers of ' external nature ; but self-knowledge , the power of understandin6 and acting on his fellow-man , the means of gainin* that greatest of all victories , self-conquest , this is not what he aims at . The philosophy of the mind is , iii his judgment , too abstruse and visionary , to be thought of beyond the limits of the college , where the folly of his ancestors unhappily in former times prescribed some little waste of time upon it . Speak to him of the laws of reasoning , of taste , of morals , of the rules by which he may distin*uish truth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deformity , between right and wrong . He xviii tell you that he makes these distinctions well enough for all his purposes , without reference to any such rules or principles . All men make them every day . What need is there of puzzling over a dry text-book of Logic , or dissertations on the sublime and beautiful , or treatises on Moral Science ? Mathematical certainty and the practical spirit of the age are contrasted with metaphysical speculations , and the argument is ended . That this is no exaggerated picture , we appeal to every man 's experience of the way , in which , even by most of our intelligent men , every attempt to gain a serious hearing for such subjects , is treated . Theorist is just now a name of Inagical effect . Does any man appeal from the few crude and casually picked up notions , which form the sum of most men 's knowledge of human nature , he is at once set down to be no practical man . He is a visionary and enthusiast . His views are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in the world . For this we want plain experienced men , not dealers in systems , or pretenders to philosophy . As if he were not in truth the more strictly an experienced and practical man , whose judgments are formed not on his own chance observations only , but who has drawn also on the recorded experience of others , who has reflected on and arranged carefully the tesults of this wide induction , and has followed them out in their applications to the concerns of life . What is a theory , using the term in its true sense , and without the implied reproach which is unfairly connected with it , but a systematized , straight-forward statement of the results of long continued observation ? Why are a comparatively few facts on any subject , collected by a single observer , more valuable // than a far larger number , if brought forward as the result of many men 's experience ? Why is the knowledge of them to make a man a safe and valued counsellor , so long as they remain " without form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to disqualify the same man for the same duties , so soon as , by the exercise of the higher powers of his understanding , he has reduced them to order , and it may be , written them in a hook ? When we are choosing an architect or engineer to construct our houses or rail-roads , or a gardener to experiment on our flowers and vegetables , or a farmer to improve the breed and training of our cattle , we never think to stipulate that he shall not have gathered any of his knowledge from others . The more he has read and learned of his profession , or , in other words , the wider has been his field of observation , and the more closely and thoroughly ho has explored it , the better for our purposes . Why is our course different when we are choosing a school-master for our children , or a religious and moral teacher , or a legislator , for ourselves ? The principle is the same in the two*cases . If limited knowledge is better than none at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says common sense in every other case ; so says not popular opinion in this . Unpromising , however , as may seem the attempt to divert this current of public sentiment to its right course , the attempt itself must not therefore be given up . The present state of things in this respect is not one , to whose continuance we can look forward with any satisfaction . We must call for the protest , and for the efforts of our directors of education , against it . Its results are to be seen in every direction , and the language in which they address us is sufficiently emphatic . Here the philanthropist , who seeks to improve the condition of his race , and who , in pursuit of this end , has to make war on any of the habits or institutions of society , is met with a triumphant appeal to existing laws and customs , to the opinions of distinguished men , or to that most absolute of all autocrats , the will of the public . To all his bright anticipations of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . The saying of the wise man is wrested against him , and he is assured that " the thing that hath been , it is that which shall be , and that which is done is that which shall be done , and there is no new thing under the sun . " To all his reasonings , drawn from the nature and prospects of man , to // all his appeals to our benevolence and moral feeling , the contemptuous sneer of his opponent gives for answer , that what he is condemning has the sanction of the law , the authority of precedent , the support of public opinion . And this reply passes current with the majority of those to whom it is addressed . Or to take another illustration , of which unhappily there are hut too many instances , both in this and in other countries . There is another and very different class of reformers , agrarian agitators , who declaim loudly against priestcraft and monopoly , and resolve every thing they dislike into one or other of these hated evils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions in a common ruin . The past and present are with them the subjects of unqualified abuse . A futurity of endless change is their element . You warn them of the danger of sweeping and premature innovation ; of the necessary inferiority , in all that ought to constitute the citizen and ruler , of that uneducated class , to whose worst passions the ) r are appealing ; of the immoral and destructive tendencies of many of their favorite and most popular doctrines ; of the difficulty even now , the impossibility ere long , of arresting the career into which they are urging the community . What is all this to them , or to those on whom they act ? The past abuses of aristocracy , the march of the human mind , the supreme and infallible decisions of the 1 ) Ublic will , - these are their watch words , irrelevant to be sure , but not therefore the less effectual for their objects . We are not stating here what has merely happened once , nor even what is now occasionally occurring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral and political controversies ; of the utter want of any commonly admitted principles of action , or tests of truth . Is this as it should he ? Ought not they , to whom these questions are committed , and by whose voice the settlement of them is for the time determined , to be aware that the terms " legal " and " moral , " " popular " and " right , " do not always mean the same ; that the enactments of human law , and the decisions of popular caprice , are often at variance with the dictates of that moral law , of which , so far as they go , they ought to be the exact transcript ; and that in all such cases , it becomes the faithful citizen to labor , by all right means , for their correction ? Let all such proposed changes , whether of law or of opinion , be canvassed as minutely as their enemies can desire , but let their ordeal he a fair one . Let not those who // contend on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and before umpires who can not set either of them right . That this is so much the state of things at present , reflects no credit on the modes which have been adopted for the education of our I ) eople . Nor is the effect of this system better on our religious controversies . The infidel raises a laugh at the priest-ridden follies of former days , and calls on men to reject forever the religious systems , which have been in all ages so fruitful of them . It is in vain that the use of revelation is contrasted with its abuse ; the moral purity of Christianity itself , with the impure glosses and corruptions that have at times disfigured it . The scoffer is a sceptic about all this . He has not been brought up to draw such distinctions , and it is no wonder that his moral vision is too imperfect to perceive them clearly . The proof of the being and attributes of a God , offered by the noblest of his creations , the mind of man , and its adaptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly urged , for him to give it much attention . The whole subject , indeed , is an obscure one . Is not the mind , with all its powers , the result of accident ? Have not even philosophers so considered it ? Has it really any constitution , properly so called , and if it has , what are its elements ? If there be indeed , as some think , a natural power of the understanding , whose office is to force on our minds the necessary connexion of effects with causes , and by enabling us to trace it in all things , to bear witness to that great first cause , to whose action all around and within us is to be ascribed , he has yet to learn its existence . if there be in the heart of man naturally implanted dispositions , leading him to do involuntary homage to whatever is above himself , to place unhesitating faith , nay , sometimes to take pleasure in truths which are yet incomprehensible to him , to " hope even against hope " for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , are still unregarded by him . If , again , in the natural instincts of humanity to " do justly and love mercy , " there is to be found an evidence of the justice and goodness of Him who made man in his own image , these instincts are not acknowledged by him . The divine enlarges on the internal evidences of this revelation , its harmony with human nature , its adaptation to human wants ; - to what purpose ? The grounds of his reasoning are not recognised . Human nature and human wants are , with most minds , literally // unknown quantities , and can not be made an available standard . Perhaps , indeed , by some of his shrewder opponents , he may be reminded of the position assumed in regard to this argument by certain even of his own class , and the ex-cathedra declaration of Dr. Wardlaw , that all systematic inquiries into human nature , have led more or less to anti-scriptural results , may be cited against him , as an evidence of the unreasonableness of his creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its favor . And the people , in the meantime , whose judgment in this question is of so much moment , how stands the case with them ? Are they better fitted than the disputants to follow out these trains of thought , and in so doing , to avoid those sources of error which have thus misled the disputants themselves ? We know that most men never give a serious thought to such considerations at all . And yet to a mind that has ever reflected on them , they present by far the strongest and most unanswerable evidence of religious truth . The historical argument is a long one , and makes some demands on an unlearned man 's belief , ( and in the sense in which we here use the term , most men are unlearned , ) in the statements of him who presents it . Every link of the chain has to be examined separately , and an impudent antagonist may easily , by a few well chosen assertions , make the uninstructed quite incredulous as to its whole fabric . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to every man who has but the preliminary knowledge of his own nature . There is no gainsaying its conclusions . " He that runs may read it . ' * And can we hope , knowing as we do , how much more powerful with the many a sneer is than any sober argument , that the defender of natural or revealed religion can succeed against the sneer of the sceptic , while he is himself unable to use with their full power , and his opponents and his hearers are alike unable to appreciate , his most convincing class of arguments ? We do not wonder at the rapid growth , - we will not say , of avowed atheism , because that form of infidelity is not just now prescribed by fashion , but we do say , - of a practical and indefinite scepticism , a disposition neither to believe nor to deny any point in morals or in religion , - a disposition which , if unchecked , may lead to almost worse effects , than the noisiest and most open infidelity . The limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results // of this all-pervading defect in our system of instruction , as they affect the controversies which are carrying on between the various sects into which the Christian world is divided , and to show how much their number , as well as their acrimony , is to he traced to this as a cause . We must pass on to a remark or two on the nature of the remedy for the evil . On this head , our views are soon stated . The cause of the evil must be done away . Our course of education , so far as it tends to produce it , must be altered . Whatever be the defect in the early training of the young , or in the later operations of society and its institutions on the adult , it must be supplied . In seeking to ascertain this defect , we must look below the surface . It not enough that we redouble our exertions to teach well and universally , what is already taught* Men may read and write , may even be profound in their acquaintance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be sound lawyers , dexterous as politicians , learned in theology ; and yet when weighed in the halances , may be found wanting as men and citizens , in the highest and most essential features of the character . The root of the evil is not , that the public in general , nor that our various classes of innovators and anti-innovators , moral , political , or religious , know too much or too little , talk too loudly or too slightingly of the law , or of public sentiment ; nor yet that they are too well or too ill informed on general topics , or on the technicalities of religion . It lies deeper . It is that they know too little of themselves ; that they are not enough versed in the great principles which are at the foundation of all these controversies ; that they have not that which alone can serve them as their compass or pole-star , in the otherwise bewildering inquiry after truth . This knowledge we must give them , not indeed in the place of any other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , " but in addition to them all . They must learn the laws of the external world , so far as those laws can he ascertained , whether they relate to the abstract properties of space and number , which form the subject of demonstrative science , or to the simply observed phenomena of inorganic , vegetable or animal existence ; but they must not be left in ignorance , - no , not even in comparative ignorance , - of the laws of nature , as they act upon the highest of those existences to which our powers of direct observation reach , as they are manifested in // the phenomena of the human mind . They must be made acquainted with this subject , not superficially , not as a matter of curious and interesting speculation merely , but as the great end and aim of all their previous studies , as the great business , we had almost said , of their life . Other knowledge they must be taught to regard as useful , highly useful ; but useful mainly , inasmuch as it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to facilitate the intercourse of nations , to render the most fearful of the powers of nature ministers to our will and contributors to our power ; all this is well , is to be desired , and to be attained . But there is a higher object yet for our exertions , one which will yield us a far richer and more enduring reward , without which indeed all our other attainments will have rendered but half their blessings ; and this is the bringing of ourselves into that condition , individual and social , for which our nature is designed , the effectin in the world wit bin us , cl1anges as striking , as miraculous , we might almost say , as those which our discoveries in physical science have enabled us to bring to pass in the world without . We do not call in question the indirect influence which the spread of general information exerts towards this result , nor yet the more direct agency which the government of law , the restraint of private by public will , and the existing institutions of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than this . We are not contented with anything short of direct knowledge in regard to any other branch of science . The farmer does not trust to a mere geologist the management of his crops , nor yet does he expect simply by his own practical knowledge of soils and their vegetable productions , to make himself a successful rearer of cattle . Yet geology is found to contribute to the improvement of the soil , and therefore of the harvest ; a knowledge of husbandry in general , is a help to the improver of cattle . So too with man . Every kind of knowledge will do something for him ; but it is the direct knowledge of himself that will do most . It is on this , that he must base his laws , by this , that he must form and estimate public opinion , by this that he must in no slight degree test his interpretations of that revelation , whose provisions are all suited and addressed to himself . When he has done this , the great problem of human improvement will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our colleges this study has been long prescribed , and asked why these grand // results of which we speak have not already ensued from it , if indeed it possess the high rank we award it . To this we *nswer , not by a denial of what any man may quote our college catalogues to prove , but by a brief comparison of what they state to be done in this matter , with what a true estimate of its importance , and a practical in an 's calculation of what is needed to render it efficient , would require . What then is the testimony of these witness ? Some months , no doubt , are given , more or less completely to mental and moral philosophy . But the time is much shorter than that devoted to the classical or mathematical departments , nay , often less than is allowed to the modern languages and the natural sciences . And it should be borne in n*ind , in ruakin g this comparison , that while both the ancient languages and the elements of mathematical and natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while , with the exception of the classics , all the other branches we have named are regarded with favor , and very commonly pursued as studies after the college course is ended ; there is no preparation made for the studies connected with the human mind before the student enters on them with his class , and scarcely ever the idea presented to him of continuing them for himself , when his daily recitations cease . Nor must we forget , that the atmosphere of college is not a little affected by that which prevails out of doors , and that our students mostly enter on this portion of their course with pretty unfavorable impressions as to its utility , impressions which the common regulations of the course itself are little likely to remove . In general , the undergraduate finds his text-books on the two subjects almost wholly unconnected with one another . A philosophy of the Mind is presented to him , which makes but very p**r provision for any practical Moral applications , and a philosophy of Morals , which has as slender a foundation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the same predicament ; neither the rules which profess to guide the mind in the search for truth , nor those which l ) rescribe for the modes of its communication , being provided for by his mental science , or referring ever so remotely to it . Nor after lie has left college . does the tenor either of professional and literary , or of more active life , tend to correct this idea . Law , medicine , divinity , criticism , are all pursued and carried on independently , or very nearly so , of the philosophy he has learnt . The du // ties of the man of business , of the teacher , of the citizen , are commonly performed without a reference to it . If we take into view all these facts , and they all bear on the question whether the human mind is studied as it should be , even in the course of what we call " a liberal education , " we think there can be no doubt of its being at once decided in the negative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the time force itself on the attention of our students so considerably as it does , and should be so highly estimated as it is by the few who continue to it that attention , is no slight evidence of what it might and would effect , were the influences which now act unfavorably upon its usefulness , displaced by others of an opposite character . This change , however , it is not in the power of our colleges alone to make . It must be favored from without . The public mind must awake to its importance , and instead of forcing on our colleges the hard though honorable duty , of risking unpopularity , by continuing to mental science the sanction they still extend to it , must call upon them to add to the weight of that sanction , by raising the study of human nature to its proper place in the scheme of education . And why , we may be allowed to ask , before passing from this topic , why is this branch of education to be confined to the collegiate course ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , a deep interest in its being taught to their members ? All men have to deal with the human mind , to act upon it , and with it . All men alike have powers of their own to cultivate , and propensities of their own to subdue ; all have a circle round them of associates or dependents , on whose minds they ought to exert some influence for good ; all help to form the mind and mould the character of the young , to give a bias to the laws and institutions of their country . Ought not all then to be made partakers of that knowledge , by whose light only these high duties can be rightly discharged . " The proper study of mankind , is man . " Then only , when every member of the community has pursued this study , will our obligation to extend it cease . In thus presenting to those who desire the success of the great efforts at popular improvement , which are now making , the claims of the Philosophy of Human Nature to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every class of men , we do not at all enter the lists as the es // pecial champion of any one of the many more or less clashing theories , which have been broached in regard to it . We take a higher ground . A knowledge of the true analysis of the human mind must be of the utmost utility to every human being . All truth is valuable ; this , most of all . Are we told that this or that system of mental philosophy is not really found thus useful ? Our reply is , not indeed that it is therefore wholly false , but that it is not " the whole truth . " There may he in it , the chances are that there is in every such system which man has ever huilt on any number of observations , however small , something that is true , and therefore useful ; though , from defect in its foundation , that son ) ething may he but little . Our argument is not set aside , even by the assertion that no one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses we bave assigned to the true theory of man . Such an assertion , could it be supported , would lead only to the conclusion that , as a whole , the true philosophy of man is yet in expectation . When discovered , we may he very sure that it will more than verify all the prophecies of the most sanguine of its eulogists . The way to bring about such a discovery , supposing it for the moment not yet made , is not to give ourselves no concern on the subject , and to direct our whole attention to other subjects about which we happen to be better informed , as if this were of no consequence . We must look upon it as therefore only of the greater moment , direct the public mind to it , point it out to the attention of the young , and set them also on the track towards discovering it . By this course we may reasonably hope to find it . But , though this is not the place to enter on an examination of the various theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one over the others , we can not avoid expressing our belief that this process of discovery has not now for the first time to be undertaken . rrrue there are many theories , each supported by some facts and countenanced by some authorities , while truth , on whatever topic , is and must be single . A number of clashing systems can not all be wholly true ; but each may contain some truth , and some rriay present a large preponderance of truth over error . The course of the philosopher will not be to reject them all , but to select from each , to widen in this way his induction of facts , and , as a result , to produce a system which may be wholly true , and which may therefore // bear him out in his applications of it to every one of those objects , which the true philosophy of man is to affect . There is , on this point , not a little popular error . We are too apt to require originality , as we call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of new and unheard of names , the statement of startling paradoxes , the display of fine writing , and of a train of thought too recondite for any of the uninitiated to follow it , were any thing more than an evidence of the still unsettled state of the whole subject . Our mental philosophers must not seek for any such originality , if they mean in earnest to be seekers after truth . The analysis of the mental operations does not require a formidable array of new and tinintelligible names , nor will it lead us to any unintelligible or contradictory results . There is no reason why it should not be brought to the level of every man of ordinary capacity . Perhaps , when it is so presented , such men will wonder at the ease with which they recognise alike its meaning and its truth . The course of many of our philosophers will no doubt have tohe n ) aterially changed before this effect takes place , hut the result itself is not therefore the less certain . We have the analogy which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no reason why a theory of the mind should not be constructed , that shall be , to use the words of the Father of the Inductive Philosophy , " not vague and obscure , but luminous and well-defined , such as nature herself would not refuse to acknowledge . " Let but our philosophers , while they analyse the operations of their own minds with all the minuteness , of which the case can be made to admit , correct their inferences , as drawn from this source alone , so far as may be necessary , by the observation of other minds . Let them reject from their consideration no theory that refers to facts in its support , however foreign it may appear at first sight from their own ideas ; let them take into view all facts which they can collect directly or indirectly bearing on their subject , whether immediately relating to the brute creation or to nan , to the bodily organization or to the mind , to men of this or that rank , age , or nation ; let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to solve questions to which the human mind is unequal , to explain the mysteries of Fatalism or Materialism ; in a word , let them but deal with facts in their department , as other men already do in every other branch of science , and the work is done . The // materials are most of them ready to their hands , and very many of them indeed are already rightly sorted . Mental Philosophy will , of course , long admit of and require additions , just as is the case with the natural sciences . But that is no reason why we should not at once have it made a real and useful science , and admitted as such into our schemes of edu* cation . So much then for the general importance and character which we assign to the study of the mind , and to those ethical and other studies which we consider dependent upon it . We proceed to what is more strictly the object of our present remarks , the nature of that dependence itself , especially as it relates to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The length to which this preliminary matter has been extended must be excused , as almost necessary , in the present disposition of the public mind , to the fair consideration of the question itself . When an engineer , to borrow from an illustration now pretty often used , proposes to run a line of rail-road through a district , there are three distinct processes of inquiry through which in succession he has to pass , before he is prepared to enter on his actual operations . He has first to learn the physical properties of the country , its hills , valleys and rivers , the character of its geology , every fact , in short , connected with his undertaking , as well as the abstract results of his mathematical studies , as the accidental circumstances to which they are to be applied in the case before him . He must then , with this knowledge present to his mind , distinguish the favorable from the unfavorable circumstances , and determine the line which , all things considered , is the best ; in other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his work . His third and last inquiry , relates to the means he is to use for its execution . if his plan be drawn before either his scientific knowledge or his surveys are complete , or if his contracts be made and his workmen employed , before both survey and plan are finished , his procedure will be so far wrong . The case is much the same with the improver of his fellowmen . He seeks to effect a change for the better in the intellectual and moral character of man , as the engineer does in the physical features of a district ; and for this purpose , he must resort to the same succession of measures . The various manifestations of the human mind as at present developed , every // fact which can be made to illustrate and explain them , must be his first object of inquiry . From this he must procedd to the selection of that class of manifestations , which are to be regarded as desirable , and then , and not till then , is he in a condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means by which to render them predominant . This is the natural order of his studies . The material he is to work upon , the model by which he is to work , and the instruments he is to use , must be successively ascertained . His material must determine his model , his material and model together , his instruments . This distinction seems to us to pave the way for a convenient three-fold division of the various sciences which have man directly or indirectly for their subject , and at the same time to suggest the relation which should subsist between them . If , in pursuing this division , we trace Mental Philosophy to one , and Moral Philosophy to another of these classes , we shall at once see how far either can be fairly said to depend on the other . The division , then , which we propose to make , and which , though often not very distinctly kept before the mind by writers on these different sciences , is yet far from new , is simply this . Those branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us a knowledge of its actual phenomena , to answer the question , " What is ? " in regard to it , we call , as they have been commonly called , " physical sciences " ' * ' Those whose object is to lead us to the design of * Some ambiguity has resulted from the common restriction of the term " physical science , " in popular language , to a class of sciences not having man for their subject , geography , natural philosophy , chemistry , &amp;c. , for example . This restriction is however improper . That class of the sciences relating to man , to which we have here extended the term , treats as directly of existing nature , and is therefore as correctly called " physical science , " as that class , to which the name is sometimes exclusively applied . All who have ever attempted to deal in definition on these subjects , have had occasion to echo the complaint of Sir J. Mackintosh , on the inadequacy of their language to furnish them with unexceptionable words for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , " is doomed to use the rudest tools for the most refined purposes . He must reason in words , of which the looseness and inadequacy are suitable , and even agreeable , in the usual intercourse of life , but which are almost as remote from the extreme exactness and precision required , not only in the conveyance , but in the search of truth , as the hammer and the axe would be unfit for the finest exertions of skilful handiwork ; for it is not to be forgotten , that he must , himself , think in these gross words , as unavoidably as he uses them in speaking to others . - He might be moore justly compared to an arithmetician , // human nature , to answer the question , " What ought to be 7 " in regard to it , have been commonly called " the mo*ai sciences , " though from the necessary confusion between the word " moral " thus used in a wide sense , and the more limited sense of the same word when used to denote " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable . We shall here call them " the speculative sciences , " for this reason , as well as from the impression that the term " speculative , " though it may not he precisely what is wanted , yet conveys better than the older word " moral , " their distinctive characteristic . The third class , those whose object is to ascertain the means of bringing into existence that state of things which the second class reveals , to resolve the question , " how that which is , shall be made what it ought to be , " may he styled , as they always have been , " the practical sciences . " The division thus proposed , appears to us , so far as its principle is concerned , an exhausting one . There is no kind of real knowledge on the subject of man , which is not referable to one or another of the classes which it recognises . To those ulterior inquiries as to the " how " or the " why " nature is created as it is , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do not believe the powers of the human mind to he adapted . The attempt to explain , for example , the mode in which organization acts in producing the various forms of vegetable and animal life , or the compatibility of the laws of causation with human freedom and responsibility , has never led , and in the nature of things can never lead to any useful end , to any science , properly so called . Existing objects and phenomena , with their several qualities an ( l relations , form the whole basis of true knowledge . When we have learned , on whatever subject , the existing results of the ordinations of nature , as actually apparent , when we have drawn the line between those that conduce directly to our well-being , and those which do not , and have ascertained the mode of reaping the advantages of the one set without incurring the disadvantages of the other , we have learned all that the Creator designed us , in our present state , to know . To the first class then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerals , not only cumbrous , but used so irregularly to denote different quantities , that they not only often deceive others , but himself . " - View of the Progress of Ethical Philosophy , p. 1 . // actual condition of mankind , bodily and mental , are to be assigned . Anatomy , which proposes to ascertain the seVeral parts of the body , and their varying appearances in different individuals , and physiology , which investigates the l ) heno1*ena of life as they are connected with them , are branches of the physical science which treats of the human body . Mental philosophy is the physical science of the mind . Its object is to collect all facts which bear on mental existence , to learn the modes of thought and feeling of which the mind is capable , the original faculties with which it is endowed , with their various manifestations for good or evil , the principles which determine their action on one another , on the body , and on the external world , and those which regulate the influences of bodily organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sciences which constitute the second class , still keeping in view the division we have laid down , follow on these respectively . Of the phenomena , with which the observation of the human body makes us acquainted , some conduce to the happiness , some to the misery , of man . The bones , which serve in most cases as firm and solid supports , are not unfrequently soft and useless ; con*monly suited in their proportions to the movements which they are to assist , and destitute of sensation , they are frequently disproportioned , and sometimes the seat of excruciating pain . The digestive apparatus in many cases fails to supply nourishment to the rest of the system , and becomes a serious inconvenience to its owner . The nervous system has its deran0ements . In a word , every organ of the body is by turns a source of pain as well as of pleasure . Is this a necessary result of its constitution , or is there not to be drawn a distinction between healthy and diseased action , between the designed and desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some cause or other , it is often found ? If so , what is this normal state of all these organs , now so variously affected ? The answers to these questions constitute that branch of the science of the human body , which is speculative in its character , and for which we have as yet no English name in common use , unless the term " Hygiene* ' be so appropriated . Similar contradictions are to be observed in the roanifestationsof the mental powers , when studied as we have shown the mental philosopher ought to study them . Man has been truly // called an enigma . In one man we see the powers of the understanding equal to almost any amount of observation and reflection , discovering truth and detecting error as if by intuition , while in another xve find them hardly capable of exertion at all . Here we are struck by the perfect taste displayed in the conceptions of the poet or artist , there by the perfect incapacity of the multitude to do them justice ; here by the display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there by the indulgence of absorbing selfishness and revolting irreverence . The powers of the mind , like the organs of the body , produce mingled good and evil . Was this the object of their creation ? Was it designed , that what is believed by one man , should be either not understood or not believed by another , that what is beautiful in this man 's eyes should seem devoid of beauty or perhaps deformed to his neighbor , that what we look upon as our duty to God or man should not be so regarded by those around us ? Or are we to suppose that these opposite results are traceable to any general rules of the Creator 's government , one class of them springing from their being rightly observed , and the other from their being more or less infringed upon ? if so , what are these laws , and what would be the results of perfect obedience to them ? What are the proper sources of human belief , the rules by which we should distinguish truth from error ? What are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration of the beautiful ? And what , again , should be the general state of his dispositions towards his Maker , and towards his fellow-creatures ? The pursuit of these investigations leads us to the speculative sciences which relate to the constitution of the human mind . When we are seeking to learn the proper field of operation designed for the Intellectual Faculties , individually and collectively , that is to say , when we are engaged in the inquiry for the principles which should direct us in the formation of belief , we have entered on one of them . We may here give it the name of Logic , premising , ho**ever , that the sense in which we use the word , is much wider than is really allowed to it in our text-books , which profess indeed generally to explain the principles of reasoning , but mostly confirm e their attention to what is in fact but a trifling fl-action of the whole field beiongin* to their science , - the theory and practice of the Syllogism . The philosophy of Taste is another of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the laws , by which both the understanding and feelings should be guided in their estimate and admiration of ' the beautiful and poetic , whether in art or nature . Moral philosophy is that other science falling into the same class , which treats of the balance that should subsist between the several powers of our intellectual and affective nature , in order to the right cli scharge of our duties to those beings , whatever their relations to ourselves , to whom our states of mind or our outward actions , may have any reference . Setting out with the admission of the existence of conflicting tendencies to action in the human mind , and of the vast variety of views in regard to duty , existing among men , it aims at showing the relations which these several tendencies should bear to each other iii the mental economy , at deciding which of these various views should be adopted as correct . These sciences which we have named , may not perhaps he all that could be referred to this class . We do not here attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt would belong to a work on the subject , rather than to an incidental notice . Our object is to show the position we conceive Moral Philosophy to occupy ; not to offer a classification in some respects new , of other sciences . Logic , or as we might with our definition term it , the philosophy of belief , and the philosophy of taste , we have here referred to , rather in illustration of our views in regard to the philosophy of morals , than with any other design . The third or " practical " division of the , taken in its widest sense ; the examination of all the means which can be employed , to render man , in every respect , both in his bodily and in his mental constitution , what , from our previous inquiries , we conceive he ought to be . These means , of course , are various ; some acting solely on the organs of the body , others designed to affect the mind in one way or another . Education , in this view of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school-keeping . Every influence , the slightest as well as the most powerful , which , from the cradle to the grave , in the nursery , the school-room , the college , or in after-life , may be exerted , no matter by what agent , on the bodily or mental condition , falls under its investigation . It aims not merely , as some would seem to think , at devising the best methods of communicating // information , or of preserving discipline in a school , but at showing bow we may produce tbe perfect and barmoriious developement of all the powers of the body and of the mind ; bow we may put an end alike to the diseases which shorten and embitter life , and to the errors of judgment and of heart which endanger the well-being of the individual and of the community . If these remarks on the respective provinces of mental science , the theory of morals , and the philosophy of mental education , and on the relations consequently subsisting between them , he not wholly erroneous , the estimate xve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful study , is fully borne out by them . He only , as we all admit , can hope to succeed in the training of the body , who has become master of the sciences which teach the structure , functions , and design , of its several parts . He only can be considered perfectly , that is , properly qualified to discharge his duties as a practical educator of the minds of his fellow-men , ( and all men must discharge them , well or ill , from the very fact of their being members of society ) who has become acquainted with the powers of the mind and with the means by which they may all be made conducive to the general good . Is it not time that more should be done to give men generally this knowledge ? We are axvare that by some this statement of the province of Moral Philosophy may seem to be unnecessarily refined upon . What is moral science , they may ask , but the science which teaches us what we ought , and what we ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here meant all that is really comprehended in the idea of a " moral action , " we are ready to adopt the definition ; hut if the word be used , as it most commonly is used , in its popular sense of " doing* ' as distinct from " thinking , " or " intending , " we can not assent to it . Christ 's epitome of the moral law refers to motives wholly . Love to God and man , is its precept ; not mere prayer , or alms-giving . Even the older and less comprehensive epitome , given in the decalogue , has the same reference to the disposition . " honor thy father and thy mother , " and " thou shalt not covet , " are among its injunctions . Virtue is not , as Dr. Paley defined it , simply " the doing good to mankind . " A man may be highly virtuous , and yet not succeed in really doing good in any proportion to his virtue ; or again , he may // happen to be the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all merit , from that fact , the character of a virtuous man . Expedient and inexpedient are the terms we shoul ( l apply to actions , vieweri separately from their motives ; virtue and vice are qualities predicable only of the motives themselves . In common language , to be sure , we speak of virtuous " actions ; " but in all such cases , our idea of the action so designated , if rightly formed , includes within it the intention of the act , as fully as the act itself . In this view of the case , Paley 's definition is doubly in error . " Virtue , " says he , " is the doing good to mankind , in obedience to the will of God , and for the sake of everlasting happiness . " On this principle , the benevolent designs of Howard , wo&amp;ld be declared devoid of the quality of virtue , if either they had failed to do good , or had been prompted by sincere regard to the xvell-being of his fellow-men , rather than by a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been even disinterestedly obedient to the divine will . and bad acted without reference to the reward offered for obedience . Our limits do not allow us here to enter on the discussion of what we deem the true theory of virtue . In general , we look upon the views of Dr. Wayland on this head , as greatly in advance , both in regard to their correctness and to their comprehensiveness , of those expressed by his predecessor , to which we have adverted . They are so , in our view , from the fact , that he has based them so much more directly and completely on the leading principles of the true philosophy of the mind . While on this topic , we may be allowed , without being disposed to censure what we regard as an extremely valuable accession to the library of the moral philosopher , to express our regret that , in one or two instances , Dr. Wayland should have omitted to perceive , how much a little further reference to the same source would have improved his arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , after stating his faith in " a distinct and separate faculty to make us acquainted with the existence of the distinct and separate quality " of moral rectitude , he goes on with the fohiowin remark : " But after all , this question is , to the moral philosopher , of but comparatively little importance . All that is necessary to his investigations , is , that it be admitted , that there is such a quality , // and that men are so constituted as to perceive it , and to be susceptible of certain affections in consequence of that perception . Whetber these facts are accounte ( l for , on the supposition of the existence of a single faculty , or of a combination of faculties , will not affect the question of moral obligation . All that is necessary to the prosecution of the science is , that it be admitted that there is such a quality in actions , and that man is endowed with a constitution capable of bringing him into relation to it . " - p. *34 . Now while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Waylatad that a knowledge of this ultimate fact in the natural I ) iStOry of man , his actual ability to take comizance of the distinction between right and wrong , is all that is " necessary to the prosecution of the science " of morals , we canuct , with him , regard the question as to the existence of one or more faculties to enable him to arrive at this result , as one by any means of " corn l ) aratively little importance . " To the formation of any clear view of the proper balance of the different powers of the mind with reference to the idea ofriglit and wrong , ( and this , as we have said , we regard as the true aim of moral science , ) it is of the utmost consequence that we have a clear conception of what those powers really are in their orioinal a constitution , which are concerned , directly or not , in the production of that idea . Nay , further , to the satisfactory proof of those fundamental doctrines of moral science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought or sentiment having that special object , and the consequent authority of such power in the mind , it is almost , indeed we shotdd be inclined to say , absolutely necessary , that by the researches pursued in the physical department of the science of mind , the power or powers themselves should be distinctly set forth and analysed , and their unity or plurality , their similarity or diversity of function , clearly shown . Thus , to explain our meaning , the doctrine of the " moral sense , " as it is called , is objected to on the score of the non-universality of the feeling which it supposes to be an essential attribute of humanity . It is for the mental pmilosopler to show , that universality is not requisite to the establishment of its existence among the natural instincts of the heart , any more than the universality of sight among men , ts necessary to the proof that man was created with such a sense , or that of the faculties which discern the musical relations of sound , or lead us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the abstract to judge of music , or trace the connexion of cause and effect . The very existence of the words " right " and " wrong , " establishes the natural existence of some power or powers of mind which have relation to them , just as that of the words light " and darkness , ' ' harmony " and " discord , " " cause " and " effect , " proves that man was naturally made to see , to discriminate between sounds , and to pursue abstract reasoning . But again , it is objected , that men 's judgments in the premises differ , that duty with one man is not the same as duty with another . Here , too , the moralist must refer to the results to which the physical science of the mind will lead him . May not what he calls " the moral sense , " be a result of the action of several powers , differing in their separate functions , - of a feeling which simply prompts men to desire justice and to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discern , or seek to discern , those qualities of actions in which their propriety or impropriety consists ? Nay , more , may not this combined result of impulse and reflection , he further modified by other natural impulses of the mind , more or less in particular cases at war with the direct influence of the moral feeling ? If so , he may admit , to the fullest extent of the objector 's wishes , that the strength of men 's moral feelings , and the clearness of their moral perceptions , and the violence and peculiar character of their antagonist dispositions , vary greatly ; that some men have hardly any conscience in their dealings , that others are sadly mistaken in their views of right ; and yet he may insist and prove , that nature no more necessitated or designed these aberrations , than she did the want of sight or understanding in the blind or idiotic . For the sake of the greater clearness and conviction with which we conceive Dr. Wayland could have invested his arguments by such a course , we regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry as to the existence of a moral sense , by entering more minutely into the analysis of its constituent elements . No degree of acquaintance with this analysis of any class of mental phenomena , can be too minute for the guidance of the constructor of a sound and comprehensive theory of Morals . Dr. Wayland has done very much that demands our thanks in this respect . He is himself the man who is capable of doing still more . But we must not forget , that against the whole of this procedure // Dr. Wardlaw 's decided and labored protest is entered , and that our defence of it is not established , unless we ctin show the ground of that protest to he untenable . The position assumed by him , the truth and authority of Scripture , is one which we are as little disposed to question , as he can be himself . To the application which he makes of it in the case before us , we can not by any means assent . We have already , at the outset of our remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as briefly as we can , consider its force , as an argument against the philosophical study of human nature , which we have recommended . Before doing this , we may he allowed to repeat the expression of our belief in and reverence for Scripture , as a comrnunication of truth , moral as well as religious . We are willing to echo all the forms of expression , ( and they are many and varied ) in which our author has in different portions of his work , repeated the declaration of his own faith on this head . We believe it to contain " the only philosophy , " we believe it to communicate " the wisdom of ' the only wise , " ' we desire not to see it " make its obeisance to the chair of human science . " On the contrary , we will quote , and with full approval , when it is accompanied by such a course of investigation as our other author has fearlessly pursued , the sentiment expressed by Dr. Wayland in his preface . " Entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed in the work itself , it is scarcely necessary to add here , that I consider them the great source of moral truth ; and that a system of ethics will be true just in proportion as it developes their meaning . " Still , while making these concessions , and we make them not at all in that spirit of " verbal courtesy , " which Dr. Wardlaw attributes to those who differ from his conclusions , we have something to urge against his tnode of applying them to the case in question , instead of resting satisfied , that truth as drawn from the careful study of the works of God , can only harmonize with that which is by a like process elicited from his word , and thereupon setting himself in good faith , as Dr. Wayland and others have done and as we would have all men do , to develope the analogies which must subsist between the results of these two processes , Dr. Wardlaw prefers to assume , that all who study the works of the Creator , and seek by that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they are willing , in so many words , to bind themselves to depart in no iota from the ideas of other men , as dedmuiced from the mere study of the expressions used in the written law , are seeking to exalt " the dictates of their own sagacity , " above the authority of the written law itself . We are tempted to ask whether our author really regards the discoveries of Newton and his disciples , made by the observation of nature in her other departments , as simply dictates of their sagacity , or whether he is not willing to allow the now e3tablished principles of astronomy , to be the result originally of divine and not of human skill . And if Newton , by the study of the heavenly bodies was enabled to declare " the wisdom of God " in their construction and arrangement , why may not another meet with like success , by taking the same course in regard to another subject ? The " science falsely so called , " whose summary rejeclion by an apostle is insisted on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the christian world to follov , had , indeed , no higher authority than that of human sagacity . It was the " wisdom " in which the Greeks of his day delighted , for which they looked in vain in the simple and pure morality of the Gospel ; and which is not to be found any more in the book of nature by the philosopher , than it is to be traced in the writings of the apostle by the critic . That the student of nature should also be a student of revelation , is true enough ; and it is equally true , that the student of revelation ought to be likewise an inquirer into nature . When the cardinals of the Catholic church declared the doctrine of Galileo in regard to the solar system to be " absurd , philosophically false , and formally heretical , because it is expressly contrary to the holy scripture , " they proved the insufficiency of the mere study of revelation to make men philosophically acquainted with the external universe . Perhaps some of Dr. Wardlaw 's sweeping charges against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like insufficiency of the same means to ensure any philosophical view of the world of mind . Granted , that scripture treats far more directly of mind and its phenomena , than it does of the material world ; granted , that whatever it states on these subjects is , and ever will be , absolutely authoritative : - does it therefore follow , either that it is designed to give us a full and complete account of all that man can profitably know in regard to them , or that , even as far as it goes , it presents to us the facts which it makes known , // in the most systematic form , and in the most philosophical language ? The truth is , that scripture throughout uses the terms in common use at the periods when its several l ) ortions were composed , as well in its statement of facts bearing on the mind , as of those which relate to matter . It was no more its design to unfold the philosophy of man in all its parts , thoroughly , and in precise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform the same task for any other branch of science . Its true object was to reveal to man , what he could not , but by revelation , have learnt with any certainty ; and not at all to dispense with that necessity , which is laid upon him by the whole constitution of the world he lives in , to improve his state and prospects , bodily and mental , by the use of all his powers of mind in acquiring every hind of knowledge of which they are capable . Suppose that , instead of the simple assertions which we find scripture to make , in popular language , of such detached facts and principles respecting the mind and moral truth in general , as were essential to its great design of making known the will of the Creator , a future world , and other mysterious and undiscoverable truths , it had taken the other course , and had attempted to reveal all that man could require to know of himself , and of his duties and interests here , as well as hereafter ; - what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed book to those who were , ( as almost all then were , as too many are even now ) entirely unprepared by their previous knowledge for any such information ? What could it have been , in all ages indeed , but a standing contradiction to the course of divine providence in regard to every other branch of humanly attamable knowledge ? We have no sort of doubt that all the incidental statements which it does make , are in full accordance with what the true philosophy of man , as learnt by observation , has to disclose . And this belief is to our mind only a stronger motive to the faithful and independent study of that philosophy . The harmony of Scripture with itself , the truth and fitness of its representations of man , the force and meaning of its moral precepts , can not be fully seen , until the nature of man and the laws of the universe as they bear upon it , are fully known . We can not here enter on any discussion in detail of the arguments by which Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discussion would lead us too near // the limits of controversial divinity . As to the correctness or incorrectness of the theological views on which they profess to be founded , or the degree of precision with which Dr. Wardlaw has stated them , it is not our intention to say anything . So far as the arguments themselves are urged against the study of mental and moral science , on the same principles and in the same manner with every other science , it is hardly necessary to say that we consider them to fail entirely of their object . Of Dr. Wayland 's work , if we have not spoken so much at length in this article as its merits might seem to require , it is because its eminently systematic and condensed character , preclude all hope of doing justice to it by any analysis or direct criticism , either of the whole or of any detached portions . We have preferred to vindicate the propriety and importance of the study of which it treats , and to offer some remarks on the proper mode of pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce our readers to study the work for themselves , we shall have done them a better service , than we could by any extracts or detached criticisms . As a whole , without making ourselves responsible for every one of its conclusions , we may say that we consider it a highly valuable work , and one likely to do not a little in producing the reform in our course of education , of which we have been endeavoring to urge the necessity . We could have wished to find in it a greater amount of illustration , not only for the sake of giving interest to the work , but also as an essential in some cases to its full comprehension by merely casual readers . The author of such a work , it is to be presumed , will be by far the best illustrator of his own views , and he should not therefore leave the task , in any considerable degree , to others . Future editions , of which we hope there may be many , might be advantageously enlarged in this respect . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been noticing , Dr. Wayland has published an abridgement of it for the use of schools . Of this step we can hardly speak too highly . It is , as we have already stated , more than time that the study of Moral Philosophy should be introduced into all our institutions of education . We are happy to see the way so auspiciously opened for such an introduction . In its general style and illustrations the smaller work appears to us to have been the result of more labor on // the part of the author , than the larger work itself . Indeed , as he himself informs us , it has been " not merely abridged , but also re-written . " We can not but regard the labor as all well bestowed . The difficulty of so choosing our words and examples as to make them intelligible and interesting to the child , is very great . The success with which Dr. Wayland appears to have overcome it , is in the highest degree gratify-. ing . We have no doubt that its circulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains he has taken with it . In conclusion , we may be allowed to express the hope , that the science whose claims we have been considering , may not long continue to labor under the comparative neglect , of which it has been our present task to complain , and that , whenever we may again approach the subject , it may be to express ourselves less in the langua0e of complaint , than our sense of what was required by truth , has compelled us in this instance to adopt.
