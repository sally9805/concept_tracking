txt Civil war in the British North American Provinces ! This event has come upon the people of the United States with something of apparent suddenness and surprise ; and yet , to those who have attentively observed the progress of opinion in the two Canadas , the proceedings of the Assembly of Lower Canada , the discussions on the subject in the British Parliament , and the agitation of the Canadians themselves , the actual collision between the mother country and her colonies has been a matter neither strange nor unexpected . Indeed , if there be any thing remarkable in the fact , it has been , that , situated as the British Provinces are , in close contiguity with the United States , and exposed , as they thus have so long been , to the salutary contagion of democratic institutions and democratic principles , they have been content until this time to remain the subject colonies of Great Britain . While , however , it has been apparent , of late especially , that i VOL. 1 . NO . II . E // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Provinces was at hand , it is right to observe that actual hostilities were precipitated by the violence of the royalist party in Lower Canada . The Canadians were pursuing reform in constitutional modes . Their House of Assembly had again and again presented the grievances of the colony to the notice of the mother country . They had refused , as they lawfully and constitutionally might , to make appropriations for the salaries of the officers of the Crown , unless the reforms , municipal and constitutional , which they deemed essential to the colony , were conceded by Great Britain . They were peacefully organizing themselves , as they had a right to do , for effecfive resistance ,  --  forcible or not , as the case might require ,  --  to any attempt of the Crown to coerce them into an abandonment of the objects of reform which the good of the colony demanded . They were discussing these objects in public meetings and in public journals , as they had full right to do . They were preparing to maintain their rights by force if assailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow . They did not explode the train of revolution . This was done by the persons and the party attached to the mother country , who assaulted individuals of an association called Sons of Liberty , ' - mobbed the printing office , and destroyed the printing materials , of the principal journal of the Canadians , a paper conducted with great spirit and ability , the Vindicator -- arrested and imprisoned many of their number on charges of sedition or treason , and thus drove the Canadians to take up arms , and kindled the flame of civil war in the Province . There can , we are inclined to think , be little doubt , that it was the purpose of the violent loyalists of Montreal , in those steps , to precipitate the outbreak , the near approach of which was self-evident ,  - -  in the belief that the rapidity of action , bravery , and discipline of the regular troops , would probably be able to crush at once the first insurrectionary gatherings , before the depth of the winter should open the communication across the St. Lawrence by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proceeded so far , the mutual feelings of the two parties had reached such a point of exasperation , and the organization of the Canadians , emanating from the central association of the Sons of Liberty , ' in Montreal , was progressing so rapidly , that , in truth , the cour e adopted seemed the only one that afforded a chance of nipping the embryo revolution in the bud . By driving out into overt treason all the leaders ,  --  - whose designs were already scarce half concealed , while they pursued them so skilfully as to keep within the line of personal safety ,  --  it was doubtless supposed that the result would either place their persons within the power of Government , as prisoners* or get rid of them as fugitive exiles . - The immediate crisis was brought on by measures of the British government , adopted in the aim to compel the Canadians to submit // themselves to the will of the mother country , in respect of the questions of right raised by the House of Assembly of Lower Canada . To understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy generally , it is necessary to go back to the former early history of the colony , and trace events down to the present day . Canada , originally a French colony , it is known , came into the possession of Great Britain by conquest , being assured to her by treaty in 1763 , just at the beginning of the controversy between her and the colonies now constituting the United States . The province contained at that time a small population , less than a hundred thousand souls . Being exclusively French , and having for many years been at war , more or less , with the old British Colonies in America , the Canadians did not , at the epoch of the Revolution , sympathize in feeling with the latter ; and , unwilling , perhaps , to incur anew so soon the horrors of war , remained passively submissive to the authority of Great Britain ,  --  governed , without institutions of their own , as a conquered colony . But when the French revolution not long afterwards ensued , *-an event , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadians were likely to be more sensibly affected than by a revolution in the British colonies , though on the same continent ,  --  the British government felt the necessity of anticipating any discontent in Canada by the voluntary concession of institutions , and by other measures which might conspire to secure their allegiance . Accordingly , in 1791 , an act of Parliament was introduced and passed by Mr. Pitt , which is commonly called the Constitutional Act ; ' and by which the colony was divided into two governments , Upper and Lower Canada . The idea was , to organize each after the model of the constitution of Great Britain itself : answering to the King , a Governor ,  --  for the Cabinet , an Executive Council ,  --  for the House of Lords , a Legislative Council ,  --  for the House of Commons , a Representative Assembly . The colony was divided , in order to have that part of it called Upper Canada peopled by emigrants from Great Britain , so as to balance the French colony of Lower Canada . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ; which objections have , in the progress of events , been fully verified . First , it was objected that , by the separation , Upper Canada would be insulated in the interior of the continent , being accessible to maritime commerce only through Lower Canada , or through the United States . Then , it was objected that the theory of the Constitutional Act ' was radically defective , inasmuch as Canada had not , and no American colony could have , an hereditary aristocracy of sufficient number and weight to correspond to the peerage of Great Britain ; and therefore the Legislative Council would either be nugatory , if it did not exercise its functions independently of the Assembly , or on the other hand , if it did , would // become odious to the colony , as the mere instrument of the Crown , by whom its members were appointed . Out of this inherent vice of the Constitutional Act ' a multitude of evils have flowed . As the Canadians grew in numbers and intelligence , they naturally desired to meliorate the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age . But the Legislative Council proved to be a perpetual drawback on all reform ,  --  a standing conservator of every abuse . Thus matters went on , until the war of 1812 , between the United States and Great Britain , at which time , as before in 1774 and 1791 , the government of 0 rent Britain took pains , by politic conciliations , of one sort or another , to enlist the Canadas on their side , and against the natural ally of the Canadians . Since that period , however , the discontents of the Canadians have been gradually growing to a head ; until , in 1833 , the supply bill , passed by the Assembly , was coupled with conditions of the reform of various gross abuses of the colonial administration ; which the Government not consenting to reform , the supply bill was lost . This event was the beginning of the end ; for the next year the House of Assembly set forth solemnly the grievances of the colony , in the celebrated " Ninety-two Resolutions . " This document has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States ; and its great importance at the present time , as a formal exhibition of the claims of the Canadians to redress , will justify us in transferring some of the more material parts of it to our pages . Resolutions of the House of Assembly of Lower Canada , dated Q bec , Friday , 21st February , 1834. 1 . Resolved , That His Majesty 's loyal Subjects , the People of the Province of Lower Canada , have shewn the strongest attachment to the British Empire , of which they are a portion ; that they have repeatedly defended it with courage , in time of war ; that at the period which preceded the Independence of the late British Cob . nies on this Continent , they resisted the appeal made to them by those Colonies to join their confederation . 4 . Resolved , That this House , as representing the People of this Province , has shewn an earnest zeal to advance the general prosperity of the Country , by securing the peace and content of all classes of its Inhabitants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid and durable basis of unity of interest , and equal confidence in the protection of the Mother Country . 6 . Resolved , That in the year 1827 , the great majority of the People of this Province complained , in Petitions signed by 87,000 persons , of serious and numerous abuses which then prevailed , many of which had then existed for a great number of years , and of which the greater part still exist without correction or mitigation. 7 . Resolved , That the complaints aforesaid , and the grievances which gave rise to them , being submitted to the consideration of the Parliament of the United Kingdom , occasioned the appointment of a Committee of the House of Commons , of which the Honorable Edward Geoffrey Stanley , now His Majesty 's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonial Department , and several others who are now Members of His Majesty 's Government , formed part ; and that after a careful investigation , and due // deliberation , the said Committee , on the 18th July , 1828 , came to the following very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had long prevailed in the Canadas , had arisen from serious defects in the system of Laws and the Constitutions established in those Colonies . " 2dly . " That these embarrassments were in great measure to be attributed to the manner in which the existing system had been administered . " *dly . " That they had a complete conviction , that neither the suggestions which they had made , nor any other improvements in the Laws and Constitutions of the Canadas , will be attended with the desired effect , unless an impartial , conciliating , and constitutional system of Government were observed in these loyal and important Colonies . ' 8 . Resolved , That since the period aforesaid , the Constitution of this Province , with its serious defects , has continued to be administered in a manner calculated to multiply the embarrassments and disconteats which have long prevailed ; and that the recommendations of the Committee of the House of Commons have not been followed by effective measures of a nature to produce the desired effect . 9 . Resolved , That the most serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the most active principle of evil and discontent in the Province , the most powerful and most frequent cause of abuses of power ,  --  of the infractions of the Laws ,  - -  of the waste of the public revenue and property , accompanied by impunity to the governing party , and the oppression and consequent resentment of the governed-is that injudicious enactment , the fatal results of which were foretold by the Riaht Hon. Charles James Fox , at the time of its adoption , which invests the Crown with that exorbitant power , ( incompatible with any Government duly balanced and founded on Law and Justice , and not on force and coercion ) of selecting and composing , without any rule or limitation , or any predetermined qualification , an entire Branch of the Legislature , supposed from the nature of its attributions to be independent , but inevitably the servile tool of the authority which creates , composes and decomposes it , and can any day modify it to suit the interests or the passions of the moment . 10 . Resolved , That with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is inseparably connected , and that it has always been so exercised in the selection of the Members of the Legislative Council of this Province , as to favor the spirit of monopoly and despotism in the executive , judicial , and administrative departments of Government , and never in favor of the public interest . 21 . Resolved , That the Legislative Council of this Province , has never been any thing else but an impotent screen between the Governor and the people , which , by enabling the one to maintain a conflict with the other , has served to perpetuate a system of discord and contention ; that it has unceasin*ly acted with avowed hostility to the sentiments of the penple as constitutionally expressed by the House of Assembly ; that it is not right , under the name of a Legislative Council , to impose an aristocracy on a country which contains no natural materials for the composition of such a body ; that the Parliament of the United Kingdom , in granting to His Majesty 's Canadian Subjects the power of revising the Constitution under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal policy , free from all considerations of former interests and of existing prejudices ; and that by this mea*nr equally consistent with a wise and sound policy and with the most liberal and extended views , the Parliament of the United Kingdom would enter into a noble rivalry with the United States of America , would prevent His Majesty 's subjects from seeing any thing to envy there , and would preserve a friendly intercourse between Great Britain and this Province , as her Colony , so long as the tie between us shall continue , and as her Ally whenever the course of events may change our relative position . 37 . Resolved , That the political world in Europe is at this moment agitated by two great parties , who in different countries appear under the several names of Serviles , Royalists , Tories , and Conservatives , on the one side , and of Liberals , Constitutionals , Republicans , Whigs , Reformers , Radicals , and similar appellations on the other ; // that the former party is , on this continent , without any weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters , and from a trifling number of persons who become their dependents for the sake of personal gain , and of others who from age or habit cling to opinions which are not partaken by any numerous class ; while the second party over reads all America ; and that the Colonial Secretary is mistaken , if he believes that the exclusion of a few s laried Officers from the Legislative Council could suffice to make it rmonize with the wants , wishes , and opinions of the People , as long as the Colonial Governors retain the power of preservin0 in it a majority of Members rendered servile by their antipathy to every liberal idea . 41 . Resolved , That His Majesty 's Secretary of State for the Colonial Department has acknowledged in his Despatches , that it has frequently been admitted that the People of Canada ought to see nothing in the Institutions of the neighboring States which they could regard with envy , and that he has yet to learn that any such feel .. ing now exists among His Majesty 's subjects in Canada : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States have a form of Government very fit to prevent abuses of power , and very effective in repressin* , them : that the reverse of this order of things has always prevailed in Canada under the present form of Government : that there exists in the nei*hbourin0 States a stronger and more general attachment to the national institutions , than in any other country ; and that there exists also , in those States a guarantee for the progressive advance of their political institutions towards perfection , in the revision of the same at short and determinate intervals , by con ' ventions of the People , in order that they may , without any sock or violence , be adapted to the actual state of things . 44 . Resolved , That the unanimous consent with which all the American States have adopted and extended thy Elective system , shews that it is adapted to the wishes manners and social tate of the Inhabitants of this Continent ; that this system prevails among those of British and those of Spanish origin , althou , , h the latter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the calamitous yoke of ignorance and absolutism ; d that we do not hesitate to ask from a Prince of the House of Brunswick , and a reformed Parliament , all the freedom and political powers which the Princes of the House of Stuart and their Parliaments granted to the most favored of the Plantations formed at a period when such arants asust have been less favorably retarded than they would now be . 47 . Resolved , That the fidelity of the People and the protection of the Government are correlative obligations , of which the one can not ba , , subsist without the other ; that , by reason of the defects which exist in the Laws and Constitution of this Province , and of the manner in which those Laws and that Constitution have been administered , the People of this Province are not sufficiently protected in their lives , their property and their honor ; and the Ion , , series of acts of inju ice and oppressson of which th y have to complain , have increased with alarming rapidity in violence and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That it was anciently the practice of the house of Commons , to withhold supplies until grieva ces were redressed ; and that in following this course in the present conjuncture , we arc warranted in our proceedings , as well by the inns approved precedents a by the spirit of the Constitution itself . 75 . Resolved , That the nu er of the Inhabitants of the country being about 600,000 , those of Fre ch ori , , in are about 555,000 , and those of British or other origin 75,000 ; and that the establishment of the Civil Government of Lower Canada , for the year 1832 , accordin , , to the yearly Returns made by the Provincial Adosinistration , for t infonnation of the British Parliament contained the ames of 157 Officers and others receiving Salaries , who are apparently of British or Forei , , n origin7 and the names of 47 who are , apparently , natives of the country , of French origin ; that this statement does not exhibit the whole disproportion which exists in the distribution of the public money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices , and most frequently only obtaining even them , by becoming the dependent of those who hold the higher and the more // lucrative offices ; that the accumulation of many of the best paid and most influential , and at the same time incompatible , offices in the same person , which is forbidden by the laws and by sound policy , exists especially for the benefit of the former class ; and that two-thirds of the persons included in the h st commission of the peace issued in the province , are apparently of British or foreign origin , and one-third only of French origin . 84 . Resolved , That besides the grievances and abuses beforementioned , there exist in this province a great number of others , ( a part of which existed before the commencement of the present Administration , which has maintained them , and is the author of a portion of them ) with rega d to which this house reserves to itself the right of complaining and demanding reparation , and the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumerated here : that this House points out as mong that number : 5thly . The intermeddling of members of the Le*islative Council in the elections of the representatives of the people , for the purpose of influencing and controlling them by force ; and the selection frequently made of returnin5 officers for the purpose of securin5 the seine partial and corrupt ends ;  --  the interference of the present Governor-in-chief himself in the said elections ; his approval of the intermeddlin* of the said Legislative councillors in the said elections ; the partiality with which he intervened i * the Judicial proceedings con ected with the said elections , for the purpose of influencing the said proceedings in a manner favorable to the Military power , and contrary to the independency of the Judicial Power ; and the applause which , as - commander of the forces , he bestowed upon the sanguinary execution of the citizens *y the soldiery . 6thly . The interference of the armed military force at such elections , through which three peace . bie citizens , whose exertions were necessary to the support of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election , were shot dead in the streets : the applause bestowed by the Governor-in-chief and commander of the forces are the authors of this sanguinary military execution ( who had not been acquitted by a petty jury ) for the firmness and discipline displayed by them on that occasion . We have selected only a part of these Resolution* , because of the great number and length of the whole ; but what we have given will *sufficiently illustrate the nature of the grievances of which the Canadians complained . In consequence of these and other proceedings , commissioners were sent from Great Britain to investigate the affairs of Canada on The spot ; which commissioners at length made report , in accordance , of course , with the instructions and wishes of the Government by which they were employed ,  --  the Canadian House of Assembly continuing to refuse the supplies ,  --  and - on the 0th of March , 1837 , Lord John Rustsell introduced into the House of Commons the following resolutions , by way of answer to , and decision upon , the complaints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of October , in the year 183 ' 2 , no provision has been made by the Le*islature of the Province of Lower Canada for defraying the charges of the administration of justice , and for the support of the civil government , within The said Provi ce ; and that there will , on the 10th day of April now next ensuing be required f defraying in full the vharges aforesaid to that day , the sum of 142,1601 . Us. 6d. 2 . That at a session of the Le , islature of Lower Canada , holden at the city of quebec , in the said ProVince , in the months of September and 0 ober , 1836 , the Governor of the said Provinces in co pliance with his Majesty 's commands , // recommended to the attention of the House of Assembly thereof ' , the estimates for the current year , and also the accounts , showing the amount due in respect of the civil government , and signified to the said House his Majesty 's confidence that they would accede to the application which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arrears due on account of the public service , and for the funds necessary to carry on the civil government of the Province . 3 . That the said House of Assembly , on the 3d day of October , 1836 , by an address to the Governor of the said Province , declined to vote a supply for the purposes aforesaid , and by the said address , after referring to a former address of the said House to the Governor of the said Province , declared that the said House persisted , amongst other things , in the demand of an elective Legislative Council , and in demanding the repeal of a certain Act , passed by the Parliament of the United King- A dom , in favor of the North American Land Company ; and , by the said address , the said House of Assembly further adverted to the demand made bythat House of the free exercise of its control over all the branches of the Executive Government ; and by the said address the said House of Assembly further declared , that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjourn their deliberations until his Majesty 's Government should , by its acts , especially by rendering the second branch *f the Legislature conformable to the wishes and wants of the people , have commenced the great work of justice and reform , and created a confidence , which alone could crown it with success . 4 . That in the existing state of Lower Canada , it is unadvisable to make the Legislative Council of that Province an elective body ; but that it is expedient that measures be adopted for securing to that branch of the Legislature a greater degree of public confidence . 5 . That while it is expedient to improve the composition of the Executive Council in Lower Canada , it is unadvisable to subject it to the responsibility demanded by the House of Assembly of that Province . 6 . That the legal title of the North American Land Company to the land holden by the said company by virtue of a grant from his Majesty , under the public seal of the said Province , and to the privileges conferred on the said company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth year of his Majesty 's reign , ought to be maintained inviolate. 7 . ( Relates to The Canada Tenure Act , ' and The Canada Trades Act . ' ) 8 . That for defraying the arrears due on account of the established and customary charges of the administration of justice , and of the civil government of the said Province , it is expedient , that , after applying for that purpose such balance as shall , on the said 10th day of April , 1837 , be in in the hands of the Receiver General ofthe said Province , arising from his Majesty 's hereditary , territorial and casual revenue , the Governor of the said Province be empowered to issue from and out of any other part of his Majesty 's revenue , in the hands of the Receiver General of the said Province , such further sums as shall be necessary to effect the payment of the before-mentioned sum of 142,1601. 14s. &amp;d. 9 . That it is expedient that his Majesty be authorized to place at the disposal of the Legislature of the said Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' *ri-itorial and casual revenue arising within the same , in case the said Legislature shall see fit to grant to his Majesty a civil list for defraying the necessary charges of the administration of justice , and for the maintenance and unavoidable expenses of certain of the principal officers of the civil government of the said Province . 10 . ( Relates to the trade between Lower Canada and Upper Canada . ) These resolutions , were introduced by Lord John Russell , in a speech which betrays throughout a halting between two opinions ; a reluctance to drive things in Canada to the last resort , and a conviction that still matters were evidently and irresistibly tending thither . Indeed , Lord Stanley , in the subsequent debates , very // justly characterized the resolutions as too weak for coercion , and too strong for conciliation . The Ministers were warned by the opposition that this was the old question between the thirteen colonies and the mother country ; that things had been going on in the same train in Lower Canada now , as in Massachusetts Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and act by , in the history of the thirteen colonies , for any public contingency of her own case ; that , in general , a populous and powerful colony could not be retained by Great Britain , without the consent of the colony itself ; that especially the Canadas could not , being in the vicinity of the United States , imbued with democratic opinions by contact with a democratic people , and sure of being able to draw resources from , and find refuge in , the America n republic ; and that the Ministers had but one course to pursue ,  --  to grant at once the reforms prayed for by the House of Assembly of Lower Canada . Accordingly , Mr. Leader moved , as a test question , by way of amendment of Lord John Russell 's motion ,  --  ' that it is advisable to make the Legislative Council of that Province an elective council . ' The main position upon which Lord John Russell rested the resolutions , was , that the ministers of Great Britain could not conduct the affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which simply means , of course , that an elective legislative council would , naturally , be in the interests of the colony ,  --  while the Legislative Council , as at present constituted , of nominees of the Crown , was subservient to the interests of Great Britain , as adversary to those of the colony . Indeed , he expressly says : - I do not suppose that these colonies will persist in their demands ; but , if they do still hold out , we have not the means of carrying on the government of them here , in continual resistance to their assemblies . ' Mr. O'Connell , Mr. Leader , Mr. Roebuck , and others , very justly replied You can not hold the Canadas at any rate , if you adopt and act upon these resolutions ,  --  perhaps you may , if you grant their demands ; but to undertake to coerce them is , of itself , to make sure of their separation from the mother country . ' However , the Ministers persisted , and the resolutions were , from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important of them , passed in the House of Commons , by decisive majorities ,  --  being finally disposed of in that body on the 24th of April . On the 9th day of May , the resolutions were taken up in the House of Lords , discussed and passed ,  --  being opposed only by Lord Brougham , who , in addition to speaking against them , entered the following protest on the journal of the Lords . Dissentient ,  --  1 . Because these resolutions , embracing a great variety of important subjects , upon which different opinions may be entertained by the same persons , were all passed to the vote as once , in a House of not a tenth part of the members that frequently attend when questions affecting the interests of political parties or *even individuals stand for discussion . // 2 . Because , though some of these resolutions are justifiable , there are others , and especially the eighth , which set all considerations of sound policy , of generosity . and justice , at defiance , and will most likely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the Executive Government may at any time and for any cause show itself in any portion of North American provinces . 3 . Because it is the fundamental principle of the British Constitution which was intended to be established in Canada by the act of 1791 ,  --  and was finally promulgated in 1831 , that no part of the taxes levied upon the people shall he applied to any purpose whatever without the consent of their Representatives in Parliament ; and this control ought in an especial manner to be vested in the people of the Colonies , seeing that it never can give them the same unlimited influence which it confers on the people of the parent State ; for , if supplies are withheld by the Commons of England on account of grievance , the Crown has no other resource , and the grievance must be redressed ; whereas , if the Commons withhold supplies for the like reasons , the Crown can not by this proceeding be obliged to redress the grievance as long as the Parliament of the mother country is willing to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the money placed by the British Parliament at the disposal of the Colonial Councils , without their consent , is wholly suhversive of the above-named fundamental principle , and directly contrary to the wise and salutary provisions of the act passed in 1831 ; - nor does it at all si*nify that this is said croly to be done upon the present occasion , and that the rights of the Colonial Parliament are represented as left unimpaired . The precedent of 1837 will ever after be cited in support of such oppressive proceedings as often as the Commons of any Colony may withhold supplies ; how justifiable soever their refusal may be , or in whatever designs the Executive Government may be engaged . 5 . Because the constitution of the Council , having been tried for nearly half a century , has not only failed to produce the advantages expected from it , but , after occasioning the most serious evils , has ended in bringing the Le*islative operations of the QAonial Parliament to a close ; and there seems good ground to hope the evils now er*mplained of may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this body , under due modifications . But the 4th resolution seems to pledge Parliament against ever introducing that principle , since it is not possible to conceive any circumstance justifying its introduction if the existing state of things does not . 6 . Because the spirit in which these proceedings were conceived is avowedly adverse to the opinions and desires of a vast majority of the inhabitants of Lower Canada , and the no less plainly avowed object in bringing them forward is , by the authoritative declaration of Parliament to put down the principles and thwart the inclination so generally prevailing among the people of that Province . 7 . Because these proceedings , so closely resembling the fatal measures that severed the United States from Great Britain , have their origin in principles , and derive their support from reasonin* , s , which form a prodigious contrast to the whole grounds , and the only defence , of the policy during later years so justly and so wisely sanctioned by the Imperial Parliament , in administerina the affairs of the mother country . Nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American or the European branches of the Empire should contemplate so stran e a contrast without drawing inferences thereform discreditable to the character of the Legislature , and injurious to the future welfare of the State , when they mark with what different measures we mete to 600,000 inhabitants of a remote province unrepresented in Parliament , and to 6,000,000 of our fellow-citizens nearer home , and maltin* themselves heard by their Representatives , the reflection will surely arise in Canada , and may possibly find its way into Ireland , that the sacred rules ofjustice , the most worthy feelings of national generosity , and the soundest principles of enlightened policy may be appealed to in vain , if the demand of the suitor be not also supported by personal interests and party views , and political fears among those whose aid he seeks , while all men , perceiving that many persons have found themselves at liberty to hold a course towards an important but remote Province , which their constituents never would suffer to be // pursued towards the *viost inconsiderable borough of the United Kingdom , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colonial dominion , that the people can never safely entrust the powers of Government to any supreme authority not residing amongst themselves . BROUGHAM . Our readers can now judge for themselves what are the merits of this great controversy between Great Britain and the Canadas . We say the Canadas , because , though Lower Canada has been foremost in the dispute , and though it was upon the resolutions of the Assenv. bly of Lower Canada that parliament acted , and though the British party is much stronger in Upper than in Lower Canada , yet the public question is the same in both , and the one must follow the fate of the other , so far as regards their ultimate relation to Great Britain . Our readers , we repeat , can judge for themselves , as to the merits of the question ,  --  but there are two or three points in it , which we desire to present in relief from the others . First , it must be admitted , that the Canadians have had ample cause of complaint ; grievances enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should obtain it . The ministers of the Crown confessed this in the very resolutions they offered ; Parliament confessed it ; and it is a fact undeniable upon the record ; proved by authentic state papers , of which we have given some idea in the preceding pages . Secondly , those grievances were of a kind which seem to be of the very essence of a colonial government . The remoteness of an American colony from its European metropolis ; the diverse and contrariant interest which of necessity grew up in such a case ; the fact of being governed by officers , civil and military , sent from a foreign country-these , and a multitude of other considerations , which the colonial history of the United States renders familiar to all , tend to show that a colony on this continent , when it arrives at maturity , and acquires the feelings of self-respect belonging to maturity , can not be satisfactorily governed , or well governed , by a Colonial Secretary in Europe . Lord John Russell might well say , that he and his colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its House of Assembly . Certainly he could not govern it under such circumstances , without the performance of acts , which , as properly averred by Lord Brougham , if applied to the internal administration of England itself , would be denounced and resisted , as tyrannical in principle and insupportable in fact . Thirdly , it is the right of every people , which possesses the hiclination and physical power , to remodel and reform its institutions at will . This is the fundamental principle of the institutions of the United States , and can not be denied or controverted , without impeachment of the wisdom and virtue of our fathers of the Revolution , nor without the renunciation of every thing which is peculiar or // valuable in the constitutions , whether of the United States , or of the individual States . It is a right , which belongs to every people ; and it belongs to a European colony in America , not less , but more , than to any other description of people . The Canadians have all these grounds of right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such form as may best promote their own happiness ; and they have another , which is equally sacred ,  --  they are a conquered people . Great Britain acquired her dominion over them by force ; they do not owe allegiance to her as an original colony of hers ; and surely , if there be any case in which a people may of right throw off the authority of those who govern them , it is when these last are foreign conquerors ; and which is the precise relation of Great Britain to the Canadas . We do not propose to look at this question in any bearings which it may be presumed to have upon supposed interests of our own . Our aim has rather been to consider it as a question of political right . We look with solicitude , personally , to the issue of the event , because the triumph of the people will be a triumph of liberty - of democratic principle-of the right of self-government ; but at all events , it must be the duty , and of course the determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid any compromise of its neutrality , by taking sides either with the colonies against Great Britain , or of Great Britain against the colonies . On a calm view of the whole subject , no one can , it appears to us , entertain the preposterous idea of the possibility of the continuance of the colonial relation between the Canadas and Great Britain . It is utterly contrary to the spirit of the age . Thank God , the period of force , of armed violence , is passing away from the world , at least , from those countries enlightened and liberalized ,  --  as England has been preeminently ,  --  - by the influence of the genius of Commerce . The idea of an armed struggle for dominion over a powerful colony , by England , at this day , is too absurd . A large proportion of the party now in the ascendency in that country , has long been utterly opposed to the whole system of foreign and colonial policy , maintained by England under the auspices of those anti-liberal principles which are now fast passing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the Canadas desire to be free ,  - -  to govern themselves on the pure representative principles of which they have so glorious a model perpetually before their eyes ; and they are so unreasonable as not to feel contented to go down to the sea shore* to greet rulers sent to them from across an ocean three thousand miles wide ! It is enough . They must become free whenever they will it . The question is of no importance to us . There is nothing to be desired by us in the prospective annexation of the Canadas to our Union . That event may happen ,  --  or those provinces may maintain // a friendly independence . We have no material objection to the English neighbourhood . Any serious disturbance of friendly relations between the two commercial sister countries , Great Britain and our Union , is an event not less impossible , now , or hereafter , than it would be to roll back the lapse of time , and resuscitate the passed and buried centuries . Nor is there any thing to be either desired or deprecated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the St. Lawrence . It could not influence , in the slightest degree , either our safety or prosperity . Nor would there be any benefit to them in a participation in our federal union ,  --  - at least no greater benefit than would attend a sovereign independence , provided they should follow , which would doubtless be the case , our great principles of republican freedom at home , and peaceful commerce abroad . And yet we are not haunted with that idea , which we hear so frequently expressed , of the danger of extending our already overgrown territorial limits . ' This is one of those false ideas which has been bequeathed to us by the Past ,  --  that Past which was terminated when the American experiment first dawned upon the world as the commencement of a new era . That idea is evidently correlative to the one of strong central governmental action . A strong central government can not , indeed , maintain the cohesion of extended territories , of diversified peculiar interests , beyond certain limits . They follow the mathematical law of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverse proportion to the square of the distance ; beyond a certain circular limit it must be inoperative , except by such convulsive effort as must derange and disorganize the whole system . Such a territorial dominion , is then overgrown ' and unmanageable . But those terms can have no proper applicability to a federal republican system , on the principle of diffusion of power on which ours is based . The peculiar characteristic of our system ,  --  the distinctive evidence of its divine origin ( that is to say , its foundation on those original principles of natural right and truth , implanted by the Creator , as the first moral elements of human nature ) - is , that it may , if its theory is maintained pure in practice , be extended , with equal safety and efficiency , over any indefinite number of millions of population and territory . In such a federative system ,  --  in which every individual portion is left free to its own self-government , and to the cultivation of its own peculiar interests , with the sole restriction , of respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection of a federal union , of strictly defined powers , to give some degree of uniform national organization to the whole mass , in its relations with foreign powers ,  - -  every part has an equal interest in the maintainance of the system , and its great principles . The vitality is not forcibly propelled from the centre to the extremities , but is diffused equally throughout all the parts ; and it is only necessary for the latter to contribute a suf // 218 The Canada Question . ficient degree of the vital energy towards the centre to keep alive the general unity of the national body . Such a system is , from its nature ,  --  if its great principles are only preserved sound and pure ,  - -  as applicable on a large scale as on a small one ; and we can see no reason why , at some future day , our experiment ' should not be in successful operation over the whole North American continent , from the isthmus to the pole . Yet in this supposed gradual extension of the federal union ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the benefit of every successive accession enures not to the main body , but to the new member added ; the former has no interest in it . The natural distrust of the future and the unknown , however clear probabilities may seem , might make it rather the part of prudence to decline the accession which can not add any material benefit , and may , possibly , do harm . In discussing freely , therefore , the question of the relations between the Canadas and the mother country , we shall not be suspected of a hankering after an extension of our own territory . We look upon the subject only in the light of general principles ,  - -  and may , without impropriety , and without violating the spirit of perfect neutrality , express ourselves with entire freedom upon it . No American , sincerely and understandingly imbued with American principles , can refrain from feeling a deep sympathy in a cause so closely analogous with that of our own Revolution ;  --  and feeling , there can exist no consideration to check the free expression of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in the contest , whether by individuals or bodies of men , to be highly improper , and equally a violation of our national neutrality ( which the individual citizen is as much bound to hold sacred as the organized government ) and inconsistent with a philosophical view of the principles involved . If the Canadian people will to be free from their dependence on a foreign country , they have but to arise in their strength of mass and say so ; - they need no assistance of money or volunteers from us . If it is not the will of the people ,  --  or if that will is not sufficiently strong to carry them through the ordeal of revolntion ,  --  we ought not yet to desire it . In neither case ought we to exert any other interference , than that moral influence of sympathy and approbation , of which no hum*in power can rightfully restrain the expression . This has been freely done on many former occasions-witness the struggles for freedom of the Greeks , the Poles , or , still more applicably , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New World . We shall not , of course , be understood as comparing the British dominion over the Canadian colonies , to the illiberal and brutal tyranny against which the rights of man were struggling for emancipation in those cases ; yet that does not touch the question . If freedom is the best of national blessings , if self-government is the first of national rights , // and if the fostering protection ' of a paternal government ' is in reality the worst of national evils-in a word , if all our American ideas and feelings , so ardently cherished and proudly maintained , are not worse than a delusion and a mockery-then are we bound to sympathize with the cause of the Canadian rebellion , with the most earnest hope that success may , with as little effusion of blood as possible-why should it flow !  - -  crown it as a Revolution . What may be the immediate issue of the contest , none can presume to prophecy . But even though the present unprepared rising should be crushed , it is evident that the flat of separation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretching wider every day , can never again be closed and cemented . Least of all can it be rationally expected , that the fire and sword , as they are reported ( we hope without truth ) to have been tried at St. Charles , can effect that object . The end is at hand ; and it would far better become the noble nation which would itself be the first to dare and sacrifice all in such a struggle , to resign at once , with magnanimity and mercy , an unnatural dominion which it will cost seas of human blood to attempt to retain . In fact , we look with not less deep interest to the news from England , than to the events of the contest in the Provinces . May she be true to her own best interests and highest glory ! But one more remark in connection with this subject . One of the signs of the times , ' which must strike foreigners , and even liberal members of the anti.popular party among ourselves with surprise , is the disposition which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presses , of the United States , to frown upon the infant revolution  --  to disparage the efforts of the Canadians , and the character and principles of the able and respectable men , who , like the Otises , the Adams , the Henrys , and the Franklins of our own Revolution , happen to be placed , by their patriotism , and the confidence of their countrymen , in the front of affairs , as the auspicious champions of the cause of liberty and independence ,  --  and this in the United States ,  --  a government founded on colonial revolution , and of which the vital principle is , the right of every people to have such form of government , and such governors , as it may in its supreme discretion choose ! But there is nothing in it that excites our surprise . There has always existed among us a party , respectable in numbers as well as in wealth and education , entertaining an inveterate distrust of , and dislike to , the people and popular principles . And here recurs the broad line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every question that arises . We might point to several leading Whig papers , whose sympathies in every case arising , involving a collision between popular and antipopular principles , in the affairs of foreign nations , flow , invariably because naturally , in behalf of the latter . It is in fact one of the best tests to apply to the professed republicanism of Americans ,  --  . // to ascertain whether it is a sound and pure principle , understandingly believed , and feelingly cherished ,  --  to put them on foreign ground , and observe the side , in the struggles of the two causes there perpetually in progress , their sympathies incline to . This is a test which does not often fail . We by no means intend to apply this reproach to the whole Whig party , or its entire Press . Far from it . There are many variations in degree in the anti-popular bias of sentiment which is , as a whole , their general characteristic ; and a large proportion of them are soundly democratic at heart , if they but knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration from adventitious causes , and by deceptive appeals to the very principles which ought to make them its earnest supporters . With respect to the Canadians , we are glad to say , that the number of the papers from which they have to experience this illiberality , is comparatively small . As a whole the people of the Union manifest a warm interest in their cause . We are bound , morally bound , to sympathize , in this , as in every other question , with that party which has the weight of natural justice on its side . And as Americans , as the citizens of a country elevated to greatness by virtue of the very claims to self-government which the Canadians assert , it is impossible to repress the emotion of candid good will towards them , and of ardent aspirations for the honorable success of this new family of worshippers at the holy Shrine of Liberty.
