Scene  --  Germany . A Masked Ball . Madelon and a Stranger , in a deep recess . MADELON . MADELON . Why hast thou led me here ? My friends may deem it strange , unmaidenly , This lonely converse with an unknown mask . Yet in thy voice there is a thrilling power That makes me love to linger ! It is like The tone of one far distant  --  only his Was gayer and more soft . STRANGER . STRANGER . Sweet Madelon ! Say thou wilt smile upon the passionate love That thou alone canst waken ! Let me hope ! MADELON . MADELON . Hush ! hush ! I may not hear thee . Know'st thou not I am betrothed ? STRANGER . STRANGER . Alas ! too well I know ! But I could tell thee such a tale of him  --  Thine early love  --  ' t would fire those timid eyes With lightning pride and anger ,  --  curl that lip , That gentle lip , to passionate contempt For man 's light falsehood ! Even now he bends  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , In fond affection . Even now his heart  --  MADELON . MADELON . Doth my eye flash ? doth my lip curl with scorn ?  --  ' T is scorn of thee , thou perjured stranger ! not  --  Oh ! not of him , the generous and the true ! Hast thou e'er seen my Rupert ? hast thou met Those proud and fearless eyes , that never quailed , As Falsehood quails , before another 's glance  --  As thine even now are shrinking from mine own  --  The spirit-beauty of that open brow  --  The noble head  --  the free and gallant step  --  The lofty mien , whose majesty is won From inborn honour ,  --  Hast thou seen all this ? And darest thou speak of faithlessness and him In the same idle breath ? Thou little know'st The strong confiding of a woman 's heart , When woman loves  --  as I do ! Speak no more ! STRANGER . STRANGER . Deluded girl !  --  I tell thee he is false  --  False as yon fleeting cloud ! MADELON . MADELON . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind less wayward than his heart ! MADELON . MADELON . The forest oak less firm ! He loved me not For the frail rose hues and the fleeting light Of youthful loveliness !  --  Ah ! many a cheek , Of softer bloom , and many a dazzling eye , More rich than mine , may win my wanderer 's gaze ! He loved me for my love  --  the deep , the fond ! For my unfaltering truth  --  he can not find , Rove where he will , a heart that beats for him With such intense , absorbing tenderness  --  Such idolizing constancy as mine ! Why should he change then ?  --  I am still the same STRANGER . STRANGER . Sweet infidel ! wilt thou have ruder proof ? Rememberest thou a little golden case Thy Rupert wore , in which a gem was shrined ?  --  A gem I would not barter for a world !  --  An angel face !  --  its sunny wealth of hair In radiant ripples bathed the graceful throat And dimpled shoulders ,  --  round the rosy curve Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While in the depths of azure fire that gleamed Beneath the drooping lashes , slept a world Of eloquent meaning  --  passionate , but pure !  --  Dreamy , subdued ,  --  but oh ! how beautiful !  --  A look of timid , pleading tenderness , That should have been a talisman to charm His restless heart for aye ! Rememberest thou ? MADELON MADELON ( impatiently . ) I do  --  I do remember ! ' t was my own ! He prized it as his life  --  I gave it him ! What of it ? speak ! STRANGER STRANGER ( shewing the miniature . ) Lady , behold that gift ! MADELON MADELON ( clasping her hands . ) Merciful heaven ! Is my Rupert dead ? ( After a pause , during which she seems overwhelmed in agony . ) How died he ?  --  when ? Oh ! thou wert by his side In that last hour  --  and I was far away ! My blessed love ! Give me that token !  --  speak ! What message sent he to his Madelon ? STRANGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is not dead , dear lady ! grieve not thus ! MADELON . MADELON . He is not false , sir stranger ! STRANGER . STRANGER . For thy sake , Would he were worthier ! One other proof I 'll give thee , loveliest ! if thou lov'st him still , I 'll not believe thee woman ! Listen then ! A faithful lover breathes not of his bliss To other ears .  --  Wilt hear a fable , lady ?  --  Softly from heaven the starlight fell , And trembled in the playful wave ; Faintly the far-off vesper bell Its wild and mournful music gave ! With frolic feet , and floating hair That glistened in the radiant air , A maiden sought the river 's side ; The white sands beamed beneath her tread , And smiled beyond the baffled tide , That murmuring and receding fled . Their silvery sparkle caught her eye ,  --  Smooth was their tempting sheen and dry ; The summer evening still and warm ; The maiden weary ;  --  on the sand She lightly laid her fairy form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she leaned , her lovely hair Fell o'er a forehead pure and fair ,  --  Shaded her drooping eyes of blue ,  --  Swept her soft cheek 's transparent hue ,  --  And trembled , like a glossy wreath Of gold , upon the ground beneath ! That dreaming maiden did not hear The swift , light footstep , stealing near ; She did not see the knee that bent Beside her softly , as she leant ! With faltering finger , in the sand She traced a single word , and then She blushed , and passed her pretty hand Across it , and began again ;  --  " Rupert " she wrote  --  nay start not so ! Fair lady ! why that sudden glow ? Once more she traced the name  --  and lo ! Beside it , as by magic , shone Another !  --  it was " Madelon ! " The maiden turned , confused , distressed ,  --  Her Rupert clasped her to his breast !  --  While fond and warm , the impassioned boy Revealed his love , his hope , his joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumult softly came ; And trembled in her timid eye The tear of maiden-modesty ! But Rupert kissed away the tear , And Rupert soothed her bashful fear : And ere the vesper hymn was done , A plighted maid was Madelon ! Lady ! my task is o'er  --  dost doubt me still ? MADELON . MADELON . Doubt thee , my Rupert !  --  ah ! I know thee now ! Fling by that hateful mask !  --  let me unclasp it ! No ! thou wouldst not betray thy Madelon ! ( Takes off his Mask . ) RUPERT . RUPERT . Come to my heart ! my faithful ! my adored ! Oh ! guileless , constant , true as heaven itself , Must be the breast wherein dwells trust so pure ! MADELON . MADELON . And didst thou think to shake my faith in thee By idle tales like these ? Yet it was wrong , A cruel mockery , Rupert ! Woman 's love Is far too tender and too soft a flower To be so played with !  --  Ah ! we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why was this ? RUPERT . RUPERT . Forgive me , Madelon !  --  ' t was but to try Thy strength . In my long wanderings I have heard So much of woman 's fickleness , and seen So much of evil  --  nay ! of ruin , wrought By woman 's causeless jealousy !  --  But thou  --  Oh ! thou hast been a bright and holy proof That only in the heart too prone itself To stray from truth , doth dark suspicion dwell ! I bless thee then , my noble Madelon ! For thy deep love , and thy unconquered trust !
