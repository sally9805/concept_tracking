txt There is nothing in which the Moderns surpass the Ancients more conspicuously than in their noble provisions for the relief of indigence and distress . The public policy of the Ancients seems to have embraced only whatever might promote the aggrandizement or the direct prosperity of the state , and to have cared little for those unfortunate beings , who from disease or incapacity of any kind , were disqualified from contributing to this . The beneficent influence of Christianity , however , combined with the general tendency of our social institutions , has led to the recognition of rights in the individual as sacred as those of the community , and has suggested manifold provisions for personal comfort and happiness . The spirit of benevolence , thus widely , and oftentimes judiciously exerted , continued until a very recent period , however , strangely insensible to the claims of a large class of objects , to whom nature , and no misconduct or imprudence of their own , as is too often the case with the subjects of public , charity , had denied some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the close of the last century , have been provided for the nurture of the deaf and dumb , or the blind . Immured within hospitals and alms-houses , like so many lunatics or incurables , they have been delivered over , if they escaped the physical , to all the moral contagion too frequently incident to such abodes , and have thus been involved in a mental darkness far more deplorable than their bodily one . // This injudicious treatment has resulted from the erroneous principle of viewing these unfortunate beings as an absolute burthen on the public , utterly incapable of contributing to their own subsistence , or of ministering in any degree to their own intellectual wants . Instead , however , of being degraded by such unworthy views , they should have been regarded as , what in truth they are , possessed of corporeal and mental capacities perfectly competent , under proper management , to the production of the most useful results . If wisdom from one entrance was quite shut out , other avenues for its admission still remained to be opened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicament , it is necessary to place ourselves as far as possible in their peculiar situation ; to consider to what faculties this insulated condition is on the whole most favorable , and in what direction they can be exercised with the best chance of success . Without such foresight , all our endeavors to aid them will only put them upon efforts above their strength , and result in serious mortification . The blind , from the cheerful ways of men cut off , are necessarily excluded from the busy theatre of human action . Their infirmity , however , which coiisigns them to darkness , and often to solitude , would seem favorable to contemplative habits , and to the pursuits of abstract science and pure speculation . Undisturbed by external objects , the mind necessarily turns within and concentrates its ideas on any point of investigation with greater intensity and perseverance . It is no uncommon thing , therefore , to find persons setting apart the silent hours of the evening for the purpose of composition , or other purely intellectual exercise . Malebranche , when he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day-time , excluding every ray of light ; and hence , Democritus is said to have put out his eyes in order that he might philosophize the better ; a story , it is true , the veracity of which Cicero , who relates it , is prudent enough not to vouch for . Blindness must also be exceedingly favorable to the discipline of the memory . Whoever has had the misfortune , from any derangement of the organ , to be compelled to derive his knowledge of books less from the eye than the ear , will feel the truth of this . The difficulty of recalling what has once escaped , of reverting to , or dwelling on the passages read aloud by another , compels the hearer to give undivided atten // tion to the subject , and to impress it more forcibly on his own mind by subsequent and methodical reflection . Instances of the cultivation of ti*is faculty to an extraordinary extent , therefore , have been witnessed among the blind , and it has been most advantageously applied to the pursuit of abstract science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our preceding remarks is the well-known history of Saunderson , who having been deprived in his infancy , not only of sight but of the organ itself , contrived to become so well acquainted with the Greek tongue as to read the works of the ancient mathematicians in the original . He made such advances in the higher departments of the science , that he was appointed , though not matriculated at the university , to fill the chair which a short time previous had been occupied by Sir Isaac Newton at Cambridge . The lectures of this blind professor on the most abstruse points of the Newtonian philosophy , and especially on optics , naturally filled his audience with admiration ; and the perspicuity with which he communicated his ideas is said to have been unequalled . He was enabled , by the force of his memory , to perform many long operations in arithmetic , and to carry in his mind the most complex geometrical figures . As , however , it became necessary to supply the want of vision by some symbols which might be sensible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose value was determined principally by their relative position to each other , served him instead of figures ; while for his diagrams he employed pegs , inserted at the requisite angles to each other , representing the lines by threads drawn around them . He was so expert in his use of these materials , that when performing his calculations he would change the position of the pins with nearly the same facility with which another person could indite figures ; and when disturbed in an operation , would afterwards resume it again , ascertaining the posture in which he had left it by passing his hand carefully over the table . To such shifts and inventions does human ingenuity resort when stimulated by the thirst of knowledge ; as the plant when thrown into shade on one side , sends forth its branches eagerly in that direction where the light is permitted to fall upon it . In like manner , the celebrated mathematician Euler continued , for many years after he became blind , to indite and publish the results of his scientific labors , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoirs ready for the press , most of which have since been given to the world . An example of diligence equally indefatigable , though turned in a different channel , occurs in our contemporary Huber , who has contributed one of the most delightful volumes within the compass of natural history , and who , if he employed the eyes of another , guided them in their investigation to the right results , by the light of his own mind . J3lindness would seem to he propitious also to the exercise of the inventive powers . Hence poetry , from the time of Thamyris and hlind Ma*onides down to the Welch harper and the hallad-grinder of our day , has been assigned as the peculiar province of those bereft of vision ; As the wakeful bird Sings darkling , and in shadiest covert hid , Tunes her nocturnal note . The greatest epic poem of antiquity was probably , as that of the moderns was certainly , composed in darkness . It is easy , however , to understand how the man , who has once seen , can recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty ; but it would seem scarcely possible , that one born blind , excluded from all acquaintance with colored nature , ' as Condillac finely styles it , should excel in descriptive poetry . Yet there are eminent examples of this ; among others , that of Blacklock , whose verses abound in the most agreeable and picturesque images . He could have formed no other idea of colors , however , as his biographer and countryman Mackenzie justly remarks , than was conveyed by their moral associations , the source indeed of most of the pleasures we derive from descriptive poetry . It was thus that he studied the variegated aspect of nature , and read in it the successive revolutions of the seasons , their freshness , their prime , and decay . Mons. Guilli* in an interesting Essay on the Instruction of the Blind , to which we shall have occasion repeatedly to refer , quotes an example of the association of ideas in regard to colors , which occurred in one of his own pupils , who in reciting the well-known passage in Horace , rubente @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words by fiery , ' or burning right hand . ' On being requested to render it literally , he called it red right hand ; ' and gave as his reason for his former version , that he could form no positive conception of a // red color ; but that as fire was said to be red , he connected the idea of heat with this color , and had therefore interpreted the wrath of Jupiter demolishing town and tower , by the epithet , fiery or burning ; ' for when people are angry , ' he added , they are hot , and when they are hot , they must of course be red . ' He certainly seems to have formed a much more accurate notion of red , than Locke 's blind man . But while a gift for poetry belongs only to the inspired few , and while many have neither taste nor talent for mathematical or speculative science , it is a consolation to reflect that the humblest individual , who is destitute of sight , may so far supply this deficiency by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid to attain a considerable degree of intellectual culture , as well as a familiarity with some of the most useful mechanic arts . It will be easier to conceive to what extent the perceptions of touch and hearing may be refined , if we reflect how far that of sight is sharpened by exclusive reliance on it , in certain situations . Thus the mariner descries objects at night , and at a distance upon the ocean , altogether imperceptible to the unpractised eye of a landsman . And the North American Indian steers his course undeviatingly through the trackless wilderness , guided only by such signs as escape the eye of the most inquisitive white man . In like manner the senses of hearing and feeling are capable of attaining such a degree of perfection in a blind person , that by them alone he can distinguish his various acquaintance and even the presence of persons whom he has but rarely met before ,  --  the size of the apartment , and the general locality of the spots in which he may happen to be ,  --  and guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throng of towns . Dr. Bew , in a paper in the Manchester Collection of Memoirs , gives an account of a blind man of his acquaintance in Derbyshire , who was much used as a guide for travellers in the night over certain intricate roads , and particularly when the tracks were covered with snow . This same man was afterwards employed as a projector and surveyor of roads in that county . We well remember a blind man in the neighboring town of Salem , who officiated some twenty years since as the town crier , when that functionary performed many of the advertising duties now usurped by the newspaper , making his diurnal round , and stopping with great precision at every corner , trivium or quadrivium , to chime his melodious twang. ' // Yet this feat , the familiarity of which prevented it from occasioning any surprise , could have resulted only from the nicest observation of the undulations of the ground , or by an attention to the currents of air , or the different sound of the voice , or other noises in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Mons. Guilli* mentions several apparently well-attested anecdotes of blind persons , who had the power of discriminating colors by the touch . One of the individuals noticed by bin ) , a Dutchman , was so expert in this way , that he was sure to come off conqueror at the card-table by the knowledge which he thus obtained of his adversary 's hand , whenever it came to his turn to deal . This power of discrimination of colors , which seems to be a gift only of a very few of the finer-fingered gentry , must be founded on the different consistency or smoothness of the ingredients used in the various dyes . A more certain method of ascertaining these colors , that of tasting or touching them with the tongue , is frequently resorted to by the blind , who by this means often distinguish between those analogous colors , as black and dark blue , red and pink , wbicki , having the greatest apparent affinity , not unfrequently deceive the eye . Diderot , in an ingenious letter on the Blind , *t l'usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his visit to a blind man at Puisseaux , the son of a Professor in the University of Paris , and well known in his day from the various accomplishments and manual dexterity which he exhibited , remarkable in a person in his situation . Being asked what notion he had formed of an eye , he replied , I conceive it to be an organ on which the air produces the same effect , as this staff on my hand . If when you are looking at an object , I should interpose any thing between your eyes and that object , it would prevent you from seeing it . And I am in the same predicament when I seek one thing with my staff and come across another . ' An explanation , says Diderot , as lucid as any which could be given by Descartes , who , it is singular , attempts , in his Dioptrics , to explain the analogy between the senses of feeling and seeing , by figures of men blindfolded , groping their way with staffs in their hands . This same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he seems to have accounted them almOst equally valuable with those of vision . On being interrogated if he felt a great desire to have eyes , he answered , Were it not for the mere gratification of curiosity , I think I // should do as well to wish for long arms . It seems to me that my hands would inform me better of what is going on in the moon , than your eyes and telescopes ; and then the eyes lose the power of vision more readily than the hands that of feeling . It would be better to perfect the organ which I have , than to bestow on me that which I have not . ' Indeed the geometric sense ' of touch , as Buffon terms it , as far as it reaches , is more faithful , and conveys , oftentimes , a more satisfactory idea of external forms than the eye itself . *i1*e great defect is , that its range is necessarily so limited . It is told of Saunderson , that he , on one occasion , detected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye of a connoisseur . We are hardly aware how much of our dexterity in the use of the eye arises from incessant practice . Those who have been relieved from blindiiess , at an advanced or even early period of life , have been found frequently to recur to the old and more familiar sense of touch , in preference to the sight . The celebrated English anatomist , Cheselden , mentions several illustrations of this fact , in an account given by him of a blind boy , whom he had successfully couched for cataracts , at the age of fourteen . It was long before the youth could discriminate by his eye between his old companions , the family cat and dog , dissimilar as such animals appear to us in color and conformation . Being ashamed to ask the oft-repeated question , he was obsc.rved one day to pass his hand carefully over the cat , and then , looking at her steadfastly , to exclaim , So , puss , I shall know you another time . ' It is more natural that he should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was long before he could comprehend , that the objects depicted did not possess the same relief on the canvass as in nature . He inquired , Which is the lying sense here , the sight or the touch ? ' The faculty of hearing would seem susceptible of a similar refinement with that of seeing . To prove this without going into further detail , it is only necessary to observe that much the larger proportion of blind persons are more or less proficients in music , and that in some of the institutions for their education , as that in Paris for instance , all the pupils are instructed in this delightful art . The gift of a natural ear for melody , therefore , deemed comparatively rare with the clairvoyaris , would seem to exist so far in every individual as to be capable , by a suitable cultivation , of affording a high degree of relish , at least to himself . // As in order to a successful education of the blind , it becomes necessary to understand what are the faculties , intellectual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar condition is best adapted , so it is equally necessary to understand how far , and in what manner , their moral con*titution is likely to be affected by the insulated position in which they are placed . The blind man , shut up within the precincts of his own microcosm , is subjected to influences of a very different complexion from the hulk of mankind , inasmuch as each of the senses is best fitted to the introduction of a certain class of ideas into the mind , and he is deprived of that one through which the rest of his species receive hy far the greatest number of theirs . Thus it will be readily understood that his notions of modesty and delicacy may a good deal differ from those of the world at large . The blind man of Puisseaux confessed that he could not comprehend why it should be reckoned improper to expose one part of the person rather than another . Indeed the conventional rules , so necessarily adopted in society in this relation , might seem , in a great degree , superfluous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be less likely to be endowed with the degree of sensibility usual with those who enjoy the blessing of sight . It is difficult to say how much of our early education depends on the looks , the frowns , the smiles , the tears , the example , in fact , of those placed over and around us . From all this , the blind child is necessarily excluded . These , however , are the great soi.irces of sympathy . We feel little for the joys or the sorrows which we do not witness . Out of sight , out of mind , ' says the old proverb . Hence people are so ready to turn away from distress , which they can not , or their avarice will not suffer them to relieve . Hence , too , persons , whose compassionate hearts would bleed at the infliction of any cruelty on so large an animal as a horse or a dog , for example , will crush without concern a wilderness of insects , whose delicate organization , and whose bodily agonies are imperceptible to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , affects us infinitely more than the tidings of the most murderous battle , or the sack of the most populous and flourishing city at the extremity of the globe . Yet such , without much exaggeration , is the relative position of the blind , removed by their infirmity at a distance from the world , from the daily exhibition of those mingled scenes of // grief and gladness , which have their most important uses , perhaps , in calling forth our sympathies for our fellow creatures . It has been affirmed that the situation of the blind is unpropitious to religious sentiment . They are necessarily insensible to the grandeur of the spectacle , which forces itself upon our senses every day of our existence . The magnificent map of the heavens , with Every star Which the clear concave of a winter 's night Pours on the eye , ' is not unrolled for them . The revolutions of the seasons , with all their beautiful varieties of form and color , and whatever glories of the creation lift the soul in wonder and gratitude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is circumscribed by the little circle which they can span with their own arms . All beyond has for them no real existence . This seems to have passed within the mind of the mathematician Saunderson , whom we have more than once referred to , and whose notions of a Deity would seem to have been , to the last , exceedingly vague and unsettled . The clergyman , who visited him in his latter hours , endeavored to iiiipress upon him the evidence of a God , as afforded by the astonishing mechanism of the universe . Alas ! ' said the dying philosopher , I have been condemned to pass my life in darkness , and you speak to me of prodigies which I can not comprehend , and which can only be felt by you , and those who see like you ! ' When reminded of the faith of Newton , Leibnitz , and Clarke , minds from whom he had drunk so deeply of instruction , and for whom he entertained the profoundest veneration , he remarked ; The testimony of Newton is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; Newton believed on the word of God himself , while I am reduced to believe on that of Newton . ' He expired with this ejaculation on his lips , God of Newton , have I ' mercy on me . These , however , may be considered as the peevish ebullitions of a naturally skeptical and somewhat disappointed spirit , impatient of an infirmity which obstructed , as he conceived , his advancement in the career of science to which he had so zealously devoted himself . It was in allusion to this , undoubtedly , that he depicted his life as having been one long desire and continued privation . ' It is far more reasonable to believe that there are certain // peculiarities in the condition of the blind , which more than counterbalance the unpropitious circumstances above described , and which have a decided tendency to awaken devotional sentiment in their minds . They are the subjects of a grievous calamity , which , as in all such cases , naturally disposes the heart to sober reflection , and , when permanent and irremediable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those temptations , which so sorely beset us in the worldthose tumultuous passions which , in the general rivalry , divide man from man , and embitter the sweet cup of social life-those sordid appetites which degrade us to the level of the brutes . They are subjected , on the contrary , to the most healthful influences . Their occupations are of a tran ( luil , and , oftentimes , of a purely intellectual character . Their pleasures are derived from the endearments of domestic intercourse ; and the attentions almost always conceded to persons in their dependent condition , must necessarily beget a reciprocal kindliness of feeling in their own bosoms . In short , the uniform tenor of their lives is such , as naturally to dispose them to resignation , serenity , and cheerfulness ; and accordingly , as far as our own experience goes , these have usually been the characteristics of the blind . Indeed the cheerfulness , almost universally incident to persons deprived of sight , leads us to consider blindness as , on the whole , a less calamity than deafness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasures , and to society , in which he can take no part . He is the guest at a banquet , of which he is not permitted to partake , the spectator at a theatre where he can not comprehend a syllable . If the blind man is excluded from sources of enjoyment equally important , he has at least the advantage of not perceiving and not even comprehending what he has lost . It may be added , that perhaps the greatest privation consequent on blindness , is the inability to read , as that on deafness is the loss of the pleasures of society . Now the eyes of another may be made in a great degree to supply this defect of the blind man , while no art can afford a corresponding substitute to the deaf for the privations to which he is doomed in social intercourse . He can not hear with the ears of another . As , however , it is undeniable that blindness makes one more dependent than deafness , we may be content with the conclusion that the former would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor . Our remarks will be // understood as applying to those only who are wholly destitute of the faculties of sight and hearing . A person afflicted only with a partial derangement or infirmity of vision , is placed in the same tantalizing predicament above described of the deaf and is consequently found to be usually of a far more impatient and irritable temperament , and consequently less happy than the totally blind . With all this , we doubt , whether there be one of our readers , even should he assent to the general truth of our remarks , who would not infinitely prefer to incur partial to total blindness , and deafness to either . Such is the prejudice in favor of eyes . Patience , perseverance , habits of industry , and above all , a craving appetite for knowledge , are sufficiently common to be considered as characteristics of the blind , and have tended greatly to facilitate their education , which must otherwise prove exceedingly tedious , and indeed doubtful as to its results , considering the formidable character of the obstacles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such obstacles occurred at Paris , when the institutions for the Deaf and Dumb and for the Blind were assembled under the same roof in the convent of the Celestines . The pupils of the two seminaries , notwithstanding the apparently insurmountable barrier interposed between them by their respective infirmities , contrived to open a communication with each other , which they carried on with the greatest vivacity . It was probably the consideration of those moral qualities , as well as of the capacity for improvement , which we have described as belonging to the blind , which induced the benevolent Haiiy , in conjunction with the Philanthropic Society of Paris , to open there in 1784 , the first regular seminary for their education ever attempted . This institution underwent several modifications , not for the better , during the revolutionary period which followed , until in 1816 , it was placed on the respectable basis on which it now exists under the direction of Dr. Guilli* , whose untiring exertions have been blessed with the most beneficial results . We shall give a brief view of the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the valuable treatise to which we have already referred , occasionally glancing at the method adopted in the corresponding institution at Edinburgh . The fundamental object proposed in every scheme of educa // tion for the blind , is to direct the attention of the pupil to those studies and mechanic arts , which he will he able afterwards to pursue by means of his own exertions and resources , without any external aid . The sense of touch is the one therefore almost exclusively relied on . The fingers are the eyes of the blind . They are taught to read in Paris , by feeling the surface of metallic types , and in Edinburgh by means of letters raised on a blank leaf of paper . If they are previously acquainted with spelling , which may be easily taught them before entering the institution , they learn to discriminate the several letters with great facility . Their perceptions get to be so fine by practice , that they can discern even the finest print , and when the fingers fail them , readily distinguish it by applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in figures , the notation table invented by Saunderson , and once used in the Paris seminary , having been abandoned as less simple and obvious , although his symbols for the representation of geometrical diagrams are still retained . As it would be labor lost to learn the art of reading , without having books to read , various attempts have been made to supply this desideratum . The first hint of the form , now adopted for the impression of these books , was suggested by the appearance exhibited on the reverse side of a copy as removed fresh from the printing-press . In imitation of this , a leaf of paper of a firm texture is forcibly impressed with types unstained by ink , and larger than the ordinary size , until a sufficiently bold relief has been obtained to enable the blind person to distinguish the characters by the touch . The French have adopted the Italian hand , or one very like it , for the fashion of the letters , while the Scotch have invented one more angular and rectilinear , which , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accurate discrimination by the touch , than smooth and extended curves and circles . Several important works have been already printed on this plan , viz.  --  a portion of the Scriptures , catechisms , and offices for daily prayer , grammars in the Greek , Latin , French , English , Italian , and Spanish languages , a Latin selechr , a Geography , a course of General History , a selection from English poets and prose-writers , a course of Literature , with a compilation of the choicest specimens of French eloquence . With all this , the art of printing for the blind is still in its infancy . The characters are so unwieldy , and the leaves // ( which can not be printed on the reverse side , as this would flatten the letters upon the other ) , are necessarily so numerous as to make the volume exceedingly bulky , and of course expensive . The Gospel of St. John , for example , expands into three large octavo volumes . Some further improvement must occur , therefore , before the invention can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a result eventually , for it is only by long and repeated experiment , that the art of printing in the usual way , and every other art , indeed , has been brought to its present perfection . Perhaps some mode may be adopted like that of stenography , which , although encumbering the learner with some additional difficulties at first , may abundantly compensate him in the condensed forms , and consequently cheaper and more numerous publications which could be afforded by it . Perhaps ink , or some other material of greater consistency than that ordinarily used in printing , may be devised , which , when communicated by the type to the paper , will leave a character sufficiently raised to be distinguished by the touch . We have known a blind person able to decypher the characters in a piece of music , to which the ink had been imparted more liberally than usual . In the mean tune , what has been already done , has conferred a service on the blind , which we , who become insensible from the very prodigality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimmering of the taper , which is lost in the blaze of day , is sufficient to guide the steps of the wanderer in darkness . The unsealed volume of Scripture will furnish him with the best sources of consolation under every privation ; the various grammars are so many keys with which to unlock the stores of knowledge , that he may enrich himself with in after life ; and the selections from the most beautiful portions of elegant literature will afford him a permanent source of recreation and delight . One method used for instruction in writing , is to direct the pencil or stylus in a groove cut in the fashion of the different letters . Other modes , however , too complex for description here , are resorted to , by which the blind person is enabled not only to write , but to read what he has thus traced . A portable writing-case for this purpose has also been invented by one of the blind , who , it is observed , are the most ingenious in supplying , as they are best acquainted with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence , by means of a // string-alphabet , as it is called , consisting of a cord or ribbon , in which knots of various dimensions represent certain classes of letters , has been devised by two blind men at Edinburgh . This contrivance , which is so simple that it can be acquired in an hour 's time by the most ordinary capacity , is asserted to have the power of conveying ideas with equal precision with the pen . A blind lady of our acquaintance , however , whose fine understanding and temper have enabled her to surmount many of the difficulties of her situation , after a trial of this invention , gives the preference to the mode usually adopted by her of pricking the letters on the paper with a pin ; an operation which she performs with astonishing rapidity , and which , in addition to the advantage possessed by the string-alphabet , of being legible by the touch , answers more completely the purposes of epistolary correspondence , since it may be readily interpreted by any one , on being held up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blind in Paris , comprehends geography , history , the Greek and Latin , together with the French , Italian , and English languages , arithmetic , and the higher branches of mathematics , music , and some of the most useful mechanic arts . For mathematics , the pupils appear to discover a natural aptitude ; many of them attaining such proficiency as not only to profit by the public lectures of the most eminent professors in the sciences , but to carry away the highest prizes in the lyceums in a competition with those who possess the advantage of sight . In music , as we have before remarked , they all make greater or less proficiency . They are especially instructed in the organ , which , from its frequency in the churches , affords one of the most obvious means of obtaining a livelihood . The method of tuition adopted , is that of mutual instruction . The blind are ascertained to learn most easily and expeditiously from those in the same condition with themselves . Two male teachers , with one female , are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , considering the obstacles to be encountered , must be admitted to be a small apparatus for the production of such extensive results . In teaching them the mechanic arts , two principles appear to be kept in view , namely , to select such for each individual respectively , as may be best adapted to his future residence and destination ; the trades , for example , most suitable for a sea-port , being those least so for the country , and vice versa. // Secondly , to confine their attention to such occupations as from their nature are most accessible to , and which can be most perfectly attained by persons in their situation . It is absurd to multiply obstacles from the mere vanity of conquering them . Printing is an art for which the blind show particular talent , going through all the processes of composing , serving the press , distributing the types , &amp;c. with the same accuracy with those who can see . Indeed much of this mechanical occupation with the clair-voyans ( we are in want of some such compendious phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of habit , than any exercise of the eye . The blind print all the books for their own use . They are taught also to spin , to knit , in which last operation they are extremely ready , knitting very finely , with open work , &amp;c. , and are much employed by the Parisian hosiers in the manufacture of elastic vests , shirts , and petticoats . They make purses delicately embroidered with figures of animals and flowers , whose various tints are selected with perfect propriety . The fingers of the females are observed to be particularly adapted to this nicer sort of work , from their superior delicacy , ordinarily , to those of men . They are employed also in manufacturing girths , in netting in all its branches , in making shoes of list , plush , cloth , colored skin , &amp;c , and list carpets , of which a vast number is annually disposed of . Weaving is particularly adapted to the blind , who perform all the requisite manipulation without any other assistance but that of setting up the warp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw hats , rope , cord , pack-thread , baskets , straw , rush , and plush mats , which are very saleable in France . The articles manufactured in the Asylum for the Blind in Scotland , are somewhat different , and as they show for what an extensive variety of occupations they may be qualified in despite of their infirmity , we will take the liberty , at the hazard of being somewhat tedious , of quoting the catalogue of them exhibited in one of their advertisements . The articles offered for sale consist of cotton and linen cloths , ticked and striped Hollands , towelling and diapers , worsted net for fruit trees ; hair-cloth , hair-mats , and hair-ropes , basket-work of every description ; hair , India hemp , and straw door-mats , saddlegirths , rope and twines of all kinds , netting for sheep-pens , garden and onion twine-nets , fishing-nets , bee-hives , mattresses and cushions , feather-beds , bolsters and pillows ; mattresses // and beds of every description cleaned and repaired . The labors in this department are performed by . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockings , spinning , making fine banker 's twine ,  --  and various works , besides , usually executed by well-educated females . Such is the emulation of the blind , according to Dr. Guilli* , in the institution of Paris , that hitherto there has been no necessity of stimulating their exertions by the usual motives of reward or punishment . Delighted with their sensible progress in vanquishing the difficulties incident to their condition , they are content if they can but place themselves on a level with the more fortunate of their fellow-creatures . And it is observed that many , who in the solitude of their own homes , have failed in their attempts to learn some of the arts taught in this institution , have acquired a knowledge of them with great alacrity , when cheered by the sympathy of individuals involved in the same calamity with themselves , and with whom of course they could compete with equal probability of success . The example of Paris has been followed in the principal cities in most of the other countries of Europe ; - in England , Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Denmark . These establishments , which are conducted on the same general principles , have adopted a plan of education more or less comprehensive , some of them , like those of Paris and Edinburgh , involving the higher branches of intellectual education , and others , as in London and Liverpool , confining themselves chiefly to practical arts . The results , however , have been in the highest degree cheering to the philanthropist , in the light thus poured in upon minds to which all the usual avenues were sealed np ,  --  in the opportunity afforded them of developing those latent powers , which had been hitherto wasted in inaction ,  --  and in the happiness thus imparted to an unfortunate class of beings , who now , for the first time , were permitted to assume their proper station in society , and instead of encumbering , to contribute by their own exertions to the general prosperity . We rejoice that the inhabitants of our own city have been the first to give an example of such beneficent institutions in the New World . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public towards it , that we have gone into a review of what has been effected in this way in Europe . The credit of having first suggested the undertaking here is // due to our townsman , Dr. John D. Fisher , through whose exertions aided by those of several other benevolent individuals , the subject was brought before the Legislature of this State ; and an Act of Incorporation was granted to the petitioners , bearing date March 2d , 1829 , authorizing them , under the title of the New-England Asylum for the Blind , ' to hold property , receive donations and bequests , and to exercise the other functions usually appertaining to similar corporations . A resolve was subsequently passed , during the same session , requiring the selectmen of the several towns throughout the Commonwealth , to make returns of the number of blind inhabitants , with their ages , periods of blindness , personal condition , &amp;c . By far the larger proportion of these functionaries , however , with a degree of apatl*y , which does them very little credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of such as did comply with it , and by means of circulars addressed to the clergymen of the various parishes , advices have been received from one hundred and forty-one towns , comprising somewhat less than half of the whole number within the State . From this imperfect estimate it would appear , that the number of blind persons in these towns amounts to two hundred and forty-three , of whom more than one fifth are under thirty years of age , which period is assigned as the limit within which they can not fail of receiving all the benefit to be derived from the system of instruction pursued in the institutions for the blind . The proportion of the blind to our whole population , as founded on the above estimate , is somewhat higher than that established by Zeune for the corresponding latitudes in Europe , where blindness decreases in advancing from the equator to the poles , it being computed in Egypt at the rate of one to one hundred , and in Norway of one to one thousand , which last is conformable to ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appear that there are about five hundred blind persons in the State of Massachusetts at the present moment ; and adopth*g the census of 1820 , there could not at that time , according to the same rate , be less than sixteen hundred and fifty in all New-England , one fifth being under thirty years of age ,  --  a number , which as the blind are usually retired from public observation , far exceeds what might be conceived on a cursory inspection . From the returns it would appear that a large proportion of // the blind in Massachusetts are in humble circumstances ; and a still larger proportion of those in years , indigent or paupers . This is imputable to their having learnt no trade or profession in their youth . So that , when deprived of their natural guardians , they have necessarily become a charge upon the public . Since the year 1825 , an appropriation has been continued by the Legislature for the purpose of maintaining a certain number of pupils at the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb at Hartford . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , authorizing the Governor to pay over to the Asylum for the Blind whatever balance of the sum , thus appropriated , might remain in the Treasury unexpended at the end of the current year ; and the same with every subsequent year to which the grant extended , unless otherwise advised . Seven hundred dollars only have been realized as the balance of the past year , a sum obviously inadequate to the production of any important result , and far inferior indeed to what had been anticipated by the friends of the resolve . On the whole , we are inclined to doubt , whether this will be found the most suitable mode of creating resources for the Asylum . Although in fact it disposes only of the superfluity , it has the appearance of subtracting from the positive revenues of the Deaf and Dumb , an institution of equal merit and claims with any other whatever . The Asylum for the Blind is an establishment of too much importance to be left thus dependent on a precarious contingent , and is worthy , were it only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State on some more secure and ample basis . As it is , the want of funds opposes a sensible obstruction to its progress . The pressure of the times has made the present moment exceedingly unfavorable to personal solicitation , although so much has been effected in this way , through the liberality of a few individuals , that , as we understand , preparations are now making for procuring the requisite instructers and apparatus , on a moderate and somewhat reduced scale . As to the comprehensiveness of the scheme of education to be pursued at the Asylum , whether it shall embrace intellectual culture , or be confined simply to the mechanic arts , this must , of course , be ultimately determined by the extent of its resources . We trust , however , it will be enabled to adopt the former arrangement , at least so far as to afford the pupils an acquaintance with the elements of the more popular sciences . There is such a diffusion of liberal knowledge among all classes in this // country , that if the blind are suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Institution , they will always , whatever be the skill acquired by them in mechanical occupations , continue to feel a sense of their own mental inferiority . The connexion of these higher with the more direct objects of the Institution will serve , moreover , to give it greater dignity and importance . And while it will open sources of knowledge from which many may be in a situation to derive permanent consolation , it will instruct the humblest individual in what may be of essential utility to him , as writing and arithmetic , for example , in his intercourse with the world . To what extent it is desirable that the Asylum be placed on a charitable foundation , is another subject of consideration . This we believe is the character of most of the establishments in Europe . That in Scotland , for instance , contains about a hundred subjects , but who , with their families included , amount to two hundred and fifty souls , all supported from the labors of the blind , conjointly with the funds of the Institution . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . It seems probable , however , that this is not the plan best adapted to our exigencies . We want not to maintain the blind , but to put them in the way of contributing to their own maintenance . By placing the expenses of tuition , board , &amp;c. as low as possible , the means of effecting this will be brought within the reach of a large class of them ; and for the rest , it will be obvious economy in the State to provide them with the means of acquiring an education at once , that may enable them to contribute permanently towards their own support , which in some shape or other is now chargeable on the public . Perhaps , however , some scheme may be devised for combining both these objects , if this be deemed preferable to the adoption of either exclusively . We are convinced that as far as the Institution is to rely for its success on public patronage , it will not be disappointed . If once successfully in operation , and brought before the public eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy , which in this country has never been refused to the calls of humanity . No one , we think , who has visited the similar endowments in Paris or in Edinburgh , will easily forget the sensations which he experienced on witnessing so large a class of his unfortunate fellow-creatures thus restored from intellectual darkness to the blessings , if we may so speak , of light and liberty . There is // no higher evidence of the worth of the human mind , than its capacity of drawing consolation from its own resources under so heavy a privation ; so that it not only can exhibit resignation and cheerfulness , but energy to burst the fetters with which it is encumbered . Who could refuse his sympathy to the success of these efforts ,  --  or withhold from the subject of them the means of attaining his natural level and usefulness in society , from which circumstances , less favorable to him than to ourselves , have hitherto excluded him ?                  @ @ @
