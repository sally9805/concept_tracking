txt WHEN a new star rises in the heavens , people gaze after it for a season with the naked eye , and with such telescopes as they may find . In the stream of thought , which flows so peacefully deep and clear , through the pages of this book , we see the bright reflection of a spiritual star , after which men will be fain to gaze " with the naked eye , and with the spyglasses of criticism . " This star is but newly risen ; and ere long the observations of numerous star-gazers , perched up on arm-chairs and editors ' tables , will inform the world of its magnitude and its place in the heaven of poetry , whether it be in the paw of the Great Bear , or on the forehead of Pegasus , or on the strings of the Lyre , or in the wing of the Eagle . Our own observations are as follows . To this little work we would say , " Live ever , sweet , sweet book . " It comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has the freshness of morning and of May . These flowers and green leaves of poetry have not the dust of // the highway upon them . They have been gathered fresh from the secret places of a peaceful and gentle heart . There flow deep waters , silent , calm , and cool ; and the green trees look into them , and " God 's blue heaven . " The book , though in prose , is written nevertheless by a poet . lie looks upon all things in the spirit of love , and with lively sympathies ; for to him external form is but the representation of internal being , all things having a life , an end and aim . The true poet is a friendly man . He takes to his arms even cold and inanimate things , and rejoices in his heart , as did St. Bernard of old , when he kissed his Bride of Snow . To his eye all things are beautiful and holy ; all are objects of feeling and of song , from the great hierarchy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the little flowers which are " stars in the firmament of the earth . " For he feels that " The infinite forms of life are bound in one By Love 's eternal band ; The glow-worm and the fire-sea of the sun , Came from one father 's hand . " There are some honest people into whose hearts " Nature can not find the way . " They have no imagination by which to invest the ruder forms of earthly things with poetry . They are like Wordsworth 's Peter Bell " A primrose by a river 's brim , A yellow primrose was to him , And it was nothing more . " But it is one of the high attributes of the poetic mind , to feel a universal sympathy with Nature , both in the material world and in the soul of man . It identifies itself likewise with every object of its sympathy , giving it new sensation and poetic life , whatever that object may be , whether man , bird , beast , flower , or star . As to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic mind all things are poetical . To such souls no age and no country can be utterly dull and prosaic . They make unto themselves their age and country ; dwelling in the universal mind of man , and in the universal forms of things . Of such is the author of this book . There are many who think that the ages of Poetry and Romance are gone by . They look upon the Present as a dull , unrhymed , and prosaic translation of a brilliant and poetic Past . Their dreams are of the days of Eld ; of the Dark Ages , of the days of Chivalry , and Bards , and Trouba // dours and Minnesingers ; and the times of which Milton says ; " The villages also must have their visiters to inquire what lectures the bagpipe , and the rebbec reads even to the ballatry , and the gammuth of every municipal fidler , for these are the countryman 's Arcadia and his Monte Mayors . " We also love ancient ballads . Pleasantly to our ears sounds the voice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past , like the wind of evening among ruins . And yet this voice does not persuade us that the days of balladry were more poetic than our own . The spirit of the past pleads for itself , and the spirit of the present likewise . If poetry be an element of the human mind , and censequently in accordance with nature and truth , it would be strange indeed , if , as the human mind advances , poetry should recede . The truth is , that when we look back upon the Past , we see only its bright and poetic features . All that is dull , prosaic , and common-place is lost in the shadowy distance . XVe see the moated castle on the hill , and , " Golden and red above it , The clouds float gorgeously ; " but we see not the valley below , where the patient bondsman toils like a beast of burden . We see the tree-tops waving in the wind , and hear the merry birds singing under their green roofs ; but we forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the Present it is not so . We stand too near to see objects in a picturesque light . What to others at a distance is a bright and folded summer cloud , is to us , who are in it , a dismal , drizzling rain . Thus to many this world , all beautiful as it is , seems a poor , working-day world . They are ready to exclaim with G6the ; " Why so bustleth the people and crieth ? would find itself victual , Children too would beget , feed on the best may he had , Mark in thy note-books , traveller , this , and at home go do likewise ; Farther reacheth no man , make he what stretching he may . " Thus has it been since the world began . Ours is not the only Present , which has seemed dull , common-place , and prosaic . The truth is , the heaven of poetry and romance still lies around us and within us . If people would but lay aside their // " abominable spectacles , " the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with astonishing brightness . So long as truth is stranger than fiction , the elements of poetry and romance will not be wanting in common life . If , invisible ourselves , we could follow a single human being through a single day of its life , and know all its secret thoughts , and hopes , and anxieties , its prayers , and tears , and good resolves , its passionate delights and struggles against temptation , - all that excites , and all that soothes the heart of man , - we should have poetry enough to fill a volume . Nay , set the imagination free , like another Bottle-imp , and bid it lift for you the roofs of the city , street by street , and after a single night 's observation you shall sit you down and write poetry and romance for the rest of your life . We deem these few introductory remarks important to a true understanding of Mr. Hawthorne 's character as a writer . It is from this point that he goes forth ; and if we would go with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we also must start from the same spot . In order to judge of the truth and beauty of his sketches , we must at least know the point of view , from which he drew them . Let us now examine the sketches themselves . The Twice-told Tales are so called , we presume , from having been first published in various annuals and magazines , and now collected together , and told a second time in a volume by themselves . And a very delightful volume do they tnake ; one of those , which excite in you a feeling of personal interest for the author . A calm , thoughtful face seems to be looking at you from every page ; with now a pleasant smile , and now a shade of sadness stealing over its features . Sometimes , though not ofren , it glares wildly at you , with a strange and painful expression , as , in the German romance , the bronze knocker of the Archivarius Lindhorst makes up faces at the Student Anselmus . One of the most prominent characteristics of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this title . If some persons , like the cynic here mentioned , can not see the gems of poetry which shine before them , because of their colored spectacles , others resemble the alchymist in the same tale , who " returned to his laboratory with a prodigious fragment of granite which he ground to powder , dissolved in acids , melted in the crucible , and burnt with the blowpipe , and published the result of his experiments in one of the heaviest folios of the day . " // that they are national in their character . The author has xvisely chosen his themes among the traditions of New England ; the dusty legends of " the good Old Colony times , when we lived under a king . " This is the right material for story . It seems as natural to make tales out of old tumbledown traditions , as canes and snuff-boxes out of old steeples , or trees planted by great men . The puritanical times begin to look romantic in the distance . Who would not like to have strolled through the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Wednesday , and there were two annual fairs at St. James 's and St. Paul 's ? Who would not like to have been present at the court of the Worshipful* Thomas Gorges , in those palmy days of the law , when Toni Heard was fined five shillings for being drunk , and John Payne the same , " for swearing one oath " ? Who would not like to have seen the time , when Thomas Taylor was presented to the grand jury " for abusing Captain Raynes , being in authority , by thee-ing and thou-ing him " ; and John Wardell likewise , for denying Cambridge College to be an ordinance of God ; and when some were fined for winking at comely damsels in church ; and others for being commonsleepers there on the Lord 's day ? Truly , many quaint and quiet customs , many comic scenes and strange adventures , many wild and wondrous things , fit for humorous tale , and soft , pathetic story , lie all about us here in New England . There is no tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare in beauty with that of the Phantom Ship . The Flying Dutchman of the Cape , and the Klabotermann of the Baltic , are nowise superior . The story of Peter Rugg , the man who could not find Boston , is as good as that told by Gervase of Tilbury , of a man who gave himself to the devils by an unfortunate imprecation , and was used by them as a xvheelbarrow ; and the Great Carbuncle of the White Mountains shines with no less splendor , than that which illuminated the subterranean palace in Rome , as related by William of Malmesbury . Truly , from such a Fortunatus s pocket and wishing-cap , a tale-bearer may furnish forth a sufficiency of " peryllous adventures right espouventables , bryfefly compyled and pyteous for to here . " Another characteristic of this writer is the exceeding beauty of his style . It is as clear as running waters are . Indeed he uses words as mere stepping-stones , upon which , with a free // and youthful bound , his spirit crosses and recrosses the bright and rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have introdnced a kind of Gothic architecture into their style . All is fantastic , vast , and wondrous in the outward form , and within is mysterious twilight , and the swelling sound of an organ , and a voice chanting hymns in Latin , which need a translation for many of the crowd . To this we do not object . Let the priest chant in what language he xviii , so long as he understands his own mass-hook . But if lie wishes the world to listen and be edified , he will do well to choose a language that is generally understood . And now let us give some specimens of the bright , poetic style we praise so highly . Here is the commencement of a sketch entitled " The Vision of the Fountain . " What a soft and musical flow of language I And yet all as simple as a draught of water from the fountain itself . " At fifteen , I became a resident in a country village , more than a hundred miles from home . The morning after my arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any in July , - I rambled into a wood of oaks , with a few walnut trees intermixed , forming the closest shade above my head . The ground was rocky , uneven , overgrown with bushes and clumps of young saplings , and traversed only by cattle-paths . The track , which I chanced to follow , led me to a crystal spring , with a border of grass , as freshly green as on May morning , and overshadowed by the limb of a great oak . One solitary sunbeam found its way down , and played like a goldfish in the water . " From my childhood , I have loved to gaze into a spring . The water filled a circular basin , small , but deep , and set round with stones , some of which wore covered with slimy moss , the others naked , and of variegated hue , reddish , white , and brown . The bottom was covered with coarse sand , which sparkled in the lonely sunbeam , and seemed to illuminate the spring with an unborrowed light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated the sand , but without obscuring the fountain , or breaking the glassiness of its surface . It appeared as if some living creature were about to emerge , the Naiad of the spring , perhaps , in the shape of a beautiful young woman , with a gown of filmy water-moss , a belt of rainbow drops , and a cold , pure , passionless countenance . How would the beholder shiver , pleasantly , yet fearfully , to see her sitting on one of the stones , paddling her white feet in the ripples , and throwing up water , to sparkle in the sun ! Wherever she laid her hands on grass and // flowers , they would immediately be moist , as with morning dew . Then would she set about her labors , like a careful housewfe , to clear the fountain of withered leaves , and bits of slimy wood , and old acorns from the oaks above , and grains of corn left by cattle in drinking , till the bright sands , in the bright water , were like a treasury of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would Jind only the drops of a summer shower , glistening about the spot where he had seen her . " Reclining on the border of grass , where the dewy goddess should have been , I bent forward , and a pair of eyes met mine within the watery mirror . They were the reflection of my own . I looked again , and lo ! another face , deeper in the fountain than my own image , more distinct in all the features , yet faint as thought . The vision had the aspect of a fair young girl , with locks of paly gold . A mirthful expression laughed in the eyes and dimpled over the whole shadowy countenance , till it seemed just what a fountain would be , *f while dancing merrily into the sunshine , it should assume the shape of woman . Through the dim rosiness of the cheeks , I could see the brown leaves , the slimy twigs , the acorns , and the sparkling sand . The solitary sunheam was diffused among the golden hair , which melted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head so beautiful ! " My description can give no idea how suddenly the fountain was thus tenanted , and how soon it was left desolated . I breathed ; and there was the face ! I held my breath , and it was gone ! Had it passed away , or faded into nothing ? I doubted whether it had ever been . " - pp. 295- 297 . Here are a few passages from a sketch called " Sunday at Home . " " Every Sabbath morning , in the summer time , I thrust back the curtain , to watch the sunrise stealing down a steeple , which stands opposite my chamber window . First , the weathercoek begins to flash ; then , a fainter lustre gives the spire an airy aspect ; next it encroaches on the tower , and causes the index of the dial to glisten like gold , as it points to the gilded figure of the hour . Now , the loftiest window gleams , and now the lower . The carved frame-work of the portal is marked strongly out . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , comes down the stone steps , one by one ; and there stands the steeple , glowing with fresh radiance , while the shades of twilight still hide themselves among the nooks of the adjacent buildings . Methinks , though the same sun brightens it , every fair morning , yet the steeple has a peculiar robe of brightness for the Sab-bath " // " But on the Sabbath , I watch the earliest sunshine , and fancy that a holier brightness marks the day , when there shall be no buzz of voices on the Exchange , nor traffic in the shops , nor crowd , nor business , anywhere but at church . Many have fancied so . For my own part , whether I see it scattered down among tangled woods , or beaming broad across the fields , or hemmed in between brick buildings , or tracing out the figure of the casement on my chamber floor , still I recognise the Sabbath sunshine . And ever let me recognise it . Some illusions , and this among them , are the shadows of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close their evil wings , and settle down ; but so long as I imagine that the earth is hallowed , and the light of heaven retains its sanctity on the Sabbath , - while that blessed sunshine lives within me , - never can my soul have lost the instinct of its faith . If it have gone astray , it will return again . " I love to spend such pleasant Sabbaths , from morning till night , behind the curtain of my open window . Are they spent amiss ? Every spot , so near the church as to be visited by the circling shadow of the steeple , should be deemed consecrated ground to-day . It must suffice , that though my form be absent , my inner man goes constantly to church , while many , whose bodily presence fills the accustomed seats , have left their souls at home . But I am there , even before my friend , the sexton . At length he comes , - a man of kindly , but sombre aspect , in dark gray clothes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and applies his key to the wide portal . Now , my thoughts may go in among the dusty pews , or ascend the pulpit without sacrilege , but soon come forth again , to enjoy the music of the bell . How glad , yet solemn too ! All the steeples in town are talking together , aloft in the sunny air , and rejoicing among themselves , while their spires point h avenward . " " About a quarter of an hour before the second ringing of the bell , individuals of the congregation begin to appear . 7J7 he earliest is invariably an old woman in black , whose bent frame and rounded shoulders are evidently laden with some heavy affliction , which she is eager to rest upon the altar . Would that the Sabbath came twice as often , for the sake of that sorrowful old soul ! " " Here comes the clergyman , slow and solemn , in severe simplicity , needing no black silk gown to denote his office . His aspect claims my reverence , but can not win my love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate of Heaven , and frowning , more stern than pitiful , on the wretched applicants , that face should be my study . By middle age , or sooner , the // creed has generally wrought upon the heart , or been attempered by it . As the minister passes into the church , the bell holds its iron tonrue , and all the low murmur of the congregation dies away . The gray sexton looks up and down the street , and then at my window curtain , where , through the small peep-hole , I half fancy that he has caught my eye . Now , every loiterer has gone in , and the street lies asleep in the quiet sun , while a feeling of loneliness comes over me , and brings also an uneasy sense of neglected privileges and duties . Oh , I ought to have gone to church ! The bustle of the rising congregation reaches my ears . They are standing up to pray . Could I bring my heart into unison with those who are praying in yonder church , and lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no distinct request , would not that be the safest kind of prayer ? Lord , look down upon me in mercy ! With that sentiment gushing from my soul , might I not leave all the rest to Him ? " Hark ! the hymn . This , at least , is a portion of the service which I can enjoy better than if I sat within the walls , where the full choir , and the massive melody of the organ , would fall with a weight upon me . At this distance , it thrills through my frame , and plays upon my heart-strings , with a pleasure both of the sense and spirit . Heaven be praised , I know nothing of music , as a science ; and the most elaborate harmonies , if they please me , please as simply as a nurse 's lullaby . The strain has ceased , but prolongs itself in my mind , with fanciful echoes , till I start from my reverie , and find that the sermon has commenced . It is my misfortune seldom to fructify , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first strong idea , which the preacher utters , gives birth to a train of thought , and leads me onward , step by step , quite out of hearing of the good man 's voice , unless he be indeed a son of thunder . At my open window , catching now and then a sentence of the parson 's saw , ' I am as well situated as at the foot of the pulpit stairs . The broken and scattered fragments of this one discourse will be the texts of many sermons , preached by those colleague pastors , - colleagues , but often disputants ,  --  my Mind and Heart . The former pretends to be a scholar , and perplexes me with doctrinal points ; the latter takes me on the score of feeling ; and both , like several other preachers , spend their strength to very little purpose . I , their sole auditor , can not always understand them . " - pp. 25- 32 . We are obliged to forego the pleasure of quoting from the Tales . A tale must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish we had room for " The Great Carbuncle , " which is our especial favorite among them all . It is , however , too long // for this use . Instead thereof ; we will give one of those beautiful sketches , which are interspersed among the stories , like green leaves among flowers . But which shall we give ? Shall it be " David Swan " ; or " Little Annie 's Ramble " ; or " The Vision of the Fountain " ; or " Fancy 's Show-Box " ; or " A Rill from the Town Pump " ? We decide in favor of the last . " ( SCENE ,  --  the corner of two principal streets. * The TowNPUMP talking through its nose . ) " NooN , by the north clock ! Noon , by the east ! High noon too , by these hot sunbeams , which fall , scarcely aslope , upon my head , and almost make the water bubble and smoke , in the trough under my nose . Truly , we public characters have a tough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chosen at March meeting , where is he that sustains , for a single year , the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed , in perpetuity , upon the Town-Pump ? The title of town-treasurer ' is rightfully mine , as guardian of the best treasure that the town has . The overseers of the poor ought to make me their chairman , since I provide bountifully for the pauper , without expense to him that pays taxes . I am at the head of the fire department , and one of the physicians to the hoard of health . As a keeper of the peace , all water-drinkers will confess me equal to the constable . I perform some of the duties of the town-clerk , by promulgating public notices , when they are posted on my front . To speak within bounds , I am the chief person of the municipality , and exhibit , moreover , an admirable pattern to my brother officers , by the cool , steady , upright , downright , and impartial discharge of my business , and the constancy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody seeks me in vain ; for , all day long , I am seen at the busiest corner , just al ove the market , stretching out my arms , to rich and poor alike ; and at night , I hold a lantern over my head , both to show where I am , and keep people out of the gutters . " At this sultry noontide , I am cupbearer to the parched populace , for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist . Like a dram-seller on the Mall , at muster-day , I cry aloud to all and sundry , in my plainest accents , and at the very tiptop of my voice . Here it is , gentlemen ! Here is the good liquor ! Walk up , walk up , gentlemen , walk up , walk up ! Here is the superior stuff ! Here is the unadulterated ale of father Adam , - better than Cognac , Hollands , Jamaica , strong beer , or wine of any price ; here it is , by the hogshead or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Walk up , gentlemen , walk up , and help yourselves ! " It were a pity , if all this outcry should draw no customers . Here they come . A hot day , gentlemen ! quaff , and away again , so as to keep yourselves in a nice cool sweat . You , my friend , will need another cup-full , to wash the dust out of your throat , if it be as thick there as it is on your cowhide shoes . I see that you have trudged half a score of miles , to-day ; and , like a xvise man , have passed by the taverns , and stopped at the running brooks and well-curbs . Otherwise , betwixt heat without and fire within , you would have been burnt to a cinder , or melted down to nothing at all , in the fashion of a jelly-fish . Drink , and make room for that other fellow , who seeks my aid to quench the fiery fever of last night 's potations , which he drained from no cup of mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been great strangers , hitherto ; nor , to confess the truth , will my nose be anxious for a closer intimacy , till the fumes of your breath be a little less potent . Mercy on you , man ! The water absolutely hisses down your red-hot gullet , and is converted quite to steam , in the miniature Tophet , which you mistake for a stomach . Fill again , and tell me , on the word of an honest toper , did you ever , in cellar , tavern , or any kind of a dram-shop , spend the price of your children 's food for a swig half so delicious ? Now , tbr the first time these ten years , you know the flavor of cold water . Good-by ; and , whenever you are thirsty , remember that I keep a constant supply , at the old stand . Who next ? Oh , my little friend , you are let loose from school , and come hither to scrub your blooming face , and drown the memory of certain taps of the ferule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town-Pump . Take it , pure as the current of your young life . Take it , and may your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst than now ! There , my dear child , put down the cup , and yield your place to this elderly gentleman , who treads so tenderly over the paving-stones , that I suspect he is afraid of breaking them . What ! he limps by , without so much as thanking me , as if my hospitable offers were meant only for people who have no wine-cellars . Well , well , sir , - no harm done , I hope ! Go draw the cork , tip the decanter ; but , when your great toe shall set you a-roaring , it will be no affair of mine . If gentlemen love the pleasant titillation of the gout , it is all one to the Town-Pump . This thirsty dog , with his red tongue lolling out , does not scorn my hospitality , but stands on his hind legs , and laps eagerly out of the trough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did your worship ever have the gout ? // " Are you all satisfied ? Then wipe your mouths , my good friends ; and , while my spout has a moment 's leisure , I will delight the town with a few historical reminiscences . In far antiquity , beneath a darksorne shadow of venerable boughs , a spring bubbled out of the leaf-strewn earth , in the very spot where you now behold nie , on the sunny pavement . The water was as bright and clear , and deemed as precious , as liquid diamonds . The Indian sagamores drank of it , from time immemorial , till the fatal deluge of the fire-water burst upon the red men , and swept their whole race away from the cold fountains . Endicott , and his followers , came next , and often knelt down to drink , dipping their long beards in the spring . The richest gobJet , then , was of birch bark . Governor Winthrop , after a journey afoot from Boston , drank here , out of the hollow of his hand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the brow of the first town-born child . For many years , it was the watering place , and , as it were , the washbowl of the vicinity ,  --  whither all decent folks resorted , to purify their visages , and gaze at them afterwards , - at least , the pretty maidens did , - in the mirror which it made . On Sabbath days , whenever a babe was to be baptized , the sexton filled his basin here , and placed it on the communion-table of the bumble meeting-house , which partly covered the site of yonder stately brick one . Thus , one generation after another was consecrated to Heaven by its waters , and cast their waxing and waning shadows into its glassy bosom , and vanished from the earth , as if mortal life were but a flitting image in a fountain . Finally , the fountain vanished also . Cellars were dug on all sides , and cart-loads of gravel flung upon its source , whence oozed a turbid stream , forming a mud-puddle , at the corner of two streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , the dust flew in clouds over the forgotten birthplace of the waters , now their grave . But , in the course of time , a Town-Pump was sunk into the source of the ancient spring ; and when the first decayed , another took its place , - and then another , and still another , - till here stand I , gentlemen and ladies , to serve you with my iron goblet . Drink , and be refreshed The water is as pure and cold as that which slaked the thirst of the red sagamore , beneath the aged boughs , though now the gem of the wilderness is treasured under these hot stones , where no shadow falls , but from the brick buildings . And be it the moral of my story , that , as this wasted and long-lost fountain is now known and prized again , so shall the virtues of cold water , too little valued since your fathers ' days , be recognised by all . " Your pardon , good people ! I must interrupt my stream of // eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replenish the trough for this teamster and his two yoke of oxen , who have come from Topsfield , or somewhere along that way . No part of my business is pleasanier than the watering of cattle . Look ! how rapidly they lower the watermark on the sides of the trough , till their capacious stomachs are moistened with a gallon or two apiece , and they can afford time to breathe it in , with sighs of calm enjoyment . Now they roll their quiet eyes around the brim of their monstrous drinking-vessel . An ox is your true toper . " But I perceive , my dear auditors , that you are impatient for the remainder of my discourse . Impute it , I beseech you , to no defect of modesty , if I insist a little longer on so fruitful a topic as my own multifarious merits , it is altogether for your good .

Neither is it worth while to lay much stress on my claims to a medical diploma , as the physician , whose simple rule of practice is preferable to all the nauseous lore , which has found men sick or left them so , since the days of Hippocrates .

Blessed consummation ! Then , Poverty shall pass away from the land , finding no hovel so wretched , where her squalid form may shelter itself . Then Disease , for lack of other victims , shall gnaw its own heart , and die . Then Sin , if she do not die , shall lose half her strength .
