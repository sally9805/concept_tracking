Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE BANDIT. from The bandit ( 1830 ) Young Leon wore a glance of pride , That made his rivals quail , And won fair Lelia for his bride , The violet of the vale . She loved him  --  and when whispers rose , She deem 'd her dearest friends his foes  --  Fled with him , and her all of life Centred in those fond words  --  his wife . To her , whate'er his mood had been , A smile of love he wore , As summer skies are most serene , When the dark storm is o'er ; And yet at times a trembling came Upon her , when he breathed her name , Calling her wife  --  it seem 'd like guilt , The dark , mysterious awe she felt . A shout upon the moaning wind ! The echoes of the dell awoke ; Again ! it thrill 'd his startled mind , As though his victim spoke ; And all unveil 'd his deeds arise , Blood ! from the ground in thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conscience whispering death . The felon 's death , the doom of scorn , And worse , the thought to bear , His Lelia and her babe unborn The infamy must share . Then , then crime 's scorpion lash he felt , Wild fear , remorse , and grief , and guilt ; For love 's soft light , when turn 'd within , Reveals the soul 's dark stains of sin . He grasps his trusty knife  --  ' One stroke These terrors will allay '  --  But what wild shrieks from Lelia broke ! His brand is torn away ; ' Leon , dear Leon , help ! they come ! ' She deem 'd it life  --  he felt it doom . Thus shapes the heart from inward sense , To guilt its fears  --  to hope its innocence .
