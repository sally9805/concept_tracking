txt ON the 13th of November , the celestial spaces exhibited one of the most magnificent and sul ) lime phenomena , which has been witnessed l ) y the men of this generation . By the most of those who saw , or heard of it for the first time , it was supposed to be unprecedented-a new and original elemental exhibition , designed , according to the various modes of thinking , or not thinking , for the amusement , instruction , or warning of mankind . The perplexities of men were very much relieved , when , on looking into the records of the past , it was found that such things had been before ; that former ages had seexi the heavens on fire , and still the steady course of nature had moved on undisturbed and unaltered . There is no reason to doubt , that phenomena of this kind have always been among the usual , though seldom observed or unrecorded exhibitions of the laws of nature . The causes , whatever they may be , which produced this , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular or fortuitous intervals , similar phenomena . Those causes , and the manner of their action , are , at present , confessedly beyond the reach of philosophy ; their unfrequent occurrence , th' excitement under which observations have been made , and the consequent imperfection of those observations , have prevented any certain understanding of their nature or origin . The recent phenomenon was very extensively visible , and its various aspects seem to have been noted with considerable precision . Fiomn the multitude and variety of observations , it is not improbable that philosophers will be enabled to make a nearer approximation to a just theory of meteors than has yet been effected . In every view , this occurrence is especially worthy of notice , whether as a subject of philosophical speculation , or a theme for poetic musings or devotional aspirations . It is not the purpose of this article to speculate or poetizeto propose new theories , or pronounce decidedly upon old ones ; - but merely to collect , in a brief space , the results of the observations , made in different places and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this century . We had not the good fortune ourselves to witness the magnificent spectacle of November 13 , being then a fast prisoner in the land of dreams . We are , therefore , obliged to derive our ideas and descriptions from the accounts of those , who were happy enough to be called or kept from their pillows to witness this glorious flashing of the elements . The general description of the phenomenon is that of innumerable meteors , or , as they are commonly called , shooting stars , in rapid succession , and for a long space of time , darting down the heavens , filling them with light , leaving behind them long trains of brightness , and exploding in the most brilliant coruscations . So countless was the number of these meteors , that their fall has been variously represented as a " shower of fire , " -a " storm of fire , '  --  a " shower of meteors ,  --  a " starry shower . " The least excited observers speak of the " heavens being streaked with liquid fire , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindling into innumerable balls of rolling fire , "  --  and other comparisons equally emphatic . It is obvious , however , that neither language , nor the pencil , can adequately picture // the grandeur and magnificence of the scene . Imagination comes far short of its sublime reality , and is content to leave to sober philosophy the task of description . It may be doubted , whether any description his surpassed , in accuracy and impressiveness , that of the old negro in Virginia , who remarked- " It is awful , indeed , sir ,  --  it looked like ripe crah.apples falling from the trees , when shaking them for cider . " The meteors do not in general appear to have exhibited any appearances essentially different from the ordinary shooting stars , which every one frequently sees , in a bright evening . They all left behind them trains of light , which continue ( l , for longer or shorter periods , seldom exceeding seconds , after the meteor had disappeared , and grad. ually faded away . The meteors also differed in size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were larger and brighter than Jupiter or Venus . Professor Olmsted , of New-hayen , mentions one as large as the moon . Two also are recorded as seen at Richmond , Virginia , of uncommon size , which exhibited very singular and beautiful appearances . Both were about the size of a six-inch globe . One of these large meteors darted to the NorthEast , leaving behind it a train of light apparently two or three hundred yards in length , and threw sparks io every direction , until it exploded in a thousand brilliant particles . This beautiful meteor continued in its path of light , while sixty-three were counted by the observer . The other referred to , equal in size and brilliancy , shot to the South-East , and continued its course while one hundred and thirty-seven were counted . The train of this last was rather shorter than that of the first . The observer remarks , what was not generally perceived , that a cracking noise attended both . In Newton , New-Jersey , one observer reported that he saw a dark spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until it burst , arid produced a brilliant and extended flash of light . No meteors fell from it . Another person at the same place saw a body of light in the East , resembling the disk of the sun , seen through a cloudy atmosphere . This gradually grew dimmer and more indistinct , until it finally disappeared It does not appear that these appearances were seen in any other place . in Warren , Ohio , a luminous spot was observed in the North-East , resembling the new moon . It then assumed the appearance of the Italic 5 , was exceedingly brilliant , and apparently was fifteen or twenty feet in length . But the most singular of these meteors was that which , in some of the accounts , is called the serpent , and is described by Piofessor Olinsted . This was a ball , which shot off in a North-West direction , and exploded near the star Gapella , in the Goat . This left , just behind the place of its explosion , a long train of light of peculiar beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract in length and extend in breadth , till it assumed the appearance of a serpent folding itself up , until , at last , it appeared like a small luminous cloud of vapor . This cloud was carried by the wind to the South-East , opposite to the direction of the meteor , and remained in sight several minutes . But the ordinary appearance of the meteors was that of globes of fire , of various sizes , which seemed to fall from a point near the zenith , towards the horizon , in every direction . Their course is generally // described as the arc of a circle ; but to some observers they seemed to fall perpendicularly . Others affirm that they moved horizontally ; and this is not improbable , as a body movin* through the air , in a horizontal direction , would appear to be falling in a curve line . None of the meteors were seen less than ten degrees above the horizon , but all disappeared above that point . The duration of this extraordinary meteoric shower , was , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed , in some places , on the evening of the 12th , though they excited no particular observation at the time . The shooting of the meteors was observed , in some l ) laces , soon after midnight , and continued with increasino* numbers and frequency , until between four and five , which seems to have been the period of the highest illumination . From that time , the number visible gradually diminished as the day advanced . A few bright ones shot across the sky , and left their luminous traces on the morning heavens , and were lost to sight only when the daystar was hidden in the splendor of the rising sun . The light of many of these meteors was very vivid , and illumined the atmosphere as intensely as a flash of lightning . The light of others was very faint . Some disappeared suddenly , without any apparent explosion , while others , , after tracing their lines of light along the sky , would burst with the most brilliant coruscations . The light of their track was generally , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prismatic , with a predominance of blue ; and one meteor , of nincomnion size and splendor , was seen to burst in a north-west direction , and burn with a blue flame . The extent , through which this phenomenon was witnessed , is not yet ascertained . It is certain that it was seen . through nearly the whole extent of the United States , and for several hundred miles at sea . It is probable that it was as extensive as that of 1799 , which it so nearly resembles in all its circumstances . The best account of that meteoric shower is to be found in Humboldt 's Personal Narrative ; and his description accords , remarkably , with that of the recent phenomenon . That distinguished arid scientific traveler was at Cumana , in South-America , when the exhibition occurred . He afterwards ascertaired that it was also visible at Weimar , in Germany , and in Labrador and Greenland , with equal brilliancy . How far to the west it was visible , could not be known ; but its known limits included a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent phenomenon was not less extensive . The phenomenon of 1799 , occurred on the 12th of November . This may be regarded , by many , as worthy of remark ; and it may be , too , that philosophy , in her riper age , may draw many important inferences from these rerriarkable coincidences . " In most places , where the fall of meteors was noticed , . they were not observed to be attended or followed by any audible explosion . Most of the observers state , mlistinctly , that no sound was heard . The dartinr of the meteors was as silent as it was magnificent . In a few places , it is asserted , that a sound was heard , like that of a distant rocket and , in one case , the time between the explosion and the supposed report was counted , and found to he twenty seconds , making the distance of the meteor about five miles . This might be supposed to be // auricular deception . The imagination was intensely awake at such a moment . All expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is not strange that the thunder should he heard to break on some ears more sensitive than the rest , though , to the rest , all were silent . But we were rather staggered in our opinion of mistake , when we find it stated , in an account from Charleston , S. C. that frequent explosions were heard , hke the firing of small-arms , and that one meteor , of extraordinary size , exploded with a noise like a cannon . The current of testimony is certainly against any audible explosions . We know not that the fact is otherwise important , than as assisting in determining the height of the meteors . If the noise of their explosion con d he heard , they must have been nearer the earth than many other circumstances would seem to indicate . The question of their composition may also , perhaps , be affected by this fact . It was every where remavked , that the atmosphere was uncommonly pure and clear , and that the stars shone with unusual brilliancy , ind ic ati u g a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thick , dark haze rested upon the horizon , several degrees below the point , whence the meteors seemed to proceed . This might undoubtedly have been noticed in other places , if the attention of observers had been directed to it . It is not an unfrequent appearance of the atmosphere in the clearest evenings . We have deferred , till now , a notice of the most important fact , in a philosophical view , in relation to this phenomenon . The meteors , wherever observed. , all seemed to proceed from a fixed point in the heavens , from which they shot forth in all directions , like the radii of a circle from its centre , " following the arch of the sky , " as Professor Olinsted says , towards the horizon . None returned on the path in which it set forth , and none crossed the track of the other . There was no mingling or confusion . In Buffalo , New-York , and Maysville , Kentucky , it is said that they shot in no uniform direction ; and a Concord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zenith , and in every other direction . But , to nearly every observer , they appeared as we have stated . We can have no hesitation , then , in attributing these few opposing observations to ocular deception , and an excited imagination , and considering it as established that there was a fixed point in the heavens , from which all the meteors radiated . There is some diversity in the statements , concerning the precise position of this radiating point , though , in all cases , it is placed not far distant from the zenith of the observer . In Wooster , Ohio , it seemed to be in the zenith . In Washington , and Lynchbum'g , Virginia , a little south-east of the zenith ; and in New-York , the radiating point was supposed to be about fifteen degrees south*east . In these cases , the position of the centre of radiation does not appear to have been verified by referring it to the fixed stars . But Professor Olmsted , to whose account we have frequently referred , and who seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiating point was , at six o'clock , within the bend of the Sickle in the constellation Leo , a little west of the star Gamma Leonis , and near the bright star Regulus , or the Lion 's Heart . The observations of an observer at Providence coincided precisely with those of Professor Olmsted . By referring to the celestial globe , it was found that the precise position of // the point of radiation , as indicated by the above observations , was twenty degrees eighteen minutes south of the zenith . At Augusta , Georgia , the meteors are said to have commenced at all points of elevation above the horizon but that the lines of their directions , if extended back , would have met in the zenith . The difference in the zenith distance , in any two places , does not appear to have much exceeded twenty degrees . Now , if the same series of meteors were seen at each place , and the same radiating point , it is evident that they must have been at a vast height above the atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1799 , or rather the various zenith distances of the meteors of 1799 , do not appear to have been observed . Yet , without regard to this , Humboldt calculated that , in order to be visible over so great an extent of the earth 's surface , they must have been about fourteen hundred miles distant from the earth . These must have been at a vastly greater distance , on the supposition that all proceeded from a single radiating centre . Admitting the observation , taken at Augusta , to be correct , and the centre of radiation of the meteors to have been in the zenith of that place , the observations at New-Haven and Providence , which are undoubtedly correct , would place that centre at the distance of several thousand miles . An important fact , noted by Professor Olmsted , goes to confirm the opinion of a very great distance . having fixed the radiating point in Leo , he continued his observations for an hour , and found the point st*tionary in the same part of Leo , though that constellation had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This shows that the radiating point was above the region of the atmosphere , and unaffected by the rotation of the earth . But to avoid the inference from this fact , it has been supposed , that the meteors were carried westward by the *vind . It must , of course , be as sumed that the velocity of the wind was precisely equivalent to the rotary motion of the earth  --  a process of reasoning which seems hardly allowable in the cautious speculations of philosophy . Again , it is supposed that the apparent radiant point was not the same in all places , and , of course , that the same meteors were not seen in all places . If the radiant point was in the zenith at Augusta , and also at Wooster , Ohio , it is evident that it could not be the same radiant point , and that a different set of meteors was seen at each place . A good deal of difficulty attends inquiry into this phenomenon , from not knowing those by whom the observations were made . They were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thoroughly understood the grand points of observation , and were familiar with physical phenomena and their causes . The observations of ordinary spectators , will , of necessity , be inaccurate and imperfect , influenced , in a great degree , by an excited imagination , and to be made the foundations of philosophical reasoning , only as they correspond with those of more practised and scientific observers . To apply these remarks , if the radiatint* centre of the meteors has been accurately fixed by one or more men of science , on whose observations we have a right to place confidence , and the majority of other observations , by making the necessary allowances , coincides with it , we are not to avoid the result of those observations , by giving too much weight to others , which seem to lead to a different conclusion . With a trifling allowance , // most of the observations , made in the Atlantic States , are consistent with that , which fixed the radiating centre of the meteoric shower near the zenith of Augusta , and placed it far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to suppose an error in the observations in Ohio , than to admit the theory of two or more radiating centres-a theory , which we conceive to be unnecessary and unphilosophical , and rendering the solution of these magnificent celestial phenomena vastly more difficult and complicated . And it is obvious , that , on either supposition , there must have been material errors of observation . Thus , in Salem and Boston , the radiating point is said to have been in the zenith ; while in Providence and New-Haven , with only half a degree difference in latitude , and but little more in longitude , that point was twenty degrees south of the zenith . If both tI*ese observations are correct , there must have been two points of radiation , within the space of less than a degree . But it is obvious that both these points must have been visible in all the places mentioned . But we find no account of more than one point of radiation having been noticed at the same place . The centre was determined at the two latter places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens . In the t *o latter , for aught that appears , it was determined solely by the eye . There can be no hesitation in deciding which needs correction . If so great and obvious an error has been committed in places in so near proximity , there is no difficulty in conceiving the inaccuracy of other observations , made in similar circumstances , in other places . And these necessary allowances will supersede the necessity of supposing more than one centre of radiation , or of bringing the phenomenon down from heaven to earth . We must not omit to mention a circumstance , j ) robably of considerable importance to the solution of this phenomenon , and we can only mention , without dwelling upon it . The velocity of the meteors was particularly remarked . The degree of this velocity will depend altogether upon their distance from the earth . It has been computed that , if they were at the height of sixty miles above the earth , they must have moved at the rate of twenty miles in a second . Their velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand miles-perhaps equal to that of lightning-at any distance , their velocity must have been great . We have thus noticed the principal circumstances of this remarkable phenomenon . And who could behold unmoved , this fearful lighting up of the midnight sky  --  the heavens apparently on fire-millions of stars seeming to fall from their spheres , and the elements , as if about to melt with fervent heat ? He must have a great deal of recklessness , and too much of philosophy , who could behold the scene without much of awe mingling with his admiration . Even philosophy could not view it with the tranquil and passionless eye , with which she regards other equally grand but more ordinary phenomena . And philosophy will not smile in scorn of less instructed minds , to which this brilliant revelation brought nothing but terror and dire forebodings . It is easy to conceive the emotions that would be excited in an ignorant mind , and even in a cultivated and ardent mind , in the view of such a scene , especially , when religion brought to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed the inevitable certainty // of the predictions of the Bible , arid that they were uttered by him who made and controls the elements and all worlds , arid by whose omnipo* tent an ( 1 unceasing energy alone the stars and planets are continued in their wondrous revolutions , such a phenomenon could nor hut give a vivid impression of the time , when all the stars of heaven shall rush madly from their spheres , and the clements melt with fervent heat . The thought would rush over his mind , with all its emotions of hope or of despair , that the subversion of the present order of nature had commenced ,  --  that He , who was to come , had come , amid the ruins of the universe , to judge and to reward his creatures according to their works , and from these crashing and dissolving elements to form more perfect and enduring conribinations of beauty , order , an ( l utility , and new and brighter abodes of glory and happiness for his children . Science , we repeat , will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt something of them while standing , with uplifted eye , beneath those fiery meteors , and asked from whence they came , and only echo answered- " whence caine they ? " The nature arid origin of shooting stars has been long sought for by philosophers , but as yet without any satisfactory result . Their causes are confessedly beyond the present reach of science . The limits of this article will not permit us to exarriine in detail the various hypotheses that have been proposed to explain them . The central point , from which the meteors seem to be cast , favors the theory , that they are projected from some solid body in a state of intense ignition . rrhe difficulties of this theory , and they seem to be insuperable , are-that the body , which throws off so many millions of luminous globes , must be luminous and visible itselg-that some of these innumerable portions of a solid body must have fallen to the earth ; which is not the case as none have been found  --  and that no supportable projectile force , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a velocity , as these meteors undoubtedly move with . A correspondent of the New-York Journal of Commerce , who says he prefers " buck-wheat cakes and coffee to speculations in philosophy , " started a theory , or rather stated a hint for a theory , while waiting for his breakfast , which proves , at least , that his epicurism has not spoiled his philosophy , and which deserves mention , if only for its novelty and ingenuity . He adopts , as an undoubted fact , the opinion that there was more than one point of radiation , and that the observers , at different places , did not see the same meteors . It is well known , or , at least , certainly believed , that the solar system , and all the planetary systems , are revolving around some unknown centre of all systems , and that , consequently , the earth is constantly making a new path in absolute space . He , therefore , supposes that these meteoric phenomena may be accounted for by the passage of the earth through the tail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter for several millions of miles behiiid it , or through one of the nebula , which the lastest observations of Dr. Herschel led him to suppose were a shining fluid , formed from the light continually issuing from the innumerable suns , which fill the immensity of space . In the passage of the earth through these nebula , or that tail , their substance would mix with the earth 's atmosphere , and be attracted to its surface ; and the writer referred to , thinks this would satisfactorily explain the prominent indica // tions of the phenomenon . This theory is as plausible as most , and more so than many , which have been proposed , and , like a thousand other theories , needs only the support of well-established facts to render it the true one . It has an advantage over others , that it is not confined to the atmosphere of earth , but has the range of universal space , in which to gather its facts . Till that is explored , it has no chance of being refuted . But , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such extensive phenomena , are opposed to some of the known laws of nature , and the constitution of the atmosphere , and are fast being exploded , we shall only allude to that , which ascribes these meteors to the agency of electricity . This element is undoubtedly adequate to the production of effects on a scale as magnificent as those recently witnessed , and the only known agent competent to such effects . It is universally diffused throughout the earth , and exists in great abundance in the upper regions of the atmosphere , and , perhaps , to an indefinite extent beyond it . Causes , many of which are known , are continually operating , often on a scale of vast extent , to produce electrical excitation . Is it not then very probable that this agent , every where present , every where active , of vast , versatile , and unknowzi powers , would , under particular modifying circumstances , which we are yet to learn , produce the brilliant exhibition recently witnessed ? We know not how to avoid an affirmative answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Brown University , and there are many circumstances , in the late phenomenon , which powerfully confirm the theory of electric agency . At Lynchburg , Virginia , strong electric symptoms were noticed . The gold beat electrometer was excited by a touch . Bennet 's electrometer , placed on the prime conductor , with the cushion insulated , rose on a slight motion of the machine ; and the pendulum of De Luc 's dry pile was accelerated . The Aurora Borealis , which is undoubtedly of electric origin , was distinctly visible in many places , particularly at Buffalo , and Warren , Ohio . A gentleman , who writes from the latter place , states that , on the evening before , he observed his clothes to be strongly charged with electricity , which , on considerable motion , was emitted in brilliant sparks . In the former place it is stated that the air was frequently illuminated with flashes of light , in no way differing from the ordinary silent electric explosions , called heat lightn*ng . There were many other indications of a highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned the occurrence of a heavy thunder-storm , on the following night , in several places . But , after all , the most that can be said of the electric theory is , that , in the present state of knowledge , it is the most probable theory , which the future developments of science may confirm or overthrow.
