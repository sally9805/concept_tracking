txt WE are glad to find that a good translation has been made of the Paroles d'un Croyant . It is a work of great power and interest . Its character is chiefly political , and it relates particularly to the present state of things in France . It is written in the style of the Hebrew prophets , and in the form of visions contains the most violent denunciations of kings . An uncommon dignity is conferred upon the work by the s- ntiments of deep religious faith with which it abounds , and which would seem to place it far above the common standard of democratic writings in Europe . Much doubt , however , has been expressed with regard to the sincerity of the author . in 1829 , the Abb6 de Ia Mennais was called , in the English periodicals , the Apostle of Royalism . ' He was the firm adherent of the Bourbons , and seemed to entertain a degree of reverence for abstract royalism . He appeared to be filled with that sentiment which is called loyalty , and which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and family of the sovereign , existing perhaps as strongly in many who have never even seen him , // as in those who have been bred in his presence , - a feeling orioinating in a high quality of the mind , but leading not unfrequently to disastrous consequences . Thus we judge the Abbe de la 1iennais to have felt , and thus he was described by the liberal journals , during the reign of Charles X. And now , in 1833 , only four years after being distinguished as the apostle of royalism , he publishes a work of the most inflammatory nature , instigating his countrymen to declare perpetual war against kings , and tracing to the wickedness of monarchs all the ills with which the land is filled , and under which Euiope is groaning . Whether he be sincere or not , we do not pretend to judge ; loyalty is generally too deep a feeling to be speedily changed . Yet we are of opinion that enough has occurred in France and throughout the continent , since the commencement of 1830 , fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are ready enough to believe , that the feelings expressed in this work have flowed from an honest mind . A cry of indignation and anguish comes wafted on the chilling blast from Siberia ; a voice rises from the flames of Poland , from the dungeons of Austria , from the tombs of the slaughtered citizens of France , and repeats in awful tones the lesson , Put not your trust in Princes ; ' and all men of free and noble minds will catch the sound and repeat its echoes . It matters little to us , however , whether the work in question he the result of disappointed ambition or of generous and manly feeling ; there is enough in the present condition of France , to account for the appearance of such a book , without looking farther for the motives of the author . It is chiefly interesting to us who dwell at a distance , as one of the most remarkable signs of the times . Such books are not the result of ordinary circumstances ; they never appear in times of tranquillity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when the battle is to be fought between oppression and liberty , when principles are unsettled , when rights are claimed but unacknowledged , and the colossal shadow of power is advancing with its blighting influences , that these dark signs and omens are displayed , announcing times of confusion and war , and xrith fear of change perplexing monarchs . ' Such is the present state of things in France . Though the government is strong , and the king sits perhaps as firmly on his throne as any monarch in Christendom , there is still going // on in that country a mighty revolution , which commenced at least a century ago , and will not perhaps be finished for a century to come ; a revolution in the mind and character of the people . Historians commit a great error in giving us the results of a revolution , for the revolution itself . A civil war , a change of dynasty , or even of the form of a government , the elevation of one prince , or the death or banishment of another , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its origin and existence are in the mind of the people at large , and it continues as long as the change is there taking place . To the philosophical observer the revolution of France commenced as early as the reign of Louis XIV . ; and it has proceeded with unimpeded step through the successive years to the present time . The tragic reign of Louis XVI. , the horrors of the republic , the romantic career of Napoleon , the restoration , the exploits of July , the *meutes of the reign of Louis Philippe , are but different events in a great revolution , which , finding its origin in the character of the people , will not cease till the stormy elements of that character shall have subsided into harmony and peace . This is the only view of the French revolution , which can console us for the horrors by which it has been signalized . In the minds of many , there is nothing to expiate its crimes , - no ray of light falls upon the dark picture of cruelty and suffering it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the time is regarded as an axvful chasm in the history of man , cut off alike from the past and the future , teaching no lesson but the wickedness of our nature , the strength of the people wasted by its own violence , and the nation recovering at last from the delirium , like the raving Hercules , only to sit down and weep over its slaughtered children . These views are natural to men who witnessed the fearful days of the reign of terror ; and we have deep sympathy and respect for the feelings of those who have uttered , in loud and indignant tones , their detestation of deeds which seemed to be the work of fiends rather than mortals ; but we still have some doubt whether such persons are the best fitted to judge of the effects of these deeds . Few are dispo*ed , at the moment when the tornado is passing over them , destroying their dwellings and ruining their harvest , to speculate upon the healthy atmosphere that will ensue , the increased fertility of their flooded fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins around them . All thought is absorhed in the terror of the moment . So it is with those who have lived in the midst of the hurricane of revolution ; another generation must grow up before its good effects can he comprehended . But the time has now come , when it is beginning to be acknowledged that much good has been accom pushed . The American traveller , who for the first time passes over from England into France , is impressed with the fact , that a greater degree of personal freedom exists in the latter country . In France , the mighty families of olden time have been cut off ; the peerage is a shadow ; vast estates have been broken up and divided among independent landholders , republican simplicity has taken the place of aristocratic wealth . This is the work of the early revolution . Nor was it a work of time ; the fetters were suddenly hurst , and the people found themselves free ; the doors of the dungeon were opened and the captive walked forth unrestrained , the whole earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the nation it was apparent , when they first paused from their deeds of violence , that a mighty object was already accomplished . Their oppressors had vanished , their freedom was achieved . A vast gulf , never to be repassed , in whose wreck-strewed waves lay weltering staff and mitre , sceptre and diadem , now rolled between them and their bondage , and , like the emancipated people of old , they boldly sounded forth the anthem of liberty , though a wilderness of confusion and anarchy was before their . The vast efforts which characterized the first revolution of France were not wasted . Even under the iron despotism of Napoleon , we can still discern their effects in the energies which bore him on to conquest . The tide of revolution was never rolled back upon itself ; Napoleon had the genius to direct its course , and it wafted him onward to universal sway , but to check it was beyond his power . It was never to be checked ; and France at his downfall , conquered and humbled , with the stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , was still free ; free through the blood that had been poured out in her early struggles ; free because the spirit which had given rise to them was enshrined in the hearts of her children , and could never be quelled . Much has been done by the French towards the establishment // of free institutions ; but much still remains for them to do . The events of the present reign indicate but too plainly , that attempts may be successfully made to diminish their liberties ; that they have yet much to learn in the great lesson of constitutional freedom ; and that years must roll away , before their ri0hts will be so fully appreciated and understood by them , as to leave no danger of their being usurped by their rulers . A glance at the system of policy pursued since the accession of Louis Philippe to the throne , will throw some light upon the causes of that bitterness of feeling , displayed by the Abh* de la Mennais in his visions of the characters of kings . In judgingof this system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never was * course of policy more ably and honestly defended ; yet never was there an opposition , which enlisted in its ranks men of greater political experience and sagacity , or of purer patriotism . The system has been successful in accomplishing its objects ; it has triumphed over all obstacles and restored tranquillity to France , while it has preserved the peace of Europe . The very circumstance of its triumph gives a prepossession in its favor . The sufferings and outraged feelings of the defeated party , the price of the victor ) T , the good that has been left undone , the high hopes that are crushed , the ardent aspirations that are turned to sickness of heart , are forgotten in the splendor of the power which now holds almost undisputed sway over the destinies of France . On the other hand , the event of the system advocated by the opposition party is doubtful . In the opinion of many , the horrors of civil contention , arising from the attempts of the Carlists to restore the fallen dynasty , the flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of bloody revolutions , and resulting a second time perhaps in the defeat of the French armies , the humiliating sight of the allied despots in the capital , and the still more humiliating restoration of the thrice ejected race , might have been the consequences of the course of policy which Lafayette would have adopted . The memory of the disasters which befel the republic is still fresh in the minds of many of the active men of the day they recollect that the honor of France was only saved by one man ; and that the same genius , which enabled him to rescue his country from the dangers which impended , afterwards placed him in the undisputed and unlimited control of her destinies , // and gave him the  |p6wer  to trample on her liberties ; they rememher the tears of patriots shed over the defeat of their dearest hopes , the groans of the aged from whom their last child had been torn to he murdered on the hattie-field , the return of that hranded and degraded family , forced hack upon the revolting country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bloodshed ; and they beheld France in 1830 , after the revolution , in much the same relation with regard to the other nations of Europe , that she held when Napoleon was first called to the command of her armies . The course advocated hy the opposition , would , in their opinion , lead to very similar results , - a different system must he adopted , they would say , and this is precisely the one which has been followed , - the juste milieu between the exploded principles of legitimacy and the bold and hazardous career of Napoleon . We shall endeavor , in the course of our article , to show that these apprehensions were ill-founded . But we would first ask , has the juste milieu system responded to the intentions of those who placed its authors in power ? Has it ansxvered the expectations of those noble spirits through whom the last revolution was achieved ? Has it advanced the cause of liberty in France ? Has it redeemed the solemn pledges which were given to the lovers of freedom throughout Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have those who originated this system , fulfilled the destinies which were entrusted to them ? If they have not , the system is a had one and ought to be held up to reprobation . We are desirous that the course of policy , both internal and external , pursued in France , since the revolution of July , should he viewed as it deserves : the consideration of it involves some of the principles which areof vital importance to our own liherties , and we shall be pardoned , we trust , if we devote a few pages to the effort to place it in a proper point of view . In the first place , then , it seems important to determine with whom the system originated . It was the general opinion after M. Casimir Perier was called to the presidency of the council , and up to the time of his death , that the juste milieu policy had been conceived and maintained by his talents ; and not a few were expecting some marked change in the system upon the event of his death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued with equal energy and success ; and it soon became apparent to all reflecting persons , that the // system had emanated from a higher source than the distinguished prime minister ; that it had been devised and commenced previously to his appointment , and that a more skilful hand than his had held the reins of government . Nor was it long before the master-spirit was revealed . There was one , whose earlier days had been nurtured in the stern school of adversity ; to whom the camp and the battle-field were as the routine of daily life ; whom more than twenty years of exile , not passed like those of the banished monarchy , in the midst of the pomp and parade and flattery of pretended regal state , but in the realities of penury , flight , and concealment , had hardened into determined and adventurous manhood ; who , hunted from land to land , wandering from the mountains of Switzerland to the dreary wastes of Lapland , and the northernmost cape of Europe , and finding no resting-place in the old world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lessons of poverty and suffering in the new ; and who , in his sojournings in many a foreign land , had acquired a profound insight into national character , an experience in judging of systems of government and anticipating great political events scarcely equalled , a calmness , perseverance , and courage in prosecuting his objects , which might have been the envy of the greatest statesmen that have lived ; and who , anxious rather to conceal , than display , the extent of his political influence and sagacity , had been content with seeing his measures pursued , while the odium or the glory they created were alike indifferent to him . The death of Perier began to open the eyes of men to the true author of a system , which had been attributed solely to him . And a short time afterwards . when the bloody days of June had effected the final , decisive triumph of the administration , the smoke of the battle rolled away from the blood-stained streets of the metropolis , and with it , like a mist , rolled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed to astonished and baffled speculators the true founder of the juste milieu system , in the person of the king . There were many , however , to whom this revelation afforded no surprise . To keen and experienced observers , it was obvious that the system had been struck out and adopted , before Perier was called to the ministry . A statesman such as Louis Philippe has proved himself , ( and he is now generally allowed to be one of the first of the age , ) was not to be influenced in // his projects , intentions , or policy by a change of ministers ; he was not a man to be governed by circumstances . With experience and talent enough to discover , almost at a glance , the whole situation of his country at the moment of his accession to the throne , and with decision and courage enough to fix upon a plan which appeared to him suited to the state of things , it was not to be expected that he should yield himself to the advice and direction of ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ascendency . He saw at once , that his only safety depended upon the resolute adoption of some clearly defined system of policy , not to be abandoned till necessity should compel him . It is by no means improbable , that the course to be pursued in the event of his accession to the throne , had been decided upon by Louis Philippe even before the revolution . It must have been obvious to him , that a change was approaching , and might take place at any convenient moment ; and though the folly and madness of the king , which immediately caused the revolution of July , could not , perhaps , have been anticipated , still it was not difticult to perceive that the retrograde policy of the monarch must be finally checked , and that the reaction would be powerful in proportion to the obstinacy with which this policy was continued . It was obvious that Louis Philippe was likely to be called to the head of the government in the event of a revolution , or at least , that this event was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen dynasty to secure his person , is spoken of by political writers as one of the numerous proofs of that extraordinary blindness , with which the administration appeared to be struck on this momentous occasion . Could a new Chamber of Deputies have been elected immediately after the events of July , it is very likely a different policy might have been adopted . In the enthusiasm of the moment , it is not improbable that there would have been retums from nearly all France , of men who would have united in one great party , at the head of which would have been Lafayette , Dupont de l'Eure , Lafitte , Odillon Barrot , and others of that stamp , whose measures it would have been vain for the Duke of Orleans , even if he had been called to the throne , to oppose or attempt to direct . But the Chamber had been already elected but a short time before the close of the reign of Charles ; and though composed of a large majority of men liberal for the time , it was still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which made its appearance at the moment of the revolution . They were men who , if the reign of Charles had continued , would have constituted a powerful , honest , and independent opposition , or more probably they would have gained the ascendency , and a ministry would have been selected from their number ; hut after the revolution , they were not ready to meet the bold views of Lafayette and his party . They were completely juste milieu men , and the king whom they had made , manifested his sagacity in devising a system which , while it was adapted to the views of a majority in the Chamber , and would be likely to receive their support , was the one which appeared the safest for himself and the best suited to his capacities . We do not mean , however , to convey the idea , that if the king had ( letermined to follow the counsels of the more liberal party , he would have been opposed by this Chamber . They were in a complete state of doubt and uncertainty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now cage ny looked forward to the emancipation of all Europe as the result of their own glorious struggle , and as the great work which was before them to do , and the fixed partiahities , on the other hand , of those who were still desirous of restoring the fallen dynasty . They would probably have been ready to give their support to a much bolder policy than that actually adopted by the king , but they were not likely to originate any system of themselves . With such a Chamber , it was easy for the king to choose that course which seemed best to himself ; and he alone , therefore , must be considered resl ) onsibhe for the one which was adopted . His first object was to employ every means to fix himself firmly on the throne . He accordingly , in the letters which he addressed to the different sovereigns announcing lii* accession , assumed a style more becoming a suppliant tributary than tl ) e monarch of a first-rate power . The passionate impotence of the Duke of Modena , who returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet that smile , had it rested on the lip of Napoleon , might have cost the duke his principality . But the cringing letter of Louis Philippe to the Emperor of Austria , in which he speaks of the glorious revolution of July as a catastrophe , and the haughty reply of the autocrat , were alike degrading to the national honor of France , and insulting to the feelings of freemen throughout the world . The next act which disgraced the administration was the // abandonment of the Spanish refugees . Several hundreds of them , after the revolution of July , flocked into France , where they received money and passports for Spain . Two of the ministers , MM . Guizot and Montalivet , had personal interviews with some of them , the result of which was that they resolved again to attempt the recovery of their liberties . And what was the consequence ? They were abandoned to the mercy of a monarch , who refused to recognise the revolution of July , and the king whom it had placed upon the throne , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lafayette ) had addressed a circular to all the authorities of the kingdom , most insulting to Louis Philippe and hostile to the principles of July " " The brother of the unhappy Riego expelled from Paris , Torrijos , the old Lope de Calderon , the noble Pinto , and fifty others , martyrs of liberty , forced into the snare and assassinated without trial on the part of Spain , without remonstrance on the part of France , who had placed arms in their hands . " Such were the consequences of the trust , which these victims reposed in the good faith of the government of the barricades . The first cabinet was of short duration ; it quailed before the fierce spirits of Paris , and retired fiom office , not daring , as is supposed , to incur the responsibilities attendant upon the impending trial of the ex-ministers . The new cabinet enlisted , however , several of the same members , with Lafitte for iL president . It was during his administration that the system adopted by the king began to show a decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the expiration of five months , the patriotic and generous prime-minister , the long-tried friend of the king , who had sacrificed a princely fortune for the good of his country , discovered that he was no longer in the confidence of the king and the other members of the cabinet . His honest views were thwarted , his plans countermined , his measures palsied . Lafayette and Dupont de l'Eure had already been driven to resign , by the action of a system utterly opposed to their views . " And the result of these two resignations , " says M. Pepin , one of the most zealous defenders of Louis Philippe , " was to cause the moderate element , ( that is the juste milieu , ) to triumph in the cabinet as it had triumphed in the Chamber . " The immediate cause of Lafitte 's resignation is said to have been this . On the 5th of March , a courier arrived at the hotel of M. Sebas // tiani , minister of foreign affairs , with a despatch from Marshal Maison , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatch contained these remarkable words . " I am now convinced , that in order to avert the dangers which threaten France , it is necessary without delay , and before tbe levies of Austria can be organized , to take the first step in the war , and throw an army into Piedmont . " This important communication was xvithheld from the president of the council for two days after its arrival ; and it was only upon his urgent demand , when he had accidentally heard of its having come to hand , that he was permitted to read it . This want of confidence on the part of the king and the minister of foreign affairs , showed Lafitte that it was time for him to xvithdraw from the cabinet ; and he immediately sent in his resignation . It was evident , that the king or his cabinet had adopted already a system opposed to his own and to that of the friends of freedom , who had ranged themselves under the banners of Lafayette . And even at this time a name was not wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deputation from Gaillac , in January , had used the following words . " We will endeavor to keep ourselves in a just medium ( juste milieu ) equally distant from the abuses of royal power and from the excesses of popular power . " " And in those words , " says M. Pepin , " was unfolded an entire system in which the king prides himself . " Casimir Perier was now called to the presidency of the council , and the system in which the king prided himself , was at once openly avoxved and vindicated . A powerful opposition appeared against it , but unequal to its supporters in numbers . At the bead of this party were the Lafayettes , Gd cn Barrot , Dupont de l'Eure , Lamarque and others , whose names are identified with liberty over the whole earth . The juste milieu however prevailed . The elective franchise was tampered with , and finally so established , that the thirty-two millions who people the soil of France , afford at the highest estimate but about two hundred thousand voters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Holland were driven from every hold in the country except the citadel of Antwerp , from which their cannon threatened destruction to the fairest city in Belgium . An armistice succeeded , while the cunning Talleyrand was wasting his time at the conference of London , in endeavoring to arrange by articles and protocols , an affair that was becoming ridiculous by its long // continuance , and which a single word from the king of France might have settled . But the juste milieu system must be persevered in . The Duke of N6mours was refused to the Belgians for their king , and it was not till more than a year afterwards , when the great powers had evinced in the clearest manner possible , that nothing could drive them to a war , that a quasi pledge of support was given to Belgium in the person of a princess of France , and the French cannon turned against the citadel of Antwerp , from whose walls the nation had so long been mocked by the troops of the king of Holland . Meantime , the revolution burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left to fight their battles unaided , against the overwhelming power of Russia . It is needless to recall the brilliant exploits , the dazzling victories , the sad defeats , and the ruin and desolation which ensued in that unhappy war . No helping hand was extended by France ; no voice of encouragement was offered . The struggle was at length over , and the stillness of death succeeded . And then the French minister of foreign affairs dared to insult the nation by the formal declaration , that " order reigns in Warsaw . " Yes ! the order that reigns over the blackened and smoking ruin , - the order of the tomb and the charnel house , - the order of death . The insurrections in Italy were not more successful nor better sustained by the aid of France . A few troops were thrown into Ancona , only to elicit the enthusiasm of the people at the sight of their tan-colored flag , - . to show that Austria was unwilling to be drawn into a war on any condition , - to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm was raised to check the operation of that bloody edict of Cardinal Albani . Thus ended the last struggle for liberty in Europe ; and the monarch of France sat smiling on his throne , while tyranny was triumphantly striding over the continent , and the victims of its cruelty were stretching forth their hands in voin to him whose duty it was to rescue them . The strength of the *overnrnent was now increasing ; eleven millions of francs **er annum were voted by the obsequious Chambers for the civil list , to that citizen king who had solemnly promised to dispense with any such provision . The insurrections at Lyons , Grenoble and other cities in the south of France , were juelled by the standing army ; and the national guard , that early object of jealousy and terror , was disban ( led throughout a large portion of the kingdom . Finally , // came the battles of the 5th and 6th of June 1332 , to establish beyond a question the power of the administration . Up to this time , some outrage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the battles of June were more than a common erneute . Had the insurgents succeeded , the affair might , perhaps , have been called another glorious revolution ; as it resulted , it is characterized , and probably with justice , as a mad rebellion . We shall not attempt to offer any excuse for those who were in arms against the government on this occasion . We hold in abhorrence this hasty appeal to arms , which characterizes the inhabitants of Paris ; and we believe that although it was provoked hy the jealous severity of the police , it was still unjustifiable on every ground . But we reflect with sorrow and indignation upon the vindictive measures of the government , upon that occasion . When we think of the bloody victory that was gained , - of that awful tragedy in the parish of St. Mary , where two hundred young men from the schools of Paris had entrenched themselves in a house , upon which the veteran Soult , commanding in person , was pouring the cross fire of artillery from two streets ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty or death as they met the invading troops , or threw themselves in reckless despair from the windows upon the bristling bayonets beneath ; when we think of how much was lost to their country in this profitless warfare ; when our imagination turns to their homes , over which a blight has come forever , to the tears of their mothers , to the gray hairs which have been brought down in sorrow to the grave , and when we remember who was the author of this bloody drama , we can feel some sympathy with the denunciations of the Ahb6 de la Mennais . The victory of St. M*ry was folloxved up by military law established in the capital , crowds swept away to the prisons to linger unheard of for months , trials instituted without number , schools broken up ; the finest portion of the national guard disbanded , and a despotic police pervading the city , breaking into the I rioting-offices , and violating domestic retirement . Despotism never used a more effective tool than Louis Philippe found in his prefect of police , Gisquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper person to persecute the vanquished , to render their imprisonment wretched , to trample the populace still lower . " Your husband is one of those wretches whom I will exterminate , " was his answer to a poor // woman far advanced in pregnancy , who had come to the office of the police to inquire for her husband , who had been hurried with the crowd into the indiscriminate prison . Thus was the power of the government established . Many months elapsed before any serious disturbances took place in Paris , - and these , together with the renewed insurrections in Lyons , were readily quelled . The capture of the Duchess of Bern in la Vende* , put an end to the war in that province and the circumstances which occurred during her imprisonment , threw such i'idicule upon herself and the whole party , that they have never seriously disturbed the peace oF the country since that time . The opposition generally has been declining . The last returns to the Chambers gave an overwhelming majority in favor of the administration ; and the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , were left to mourn in silence over their fallen hopes , or to offer their unavailing resistance to the encroachments of arbitrary power . At this moment of humiliation and sorrow to all true lovers of freedom , it pleased the Almighty arbiter of human destinies to call to himself that distinguished patriot and bern , whose name has been the watchword of liberty in two worlds for the last half century . We shall not venture , in this place , to offer any eulogy upon Lafayette . The record of his noble deeds , his dazzling career , his stern integrity , his invincible fortitude , is engraved in ineffaceable characters on the heart of every true American . His noblest triumph was the beartfelt welcome of a nation ; his highest eulogy its universal mourning . He has been called away when the measure of his destiny was full ; and the work assigned him to do on the earth was accomplished . He has been removed from a scene , which would have harrowed up his feelings and embittered his life , and where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . But , alas , for the suffering country he has left I she has lost the best friend of her liberties ,  --  the steadiest foe of her tyrants . Alas , for the exiles from every land , who felt that while Lafayette lived , they still had a home ; they are again scattered , and wanderers on the face of the earth , - their friend , their protector , their father is gone , - and the cup of their bereavement is full . We have thus endeavored to set forth in a hasty sketch , the principal features of the juste milieu system , and to show that its real author is the king . // Still it xviii be said that this system , though odious and deplorable , is , on the whole , the best that could have been devised for the actual state of the country . The usual arguments in favor of the system are , 1st . That it has saved Europe from a series of the most disastrous wars and frightful revolutions , while it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hopes of the exiled party , and prevented the recurrence of that frightful licentiousness which blackened the cause of the early revolution . 2d . That no pledge of assistance had been given to Poland or any other nation in Europe , which should attempt to assert its rights . As to the first of these reasons , it appears hy no means certain , that a bolder policy on the part of France would have led to a general war in Europe . The position of the country with regard to the other powers of the continent was very different from what it had been when war was declared by Louis XVI . The despots of Russia , Austria and Prussia , had then much to learn , - and the lesson was taught them in a manner never to be forgotten . They had then , for the first time , to experience what efforts the awakened liberties of a people can make ; how vain is the attempt to conquer them , how impossible it is to roll back the tide of freedom when it comes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old order of things might be restored ; that a conquering army could hend back the minds of an enfranchised l ) eople to the yoke ; that the fat of an emperor could conjure up the departed form of despotism , or breathe the breath of life into its mangled remains . They had yet to learn that when a great nation has become inspired with the love of liberty , all the power on earth can not force it back to subjection ; it may be conquered , annihilated , but not en slaved . The people of Europe , also , had then a great lesson to learn from the French nation . They were to be taught that they have rights which no man may violate , - that it is their duty to assert these riohts - that their condition in the scale of being may be raised above the rank to which it has been forced down , - that freedom is not the dream of antiquity , a school-boy 's tale , but a living , enkindling , exalting reality , which it belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned by the nations of Europe before the revolution of July . The humbled monarchs had yielded and fled before the idol of a people mad with liberty ; - they had seen that Europe could not bound their energies and their ambition ; // they had felt their power , and they well knew that , had not the idol of a conquering people betrayed his enthusiastic wor shippers , they would never have been overcome . They had indeed heen conquered , hut not till they had propagated the doctrines of freedom throughout the continent . That name , which it was impiety to utter when it was first heard , had now become the sacred watch-word of patriots ; it had been wafted to the distant regions of Poland and Lithuania , it had penetrated to Sweden and Norway , spread itself over the vast extent of Germany , and revived with more than classic ardor on the hallowed soil of Italy . The Austrian trembled on his throne at its portentous sound , and the Russian autocrat was not deaf to it in the capital of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the ancient dynasty had been forced back upon them , and the old order of things did , in some sort , appear to be restored . Europe was slumbering in tranquillity , when the calm was broken as by a peal of thunder . rrhe revolution of July came not merely to vindicate the assaulted rights of a people ; it had a higher destiny than this ; it exalted the very character of liberty itself ; it showed that this divine principle has a power of life which is beyond the reach of tyrants that it can not be destroyed ; that although it may seem for a time to be extinguished , it will blaze forth with tenfold power at some moment when it may least be expected . It would be difficult to describe the amazement and consternation , which seized the various governments of Europe at the news of this ominous event . Their terror was manifest to the most careless observer ; the very hirelings of tyranny , the lowest menials of legitimacy reflected , in their pallid countenances , the panic which filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxy futile are congresses of monarchs and intrigues of cabinets , how powerless are paper treaties , how like the merest cobweb are the cunning contrivances of diplomatists , when compared with the power of a people who have once known what it is to be free . In this state of general consternation , we are of opinion that , had France assumed a menacing attitude , Russia would gladly have compounded for her own tranquillity , by complying with the long neglected articles of the treaty of Vienna in respect to the independence of Poland , and that Austria would have removed some portion , at least , of the intolerable burden im // posed upon Lombardy and the Papal states . We do not believe that a war would have ensued , had France insisted strenuously on the recognition of the rights of these two countries , for , as the event has proved , there never was a time when the great powers evinced a stronger reluctance to a war , than since the last French revolution . Notwithstanding the pacific disposition of France , there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might have led to a war , and fifty years before would have done so , and which nevertheless have been suffered to pass unnoticed , or have been adjusted by diplomacy , ihat the skill of politicians in predicting the future has been completely baffled . That the Emperor of Russia should have remained at rest , while his kinsman of Holland was driven step by step from Belgium , till not a foot of earth was left in that province which he could call his own , that Austria should have put up tamely with the defiance at Ancona , that the northern powers should have looked on quietly while one strong-hold of legitimacy was destroyed in Portugal , and that they should have suffered the constitutional cause to make head in Spain , without raising an arm to arrest its progress , are facts for which no precedent , we believe , can be found in the past history of Europe . That the great powers had reason to be alarmed , and that a war would have been almost ruinous to them , there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liheral principles had been disseminated throughout the continent ; that a restless spirit was at work and that the mass of the people was moved by it ; they felt that the doctrines of legitimacy had been undermined , and that their thrones rested upon a hollow foundation . Their apprehensions were well-grounded ; in a few days after they received the tidings of the French revolution , the flames burst forth in Belgium , and again with redoubled fury in Poland . A war with France , they well knew , would only extend the mischief . A series of revolutions would have ensued , the most fearful , perhaps , that the earth ever witnessed ; the continent would have been deluged with blood , and empires and kingdoms , states and principalities , confounded in one common ruin . The consequences of such a war , it appears to us , were vastly more to be dreaded by the three great powers , than by France . It is a common argument against such a course of policy , that a war would have led inevitably to insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in the overthrow of the government . These fears we believe to be without sufficient foundation . Upon the accession of Louis Philippe to the throne , the nation was divided into three great parties . The first of these was represented by Lafayette , and was foremost in the cause of liberal principles . Their watchword was non-intervention , and their great principle was , that no power should be allowed to interfere with the spread of the cause of freedom . That Austria , for instance , should not be suffered to interpose between the Pope and his subjects in the northern legations , who were struggling for their rights . Their motives were pure and their designs benevolent and noble . They had none of the ambition , the grasping of power , and the love of conquest which characterized Napoleon . They never desired war , save in behalf of a people suffering from tyranny , and struggling to be free ; nor did they wish to interfere till this struggle had actually begun . They offered nothing but their own splendid example , to induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as any one the effects of a war , but they believed that there were considerations of a higher import than the maintenance of peace . The next party , if indeed it can be so named , consisted of the juste milieu men . They were represented in the Chamber by those men whom we have already described , as decidedly liberal , had the reign of Charles continued , but vxho still were not ready to join heartily with the more liberal party which the revolution formed . They would not have offered any resistance had the king decided upon a bolder policy ; but they , with equal or greater readiness , fell in with the prudent measures which he actually adopted . This party was probably the largest in the kingdom ; yet this circumstance is of smaller consequence from the consideration , that the decision of the king would have carried with it large numbers . and the policy which he should have adopted , would , undoubtedly , have had the support of a ma , jority from among this party . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisans of the fallen dynasty . This party enlisted in its ranks a large number of removed office-holders , who , having lost their support , were ready to do anything to restore the former state of things . Besides these , were numbers who adhered to the Bourbons from true loyalty , and finally , a few miserable // slaves , whom fifty years ' experience had taught nothing of freedom , and who , now hugging the links of their broken chains , were longing for servitude again . Much was apprehended from this party in case of a war . But the event seems to have proved that these apprehensions were groundless . When we remember the total want of enthusiasm with which the Duchess of Bern was received in the southern provinces , and in every part of France which she traversed , except the province of La Vend*e , the very trifling effect which the war in that quarter produced , especially when compared with the outrages of the opposite party in Paris and Lyons , and which were occasioned by the juste milieu system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaded party was rendered powerless by the shame which a silly woman had cast upon it , we can not but believe that the Carlist party was too contemptible to have been taken into consideration in deciding upon the policy to be pursued by the cabinet of Louis Philippe . In choosing a bolder system , the government at any rate would have only had to encounter the violence of this party ; whereas the juste milieu system ensured the opposition of two different parties , the Liberals and the Carlists ; and on one occasion , one deplorable occasion , was witnessed the unholy coalition of the two , in arms against the government . In the event then of a war , we firmly believe that the administration would have had less opposition to contend with at home , than the juste milieu system actually encountered . It will perhaps be objected to this argument , that we have made no mention of the republican party from which the government had more to fear than from any other ; that this party , which has been the terror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , and the southern cities of France , and was only repressed by a powerful armed force , would have proved too strong for the government , if the army had been employed in forei0n service . We reply to these remarks , that republicanism , as a party , hardly existed in France at the commencement of the present rei0n . Lafayette , the foremost of the liberal party , was convinced that the time was not yet come for a republic in France ; and nearly the whole of his party agreed with him in this opinion . The name of republicanism was full of terror to a large portion of the best citizens of France , and was only popular with a few . The liberal party were completely satisfied , all but an inconsiderable // number of reckless spirits , with a constitutional monarchy . But the contemptible policy of the juste milieu actually formed a republican party , by no means insignificant for numbers or talent . Wearied with the exhibition of king-craft , sick with deferred hopes and maddened with oppression , thousands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen king , and a throne based upon constitutional principles , were driven into the ranks of ultra-opposition , and became the dread and scourge of the administration . Had the system of Lafayette been adopted , the republicans , as a party , would have had no considerable power , and the king would have received the support of two parties , embracing by far the greatest portion of the talent and wealth , as well as the physical power of the kingdom . When we take into account , also , the number of paupers to whom a war would have given employment , and the amount of industry which it would have put into operation , we feel confident that domestic troubles would have been very trifling in the event of a general war . The allied powers feared nothing , then , so much as war ; and with good reason while on the other hand , they were reasonably expecting and dreading a commencement of hostilities on the part of France . The position of France , at the moment immediately succeeding the revolution of July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . With the finest army in Europe , completely equipped , a flourishing commerce , the treasury enriched by the spoils of recent conquest , standing foremost in the cause of freedom and rejoicing in recovered liberty , we behold her occupying a more exalted condition , than when Napoleon had led her on to the plenitude of dominion . We reflect with heartfelt emotion upon the glorious power which she then might have exerted . She had but to speak the word , and the dungeons , where the martyrs of liberty were pining , would have been thrown open ; at the touch of her hand , the chains would have fallen from the captive . Freedom and happiness awaited her footsteps , and emancipated nations would have shouted her name in accents of enthusiastic gratitude . These were the splendid destinies for which she was apparently reserved . But they have not been fulfilled . The second argument in defence of thejuste milieu is , that no pledges had been given by the government to support Poland or Italy . Whether official promises had been sent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact was confidently // asserted by the opposition , though strongly denied by the administration . But we believe that pledges of a higher nature than written declarations or treaties had been given , not only to Poland and Italy , but to the lovers of freedom throughout Europe . The revolution of July was the most solemn pledge that could have been offered ; it came , not from a king and a cabinet , but a whole nation offered with their shouts of triumph , and sealed by their blood , not the result of diplomatic skill , but of ardent and elevated enthusiasm , the outpouring of unalloyed and noble sentiment . And thus it was received by the nations of Europe . They saw that it was for the interest of the liberal cause to do everything to increase itself ; that the friends of liberty have a common cause ; that the ordinary principles of national safety would make such a combination desirable to France , and not comprehending the possibility of such a system as the juste milieu , two nations fearlessly rose up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their expectations , though they reasoned upon just grounds ; they knew hy what sort of men the revolution of July had been achieved ; they were familiar with their sentiments and principles , and well knew what to expect from them . That the king whom they had raised to the throne , and the cabinet which proceeded from their numbers , should betray the principles which they were called to support , and the party to which they owed their political existence , was beyond the reach of human foresight to predict . The pledge might not have been written on parchment , and signed with the king 's hand , - but it was written in characters never to be obliterated , on the enduring page of history , and solemnly ratified by the blood of the revolution . Having witnessed the deplorable policy of the present king of France , and looking with horror upon the new and awful crimes which have stained the thrones of Europe within the past three years , the Abbe de Ia Mennais seems to have exerted his utmost powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarchs and their conspiracies against the rights of man , and to incite the people to rise in rebellion against them . He gives a picture of the first establishment of monarchies , in the third chapter of his work . " And I was transported in spirit to the times of old , and the earth was beautiful , and rich , and fertile , and her inhabitants were happy , because they lived like brethren . // " And J saw the serpent glide into the midst of them , he fixed upon some his fascinating glance , and their souls were troubled , and they drew near , and the serpent whispered unto them . " And when they had heard the words of the serpent they rose up and said , We are kings . ' " And the sun turned pale ; and the earth wore a mournful hue , like the shroud which envelopes the dead . " And a low murniur was heard , a long moan , and each one trembled in his heart . " Verily , I say unto you it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken up , and the deluge of great waters overflowed . Fear went from cottage to cottage , for there were then no palaces ; and she told to each one dreadful secret , which made him shudder . " And those who had said , We are kings , ' took a sword and followed fear from cottage to cottage . " And mystericrus deeds were acted there ; there were chains , and tears , and blood . " And the men affrighted , cried out , murder hath re-appeared on the earth . ' That cry was all , for fear had transfixed their souls and paralyzed their arms . " And they suffered themselves to he loaded with irons ; they , and their wives , and their little ones . And those who had said , We are kings , ' excavated as it were a great cavern , and they there shut up the whole human family , as beasts are shut up in a stall . " And the tempest drove the clouds , and the thunder rolled , and I heard a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not forever . ' " After that , I heard nothing but confused voices , laughter , sobbings , and blasphemies . " And I understood that there was to be a reign of Satan , before the reign of God . And I wept , and I hoped . " And the vision which I saw was true ; for the reign of Satan is accomplished , and the reign of God will be accomplished ; and those who have said , We are kings , ' shall be in their turn shut up in the cavern with the serpent , and the human race shall come forth , and it shall be for them like another birth , like the passage from death unto life . So may it be . " In the thirteenth chapter , which contains one of the most frightful of his visions , he seems to signify the formation of the Holy Alliance . We cite the whole chapter , though along one , because it appears to embody more of the spirit of the whole work than any other . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night hung heavily over the earth , like a covering of black marble over a tomb . " And nothing broke the stillness of that night , but a strange noise , as of the light rustling of wings , which at times is heard over the country and the city . " And then the darkness thickened , and every one felt his soul shrink within him , and a shudder run through his veins . " And in a hall hung with black , and lighted by the dull red glimmer of a single lamp , seven men , clothed in purple , with crowns upon their heads , were sitting upon seven seats of iron . " And in the middle of the hall was raised a throne composed of bones , and at the foot of the throne , in place of a footstool , there was a crucifix overturned ; and before the throne a table of ebony , and upon the table a vessel filled with blood , red and foaming , and a human skull . " And these seven men with crowns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sunken sockets , their eyes , from time to time , shot forth spark. * of livid fire . " And one of them raising himself , approached the throne with a tottering step , and placed his foot upon the crucifix . " At that moment his limbs trembled , and he seemed about to faint . The rest looked on him motionless ; they made not the slightest movement , but an indescribable expression passed over their features , and an unearthly smile contracted their lips . And he who had seemed about to faint , stretched forth his hand , and seized the vessel filled with blood , and poured it out into the skull and drank of it . " And the draught seemed to strengthen him . " And raising his head , this cry came forth from his breast , like ' the souiid of the dull death-rattle . " Cursed be Christ , who hath restored liberty to the earth ! ' And the other six crowned men raised themselves together , and together sent forth the same cry : Cursed be Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , sitting down again upon their seats of iron , the first said : My brethren , what shall we do to stifle liberty ? For our reign is finished if her 's commences . Our cause is the same ; let each one , therefore , propose that which shall seem good unto him . ' Hearken then ! this is my counsel . Before Christ came , * who was able to stand before us ? It is his relit*ion which hath ruined us Let us abolish the religion of Christ . ' " And they all answered ; it is true , let us abolish the religion of Christ . ' " And the second advanced toward the throne and took the human skull , poured blood into it , drank it , and spake as follows ; // " It is not religion alone which should be abolished , but learning and thought also ; for learning will discover that which it is not for our interest the world should know ; and thought is always ready to contend against force . ' " And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning and thought . ' " And after having done as the first two had done , a third spake ; When we shall have again plunged men into their stupidity , by taking from them religion , and learning , and thought , we shall have done much , but there will still remain something more for us to do . " The brute possesseth instinct and dangerous sympathies . It is necessary that one nation should not hear the cry of another people , lest if the one should murmur and rise , the other may be tempted to imitate . Let then , no murmuring from without penetrate our kingdoms . " And all answered ; it is true , let no murmuring from without penetrate our kingdoms . ' " And a fourth said ; We have our interest and the people have theirs opposed to ours ; if they unite to defend that interest against us , how shall we resist them ? ' " Divide and conquer . Let us make in every province ) iii every town , in every hamlet , an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of other proviiices . ' Jn this way , all will hate each other , and they will not think of uniting against us . ' And all answered ; it is true , divide and conquer ; concord would ruin us . ' " And a fifth having twice filled with blood , and twice emptied the skull , said : I approve of all these measures ; they are good , but insufficient . Make men brutes , it is well ; but frighten the brutes , strike terror into them by an inexorable justice , if yoa would not , sooner or latter , be devoured by them . The executioner is the prime-minister of a good prince . ' " And all answered : It is true , the executioner is the primeminister of a good prince . " And a sixth said : I acknowledge the advantage of prompt , terrible , and inevitable punishments . Still , there are heroic and desperate spirits who brave punishment . ' " Would you govern men easily , make them effeminate by voluptuousness . Virtue will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us exhaust'them by corruption . " And all answered , it is true ; let us exhaust strength , and energy , and courage , by corruption . ' " Then the seventh , having like the others , drank from the human skull , spake after this manner , his feet on the crucifix. // Down with Christ ! there is a war of extermination , eternal war betwixt him and us . " But how shall we detach the people from him ? It is a vain endeavor . What then shall be done ? Hearken unto me , - it is necessary to gain the priests of Christ with riches , with honors , and with power . " And they will command the people in the name of Christ , to be subject to us in all that we may do , in all that we may order . " And the people will believe them , and obey them for conscience ' sake ; and our power will be firmer than before . ' " And all answered , it is true ; let us gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp which lighted the hall went out , and the seven men vanished in the darkness . " And it was said to a righteous man , who at that moment watched and prayed before the cross ; my day approacheth , adore and fear nothing. ** Nothing can be better adapted to take a strong hold upon the minds of the people of France , and especially the Parisians , than a work of this kind . It has met , we are told by the translator , with an immense sale , and its influence has been so great , that the government has thought it necessary to cause a book to be written in reply to it , in the same style . The work is remarkable for its independence ; while it shows the strong features of several parties in politics , it belongs strictly to none . In the views it presents of the character of kings , and the ferocity which it exhibits when denouncing them , the book goes to the utmost length of the violent republicans of the metropolis ; but again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely removed from the creed of the liberal party . As a whole , this party may be said to have abandoned religion ; and to such a length do they carry their contempt for its sentiments , that when Silvio Pellic 0 's account of his imprisonment , ( a work which , in its apostolic gentleness and humble devotion , we consider the most powerful and touching appeal against tyranny ever made , ) was first published in France , the journals of the liheral party utterly refused to notice it on account of its religious character . With this party , therefore , the Abbe could not expect any sympathy whatever , in the love of God and of Christ which is enforced in every chapter of the work . Religion exists in no party in France , unless it be that of the friends of legitimacy ; and with these it is only valued in its connection with the state . As for the king 's party , the juste milieu men , they are // ready for religion or infidelity , just as the one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to the Abb&amp;s book , which is called Words of a Seer , Paroles d'un Voyant , they take the revolting side of atheism ; and the work commences in these woids " In the name of imperishable humanity , our God . " We doubt not , however , that there may be found in the kingdom of France numbers , who , like our author , ranging under no particular party , may still entertain sentiments of the most sincere religion , united with a love of freedom and of their country , and who will receive this work , almost as the words of an evangelist . There is , moreover , a power and beauty in the style , and an earnestness in the sentiments of liberty , which can not fail to recommend it to all but the blind advocates of legitimacy . While we sympathize in many respects most heartily with the author , and while we can not withhold our admiration for the doctrines of liberty and religion which the work contains , we still have very strong doubts whether the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good , especially with the people of France . The Abbe de Ia Mennais has come boldly forward as a teacher of the people ; but he has taught them the wrong lesson ; has directed their energies to the wrong object , and excited their feelings in a wrong cause . That they have a great lesson to learn , there can be no doubt ; that they are yet ignorant of the true basis upon which their liberties ought to be founded , is but too obvious , even to a careless observer ; and we grieve to find that the author , with all his power , has done but little to help them to this knowledge . His great mistake is iii endeavoring to excite the anirnosity and vengeance of th' people against the persons of kings , instead of cultivatin* in them a love for constitutional rights , which , when once breathed into a community , and existing as a lively principle in the minds of the people , will place it beyond the power of a monarch to become a tyrant . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them , have ever been too ready to fly to arms as a relief from their troubles ; from the time of the execution , ( we had almost said the murder ) of Louis XVI. , down to the attempt to assassinate Louis Philippe and his family in the Tuilleries , they have evinced little enough reverence for the person of the monarch . Towards the present king , we verily believe not an individual // bosom beats with a sentiment of loyalty ; and the monarch of France would now be judged in all cases nearly as a private citizen . There is little need of exciting the feelings of the populace against him , from any danger that may arise in a feeling of personal attachment . But there is great danger in exciting this lively and high-spirited people to acts of violence . The *meutes of the metropolis have been its disgrace and its curse ; and the scenes of blood which it has witnessed have done more , perhaps , than any other thing , to retard the progress of liberty , both in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France are in danger , no doubt ; and in danger from the monarch personally ; he has done much to turn hack the tide of freedom , - he has abandoned the principles which placed him upon the throne , - he has lawlessly imprisoned his innocent subjects , - he has checked the liberty of the press , - he has violated the charter in the most open and tyrannical manner ; and after all this , he remains more firmly than ever on the throne . How is it that tyranny has been thus triumphant ? How has a people , so nobly distinguished for their unquenchable love of freedom , so fearless in war , so lately triumphant over the legions of an oppressor , while the laurels won in the hallowed conflict were yet unfaded , how has this people again suffered itself to be trampled upon ? We answer , that although the monarch has betrayed the nation , still the great fault is in the people themselves ; they have been wanting to their own rights , - they have , by acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a tyrant , - they have mistaken the meaning of libe rty and disgraced its name , - they have been wanting , finally , in that reverence towards their constitution , without which no nation can he free . Here , then , was the great truth which the Abbe de Ia Mennais ought to have urged ; the love and respect for constitutional rights ; he ought to have represented , with all his eloquence , the majesty and sanctity of civil law and the sacred nature of the constitution ; he should have demonstrated that this is the key-stone of liberty , that it binds the monarch no less than the people , and that , if he violates it , he aims the deadliest blow at their rights . The French people have yet to learn a sufficient degree of reverence for law ; and in this respect consists the great difference between the liberty of France and that of England . We have already remarked that // a greater degree of personal freedom pervades all classes of people in the former country than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverence which exists in England for ' monarch and state dignitaries , for church establishment and titled men , there exists at the same time a respect for law , which has effectually prevented the liberties of the people from retrograding , and has with slow , but unvarying progress , been advancing their rights for centuries . There is no country in the old world , where the law holds a more undisputed sway than in England . The constitution has come down from the days of Magna Charta with the accumulated dignity of ages upon it , and the Englishman regards with a feeling of unmingled horror any attempt to violate its articles . In France this is not so ; the people have not yet learned to revere their constitution ; the generation that is now passing away , is older than the charter of their rights , and the younger portion of the people have witnessed too many revolutions to have been brought up in the idea of the permanence of any government or laws ; they have not yet had time , since their emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to inspire among every free people . The vital principle of every constitution is its durability , and the difficulty with which any change is made in it , - and it will readily be comprehended how little opportunity the French people have possessed for acquiring just views with regard to the inviolability of constitutions , when the reflection is made , that since the adoption of the federal constitution in this country , the form of government in France has been changed oftener than the Presidents of the United States . There has been nothing in that country to give an idea of stability in government ; the constitution has been changed , violated , trampled upon again and again ; and it is impossible , under such circumstances , that the sacredness of its character should be understood . rrrue the revolution of July was the result of the most flagrant violation of constitutional rights ; but it was excited by wrongs which touched most directly the personal comfort of a large class , - hundreds of workingmen were thrown out of employ , and were deprived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1832 , when the present king had no less openly violated the constitution , by establishing martial law in the capital , the enormity was tamely submitted to . Tb populace , who from behind the barricades , and with arms in their hands , could at one moment // cry * bas le roi , and the instant after , by a slight exhibition of personal courage , be made to throw down their arms and cry vive le roi , have yet much to learn in the book of freedom . In teaching this great lesson , our author is utterly deficient . In one respect , however , he is undoubtedly in advance of ordinary political writers ; this is in holding up , as the surest means of acquiring and preserving liberty , the sincere worship of God , and the serving no master but Christ . His principle is correct , though his application of it is wrong ; nothing can be less in accordance with Christianity , than the feelings of exasperation and vengeance which he excites . His views , however , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold , and appear to us just . The connection between religion and politics is a very different thing from the connection between church and state . The latter is only a vulgar , but powerful support to government , founded on the ignorance of a people , and degrading Christianity to a system of little more value than the pagan rites of Rome . The other elevates the science of government to the high rank it naturally occupies , breathes into it the pure spirit of life , to the happiness of a people ; it nerves the arm of the patriot , and assures him that the God of battles is his defender ; it cheers the prisoner in his dungeon , and upholds the martyr on the scaffold ; and tyrants tremble and fall before its irresistible power . The religious sentiments of the author pervade the whole work ; as a specimen of them , we cite portions of the txventysecond chapter . " Understand well , how to become free ; " To be free , it is necessary to love God above every thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ; and the will of God is justice and love , without which there is no liberty . " Love God above all things , and thy neighbor as thyself , and bondage would disappear from the earth . " Liberty is like the kingdom of heaven ; it suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force . But the violence which shall place you in the possession of liberty , is not the ferocious violence of thieves and robbers , oppression , vengeance , and cruelty ; but a will , strong and inflexible ; a courage , calm and generous . " The most holy cause becomes most impious and execrable , when crime is employed to sustain it . The man of crime from a slave may become a tyrant , but never will he become free . " // We bad intended to say something upon the present state of literature and religion in France , of which the work in question is no less a sign , than of the political condition of the country ; but our article has already been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views we have taken of the present condition of that interesting country , have a momentous bearing on our own . Are not our liberties in danger , and from the same cause that seems to retard the progress of freedom in France ? Have we not , like the people of France , evinced that we are not enough aware of the sanctity of the charter of our rights ? Have not we , like them , been dazzled and blinded by personal courage and military glory ? Have we not been too ready to take up arms to avenge our real or fancied wrongs ? Have there not been acted among us , within the last year , scenes more disgraceful to a people , and to human nature , than the *meutes under Louis Philippe , or even than the mad carnage of the old revolution ? We much fear that the respect for order , the submission to law , the majestic calmness and moderation which distinguished our fathers , and which alone could have called forth the fair form of our republic from the chaos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French , we are in danger of abandoning the feeling of reverence for all institutions ; and like them , so surely as xve do this , we shall be trodden under foot by a tyrant ; it matters little whether he be called king or president . In this hour of darkness and danger , it beh oves all good men to combine together for the preservation of good institutions , by expressing , in tones of reproach and indignation , their abhorrence of deeds of violence , and above all , by holding up to just infamy the more cunning instigators of such crimes ; and by endeavoring to cultivate among the people a more elevated morality , more sincere religion , and higher views of the sacred and inviolable character of laws.
