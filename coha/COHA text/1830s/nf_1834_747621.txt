txt /z/ My young friends have often come to me , after they have been dismissed from school , and begged me to think of some new sport for their amusement . Now , though somewhat of an old man , I have not forgotten the games and pastimes of my boyhood . Many of the events of my youth are fresh in my memory , while those of later years have quite faded away . How careful should the young be to avoid every act , upon which they can not always reflect with pleasure , when they know , that the remembrance of it will last so long ! /z/ As I can not have all my young friends about me at once , to tell them stories and assist them in their games , I have concluded to write a Book of Sports , purposely ' for American boys , ' 1 would have you fond of exercise and of being in the open air ; capable of bearing the winter 's cold without injury , and of exerting yourselves with strength and agility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain these desirable ends , and which are not only amusing but beneficial to young people . In this little book , I intend to give you a description of such sports , as may be likely to afford you either healthful exercise or innocent amusement . I shall tell you some pleasant stories as I go along ; and you will not be displeased if I occasionally mingle some useful piece of information with my descriptions . I shall begin with a very simple sport ; but it is one , from which I dare say you have derived too much entertainment to think it unworthy of a place here . /z/ /q/ puss IN THE CORNER* This lively game is played by five only . . The place usually chosen for the sport is a square room or yard . Each of the four corners is occupied by a player : the fifth , who is called Puss , stands in the centre . The game now commences . The players exchange corners in all directions : it is the object of the one who stands out , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacant for an instant during the exchanges . When he succeeds in so doing , that player , who is left without a corn-er becomes puss . This game may be played in any place , where there are four trees or posts , which may form the four corners of a square . BLIND man 's buff . This old and popular pastime is too well known to need any description . There is , however , a variation of it , called Shadow BujflF , which may not // be so familiar to you . A table with a lamp upon it is placed at some distance from a wall , between which and the table , one of the players is seated on a low stooL The other Players then walk one by one , between the table and Buffy , limping , hopping , and grimacing as they please , so as to distort their shadows on the wall . If BuflFy can tell correctly and without turning his head , to whom any shadow belongs , the person so discovered takes his place . /z/ Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture on the next page , which represents a little boy swinging between two trees , while his mother and brother are near . The weather is pleasant , and as he rises in the swing , the air rushes by his face as swift as it does * to swallows on the wing . ' The construction of the swing is simple : two ropes of equal lengths are to be suspended from any strong branch or cross piece of timber ; at the /z/ bottom of these ' ropes , a seat is to be securely fastened , and the person , who takes the seat , must be set in motion by another on the ground ; a rope for this purpose may be fixed to the back part of the seat . Care must be taken in swinging , that the two ropes are not twisted round each other , as accidents have often happened in this way . On some persons , swinging produces an effect , similar to that , which causes sea-sickness. /z/ A plank is placed across a piece of timber , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each end . By a slight exertion , if the plank be properly balanced , each end rises and sinks alternately . It must be observed , that if the players be of unequal weight , he who is the heavier , must , to preserve the due equilibrium , make his end of the plank shorter /z/ Several young persons sit on the ground in a circle , and one stands in the centre . The parties who are seated , pass round a slipjper , so as to prevent , if possible , its being found by him standing , in the possession of any of them . In order that the player in the centre may know where the slipper is , it is occasionally tapped on the ground , and then suddenly handed to the right or left . When the slipper is found in the possession of any one in the circle , by the player who is hunting for it , the party with whom it is so found , has to take his turn at hunting the slipper . THREAD THE NEEDUl . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , who all join hands , when tl lowing dialogue takes place between the tW ' /z/ side players at each end of the line : * How many miles to Babylon ? ' * Threescore and ten , ' * Can I get there by candle light . *Yes , and back again . ' * Then open the gates without more ado , and let the king and his men pass through . ' In obedience to this command , the player who stands at the opposite end of the line and the one next to him , lift their joined hands as high as possible ; the other outside player then approaches , runs under the ' hands thus elevated , and the whole line follows him without disuniting . This is threading the needle ; and the game may be continued in this way till you are tired . /z/ This is a favorite game with children . A handkerchief , or something else , is concealed by one player , and the rest try to find it . The discoverer of the concealed article takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a custom in this game , for the boy who has hid the article , to encourage those who approach it , by telling them that they burUj and to warn them of their departure from it by saying , that they freeze . /z/ This is a simple but quite a lively sport . One player places himself at the top of a little mound or hillock ; he is the king of the castle , and he tries to keep possession of his post , as long as possible , against the attacks of his playmates , who endeavor one at a time to drive him off . If he be driven from his post , the player who dethrones him takes his place . There is a sport somewhat similar to this , . called the * old man on the castle , ' in which one boy , who is named the * old man , ' chases all who approach the spot , which he calls his castle . The last player whom he catches takes his place . /z/ DICK ) DUCK , AND DtlAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is frequently applied to a spendthrift.  --  He is making ducks and drakes of his money , It is played by jerking , or what boys call skipping , or shying , bits of slate , or flat stones along the surface of a pond or river . If the thing thrown touches the water and rebounds once , it is a dick ; if twice , a duck ; if thrice , a drake . He who makes his slate or pebble rebound the greatest number of times wins the game . /z/ Many grdwn-up persons can recollect the time when*a pipe with a little soap and water would make them happy for hours . This is a quiet and harmless amusement for children . Indeed there are many * children of a larger growth , ' who spend their time in blowing bubbles of a different but not profitable nature . /z/ A VARIETY of healthful amusement may be pursued without the aid of toys ; but such additions help to diversify the entertainments of boyhood . I have told you about those simple and easy sports , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you about those games , which are played with toys . /z/ The best marbles are imported from Holland , where , as I have been informed , they are manufactured , by grinding fragments of alabaster and of other stones , in an iron mill of a peculiar construction . /q/ In this mill there are several partitions furnished with rasps , which turn with great velociity ? hy means of a stream of water ; and thus haying rounded the stones , project them out of different holes for which their size may adapt them . Thus manufactured they are sent to America and other countries . There are as you know , inferior kinds of marbles , which are of home manufacture , and consist of baked clay , or vitrified earth . The marbles made of pink marble , with dark red veins , * blood allies , ' are preferred to all others . One of the most common games at marbles is that of knock-out . Two or more may play at this game . He who begins , throws a marble gently against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exceeding a yard ; a second player throws another marble against the wall , endeavoring to make it rebound , so as to strike or come within a span of the first ; if he can do neither , the first player takes up his own marble , and , in turn , strives to snop or span that of the second . The marble that is thus snopped or spanned , is won , and the winner begins /z/ again . Where only two play , it is best to knock out two or three marbles each , alternately , before they begin to use those on the ground . In this case , a player may win his own marbles , as they are common stock when down , and take up which he pleases , to play with . Sometimes instead of throwing the marbles against a wall , the players shoot them along the ground . The winner is he who shoots his marble within a span of the other 's . This game is called ' spans and snops . ' The game of lingtaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is played in the following manner . A circle is drawn , on which each player puts as many marbles as may be agreed on . ' A line , called the offing , is then drawn at some distance , from which each in turn shoots at the ring . Shooting a marble out of the ring , entitles the shooter to go on again , and thus the ring may be sometimes cleared by a good player , before his companion or companions have a chance . After the first fire , the players return no more to the offing , but shoot , when their turn comes , from the /z/ place where their marbles rested on the last occasion . Every marble struck out of the ring , is won by the striking party ; but if the taw , or marble , jat any time remain in the ring , the player is out . In the game of arch-hoard or nine-holes the marbles are bowled at a board set upright , resembling a bridge , with nine small arches , all of theoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arches , it becomes the property of the boy to whom the board belongs ; but , if it go through any one of them , the bowler claims a number equal to the number upon the arch it passed through . . Sometimes holes are dug in the ground , into which the players try to drive their marbles . Sometimes a little pyramid of marbles is erected within a small circle , and the ) boy who shoots at it , has as many as he can drive out of the circle . One marble is given , for each time of shooting , to the owner of the pyramid . Those games at marbles which depend entirely upon chance , I hope re beneath your notice . /z/ Humming-tops are easily used . After the string is wound about the upright piece , one end of it is taken la one hand , and the handle of the fork-piece in the other . The string is then pulled off with force , and the top is set a-going . Whip-top is an excellent amusement . The top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ou a smooth surface , and applying the whip with gentleness at first , increasing the vigor of the blows ' , as the top gets finri on the peg . The peg-top is spun by quickly pulling away the string wound round it . /q/ /z/ To make a sling , jou must cut out an oval piece of leather , about two inches wide at the broadest part . . At each of the ends , fasten a leathern thong , or piece of cord . One of these cords , or thongs should be longer than the other . Place a stone in the broadest part of the leather , twist the longest thong twice or thrice round your hand , hold the other lightly between your thumb and fore-finger whirl it round several times , let go the shorter thong , and the stone will be shot to a great distance . Great care should be taken in using the sling , lest mischief is done . /z/ The best form of constructing a kite is the following . The only pieces of wood necessary in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or walnut , and a straight lath . These are fastened to- /z/ gether by twine , and when the frame is completed , it is pasted over with paper . The tail , which should be from ten to fifteen times the length of the kite , is made by tying bobs on a string , with a larger bob at the end of it . Kites may be made of various shapes and sizes . Indeed they probably first received their name from having ben originally constructed in the form of a bird of prey , called the kite . In China the flying of kites is much more practised than in this couatry ; and it is said , that their shape is always that of some bird . I remember to have seen , some years ago , a kite which resembled a man . It was made of linen* cloth , cut and painted for the purpose , and stretched on a light frame , so constructed as to resemble the outline of the human figure . It stood upright , and was dressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side , and its head was covered with a cap . The person who owned this kite could raise it , though the weather was calm , to a /z/ great height . The wind gave to it a slight motion , which made it look like a man skating on the ice . It had altogether a very queer appearance , and did not fail to attract a great crowd of spectators . Kites are often made square , as they are easiest to construct of that form . Boys frequently send up messengers when their kite is safely balanced in the air . The messenger is a round piece of paper or pasteboard , which on being fixed upon the string , is blown along the line up to the kite . The kite sometimes pulls so violently that it breaks the string , or twitches away from the hand , and is lost . Dr Franklin has said , that , with a good kite a man , unable to swim , might be sustained in the water , so as to pass from Dover to Calais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many miles along the road in a carriage drawn by two kites . But the kite has served the cause of science as well as that of amusement . It was by means of the kite that Dr Franklin was able to make his /z/ great discoveries in electricity , and to draw it from the clouds . Did you ever hear the story of the sailors who mounted to the top of Pompey 's pillar ? If you have , it will bear repeating . Some English sailors once laid a wager , that they would drink a bowl of punch on the summit of Pompey 's pillar , in Egypt . Now , Jthis pillar is almost a hundred feet high , and it is quite smooth , so that there was no way of climbing to the top , even for sailors . In this ilemma , they obtained a kite , and flew it exaotly over the pillar , so that when it came down on the opposite side , the string lay across the top of the capital . By means of this string , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger one , that was strong enough to bear the weight of a man . A puUy was then fastened to the end of the large rope , and /z/ drawn close up to the upper edge of the column ; and then , you see , they could easily hoist each other up . They did more ; for they hoisted a flag /z/ on the top , drank their bowl of punch , and won their wager . /z/ Cut a circular piece of stout leather ; bore a hole through its centre , and pass a string , with a knot to prevent the end escaping , through this hole . Soak the leather well in water before you use it ; when thoroughly soaked , place the leather on a stone , press it well down with your foot , and then taking the string , you may , by your sucker , raise a considerable weight . You have often observed the ease and security with which flies walk upon a smooth wall , or a pane of glass , or even along the ceiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet are provided with little cups , or suckers , which they alternately exhaust and fill with air ; by which means they are enabled to walk in every position , over the most slippery surfaces . In like manner , the walrus , or seal , is capable of . climbing the masses of slippery ice with perfect security . /q/ /z/ The trundling of the hoop is an old , but healthful pastime . It was as common with the Greeks and Romans as it is with boys of the present generation . It has the advantage of being a sport , which may be played by one person , although several players sometimes engage in it , and try who can keep their hoop rolling longest . Several tin squares are sometimes nailed to the inner part of the hoop , which produce , in the opinion of some lads , an agreeable jingle ; but it is apt to frighten the horses , whom they meet . Kite and other Taji. /z/ The use of the ball was well known to the children , who played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , and offers a good opportunity for the exercise of the limbs and the muscles . The games with the bat and ball are numerous , but somewhat similar . I will mention some of those , which I believe to be the most popular with boys . /z/ This game is known under a variety of names . It is sometimes called * round ball , ' but I believe /z/ that * base , ' or * goal ball ' are the names generally adopted in our country . The players divide into two equal parties , and chance decides which shall have first innings . Four stones or stakes are placed from twelve to twenty yards asunder , as a , 6 , c , , djn the margin ; another is put at e . One  --  of the party , who is out , places himself * at e . He tosses the ball gently toward a , on the right of which one of the in-party places himself , and strikes the ball , if possible , with his bat . If he miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be caught by any of the players of the opposite side , who are scattered about the field , he is out , and another takes his place . If none of these accidents take place , on striking the ball he drops the bat , and runs toward 6 , or , if he can , to c , d , or even to a again . If , however , the boy who stands at 6 , or any of the out-players who may happen to have the ball , strike him with it in his progress from a to b b to c , c to J , or d to a , he is out . Supposing he can only get to 6 , one of his partners takes the bat , and strikes at the ball in /q/ turn . If the first player can only get to c , or J , the second runs to 6 , only , or c , as the case may be , and a third player begins ; as they get home , that is , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they all get out . Then , of course , the out-players take their places . /z/ Fives may be played either single-handed or with partners . A good wall must be selected , with a round flat piece of ground in front of it . Three lines must be drawn so as to form , with the bottom of the wall , a square , to mark the bounds . A line must also be drawn on the wall , about three feet from the ground . The players toss up for innings . The winner begins by bounding his ball on the ground , and striking it against the wall , above the line , so that it may rebound tigorously . The other player then strikes it , in the same manner , either before it has touched the ground , or hopped from the ground more than once : the first /z/ player then prepares to receive and strike it at its rebound ; and thus the game goes on , until one of the players fails to strike the ball in his turn , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the mark , or to drive it out of bounds . If the party who is in do neither of these , he loses his innings ; if the other , then the in-player reckons one , on each occasion , towards the game , which is fifteen- /z/ Near a wall where the ground is level , dig nine , or a lesser number of holes , according to the number of players , large enough for a ball to be bowled in without difficulty . Number them , and let each player be allotted a number , by chance or choice , as it may be agreed . A line 4s drawn about five yards from the holes , at which one of the players places himself , and bowls the ball into one of the holes . The player to whom the hole , into which the ball is bowled , belongs , picks it up as quickly as he can , and endeavors to hit one /z/ of the others with it . The latter all run off as soon as they perceive that the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim , he loses a point , and is called ' a fifer , ' and it is his turn to bowl . If , however , he hit another , he loses nothing ; but the party hit , in case he succeeds in striking another with the ball , becomes * a fifer , ' and it is his turn to bowl . Five or six may be struck in succession , and the ball may be kept up , no matter how long , until a miss be made , when the party so missing loses a point and bowls . It is also allowed for one player to accept the ball from another , and run the risk of hitting a third . The second bowling is conducted precisely as the first ; but he who bowls three times without passing the ball into the hole , loses a point , and if he have lost one before , becomes * a tenner . ' He must still go on , until he succeed in putting the ball into - a hole ; it is his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to himself . A party who misses his aim a second time becomes a tenner ; ' /q/ he who loses a third time , /a fifteener ; ' and when four points are lost the player stands out The game goes on until all the players are out but one ; who , of course , wins the game . One of the others theii takes the ball in his left hand , places his face toward the wall , and throws the ball over the right shoulder as far as he can . The player who has won stands at the spot where the ball first touches the ground , or , if it be not immediately behind the party who has thrown it , a line is drawn from the place where the ball falls , to a spot directly behind the thrower . The winner then has the privilege of throwing the ball at the loser 's back , three times , as soft as he pleases . The other losers throw in the same manner , one after another , and the winner has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places this game is called * Hat-ball , ' on account of the players using their hats , instead of digging* holes , and the ball is tossed into the hats , instead of being bowled into the holes . /z/ This is somewhat similar to the preceding game . Instead of bowling the ball into holes , it is thrown in the air , and the name of the player , for whom it is intended , called out by the thrower . If it be caught , before it has twice touched the ground , by the player so called on , he loses no point , but throws it up again , and calls upon whom he pleases to catch it . If it be not caught in due time , he whose name is called must endeavor to strike one of the others with it ; if he miss , he loses a point , and has his throw up . /z/ In the game of rackets the ball is struck against a wall , and returned at the bound to the same wall , each player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bat , that his adversary may not be able to return it . He who does not return it , either /q/ /z/ loses a point , or has his * hand out , ' that is to say , forfeits the situation in which he would be able to add to his score of the game . This sport requires considerable skill and activity in the player who must be constantly on the move . Standing still is entirely out of the question ; and two or three games at rackets are well calculated to improve the health and invigorate the limbs . /z/ Cricket may be played by eleven persons on each side , though a less number is sufficient . Two umpires , or persons to decide , are sometimes appointed in order to settle all disputes that may arise : they are to take their stations at each wicket , and should be well acquainted with the laws of the game . Full-sized wickets are three stumps , sufficiently long to leave twenty-four inches out of the ground , with a bail , or cross stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They should be placed directly opposite to each other , at the distance of /z/ twenty-two yards for men , but varying according to the size of the player . Bowling is an important part of th game , and require3 great steadiness . Bad bowling is often the cause of losijag a game . A bowler should not be too systematic , but vary his balls faster or slower , according to the peculiarities of the striker . He should aim directly at the opposite wicket . . The striker should always be ready for running , but he should be cautious , not to leave the ground before the ball is out of the bowler 's hand ; for if he do , the bowler may put down his wicket , and he of course , be out . As soon as the ball is delivered , the striker may follow it , but should not run too far , so that , if no runs be obtained , he may return in time to save his Wicket . The bat should be kept on the outside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The bowler should be careful to toss the ball in such a way , that the striker can play at it ; for if he should toss it above the striker 's head , or out of the bounds , the party which is in shall be allowed /q/ one notch , to be put down to the byes* The striker is out if the bail or cross stick be bowled off , or the stump be bowled out of the ground . Or , if in striking at the ball he hit down his wicket . Or , if he prevent the ball from being caught by the out-players . Or , if the ball be struck , and he wilfully strike it again . Or , if with any part of his person , he stop the ball , which might have hit his wicket . The following are among some of the remaining laws of cricket .. If the players have crossed each other , he that runs for the wicket which is put down , is out . When a ball is caught , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the striker may guard his wicket either with his bat or his body , . This is , I believe , the old and original- method of playing cricket . It is often played in a simpler way . Two wickets are placed at some distance from each other . They consist each of two short stakes fixed in the ground , and a cross stick placed in notches , in the stakes , about the height of the ball from the ground . Two bowlers stand at each /z/ wicket and roll the ball along the ground with the view of knocking off the cross stick . The striker endeavors to prevent this by hitting the ball with his bat ; but if he strike it so that it is caught by any of the other players , he is out . /z/ A match is made between two sets of players of equal numbers ; a large ball made of light materials , - a blown bladder , cased with leather , is the best ,  --  is placed between them , and the object of each party is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to prevent it from passing their own . The party , across whose goal the ball is kicked , loses the game . - The game is commenced between the two goals , which are about a hundred yards asunder . This game admits of very powerful exercise , and , when played with moderation , is healthful and lively . Country boys sometimes use a blown bladder , without the covering of leather , for a foot- THE BOOK or SPOKTS , 49 ball ; and they often put peas and horse-beans inside , which occasion a rattling as it is kicked about . /z/ In running the legs should not be raised too high . The arms should be nearly still , so that no unnecessary opposition be given to the air by their motion . Your object should be rather to acquire a habit of running with ease , than to fatigue yourself by any violent effort . While talking of running , I am reminded of a story , which was once told me by a soldier of the revolution . I will tell it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuring you , at the same time , that it has its origin in fact :  - -  /q/ devoted to the cause of my country . I had accepted the of a spy . In time of war , this office is a very hazardous and responsible one . If the spy be caught by the enemy , he is usually hung with very little ceremony ; and I was not at all partial to being disposed of in that way . Well : I had made myself acquainted with the position of the enemy and gained some important intelligence , when I set out to return to the American camp . It was a bright autumnal afternoon , and I was obliged to creep warily through the woods , to escape the vigilance of the British . I had travelled three or four miles , and began to think myself out of danger , when on turning round a narrow lane , I beheld an English officer and three soldiers beneath a tree . My first movement was to sink down among the bushes , and try to conceal myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves , and supposing it to be some animal , he levelled his gun at the His aim was directly at my head , and the unpleasant conviction , /z/ entered my mind , that unless I moved out of the way , I should be shot . I was also aware that if I discovered myself , I should be seized and executed as a spy . I hit upon a desperate expedient . Starting from the ground , I rushed by the soldiers , knocking one of them over in my way , and trusted to an active pair of legs for my escape . Bang , bang , bang , bang , went the guns in my rear ; but I was soon out of the reach of a bullet . The officer and his men joined in a chase after me , and to do them justice , they were not slow in pursuit ; I arrived at the top of a steep hill , wearied and out of breath ; but adopted an expeditious way of getting to the bottom . Laying myself on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would roll a barrel along the ground . On reaching the bottom , I staggered dizzily along to some distance , till I came to the bank of a river . I plunged in without hesitation , and the cool water seemed to revive me . When I bad got ' opposite side the British were just prepariBg /q/ to ford the stream . I continued to run , and at the entrance of a small wood , was delighted by the sight of a company of Americans . I told tkem the cause of my haste , and informed them of the approach of my pursuers . * You will probably conjecture the course , which was taken by my countrymen on hearing my story . They each concealed themselves behind a tree , and waited quietly for the approach of the British ; in a short time , my pursuers were seen emerging from the river , with their clothes wet and clinging heavily about them . * It is needless to say that they were easily made prisoners by my companions . I returned safely to the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commanding officer , and rested sweetly and soundly that night , notwithstanding my roll down the hill , and my drenching in the river . ' I have wandered from my subject to tell you this story . Perhaps you may think that I am very communicative . But I have heard many curious stories /z/ in the course of my life I can enter upon fewtopies , which do not bring to my mind some scene in which I have been an actor , or some anecdote which I hare heard from others . If you are tired of hearing me talk about myself , I will now tell you about other matters . /z/ This is a sport iq which the swiftest runner usually comes off the best . Six or eight is the most convenient number to play at it . One volunteers to be the player , who is called Tag : it is the object of the other players to run from and avoid him . He pursues them- all ; or , if he think fit , singles out an individual , whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched becomes Tag , and in his turn endeavors to lay his hand upon some one else . This is an active and amusing game for boys in cold weather . It is sometimes called Touch iron , or Touch wood ; in these cases , the players are safe from being touched , while their hands are upon iron or wood , as may be previously agreed . THE BOOK or SPORTS . prisoher'b base . This game may be played by five or nine on each side , and there is no objection to more or fewer players . The choice of partners is made by chance . Bounds are marked out for the two pjirties , a sjKice being left between them to admit of running . Two prisons are also marked in a line with each o , ther at some distance from the front of the bounds . The game is now commenced by a player from one side running out mid-way between the bounds and prisons ; a player from the other side immediately follows , and he may be pursued by one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a player from the side which began the game , and so on ; both parties being at liberty to send out as many as the fit . The object of each player is to come v or intercept and touch any player of the c side , who has left the bounds before him not at liberty to touch any that have starts /z/ him , it being their privilege , on the contrary , if they can , to touch him before he can get back within his bounds again . A player is allowed to touch one of the opposite party only each time he quits bounds , and after having touched an adversary , he can not be touched on his return to bounds . Every player who is touched , goes to the prison belonging to the opposite party , where he must remain until one of his own Iside be able to reach him , without being touched in his run from bounds to the prison , by any of the opposite party . When thus released , neither he nor the player who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their return to bounds again . The game is won by that side which has all the players of the other in prison at the same time . /z/ This may be played by any number , from ten to one hundred . One begins the game by repeating the following words ,  --  * Warning once , warning twice , warning three times over ; a bushel of wheat . /q/ a bushel of rye , when the cock crows , out jump I !  --  Cock-a-doodle-doo ! .  --  Warning ! ' He then runs out , and touches the first he can overtake , who must return to bounds with him . These twp then join hands , and each of them endeavors to touch another ; he also returns to bounds , and at the next sally joins h'ands with the other two . Every player who is afterwards touched by either of the outside ones , does the like , until the whole be thus touched and taken . It is not lawful to touch an out-player after the line is broken , either accidentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to do . When a player is touched , the line separates , and the . out-players endeavor to catch those belonging to it , who are compelled to carry those who capture them , on their backs , to bounds . When three are touched , he who begins the game is en titled to join the out-players. // /z/ This game is played as follows :  --  AU the players but one , collect at a place called * home , ' while one goes off to hide himself . When ready , he shouts * Whoop oh ! ' The others then sally out to find him ; he who discovers the hidden player , calls out * Whoop oh ! ' The hidden player then breaks from his concealment , and if he can catch one of the others the one so caught must carry him on his back to * home . ' It is then the boy 's turn who has made the discovery to go and hide himself , and the others endeavor to discover his lurking place , as before . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following manner :  --  A number of boys conceal themselves , and one or two , as may be agreed upon , " ft , sally forth in search of theai . As soon as one of f the finders catches a glimpse of any of the hiding /q/ players , he exclainus * I spy , ' upon which all the boys run as fast as they can to goal . The boy who arrives at the goal last is then to go in search of th players , after they have agaiji hid themselves . /z/ A number of players join hands so as . to make a circle ; one only stands out ; he walks round the outside of the circle , and drops a handkerchief behind any player in the circle he chooses . The party , behind whom the handkerchief is thus dropped , immediately follows the one who dropped it . Those who stood on each side complete the circle by joining hands , and the chase commences . The pursuer is bound to follow precisely the course of the pursued , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players , and endeavors , by all the means in his power , to puzzle and elude him . If he succeed in so doing , and if the pursuer make a blunder in his course , he returns to his place in ' the circle , and the jfirst player prepares to drop the THE BOOK or SPOBT9. handkerchief behind one of the players again . When he is fairlj overtaken by the player behind whom he , has last dropped the handkerchief , the latter takes his place , and he Joins hands in the circle . /z/ , A BOT9 who is quick and active out of doors , who is not seen lounging lazily in the sun , but who enters heartily into his sports , when the time and place are proper , may generally be looked upon as a good , or capable scholar . Habits of laziness and inactivity are to be carefully shunned by the young , lest in after life they reap their consequences in a feeble and sickly frame . I once knew two brothers , of whom the eldest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a studious boy , but fond of the fireside , and averse to exercise in the open air . He was also very fond of lying in bed at morning , and /z/ would not leave the house till it was time to . go to school . James , though quite a respectable scholar , was the foremost in all sports during play-hours , and lost no opportunity of improving himself in sngth and agility . He was always up at an early hour , and forth in the fields , or performing some useful labor in the yard . Years passed on , and the boys grew in size , and in mind . At last they both entered college , but Arthur had not been there a week before he was obliged to leave on account of his health , and he has remained an invalid ever since , regretting deeply his early habits of bodily sloth and inactivity . James passed through his course of study at the university in a creditable manner , and unimpeded by illness or want of strength . He has since become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him declare , that wealth and reputation are nothing compared to the blessing of * a sound mind in a sound body . ' I would , therefore , my young readers , enjoin it /q/ upon you as a duty to avoid habits of inactivity and idleness* Rise with the lark , study while you study , and play while you play . Agility may be acquired by practice , but do not attempt feats , which have in them anything dangerous , for they are unnecessary , and without benefit . It is best to advance by degrees ; you will find it the surest means of success .  --  I will now go on with my list of sports . /z/ Leap-frog should be played in a smooth open place , and , if possible , out of doors . It is so common and simple a sport , that my description of it need be but brief . We will suppose a dozen boys at play :  --  Let eleven of them stand in a row , about six yards apart , and with their shoulders bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins the sport by taking a short run , placing his hands on the shoulders of the nearest player , and leaping over his head . Having cleared the first , he goes on to the second , third , fourth , fifth , &c,; /z/ in succession , and as speedily as possible . When he has gone over the last , he goes to a proper distance , and places hicdself in a position for all the rest to leap over him in their turn . This is often a favorite sport with sailors at sea . /z/ This game should be played by a number exceeding three , but not more than six or eight . A large stone . with a smooth top is placed on the ground , and an offing , or goal , is marked at eight or ten yards distance . Each of the players being provided with a large pebble , one of them , by chance or choice , becomes duck ; that is , he places his pebble on the large stone , and stands a little on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in turn , from the offing , each endeavoring to knock it off its place . Each player , as soon as he has cast his duck , watches for an opportunity of bringing it back to the offing , so as to cast again . If the player who is duck , can touch /q/ him after he has taken up his pebble , and before he reaches the offing , provided his own pebble remain on the large stone , then the player so touched , becomes duck . It sometimes happens that , three or four of the out-players ' ducks lie close together , so that they all run the risk of being touched : in this case one of those who are at the offing can afford them an opportunity of getting their pebbles , by striking the duck off the large $tone . The owner must replace it before he can touch an ; one . /z/ The first rule in jumping is to fall on the toes and never on the heels . Bend the knees , and swing the arms forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands , if necessary . Hold the breath , keep the body forward , come to the ground with both feet together , and in taking the run , let your steps be short , and increase in quickness as you approach the leap . Begin with a moderate height or breadth , and increase both as you improve . // /z/ Get a bit of wood , or half of a tobacco-pipe , hold it between the two fore-fingers of each hand , and , without letting it go , after a little practice , you may leap over it , forward and backward without difficulty : when perfect in this , you may place the tops of the two middle fingers together , and leap over them both ways , without either separating or touching them with the feet . /z/ This feat is performed by standing with your face toward a wall , and throwing yourself forward , until you support yourself from falling , by the palm of one of the hands being placed , with the fingers ; upward , against the wall ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station by springing from your hand , without bringing your feet forward . Accordidg to the greater or less distance you stand from the wall , the more or less difficult the /z/ Wilb the skipping-rope several difficult feats may be performed ; the best , perhaps , is the following : Skip in the common way for a few seconds , constantly increasing your velocity of movement , and , at length , leap tolerably high , and whirl the rope round so fast that it may pass twice under your feet before they touch the ground ; continue this until you can repeat it several times in succession , and , at last , pass the rope three times , instead of twice , under your feet during the leap . /z/ This feat is very simple . Place the inside of * the thumb against the edge of a table , and then move your feet backward as far as you can from the table , so as to be able to recover your upright position by . the spring of your thumb without moving your feeti You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously to springing from the thumb , you make two or three bends to and fro with your body . Neither the fingers , nor any part of the hand , except the thumb , should touch the table . It is advisable to begin by making the spring with your feet at a short distance only from the table at first , and to draw them farther from it gradually as you improve in the performance of the feat* /z/ I ONCE knew a sailor , who couI4 stand on the tip-top of the mast of a vessel , and look around - upon the water , without falling . This wonderful feat he learned by practice , to perforin with the greatest ease . A little boy who had seen him in this perilous position , undertook to do the same thing . He as cended the mast , placed his hand on the top , and glancing below to see that no one was looking , he gently raised his foot to the surface , and stood up erect , with his arms extended to balance him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dizzy . At that moment his father came . on deck , and casting his eyes above , beheld the awful situation of his son . With great presence of mind , the father uttered nf /z/ exclamation , but seized a gun , and calling in a calm voice upon the daring little fellow , he ordered him to jump instantly into the sea , if he did not wish to be shot . This threat was necessary to prevent the boy 's falling upon the deck , where he would have been unavoidably dashed to pieces . The little boy shut his eyes , and jumped . Down , down he went* into the sea , and the water bubbled into his ears , and he thought that he should never be done sinking . Presently , however , he felt lighter . He began to ascend , and the next moment his head rose above the waiter light as a cork , and he felt the warm sunshine , and breathed the life-giving air . A boat had been hoisted out from the vessel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt-water , but conscious of his escape . He was taken down into the cabin of the vessel , where his wet clothes were replaced by garments warm and dry , and he was soon as well as ever . His father , as you may suppose , looked to heaven with gratitude , for his son 's preservation . Why have I been going oiit of my way to tell you this story ? Because I would impress on your /q/ minds the danger of attempting any perilous feat , requiring strength or skill , before practice has given you a reasonable chance of success . Should a boy , unosed to jumping , attempt to leap a wide ditch , he would probably alight in the middle of it , amongst the mire . But another boy , who had been accustomed to wandering through the meadows of the country , and clearing the ditches at a bound , would be successful in reaching the other side . It is his practice , which gives him the superiority  --  practice , which is the great secret of success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archery , because the bow , when drawn , is in the shape of an arch . The bow is the oldest and most used of all weapons . In the days of king David , the use of the bow was general ; and before that time , Israel , when blessing his sons , says of Joseph , * the archers have sorely grieved him , and shot at him and hated him ; but his bow abode in strength , and the /z/ arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob . ' When Isaac sent Esau to the forest , he said , * Take I pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver , and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me some venison . ' The North American Indians are very expert in the use of the bow , although now they kill most of their game with rifles . The practice of shooting at targets with the bow and arrow used once to be very common in England . Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is in the way . - Accidents have occurred , where persons have been disfigured for life , or deprived of an eye , in consequence of a careless use of the bow and arrow . You recollect the story of king William , who was accidentally killed by Tyrrel in the forest of Sherwood . He was transfixed by an arrow . Equally familiar to you is the story of William Tell , who shot an apple from the head of his son , to save the lives of both . /q/ In shooting , great care should be takeo to ac- quire a proper position , as represented in the cut . Bad attitudes in archery appear very ridiculous . The game of quoits is played with flat stones , which , if circolar , are all the better for the purpose . The players have one , two , or three stones , as may be agreed , and upon the ground a mark is placed , at which they cast them . Those , whose quoits hit l6 THE BOOS OF SPORTS . of the bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battledore : and shuttlecock . Battledores and shuttlecocks are to be had at most of the bookstores . The game is played by two persons , who , with the battledores , strike the shuttlecock to and fro between them . The object is to keep the shuttlecock from falling to the ground as long as possible . . /q/ /z/ This is the name of a gentle in-doors sport , which is played by two . persons , and is somewhat similar to battledore . Each of the players has two rods , with which he sends to the other a little hoop , which is kept going to and fro , until one fails to catch it on the point of his rod . Two hoops may be easily kept a-going , when the players have acquired a moderate degree of skill . /z/ A line is to be marked on the floor , to which the toes of both your feet are to be brought , and beyond which they must not pass . You then kneel , and throw forward one of your hands ( with ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can spring back again from the horizontal position to the upright position of the body . But in springing back , you must not disturb the posture /z/ of the feet , or scrape the floor with the hand The distance to which you can reach may be marked with a piece of chalk . Those who perform this trick the best , contrive , when on the stretch , that the body may rest upon the elbow . /z/ In performing this feat , you may take a run of half a dozen paces . The trick is to place the - toe of the right foot against the wall , about the height of the knee from the ground , and to throw the left leg over it , making an entire revolution , so that when your left leg reaches the ground , your back will be to the wall . The toe of the right foot is the point upon which you must turn ; and it must not quit the wall during the performance of the exploit . To perform the turn-over appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the description ; but it may be attempted by a lad of tolerable activity , who has made himself master of the instructions , without danger . /z/ and , in a short time , accomplished with facility . Ordinary care must , of course , be taken during the early attempts . /z/ An amusing scene may be produced by requesting a person to stand with his back close against the wall , and , when in this position , placing a piece of money on the ground , a short distance before him , and offering it to him if he can pick it up without moving his heels from the wall . This , he will find , is impossible , as , on stooping forward , a part of the body goes back beyond the heels , which , m this case , the wall will , of course , prevent . /z/ This is a trick , with which many of my young friends are probably familiar . Place two , three , or even four cent pieces , in a heap , on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to /z/ a little below where your elbow was , and jmi may catch them all . /z/ There is a district in the south of France , called the Desert of Landes , where the shepherds walk 0ti stilts , and so easily does practice enable them to presenre their balance , that they run , jump , stoop , and even dance , while mounted high from the ground . They use stilts to keep their feet out of the water , which , in winter , is deep on the sands ; and to defend them from the heated sand during the summer . Another advantage is , that they can see to a much greater distance over the level soil , when they are elevated a few feet above their natural height . They can not , however , stand perfectly still upon their stilts , without the aid of a long staff , which they always carry in their hands ; this guards them against any accidental trip , and when they wish to be at rest , forms a third leg that keeps them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ by these shepherds , wheo they are very young , and it is a curious fact , that the smaller the boy is , the higher are his stilts . Stilts are easily constructed : two poles are procured , and at some distance front their ends , a loop of leather or rope is securely fastened ; in these the feet are placed , the poles are kept In a propn position by the hands , and put forward by the action of the legs . A superior mode of making stilts is by substituting a piece of wood , flat on the upper surface , for die leather loop . /z/ The word gymnastics has been so much in use of late years , that , I suppose all my young readers know what it means . Gymnastics may be said to be a series of regular exercises , calculated to strengthen the various muscles in the human frame . They also give a person knowledge of his actual strength , and when wisely practised , are highly beneficial to his health . I am aware that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the accidents which have occurred to boys , who practised them . Bruised limbs , broken arms , and dislocated necks , are said to be the unpleasant consequences /q/ of attending a gymnasium . But the accidents which occur are rather a proof of the clumsiuess or folly of those who meet with them , than of the uselessness of the exercises . It has been said that gymnastics are not only worthless , but unnatural . Now. , if it can be proved , that it is unnatural to climb a tree , to leap over a wide ditch when in danger , to mount on horseback with ease and grace , or to practise any exercise , which will impart vigor to the frame  --  I will then allow that gymnaitics are unnatural . I own it would be folly for savages , or for the North American Indians to set up a gymnasium ; for they already have one in their wide forests and broad rivers . But in cities or towns , where many persons have few opportunities to exercise their muscles ; where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrows to shoot game for their dinners ; where they do not paddle over the water in canoes to catch their fish  --  some artificial means are neceisary to give them that exercise , of which their mode of life deprives them . So that instead /z/ of being unnatural , gymnastics do in fact supply those practises , of which nature is often deprived , in civilized life . The necessary fittings-up of a gymnastic ground are as follow :  --  a horizontal bar , a vaulting horse , a leaping-stand , and ladders of rope and wood . The best time for performing gymnastics is early in the morning . Boys should proceed gradually from the more easy to the difficult exercises ; and when heated , care should be taken not to catch cold by standing stilljn the open air . The great mistake of persons , who attempt to practise gymnastics , is that they commence with violent efforts , and often hurt themselves by too great exertion . They should advance gradually , and every day , they will become stronger and stronger . Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They should take short steps in their progress toward increasing their bodily strength and skill ; and they will find that , the facility with which they can perform these feats , will be greater at every step . /z/ Two bars of wood are placed parallel at a few feet from the ground . A variety of exercise may be taken on this simple fixture . Begin by raising the body by the hands , and then moving the hands alternately backward and forward , until you go along the bars each way by means only of your hands . Then move or jump with both hands at once . The swing is performed by supporting the body by the arms , with the stomach upward , until the toes are in a straight line with the head ; when the pupil can do this with ease , he should throw his body from this position over the bar to the right or left . The movement of lowering the body by bending the elbows is done by drawing up the feet toward the hams , and sinking gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again by straightening the arms , and repeat the exercise several times . Many other exercises may be performed on these bars , which /q/ will occur to the pupil in the course of his practice . /z/ The first position is taking hold of the bar with both hands , and raising the body until the chin is on a line with the knuckles . When you can look over the bar in this manner with ease , place the hands on the farther side of the bar from you , and raise the body as before . In the next exercise , the body is raised from the ground by both hands on each side of the bar , and the pupil passes , springs , or moves the hands alternately along the bar . Keep the legs close , lift the feet so as to touch the bar and sink them down again ; repeat this several times , and when in this position , pass along the bar by alternately moving the hands ; the body may then be supported by the right arm and left leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you may then place yourself in a riding position on the bar . You may also swing with the hed downward , take /z/ the bar with both hands , and pass the feet between them , until they hang downward . /z/ The horse for vaulting is made of a wooden cylinder with rounded ends ; two ridges are placed across it , the space between which is called the saddle : they should be wide enough apart for a person to sit between them with ease* The horse may be wadded or not , according to fancy . Leaping on the horse is performed by springing by the hands astride upon it . The body is raised in the same manner , until the feet reach high enoligh to stand on the horse ; the hands are then to be placed on the farther ridge , and the body thrown forward into the saddle . a /z/ In climbing the rope , the hands are to be moved alternately , one above the other , the feet drawn up /q/ between every movement of the hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mov one hand after the other , as the friction , if you slide , would blister them . The best method to climb the slant rope is to lay the sole of one foot flat on the rope , and the other leg over the instep of that foot . /z/ A plank is placed slantwise from the side of a wall , and the object is to climb it . By practice , you may learn to ascend , with ease , a plank placed in an almost perpendicular position . There are various other exercises usual in gymnasiums , but I have not space to tell you all . If properly pursued , 1 believe these exercises to be highly useful and beneficial . Boys in town , however , have more need of them than those who live in the country . CHAPTER Vni , /z/ 1 HAVE a Story to tell you about a sailor , who once fell overboard in the middle of the sea . His name was John Luff . He was one day painting the outer sides of the ship , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and dropped him into the water . The wind was fresh and strong , all the sails were set , and the vessel was going merrily over the blue waves . As soon as John was missed , the sailors put about the ship , with the utmost haste . It was of little use . Poor John Luff was no where to be seen . His shipmates brushed away a few- tears from their eyes , with their sleeves , again got the ship under way , and returned to their usual duties . /q/ The day passed on , and the night came , and the 9aiIors gave up all hopes of ever again seeing their old shipmate . The next day , it was very stormy . The waves rose high ; . the wind roared , and the men were obligeto furl all the sails of the ship . On the third day after John 's accident , the weather was calm and delightful . The sun shone with dazzling brilliancy upon the smooth waters . The ship swung lazily on the sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it moved not forward . The sailors were employed in different ways . Some were greasing the mast , and others were mending the sails , and others were occupied in coiling the ropes . Suddenly , the man at the helm heard a voice exclaim , * Holloa , there  --  why ca n't you take me in ? Do you expect me to swim all the way to Matanzas ? Throw me a rope , will you V In amazement , the man approached the stern , and looking over , beheld his lost shipmate swimming like a porpoise in the wake of the vessel . The captain was called ; and all the crew on look- /z/ ing overboard were mute with astonishment . A boat was soon lowered , and John was taken in , ap- parently in good health and strong , but with his clothes soaked with water . He jumped on deck , shook hands with his shipmates , and went forward to change his clothes . Now do you suppose that John actually swam after the vessel during the three days that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly fallen overboard when he caught hold of a rope , which he saw hanging over the stern , and by its help climbed safely into the cabin window . No person was in the cabin , and John , after emptying a bottle of wine , which stood on the table , and devouring a quantity of bread and cheese , slunk slily away to a place between the decks , where he lay down upon a bag of meal , and went to sleep . When he awoke the next morning , it vras with some difficulty that he could recollect his situation . As soon as he was fully conscious of this , he decided that he would remain where he was for that day ; /q/ and as there were provisions enough near , there was no danger of his starving . The next day , when ho one was in the cabin , he entered it , and after tasting some more of the captain 's wine , he went to the cabin window , and dove into the water . He then uttered the exclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was afterwards taken into the ship . AfteF this exploit , which certainly was not a remarkably honest one , John was highly renowned as a swimmer . When the vessel arrived at Matanzas , in Cuba , the captain mentioned to a Spanish merchant , that he had among his crew a sailor , who could beat any man in swimming . @#@ I have a negro , - who will beat him , ' said the Spaniard . The result of the conversation was , that a time and place were appointed for the two swimmers to meet , and decide which was the best . On the day appointed , the negro came down to the shore , prepared to jump into the water . By and by , John was seen approaching the spot , bearing on his shoulders a long board , which held three /z/ or four baskets full of provisions . The aegro asked him what use he intended to . make of the board . * Whorra , Sambo , ' replied John , * we must not go to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' * And for how long a journey have you made preparations ? ' asked the Spaniard . * Why , if we have good weather , we may get back by to-m6rrow night . ' . The negro did not at all relish the idea of being so long in the water . He gripw frightened , and at last jflatly refussd to swim with our hero . So that John was a second time successful in passing himself off for a great swimmer . , But knavery must always be found out at last . John 's . tricks were finally discovered , and he proved to be no better a swimjner than his messmates . We will now bid him good bye . /z/ It is said , that any person might swim , were he not hindered by fear . Confidence is the great  --   --  xrmmm- ' ' nmm /z/ secret of the . art . There are a few rules , hpurever , which may be of advaatage te the learner . In addition to its advantages . as a healthy and bracing exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve our own lives , but those of others , ought to be a sufficient inducement to acquire a knowledge of the art . DOCTOR franklin 's REMARKS ON SWIMMING . * The exercise of swimming is one of the most healthy and agreeable in the world .  --  But you will be no swimmer till you can place confidence in the power of the water to support you ; I would , therefore , advise the acquiring that confidence in the first place ; especially as I have known several , who , by a little practice necessary for that purpose , have insensibly acquired the stroke , taught as if it were by nature . The practice I mean is this : choosing a place where the water deepens gradually , walk coolly into into it till it is up to your breast ; then turn round your face to the /z/ shore , and throw an egg into the water between you and the shore ; it will sink to the bottom , and be easily seen there if the water be clean . It must lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it up but by diving for it . * To encourage yourself , in order to do this , reflect that your progress will be from deep to shallow water , and that at any time you may , by bringing your legs under you , and standing on the bottom , raise your head far above the water ; then plunge under it with your eyes open , which must be kept open before going under , as you can not open the eyelids for the weight of water above you ; throwing yourself toward the egg , and endeavoring , by the action of your hands and feet against the water , to get forward , till within reach of it . In this attempt you will find that the water buoys you up against your inclination ; that it is not so easy to sink as you imagine , and that you can not , but . by active force get down to the egg . Thus you feel the power of water to support you , and learn to confide in that power , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg , teach you the manner of acting on the water with your feet and hands , which action is afterwards used in swimming to support your head higher above the water , or to go forward through it . ' When a iswimmer is seized with the cramp in the leg , the method of driving it away is , to give the parts affected a sudden , vigorous , and violent shock , which he may do in the air , as he swims on his back . * When I was a boy , I amused myself one day with flying a paper kite ; and approaching the banks of a lake , which was near a mile broad , I tied the string to . a stake , and the kite ascended to a very considerable height above the pond , while I was swimming . In a little time , being desirous of amusing myself with my kite , and enjoying at the same time the pleasure of swimming , I returned , and loosing from the stake the string with the little stick which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whre I found that , lying on my back , and holding the stick in my hand , I was drawn along /z/ the surface of the water in a very agreeable manner . * Having then engaged another boy to carry nay clothes round the pond , to a place which I pointed out to him , on the other side , I began to cross the pond with my kite , which carried me quite over without the least fatigue , and with th greatest pleasure imaginable* I was only obliged occasion* ally to halt a little in my course , and resist its progress , when It appeared that , by following too quick , I Ibwered the kite too much ; by doing which occasionally I made it rise again  --  I have never since that time practised this singular mode of swimming , though I think it not impossible to cross , in this manner , from Dover to Calais . The packet-boat , however , is still preferable . ' /z/ A plank is useful in a bath to perfect the young swimmer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rope fastened to a beam over /q/ head is often a great assistance . A rope may also be fastened about the learner 's by , while a grown person holds the other end of it , and keeps him above the water . The use of corks and bladders to buoy the learner up , is recommended by some , but I would not advise you to employ them . If the corks should slip down your body , your head would take the place of your feet in the water , and you would run a great risk of being drowned . /z/ Diving , by practice , may be carried to astonishing perfection ; Pearls are brought up from the bottom of the sea by divers , who are trained to remain a considerable time underwater . In ancient times , divers were employed in war to destroy the ships of the enemy ; and many instances are related , by respectable authors , of men diving after , and fetching up nails and pieces of money thrown /z/ into the sea , and even overtaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diving may be performed from the surface of the water when swimming , by merely turning the head downward , and striking upward with the legs . It is , however , much better to leap in , with the hands closed above the head , and head foremost , from a pier , boat , or raised bank . By merely striking with the feet , and keeping his head toward the bottom , the diver may drive himself a considerable distance beneath the surface . In diving , the eyes should be open ; the breath should be held . /z/ All that is necessary for treading water , is to let your legs drop in the water until you are upright ; then keep yourself afloat in that position by treading downward with your feet , alternately ; and , if necessary , paddling with your palms at your hips . /q/ /z/ Never venture into the water when you are over- heated , or when you are perfectly cool . It is best to take a little exercise before going in . It is injurious to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time aie sufficient . Do not venture beyond your depth , unless you are sure that you can swim , but if you should get beyond your depth , be not flurried or frightened . Some means of sustaining yourself above water will often come natural to you until assistance may arriiFe . With regard to the proper time of the day for swimming , there are different opinions . One thing is certain : it is injurious to bathe immediately after meals . Noon is perhaps as good a time as any , at which to bathe . In entering the water , the head should be wetted first , either by plunging in head foremost , or pouring water on it . Before you adopt the first method , ascertain if the water be sufficiently deep /z/ to allow you to dive without touching the bottom , otherwise you may injure yourself against it . Do riot remain in the water too long , but come out as soon as you feel tired , chilly , or numbed . It is a good plan to make a plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to shore immediately , and an instant afterward enter the water at your ease , and take your lesson or your swim . You do not feel so chilly if you do this , as if you dash in and swim off at once . Never , be alarmed at having a few mouthfuls of water , wh  --  n learning to swim ; be not discouraged at difficulties , but bear in mind , that millions have done what you are attempting to do . Beware of banks which have holes in them , and venture out of your depth only l ) y degrees . If one of your companions be in danger of drowning , be sure that , in endeavoring to save him , you make your approaches in such a manner , as will prevent him from grappling with you ; if he once get a hold of your limbs , you both will almost inevitably be lost . tarn THE BOOK or SPORTS .

I recollect perfectly well the bruises , which I used to receive in my persevering efforts to make my way by this method , over the ice . And how I used to ponder over the affecting , but somewhat incredible story contained in Mother Goose 's Melodies  --  almost the only book for children , when I was young b You will excuse me for repeating the story here :  --  * Three children , sliding on the ice , Upon a summer day , As it fell out , they all fell in , The rest they ran away ! ' /z/ Coasting is a name , which has been given by American boys to the amusement of sliding down hill on little wooden sleds . When the ground is covered with snow , a boy goes to the top of a hill with his sled , upon which he places himself , and then pushing gently at first with his feet , away he /z/ glides down the declivitj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow may drift in his face , but on he glides , and thinks it capital fun . In Russia , in places where there are few natural hilts , artificial hills are constructed for the boys , who are very fond of this eicercise. /z/ Snow-balling is another amusement , of which my readers will not probably require a description . I would only caution my young friends , that should they ever practice this sporty they must make use of nothing harder than light snow . It is cruel and unnecessary to throw pieces of ice at your play-fellows . The following amusing account of a skirmish in the snow is by a spirited writer ; and if you have read the extract before , you may find it worth reading again :  --  * It had gently but steadily snowed all one December night , and almost all the next day . Owing to the weather , there were no girls excepting Captain Clark 's two , and no very small boys at school . The scholars had been unusually playful through /q/ the day , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full school . * When we were dismissed at night , the snow had done falling , and the ammunition of just the right moisture , lay in exhaustless abundance on the ground , all as level as a floor , for there had been no wind to distribute unequally the gifts of the impartial clouds . The first boy . that sprang from the threshold caught up a quart of the spotless but viscid material , and whitewashed the face of the next one at the door , who happened to belong to the rival side . This was a signal for general action . * As fast as ' the troops poured out , they rushed to the conflict . We had not the coolness deliberately to arrange ourselves in battle order , line against line , but each aimed at each as he could , no matter whom , how , or where , provided that he belonged to the " other end . " We did not round the snow into shape , but hurled and dashed it in large masses as we happened to snatch or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ill At length , from putting snow into each other , we took to putting each other into the snow . Not by the formal and deliberate wrestle , but pell-mell , hurly-burly , as foot , hand , or head could find an advantagOr The combatants were covered with the clinging element . It was as if their woollen habiliments had turned back to their original white . So completely were we all besmeared by the same material , that we could not tell friend from foe in the blind encounter . No matter for this ; we were now crazed with fun ; and we were ready to carry it to the utmost extent that time , and space , and snow would admit . Just opposite the school house door , the hill descended very steeply from the road for about ten rods . The stone wall just here was quite low , and completely ; covered with snow even before this last iall . The two stoutest champions of the fray had been snowing it into each other like storm-spirits from the two opposite poles .

Another stout fellow caught a glimpse of their position , gave a rush and a push , and both Arctic and Antarctic went tumbling heels hindmost down the steep declivity , until they were stopped by the new fallen snow in which they were completely buried ; and one with his nose downward , as if he had voluntarily dived into his own grave . ' This was a signal for a general push-off , and the performer of the sudden exploit was the first to be gathered to his victims below . In five minutes all were in the same predicanient but one , who , not finding himself attacked , wiped the plaster from his eyes , and saw himself the lone victor of the field . He gave a victorious shout , then not liking solitude for a playmate , he made a dauntless leap after the rest , who were now quickly rising from their snowy burial to life , action and fun anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow upon the ground , it is often the custom with boys to construct huts or caves of the pliable material . The little snow-ball may also be rolled al ( Hig the ground until it accumulates to a vast size , and is too heavy to move . * The snow ! the snow  --  alas ! to me It speaks of far-off dajs , When a boji ah skater , mingling fre Amid the merry maze : * Methinks 1 see the broad ice stiU ; And my nerves all jangling feel , Blending with tones of voices shrill The ring of the slider 's heel .

I WILL now teli you something about those amusements , which are enjoyed solely by the aid of the eye . Optical is a word derived from the Greek , and means , ' relating to the sight or vision . ' The science of optics affords a great variety of curious experiments , which are instructive as well as entertaining . By studying this science , men have been able to explain appearances , which when they happened many years ago , would frighten the ignorant and superstitious . It has been proved , that a diseased state of the eye may a person to see , with perfect distinctness , things , which in fact , are mere delusions . /z/ Many of the foolish old stories about ghosts and apparitions may be reasonably accounted for in this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , I think , you will find interesting . ' About ten o'clock at night , when Mr and Mrs A. were sitting in the drawing-room , Mr A. took up the poker to stir the fire , and when he was in the act of doing this , . Mrs A. exclaimed , " Why there 's the cat in the room ! "  --  " Where ? " asked Mr A.  --  ' ' There , dose to you , " she replied .  --  " Where ? " he repeated .  --  " Why , on the rug , to be sure . " v ' Mr A. , who had still the poker in his hand , pushed it in the direction mentioned .  --  . " Take care , " cried Mrs A. , " take care , you are hitting her with the poker . " Mr A. again asked her to point out exactly where she saw the cat . She replied , " Why sitting lip there close to your feet on the rug : she is looking at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were two cats in the house , one of which went by this name , and they were rarely if ever in the drawing-room . At this /q/ time Mrs A. had no idea that the sight of the cat was an illusion . * When she was asked to touch it , she got up for the purpose , and seemed as if she were pursuing something which moved away . She followed a few steps , and then said , " It has gone under the chair . " Mr A. assured her it was an illusion , but she would not believe it . He then lifted up the chair , and Mrs A. saw nothing more of it . The* room was then searched all over , and nothing found in it . * There was a dog lying on the hearth , who would have betrayed great uneasiness if a cat had been in the room , but he lay perfectly quiet . In order to be quite certain , . Mr A. rung the bell , and sent for the two cats , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' These curious illusions can not perhaps , be fully explained ; but probably ' they are pictures in the minds eye , more vivid than the pictures in the body 's eye . ' I will now tell you of a few of those /z/ m /z/ experiments and amusements , which the science of optics presents . /z/ There are few persons aware that when they look with one eye , there is some particular object before them to which they are absolutely blind . In order to be convinced of this curious fact , place two colored wafers upon a sheet of white paper at the distance of threq inches , and look at the left hand wafer with the right eye , at the distance of about eleven or twelve inches , taking care to keep the eye straight above the wafer . When this is done , and the left eye closed , the right hand wafer will no longer be visible . /z/ It was found by a French philosopher , that the impression of light continued on the retina , or /q/ optic nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , about the eighth part of a second , after the image is removed . Thus , if a stick , lighted at the end , be made to revolve , so as to complete a circle in that short period , we shall see not a fiery point , but a fiery circle ; because the impression made by it in every point of its circuit will remain until it comes round again to the spot , from which it set out . On this principle , - the Thaumairope is constructed . /z/ This very amusing toy is made and exhibited in the following manner : Cut out a circular piece of card , to which fasten six bits of string . Draw on one side of it a figure with balls , and on the other , two balls only ; then taking one of the strings between the forefinger and thumb of each hand , close to , the card , twist or twirl it rapidly round , and according to which pair of strings you use , the figure will seem to be tossing two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Various cards and devices may be used : for instance , you may /z/ draw a bird on one side , and a cage on the other ; a horse on one side , and a jockey on the other , ( taking care to reverse the figures , or draw them upside down to each other , ) and by using the different pairs of strings , you may cause the rider to appear upon , leaping under , or by the side of the horse , as you please . /z/ The camera obscura is an instrument , by which the outline of a prospect may be shadowed forth in a manner so clear , that it naay be transferred to paper . It is usually constructed in a box , of about a foot and a half square . You may also construct the camera obscura in a room , thus :  --  you first darken the room , by closing the shutters , and every place where the external light can be admitted . You then cut a circular hole in the shutter , or a board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens , or convex-glass , the focus of which is at the distance of not less than four , nor more than THE BOOK or SPORTS . 11 fifteen or twenty feet : from six to twelve feet is the best distance . At this distance , also , place a pasteboard , covered with the whitest paper , with a black border , to prevent any of the side rays from disturbing the picture ; let it be two feet and a half long , and eighteen or twenty inches high ; bend the length of it inward , to the form of part of a circle , the diameter of which is equal to double the focal distance of the glass : then fix it on a frame of the same figure , and place it upon a moveable foot , that it may be easily fixed at that exact distance from the glass where the- objects paint themselves to the greatest perfection . When it is thus placed , all the objects , which are in the front of the vvindow , will be painted upon the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the most natural colors. /z/ The object of this ingenious instrument is to represent , in a dark room , on a white wall or cloth . /z/ a succession of enlarged figures of remarkablei natural , or grotesque objects The representations are often quite amusing . A smith , for example , is made to hammer on his anvil ,  --  and a tempest at sea is represented , with ships tossing on the water . It requires some ingenuity to construct one of these instruments , and you can best learn to do this by taking one already completed , as a modeU /z/ The science of chemistry is one of the naost curious and important , to which the attention of man can be devoted . Its powers are great , and to an ignorant person , truly wonderful . Before describing to you some of the amusements , which it affords , I would caution you against attempting any of those , which can be productive of mischief . /z/ Sympathetic inks are certain liquors , which alone , and in their natural states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other , or by some particular circumstance , assume a certain color . Chemistry presents us with a great many liquors of this kind , the most curious of which we shall here describe . 1 . If you write with a solution of green vitriol , to which a little acid has been added , the writing will be perfectly colorless and invisible . To render it visible , nothing will be necessary but to immerse the paper in an infusion of gall-nuts in water , or to draw a sponge moistened with the infusion over it . 2 . Write with a weak solution of alum in lemon-juice , and the characters will remain invisible until wetted with water , which renders them of a greyish color , and quite transparent . 3 . Write with a diluted solution of muriate or nitrate of cobalt , and the . writing will be invisible ; but , upon being held to the fire , it will appear perfectly distinct , and of a blue color : if the cobalt - should be adulterated with iron , the writing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ the ire the writing will soon disappear . If a landscape be drawn , and all finished with common colors , except the leaves of the trees , the grass and the sky , and the latter be finished with this sympathetic ink , and the two former with the adulterated solution just mentioned , the drawing will seem to be unfinished , and have a wintry appearance ; but , upon being held to the fire , the grass and trees will become green , the sky blue , and the whole assume a rich and beautiful appearance . /z/ Take one ounce of muriate of ammonia , the same quantity of nitrate of potash , ( saltpetre , ) and two ounces of isulphate of soda ; reduce these salts separately into powder , and mix them gradually with four ounces of . water ; the result will be , that as the salts dissolve , cold will be produced . A thermometer , immersed in the mixture , will sink at or below the freezing point . If a test tube be /z/ filled with water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be frozen . The above mixture is sometimes used at the tables of the rich , to cool the wine , wJien ice can not be procured . /z/ The most powerful of all freezing mixtures is a mixture of muriate of lime and  --  now : to produce the greatest effect by this mixture , equal weights of the salt , finely powdered , and newly-fallen snow , must be quickly mixed together . This is the mixture that is employed to freeze quicksilver. /z/ 1 .  --  Put a small quantity of calcined or pure magnesia into a cup , and pour over it a sufficient quantity of sulphuric acid to cover it ; almost immediately combustion will commence , and sparks will be thrown out in all directions . /z/ 2.  --  Rub a few grains of chlorate of potash , and about half the quantity of sulphur , together in a mortar , and a cracking detonation will be produced , accompanied with flashes of light . If a small quantity of the same mixture be wrapped in paper , laid upon an anvil , and smartly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will be loud in proportion to the quantity used . 3 . Hold the end of a rod of glass to a grindstone while it is revolving ; in a very short time it will become so hot , that phosphorus and other Combustible bodies may be inflamed by it . I must caution my young readers , however , against trying this experiment with gun-powder.  --  Wood rubbed against wood will also produce great heat . The natives of New Holland light their fires by this means . /z/ Place a lighted candle in the bottom of a jar which has its open part uppermost , ( the jar being /z/ filled with atmospheric or common air , ) then take a jar filled with carbonic acid gas , and invert it over the jar in which the candle is placed ; the effect is very striking ; the invisible fluid , being heavier than atmospheric air , descends like water , and extinguishes the flame . The whole to spectators who have no idea of substance without sensible matter , has the appearance of magic . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco-pipe , stop the mouth of it up with clay , and place the bowl in a fire ; as soon as the coal becomes heated , a small stream of gas will issue from the top of the pipe . If a candle is put to ir the gas will take fire , and burn for some time . LIQUID PJElODUCliD FHOM tWO SOLIDS . Mix equal portions of sulphate of soda and acetate of lead , both in fine powder : let them be well /q/ rubbed together in a mortat , when the two solids will operate upon each other , and a fluid will be produced . /z/ If a saturated solution of muriate of lime be mixed with a saturated solution of carbonate of potash , ( both transparent liquids , ) the Jesuit is the formation of an opaque and almost solid mass . If a little nitric acid be added to the product , the solid iuass will be changed to a transparent fluid . These two last experiments were formerly called chemical miracles , but the present scientific age no longer ' considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes which take place are occasioned by chemical decomposition , or the action of one salt upon another . CHAPTER Xn . /z/ There are many curious questions in arithmetic , which ajSbrd good exercise for the mind as well as considerable amusement . They furnish subjects for quiet in-door pastime , and may be acceptable at times , when the weather or some other circumstance prevents you from playing in the open air . /z/ Bid the person take 1 from the number thought of , and then double the remainder ; desire him to take 1 from this double , and to add to it the number thought of ; in the last place , ask him the /q/ number arising from this addition , and if you add 3 to it , the third of the sum will be the number thought of . ' /z/ Desire the person to add 1 to the triple of the number thought of , and to multiply the sum by 3 ; then bid him add to this product the number thought of , and the result will be $ sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be ten times of the number required ; and if the cipher on the right be cut off from the remainder , the other figure will indicate the number sought . Example :  --  Let the number thought of be 6 , the triple of which is 18 ; and if 1 be added , it makes 19 ; the triple of this last number is 67 , and if 6 be added it makes 63 , from which if 3 be subtracted , the remainder will be 60 : now , if the cipher on the right be cut off , the remaining figure , 6 , will be the number required . /z/ This game is an appUcation of one of the raethocls emploj'ed to tell several numbers thought of , and ought to be performed in a company not exceeding nine , in order that it may not be too difficult . Desire any one of the company to take a ring , and put it on any joint of whatever finger he may think proper . The question then is , to tell what person has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on what joint . For this purpose , you must call the first person 1 , the second 2 , the third 3 , and so on . You must also denote the ten fingers of the two hands , by the following numbers of the natural progression , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , &c,; beginning at the thumb of the right hand , and ending at that of the left , that by this the order of the number of the finger may , at the same time , indicate the hand . In the last place , the joints must be denoted by 1 , 2 , 3 , beginning at the points of the fingers . TBt BOOK OF 133 To render the solution of this problem more explicit , let us suppose that the fourth person in the company has the ring on the sixth finger , that is to say , on the little finger of the left hand , and on the second joint of that finger . Desire some one to double the number expressing the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bid him add 6 to this double , and multiply the sum by 6 , which will make 65 ; then tell him to add to this product the number denoting the finger , that is to say , 6 , by which means you will have 71 ; and , in the last place , desire him to multiply the last number by 10 , and to add to the product the number of the joint , 2 ; the last result will be 712 ; if from this number you deduct 260 , the remainder will be 462 ; the first figure of which , on the left , will denote the person ; the next , the finger , and consequently , the hand ; and the last , the joint . It must here be observed , that when the last result contains a cipher , which would have happened in the present example , had the number of the /z/ finger been 10 , you must privately subtract from the figure preceding the . cijpher , and assign the value of 10 to the cipher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal reward on one of his courtiers , who had performed some very important service , desired him to ask whatever he thought proper , assuring him it should be granted . The courtier , who was well acquainted with the science of numbers , only requested that the monarch would give him a quantity of wheat equal to that which would arise from one grain doubled sixty-three times successively . The value of the reward was immense ; for it will be found , by calculation , that the sixty-fourth term of the double progression divided by 1 : 2 : 4 : 8 : 16 : 32 : &c,; is 9223372036864776808 . But the sum of all the terms of a double progression , beginning with 1 , may be obtained by doubling the last term and subtracting from it 1 . The number gMH  --  - . i /q/ of the grains of wheat , therefore , in the present case , will be 18446744073709561615 . Now , if a pint contain 9216 grains of wheat , a gallon will contain 73728 ; and , as eight gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hy eight times 73728 , we shall have 31274997411295 for the number of the bushels of wheat equal to the above number of grains : a quantity greater than what the whole surface of the earth could produce in several years , and which , in value , would exceed all the riches , perhaps , on the globe . /z/ A gentleman , taking a fancy to a horse , which an old horse dealer wished to dispose of at as high aprice as he could ; the latter , to induce the gentleman to become a purchaser , offered to let him have the horse for the value of the twenty-fourth nail in his shoes , reckoning one farthing for the first nail , two for the second , four for the third , and so on to the twenty-fourth . The gentleman , thinking he should /z/ have a good bargain , accepted the offer ; the price of the horse was , therefore , necessarily great . The old M &n; and his race-Horse .

How many dinners would be necessary for that purpose ? It may be easily found , by the rules already given , that the club must dine together 5040 times , before they would exhaust all the arrangements possible , which would require above thirteen years . /z/ What is the difference between six dozen dozen , and half a dozen dozen ? Answer .  --  792 :  --  Six dozen dozen being 864 , and half a dozen dozen , 72. /z/ Legerdemain , or sleight of hand , is the art of performing a variety of tricks , which , to a person unacquainted with them , seem truly curious and astonishing . I am not particularly partial to these kinds of sports , but it is well enough to know how they are performed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful , which is very simple . I am indebted to the ' Boy 's Own Book ' for the following ' tricks of easy performance . ' THE conjuror 's JOKE . Take a ball in each hand , and stretch your hands as far as you can , one from the other ; then state /z/ that you will contrive to make both the balls come into either hand , without bringing the bands near each other If any one dispute your power of doing this , you have no more to do , than to lay one ball down upon the table , turn yourself , , and take it up with your other hand . Thus both the balls will be in , one of your hands , without their approaching each other . . /z/ When a candle is burnt so long as to leave a tolerably large wick , blow it out ; a dense smoke , which is composed of hydrogen and carbon , will immediately arise . Then , if another candle , or lighted taper , be applied to the utmost verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; the flame of the lighted candle will be conveyed to that just blown out , as if it were borne on a cloud , or , rather , it will seem like a mimic flash of lightning proceeding at a slow rate . /z/ The thread haying been previously soaked two or three times in common salt and water , tie it to a ring for the finger . When you apply the flame of a candle to it , though the thread burn to ashes , it will yet sustain the ring . TflE BALANCED STICK . Procure a piece of wood about the length of your hand , half an inch thick , and twice as broad ; within a short distance of one end of this piece , thrust in the points of the blades of two penknives of equal weight , in such a manner , that one of them may incline to one side , the second to the other . If its other extremity be placed on the tip of the finger , the stick will keep itself upright without falling ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself again and recover its former situation . /q/ /z/ Half fill a glass of water , and put a shilling or a sixpence into it ; cover the glass with a plate , upon which , place one hand , while you hold the glass with the other ; turn the glass upside down , so that none of the water may escape ; place it on a table , and you will see the coin , at the bottom , larger than it is in reality , and another will appear , of the natural size , a little above it . /z/ Wind some linen thread tightly round a smooth pebble , secure the end , and if you expose it to the flame of a lamp or candle it will not burn . The caloric traverses , without fixing in it , and only attacks the stone which it encases . To a person who has never seen this experiment tried , it is quite interesting and extraordinary . /z/ Take a rose that is quite faded , and throw some sulphur on a chafing-dish of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sulphur , and it will become quite white ; in this state dip it into water , put it into a box or drawer for three or four hours , and when taken out , it will be quite red again . /z/ Dip a sheet of paper in strong alum-water , and when dry , repeat the process ; or , it will be better still , if you dip and dry it a third time . After this , you may put it in the flame of a candle , and it will not burn . /z/ Stick a little wax upon your thumb , take a bystander by the fingers , show him a sixpence , and /q/ tell him you will put the same into his band ; then wring it down hard with your waxed thumb , and , using many words , look him in the face ; suddenly take away your tbumb , and the coin will adhere to it ; then close bis hand , it %ill seem to him that the sixpence remains ; now tell him to open his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his great astonishment , he will find nothing in it . /z/ On each side of a table-knife , place , in the presence of your company , three waffers : small pieces of paper will do as well . Take the knife by the handle , and turn it over two or three times , to show that the wafers are all on . Desire some person to take off one wafer from one side of the blade ; turn the knife two or three times again , and there will appear only two wafers on each side ; remove another wafer , turn the knife as before , and there will appear only one wafer on each side ; take the third wafer away , turn the knife as before twice or thrice , and there will appear to be no wafer // on either side . After a momentary pause , turn the knife again two or three times , and three wafers will appear on each side . The secret of this capital trick consists in using wafers of the same si4e and ccrfor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly presented to the view , and the wafers are taken off that side , one by one . The three wafers will thus remain untouched on the other side , so that when you have first made it appear that there are no wafers on either side , you may , apparently , sh6w three on each , by the same means . The way to ' turn the knife is as follows ; when you lift it up , turn it in your hand , with your finger and thumb , completely round , until the side that was uppermost when you lifted it , comes uppermost again . This is done in an instant , and is not perceptible , if adroitly managed . /z/ You may make ati egg enter a phial without breaking , by steeping it in strong vinegar , for some THE BOOK or SPOBTS. time ; the vinegar will so soften the shell , that it will bend and extend lengthways without breaking ; when put in cold water , it will resume its former ligure and hardness. /z/ Dip a rose-colored ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water , and as soon as the color disappears , which it will do in a short time , take out the ribbon , and-put it into a very weak alkaline solution ; the alkali will quickly neutralize the acid , and the color will then re-appear. /z/ I NOW come to a notice of such holidays in the year , as are apt to be hailed by the young with eagerness and joy . And with what can I more appropriately commence my list than with NEW year 's day ? The custom of celebrating the birth-day of the year is very old , and prevalent among almost all nations . On this occasion , it is the practice of people to interchange wishes for each other 's welfare ; and the young anticipate a harvest of presents and picture books .

Not only does it prevail in America and in Europe , but it is said to be in full force among the Hindoos at the celebration of their Huli festival , which is kept on the 31st of March . /z/ It is the custom od this day ( although a custom , I think , which is far more honored in the breach than in the obserrance ) for boys to practise tricks upon one another .

' These jokes , if well-timed and not impertinent , are , perhaps , quite pardonable ; but not even the palliatory circumstance of its being April fool day can authorize tricks of a coarse or impudent character . My young readers will have the good taste to discriminate between the two . /z/ How welcome both to young and old is the first breath of returning spring ! May day is not now celebrated with the same ceremonies , which hailed its approach of old . Still it is a custom with young persons to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers and sprigs of green .  - -  And sometimes a May Queen is chosen , who presides over the amusements of the day . There are few holidays more worthy of being observed than this . /q/ /z/ The aDniversary of the declaration of independence is celebrated throughout the United States with great enthusiasm* Here it is the most popular holiday of the year , and on this day all the youthful companies of soldiers make it a point to display themselves .. It is painful to reflect , however , that the day is sometimes dishonored by riotous and unbecoming hilarity. /z/ This joyous anniversary takes place in autumn after the fruits of the earth are gathered in , and the toils of the farmer are rewarded with  --  plentiful harvest . The last of November or the first of December is generally appointed for this purpose by the governor , who issues a proclamation to that effect . After an attendance at church in the forenoon , and an expression of gratitude to the benefi- /z/ cent Giver of all good , the remainder of the day is spent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth . This is the day for family meetings , and it is then that merhbers of the same family often come iiundreds of miles to collect again around the blazing hearth . /z/ Christmas is the closing festival of the year , and it is usually celebrated with much joy . An article in a New York paper contains the following notices of this cheerful holiday : * The throngs of happy children that we encounter in the streets , whose little smiling faces look almost blue with the cold , but whom wind and weather can not restrain from sallying out to spend their holiday finances in the nearest toy-shop ; the greeting of " a happy Christmas " to you that salutes our ears into whatever house we step , and for saying which the urchins expect a return , but not in kind ; nd the peculiar nature of the amusements and sports around the - ' " ening fireside , where a sort of moral sunshine /q/ diffuses itself , bright in proportion to the bleak and disagreeable state of external nature  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which this festive period of the year is still observed . ' /z/ Need I describe to the young the meaning of this welcome word ? To those who have been industriously employed , who have attended to their lessons with proper care , and have no wasted opportunities to lament , vacation may indeed be welcome . On this occasion , the young inmates of the city generally go into the country to taste the novelty of rural life , and to roam with delight through the green fields . Here , in the language of the poet , * The world is beautiful and new , The earth is filled with flowers and dew ; Birds loudly sing on bush and spray , And we more merrily than they . We gather strength , we run , we leap , . Find joy in every thing  --  and sleep . ' /z/ The pleasures of the country are indeed maay to the boy , whose life is passed mostly in the close confines of the city . And when the country lad leaves his happy home , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its steeples , and its bustle , the contrast is not , perhaps , less new and pleasing . /z/ The custom of making riddles is very old , and were I to attempt to tell you all those which the ingenuity of mankind has invented , I should have to fill many volumes before I succeeded . A good riddle sometimes offers a pleasant exercise for the mind , when a cheerful circle of friends is gathered around the winter fireside . But the thought oftentimes expended on these occasions , might perhaps be bestowed on subjects more profitable and better calculated to fiirnish the mind with useful matters of reflection . There are different kinds of riddles , and the names of charades , rebusses , conundrums and ana- /z/ grams have been given to some of them I will show you . specimens of each of these , believing that it vill be sufficient , if you have an idea of their character , and the manner of their formation . /z/ Mj first do all nurses possess , And dandle my second upon it ; My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cap or the bonnet . /z/ Come from my First , ay , come ! The battle dawn is nigh ; And the screaming trump and the thundering drum Are calling thee to die ! Fight as thy father fought , Fall as thy father fell ; Thy task is taught , thy shroud is wrought ; So , forward ! and farewell ! /q/ Toll ye , my Second ! toll ! Fling high the flambeau 's light ; And sing the hymn of a parted soul , Beneath the silent night 1 The wreath upon his head .
