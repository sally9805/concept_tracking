txt Tun time is drawing near when new recruits are to be sent forth from our colleges . Among these young men the choice of a profession is probably the subject , which engrosses most of their thoughts . I hope , therefore , that the following remarks , in the form of a letter from a young man to his friend , will not be thought inappropriate . Yor ask me to tell you which profession I think you should choose . I will do no such thing ; but instead thereof ; will make a few remarks , which will tend to free you from unnecessary incumbrances and false guides , rather than afford any positive assistance in determining the question before you . In the first place , ask nobody 's advice . Consult no one , listen to no one . Otherwise you will be sadly perplexed . For friends will advise you , not upon right principles , but from their own prepossessions and prejudices . One is dazzled by the glittering mausoleum of an eminent lawyer . He recommends the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful physician . He recommends medicine . A third is charmed with the character of a clergyman , and prefers his plain monument of unsullied marble to the towering edifices raised by political ambition . He recommends divinity . Thus all the pursuits in the world may be recommended by your different friends . Now what is to be done ? Here you are on the threshold of life . You are without experience . You can not test for yourself the objects before you . In that case , life would be wasted before the work is begun . Men of experience offer different opinions . You can not rely upon t em , and yet the decision must be made . How is it to be made ? Disregard altogether the opinions of others . Study into the wants of the community , and the wants of your own soul . Examine the nature of your mind ,  --  its prepossessions , powers , and aptitudes . Learn which xvay your natural inclination , leads you , and in what your happiness consists . Then reflect upon the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoa are competent or capable of becoming competent to the duties , and how far you will be able to secure and enjoy the advantages . Beware of suffering extraneous circumstances to influence your decision . It is to be feared , that the fame of a few men , in the law , for instance , has drawn many into that profession , who were altogether unfit for it , and who might have been eminent physicians or useful clergymen . You must not be led astray by such considerations . That Marshall , or Webster , or Wirt has acquired a high reputation , is no reason why you should enter the same profession , unless you feel germinating within yourself the seeds of talents , such as they possess . Suppose that the shrub , which from its nature can never be more than two feet high , should say , as it sees the oak , towering to heaven upon a neighboring hill , " If I could only he planted upon that hill , I , too , should rise and kiss the heavens ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should undertake to vie with him in architecture , or that the beaver should spend his life in the attempt to soar above the eagle 's flight . Would it not be very // ridiculous ? And yet not more so , not a whit more ridiculous , than for you to engage in Law , Medicine , or Divinity , because charmed by the reputation of some great name , when you have not reflected a moment upon your capacity or incapacity for the pursuits upon which you would enter . This is making a strong statement . But I am satisfied that it would hardly be thought an exaggeration , could we but assemble before us the crowds , whose talents have been misplaced , and their energies wasted , in* consequence of the celebrity of a few distinguished men . I have at this moment in my eye the image of a young man , who was engaged in mercantile pursuits , and bidding fair to become a respectable merchant . But he chanced to form an acquaintance with a professional gentleman of some eminerce . Captivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same course , not doubting that he should meet the same success . lie therefore applied himself at once to hard study . But he was not fashioned for a scholar , and his progress was exceedingly slow . This was the source . of insupportable mortification to his morbidly sensitive mind . Still he persevered , and , after having spent I know not how many years in utter wretchedness , pursuing a route for which nature never destined him , he was at last obliged to abandon the project with a constitution so shattered , and a mind so discouraged , as to render him absolutely unfit for any employment whatever . Disregard altogether the suggestions of ambition . Fame is too small and mean a reward for the labors of a life . The man , who is most successful in pursuit of it , is , after all , an unhappy and disappointed being , if this has been the great object of his existence . See him walking to and fro upon the summit of his cold and barren promontory , muttering to himself words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " I had once looked up to the great men of the world with unbounded respect . I dreamed that if I could but reach their places , I should be happy . Ah me ! I did but dream . ' I reached those places . I-leaven answered my wishes , and added thereto what I had not dared to hope . But I am not happy . I am disappointed . I have climbed to the spot where my rainbow was extended ; hut the bright vision has fled . The place , which my childish fancy had peopled with sunny pleasures and rich and substantial joys , is but a desert . I once thought great men happy ; and as I perused the history of by-gone ages , my heart glowed within me at the contemplation of illustrious men , and I longed to follow , though at an awful distance , in their imposing train . I followed them . Hopes , desires , facilities increased , and I at length , have placed myself among them . But I am disappoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lofty mountains are indeed nearer to the sun than humble plains ; but they are only the more bleak and weather-beaten . Even the fogs , by which fens are infested , are hardly less frequent upon the mountain topsand then the storms , the merciless , pitiless storms , which . clatter against their rough sides ! Ambition , I no longer covet your honors* They are apples of Sodom-bitter dust and ashes . Striking and just are the words of Burke in his old age : - My Lord , if I know my own mind , I would not give a peck of refuse wheat for all that tim world calls great . ' " // But this is no place to preach upon the vanity and worthlessness of fame . Admitting the highest claims , which its advocates would make for it , still it is an unphilosophical object of pursuit . There are too many blanks , and the tickets are too dear to justify a purchase in the lottery . Mediocrity is the common portion of man . " Fame is no plant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with certainty , and few can put forth reasonable claims to it . Usefulness is an absolute term . It interferes with nothing else . It can exist alone . Any man may therefore be useful . But eminence and opulence are relative terms , and as much imply the existence of degradation and poverty as hills and trees imply the existence of valleys and roots . One man is conspicuous , not always because he is high ; but because others are low . If thousands rise together , all which the ambitious man desires is lost . Besides , fame will be quite as likely to come to those who seek it not , as to its most ardent votaries . I should advise you , therefore , to put it entirely out of your mind , in determining upon your profession . It is good for nothing when attained . You have hardly a chance of attaining it . If it is to come to you , it will come in that pursuit to which your talents are best adapted . He , who could never shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may , as a physician , a scholar or a clergyman , build up a reputation as durable and as valuable as the proudest trophies of the conqueror , or the richest laurels of the statesman . But I have dwelt too long on this point . You must decide upon it for yourself ; and if you find that your habits and feelings are such that fame or pelf must he the pole-star of your existence , of course , you have no thoughts of studying Divinity . That would be hypocrisy ; it would be sacrilege . Your mind is unfit for the sacred office , and you would take no pleasure in the performance of its duties . Religion is under light obligation to those , her recreant sons , however exalted in intellect , who have made her altars the stepping stones to worldly pr&amp; ferments , dignities , emoluments and honors . She has already suffered too much from such characters , and you will not add yourself to the number . If , however , you conclude that the great object of life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the surest means of advancing your happiness , and that your plans should be laid out and your actions performed with reference to this ; then all the great pursuits of life are open , and the difficult work of selecting is yet on your hands . The only question , which you are to answer , is , " In which profession can I be most happy , and do the greatest good ? " Considering the professions in themselves , the duties which they require , the manner in which they are filled , the general wants of the country , the character of your own mind , your feelings , habits , and physical temperament ; considering all these separately and relatively , you must determine for which you are best adapted , and in which you are most likely to succeed . You must not be satisfied with a partial view . It is not enough to decide that your talents are best fitted for law or medicine . It does not follow that you will therefore be nest sue *easful in these professioris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in want of liastors , iii *t not ; but remember that a you lose *i*ht of thib // common preacher , where preachers are wanted , may do more good and be more prosperous than an able lawyer where lawyers abound , in the same manner , and for the same reason , that he , who is an excellent physician and only a tolerable surgeon , will sometimes find himself more usefully employed in exercising his scanty knowledge of surgery than his consummate skill in medicine . Is not this a consideration which ought to have great weight upon the irimds of those about to engage in the learned professions ? Is not the bar full to overflowing ? Are two thirds of our lawyers really wanted ? To be sure , men of perseverance , talents and integrity will make their way , and do good ; but could they not be of more service in another profession which is not full ? I would by no means be supposed to intimate that all well-educated young men of principle will be more serviceable in the desk than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some may have minds of so peculiar a structure , that they are fit only for law . Others may have peculiarities of temper , manners , perhaps even of voice or countenance , which would render them worse than useless in the clerical office , while in other walks of life they might succeed . Better be without preachers , than have only those whose minds are so weak , or whose manners are such as to bring discredit upon their office . But when there is no peculiarity and no incorrigible prejudices in the way , is not the dearth of clergymen a very important circumstance , which should not be lightly passed over ? There are many other considerations of minor importance which I fear have too much influence upon young men . One is the comparative respectability of the several professions . Every one wishes to attach himself to a respectable class , lie feels that his influence , and , by consequence , his usefulness , is diminished , if he is associated with a degraded caste . So far as relates to the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are all respectable , all despised , according to the character of those by whom they are filled . Even within the narrow bounds of New-England , nothing has struck me more forcibly than the different estimation in which the same profession is held in different places . One place is persecuted by a hard , grinding attorney . There lawyers generally are dreaded , and the profession thought oppressive . In another place several young lawyers of small talents and less industry have lately opened shops for the sale of golden opinions , and there the profession is looked upon as light and worthless . A third town has been favored with a profound , honorable , honest , and humane practitioner , and there the respect in which he is held is extended to his profession . So with all pursuits . Ifsome have been thought to command too little attention , is it not on account of the inferior character of those by whom they are represented ? and will not the tables he turned and the professions duly respected as soon as they are filled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will every where be honored , while imbecility and fraud , ignorance and charlatanry , can find no station sufficiently high and no dress sufficiently rich to screen them from derision and detestation . Many are deterred from studying divinity , by the impres.sion that it will require them to be too staid and formal ,  --  by the idea that they would thereby obligate themselves to live a different sort of life from // what would otherwise be required of them . They are deterred from studying divinity by the same consideration , which deters many from joining temperance societies . They never drink ardent spirits ; never wish for them . But yet they are unwilling to promise to abstain . Et gui nolunt occidere quenquam , posse volunt . They want the power , they want the liberty , although certain that they will never have occasion to make use of it . He , who can deliberately harbor in his mind this sentiment , does well to keep from the pulpit . He has not yet acquired that command over his feelings , which becomes a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue , he will do well to divest himself of the weakness . Otherwise he will find it hard , very hard , to perform , with uprightness and integrity , the duties which the common walks of life will demand of him . Besides , the objection proceeds on a misgrounded assumption . Why are clergymen called upon to be more holy than other men ? What moral or religious duty is binding upon them , which is not equally binding upon the lowest drudge of society ? Happily , the days of clerical ostentation are going by ,  --  the days when a sanctimonious scowl and a holy drawl were the only passports to the pastoral office . It is happily discovered , that the clergy are men , subject to like passions with other men , equally liable to err , and having equal claims upon the sympathy and forgiving spirit of their brethren . Perfection is not expected of them . While they are on the earth , it is supposed that they will enter into the feelings and be affected by the vicissitudes of earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious concerns ; that they will rejoice in its prosperity and smart under its afflictions . Like astronomers , their business is with another world ; their principal thoughts are to be fixed upon heaven and heavenly things . Still , they are in a terrestrial atmosphere , exposed to its accidents , and affected by its changes . From the innocent amusements of life they are not shut out ; and what other amusements can a rational , moral being wish to enjoy ? Above all things , my friend , take care to select such a profession that you will delight to be employed in its concerns . Remember that your happiness and success depend upon common things ; that they are a thousand times more influenced by ordinary events , by your daily duties and occupations , than by any great epochs , to which you may look forward . Swift has but expressed what every student has felt , when he says , that the scholar 's happiness consists not in having knowledge , but in acquiring it . The professional man 's happiness consists not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in getting there . Life is spent in performing the journey . The repose , which follows , is short , uncertain , and too often fitful , interrupted , and distressing . You can place no reliance upon it . When surrounded with cares , overwhelmed with vexations , and looking anxiously around for the rest which your wearied system requires , it may be consoling to glance at the time , when , rich in wisdom and laden with honors , you may enjoy a dignified retirement in the bosom of your family and friends . But remember that it is only a fancy sketch ; that it can be enjoyed only in anticipation . Our business must be our delight , or we are wretched . Happiness or misery is engrafted upon every shrub and flower which we see in the journey of // life , and from them if from any thing it must be gathered . Nature has not been so parsimonious as to confine her gifts to the inns and stopping-places , which we may meet . Every moment is fertile , either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment , cheerfulness or wearisomeness . Time is not a desert , , unless we make it so . It is not a desert with here and there a gushing spring , a green shade , a fruitful field , to which we are to direct our steps . Far from it . It is an expanse every where richly diversified with " Sweet interchange Of hill and valley , rivers , woods , and plains ; " and every where , if our minds are rightly cultivated and our course judiciously selected , we can not fail to drink in happiness as the air we breathe . But if our minds are not properly regulated , and we have taken a false step , traveling a way repugnant to our feelings , habits and powers , it is of no avail that Nature has been thus bountiful in her gifts , that she has opened her stores of endless variety , and spread out her visions of surpassing beauty and loveliness . They are lost upon us . We have no relish for them . We are out of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could have enough of the breath of life insured to them to enable them with writhings and agony to perform the tour . Our duties are irksome . We shudder to enter upon them , and are impatient for the moment when they shall be accomplished . As the ox is dragged to the slaughter , as the prisoner is driven to his task , so go we to our business  --  to the business of our lives ! The sun shines ; but we heed it not . The showers descend ; but we regard them not . And all this because we have mistaken our purpose-because , for the sake of some remote and visionary good , we have engaged in pursuits , for which we have no taste , and in which we can take no pleasure . We have purposely deferred our happiness till some remote period which is subject to innumerable contingencies ; or rather , we have sacrificed the certain happiness which we might reap from employments congenial to our natures  --  a certain happiness which we might be enjoying all our lives long-this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanciful good , which , under the most favorable circumstances , can not come till our hearts are seared , our affections withered , our susceptibility blunted , and our health wasted , and which , at best , is but a " puff of empty air , " an uncertain , unsubstantial , momentary blessing . Do not lose sight of this . Consider that your happiness is inseparably inter*voven with the duties of your profession . If they are painful or irksome , life will pass but roughly . If they are agreeable , you may count upon as much happiness as falleth to the lot of mortals . " Choose the right way , " says an old divine , " and habit will make it agreeable . " But what is the right way ? It is not a spiritual , abstract right , of which you are in search . From many things which in themselves are good , you are to select that which is good for you , and to do this , you must submit to a severe self-examination ; you must carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various duties before you .
