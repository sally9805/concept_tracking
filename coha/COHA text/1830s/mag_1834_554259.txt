txt FRANCE , ' says the distinguished author of the work first cited above , we confess it with regret , with surprise ,  --  has been last to see the public attention directed to the art of instructing the deaf and dumb . ' With equal surprise , if not with equal regret , we may observe of our own country , that , while this interesting art has been actually in practice among us for nearly twenty years ; in the hands , too , of men distinguished for // their ability ; nothing has yet appeared to shed light upon its principles , or to gratify the public curiosity with regard to its processes . Hardly has , here and there , a feeble attempt been made to prepare a series of the simplest elementary school exercises ; and nowhere do we find even the shadow of a systematic course of instruction , or of a nomenclature reduced to logical method , having its foundation in the connexion between derivative ideas , and the primitive ones of which they are composed , or from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own country be still deficient , the labors of foreign writers have been so assiduous and so well directed , as to leave nothing , at least in mere theory , to be desired . Prolific Germany has produced her fifty writers on this single subject , considered in one or another of its aspects . France has more than retrieved the ground which she had lost ; and from apathy , has passed almost to enthusiasm . Her rapid advances have left all competition far behind , and placed her decidedly at the head of the science and of the art . To her we owe the work of Degerando , the only complete treatise which the world has yet seen , on the education of the deaf and dumb ,  --  a treatise , which , however particular systems may vary from it in their practical details , embraces those great fundamental principles , which , having their origin in the very nature of things , must lie at the foundation of all . Spain , Italy , Holland , Denmark , Prussia , Switzerland , England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvemen t . Still , though we have in this country done nothing toward perfecting the theory of this noble art , and little toward reducing to system the details of its practice , we have done that which , to the eye of philanthropy , may seem of much higher importance . We have shown ourselves not insensible to the claim , which this remarkable portion of the human family have upon our sympathy and liberality . We have established institutions , which , though of less than twenty years ' standing , occupy an elevated rank as well in character as in number . And though , in our extended country , the number of the deaf and dumb is great , and their wants inadequately sq*pplied by the existing provision for their education , still the heart of the philanthropist is gladdened , whether he contemplates what has already been effected , or the disposition which manifests itself among our countrymen , to prosecute to its accomplishment whatever yet remains undone . // Lamentable as the natural condition of the deaf and dumb evidently is , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencement of the sixteenth century , the idea had ever occurred to any individual in any country , that this condition might be ameliorated by education . To impart instruction to a person affected by constitutional deafness , seemed an undertaking so palpably impossible , that its practicability was never even proposed as a problem , much less was it made a subject of examination and discussion . The speaking world had all acquired language through the medium of sound , and knowledge through the medium of language . The belief was therefore universally prevalent , that language could only he acquired through the ear , and was , consequently , in the nature of things , beyond the reach of the deaf and dumb . This pernicious prejudice had its origin in the highest antiquity . It has the express sanction of Aristotle , who , at a stroke of the pen , condemns the deaf and dumb to total and irremediable ignorance . Prejudices still more severe than this , of a kind , too , to bring down upon the heads of their unfortunate objects evils , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , would have spared them , have extensively prevailed at different times and in different places ; nor are we permitted to say , that they are even yet entirely dissipated . Among some nations of antiquity , the deaf and dumb were regarded as beings laboring under the curse of Heaven . By the Romans , they were considered , if not as affected by positive idiocy , as at least deficient in intellect ; and were , consequently , by the code of Justinian , abridged of their civil rights . The Ahb6 de l'Epe6* asserts that , in some barbarous countries , the deaf and dumb are even now regarded as monsters , and put to death at three years old or later , probably as soon as the fact of their calamity can be satisfactorily ascertained . The benevolent Ahb6 further tells us , that very respectable ecelesiastics of his own time openly condemned his undertaking ; and that , too , on theological grounds . Parents , he remarks again , hold themselves disgraced by the fact of having a deaf and dumb child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and confine it in some obscure retreat . Condillac denies to the deaf and dumb the faculty of memory , * Institution des sourds et muds . Paris , 1776 . VOL . XXXVIII. - NO. 83. 40 // and , as a necessary consequence , the power of reasoning . Even among ourselves , how often do we observe a species of contempt for this unhappy portion of our brethren , or an absolute aversion towards them , which neither philosophy will warrant , nor enlightened benevolence approve ! It is certainly remarkable , that the deaf and dumb should have been almost universally regarded , in every age , as beings placed , in respect to mental endowments , somewhere between man and the brute creation . Deafness , in itself , implies no deficiency of intellect . A man of education may become deaf ; still his powers of mind will lose nothing of their vigor or activity . Blindness , in like manner , may supervene , without impairing , in the slightest degree , the mental faculties . The nerves which subserve these senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constitute only certain means of communication between the external world , and the intelligence within . They form no part of the intelligence itself . Let them be destroyed or paralyzed , and the communication is indeed cut off , or rendered imperfect ; but the soul , the recipient of information through the channel of the sense impaired , suffers , in consequence , a merely negative loss ,  --  a loss which consists in the failure , from that time forward , on the part of the sense impaired , to continue its usual observation upon external things , and to convey their results to the mind . To be deaf from birth , therefore , is not necessarily to belong to a class of beings of an inferior order of intellect , but only to be deficient in that species of information , which it is the province of the ear to collect without effort . it is to be ignorant , not weak , stupid , or savage . It is , indeed , to be ignorant in a very high and even fearful degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of science , and of morality , save in its first instinctive glimmerings ; to be ignorant of language , the great store-house of knowledge ; and , above all , to be ignorant of religion ,  --  to be , literally and strictly , without God in the world . ' We are too apt to attribute ignorance to natural inferiority of intellect , even when the cause is palpable ,  --  at least we too often associate these two accidents together . Thus have the deaf and dumb been judged deficient in intellect , because they were found to be so in that amount of information , which , in their circumstances , could only have been acquired by a miracle . Still more surprising is the circumstance , that the education // of these ignorant minds should so long have been regarded as a self-evident impossibility . To account for this , we must refer to another propensity of our nature , which is to believe , that things can not easily exist otherwise than as we have known them . That order of events to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our individual observation , has been invariably the same , seems at length to become the necessary order , and assumes the character and importance of a law , a departure from which would excite in us no less surprise , than to behold the sun rising in the west . Through the ear we have ourselves acquired our mother tongue . Through the ear we have learned the use of those visible characters , representing sounds , by means of which speech is depicted to the eye . rrhus , through the ear , we have become possessed of all our means of accumulating knowledge , or of commumcating with our fellow-men . And thus we conclude , that the ear must always be the channel , through which the mind is to acquire that species of knowledge , which this organ has been the means of conveying to us . But we conclude hastily . Let us suppose society in its infancy , possessed of no language whatever . The eye and the ear equally present themselves , as instruments , through which a communication may be established between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye offers the only means of intelligible intercourse . It is through the medium of signs addressed to this organ , that the value of other signs , more convenient in use , but infinitely more arbitrary , having sound as their basis , and addressing the intelligence through the eye , is gradually determined . This , which must necessarily take place in the circumstances supposed , is what does actually occur in the history of every infant , who learns his mother tongue , as is commonly supposed , entirely through the ear . It is what must take place in the case of a voyager , unexpectedly cast upon an unknown coast , and compelled to hold intercourse with a people , speaking an unknown language . For him articulate sounds assume their real character ; they appear as the mere conventional representatives of ideas : and whether he desire to make known his wants , to recount the history of his misfortunes , to awaken compassion , to implore relief and protection , or to deprecate cruelty , he finds himself compelled to abandon signs which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion of nature ,  --  to become , for the time being , dumb , and , // with whatever art he may possess , to address the understandings of those whom he desires to influence , through the eye alone . Ideas , then , may obviously associate themselves directly with visible signs , without regard to spoken language ,  --  without regard , in short , to articulate and audible sounds . Hence it follows , that those who are naturally destitute of the sense of hearing are not to be considered as incapable of intellectual culture . The degree to which their improvement may be carried is a farther question , and for the purpose of solving it , it is of high importance , to an instructer of the deaf and dumb , to determine the intellectual and moral condition , previously to all instruction , of those to whom his labors are devoted . This , indeed , seems absolutely necessary , that he may acquaint himself with the magnitude of his task , and ascertain the point at which his labors are to commence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accordingly , occupied the attention , to a greater or less degree , of every instructer . The conclusions to which the investigations of different men have led them , have , nevertheless , exhibited nothing like uniformity ; and , in many instances , nothing like justice toward the unhappy objects upon which they were exercised . So severe , indeed , are the judgments emanating from men who rank among the most able , intelligent and humane of those who have devoted their lives to this subject , so humiliating a picture do they present us in their delineations of a being , possessing certainly a soul , if not a language , and so little do we find in our own observations to justify their opinions and statements , that we are led with astonishment to set them in contrast with the ordinary acuteness displayed by their authors , and to inquire if it be possible that such sentiments can proceed from such men . The Abb6 de l'Epe6 , whose name is synonymous with benevolence , ranks uneducated deaf and dumb persons with the brutes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares that a deaf and dumb person is a perfect cypher in society , a living automaton , a statue , such as Condillac and Bonnet have represented him . He possesses not even that sure instinct , by which the animal creation are guided . He is alone in nature , with no possible exercise of his intellectual faculties , which remain without action , without life . As to morals , he // does not even suspect their existence . The moral world has no being for him , and virtues and vices are without reality . ' * It would be an unprofitable labor , in this place , to cite the numerous conflicting opinions , which the history of the art abundantly supplies . We quote a few by way of specimen . The learned and estimable instructer , Mr. T. Guyot of Groningen , assures us that the deaf and dumb are by nature cut off from the exercise of reason ; that they are in every respect like infants , and if left to themselves will be so always : only that they possess greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or law , are more violent ; assimilating them rather to beasts than man . ' * M. Eschke of Berlin says , The deaf and dumb live only for themselves ; they acknowledge no social bond ; they have no notion of virtue . Whatever they may do , we can impute their conduct to them neither for good nor for evil . ' 1 M. Ca*sar of Leipsic remarks , that the deaf and dumb indeed possess the human form , but this is almost all , which they have in common with other men . The perpetual sport of impressions made upon them by external things , and of the passions which spring up in their own souls , they comprehend neither law nor duty , neither justice nor injustice , neither good nor evil ; virtue and vice are to them as if they were not . ' Unfortunate as the condition of a deaf and dumb person without education obviously is , it is hard to suppose him so utterly degraded in the scale of being , as these extracts would warrant us in believing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidently , in many instances so dogmatically , expressed , did we not bear in mind , that the world is not yet free from the disposition , first to theorize , and afterwards to compel facts into an accordance , however unwarranted , with aprior* views . Nor can we forget , that most of these instructers have brought to their task the prejudices , which we have already enumerated as once universal , and not yet extinct . Nor can we overlook the tendency , inherent in human nature , to magnify the achievements of personal exertion , * Gours d'instruction d'un sourd-muet de naissance. 2d edition , Paris , 1803. * Cited by the Abbe Montaigne , in his Recherche* sur les COnflOiSsances ntellectuelles des sourds-muets : 4*c . Paris , 1829. $ Recherches sur les connoissances intellectuelles de3 sourds-miLetS , $ , *c . Ibid. // especially when a trivial coloring may impart to those achievements the character of the marvellous ; when the world is sufficiently disposed to receive any statement , however extravagant ; and when the known incompetency of the multitude to call such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of little consequence . It is gratifying to observe that all have not yielded to this natural and seducing tendency , nor suffered themselves to he blinded by prejudice or deluded by speculative inquiry . M. B6hian , an accomplished colleague of Sicard , has given us his opinion in the following words : deaf and dumb persons only differ from other men in the privation of a single sense . They judge , they reason , they reflect . And if education exhibits them to us , in the full exercise of intelligence , it is because the instructer has received them at the hands of nature , endowed with all the intellectual faculties . ' * M. Piroux , the accomplished teacher , now at the head of the institution at Nancy , in France , and formerly of the Royal Institution , expresses himself thus ; Let us guard against believing , that the sole privation of speech deprives the deaf and dumb of every prerogative of moral life . Judgment and reason , memory and imagination , are faculties which spIing up and form themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , and the moral sentiments , are a necessary consequence of the social relations . ' t Peter Desloges , a deaf and dumb person , who lost his hearing at the age of seven years , having previously learned to read , asserts , with something perhaps of hyperbole , of the uninstructed deaf and dumb of his acquaintance , that there passes no event at Paris , in France , or in the four quarters of the globe , which does not afford matter of ordinary conversation among them . ' Baron Degerando , whose conclusions are the result equally of philosophic inquiry , of personal observation , and of extensive intercourse and correspondence with practical men , uses the following language . The deaf and dumb , coming into the world with the intellectual faculties common to all men , though deprived of a sense and an organ , are capable of attention , of reflection , of imagination , * Journal de l'instruction des sourds-muets , et des aveugles . No. 1 . Paris , 1826. f Institut de sourds-muets des deux sexes , etabli *e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of memory . ' Of the writers who have so greatly exaggerated a calamity , already sufficiently deplorable , he observes , It is worthy of remark that no one among them has cited a single fact in support of his opinion . ' He supposes many of these writers to have been influenced by the notions of the Abb6 Sicard , which he can not contemplate without extreme surprise ; but which he attributes to the exalted idea which the worthy Abb6 had formed of his own success ,  --  an idea , which rendered him desirous of making the contrast between the educated and the ignorant dumb as wide as possible . We shall see , however , that the views of Sicard underwent a remarkable change . In the advertisement to his Th6orie des Signes* he says , It will be observed that I have somewhat exaggerated the sad condition of the deaf and dumb in their primitive state , when I assert that virtue and vice are to them without reality . I was conducted to these assertions , by the fact , that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas which they had before their education ; or that they were not sufficiently instructed to understand , and reply to my questions . I have always taught that the law of nature is engraved , by the creating hand , upon the soul of man ; that this law is anterior to all sensible impressions , which our organs receive ; that it is nothing else than the light divine , which teaches man his duties ; which awards him the meeds of approbation and happiness when he is faithful , and punishes him when he transgresses its dictates . ' Regarding , therefore , the deaf and dumb as beings possessed of an intelligence not wholly inactive ; beings , not entirely shut out from communication with their fellows : not entirely without interest in that which is passing before them ; not wholly unaccustomed to reason and to reflect ; and not absolutely without ideas , appertaining to the intellectual and moral worlds ; it becomes important to examine , how great a degree of development their mental powers are , capable of attaining , and how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has relation , of course , only to those dumb persons who have been deaf from birth . In every case in which deafness has supervened at a later period , the faculties of the // mind may have received considerable cultivation before that event . Even language may have been preserved , as in the case of Desloges , after the power of utterance is gone . Cases of this kind are , evidently , widely different from that of an individual , who , never having heard a sound , has of course never attempted to articulate , and for whom language , whether written or spoken , has ever been a sealed book . It is not to be supposed , that the intellectual faculties of the deaf and dumb will as frequently be called into exercise as those of other persons ; it is not , indeed , possible that they should be . The development of those faculties will , therefore , he much less rapid ; on account , at once , of this want of exercise , and of the greater labor requisite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by means of the signs which artificial languages afford to represent them . It is a consequence , also , of their calamity , that they are cut off from all that species of traditional knowledge , which naturally flows from generation to generation ; which is imparted almost unconsciously , and treasured in the memory almost without effort . The experience of the human race in each succeeding age is constantly adding something to the floating wealth of mind ; but of all this the unfortunate deaf and dumb know , and can know nothing , - nothing , at least , in comparison with the world which is to be known . In fact , it is , in their case , strictly true , as is remarked by M. B6hian , that the world , so to speak , commences with them . Still the very calamity which shuts them out even from the pale of that knowledge which is open to infancy , and familiar to the child of half a dozen years , is not without its favorable influence upon the originality of their conceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however humble , are at least the fruit of their own labor ; and their opinions , however , at times , erroneous , are still the result of their own independent reasoning upon such data as are within their reach . Their ingenuity is continually awake , to supply the deficiency of their information , and to break down , or at least to weaken , the barrier between themselves and the speaking world . ' A strong inducement with the deaf and dumb to become close observers , is found in the nature of their language . This beautiful language is their own creation , and is a visible testimony to the activity of their intellect . It is a language of action , full of force , full of animation , full of figurative expres // sion , oftentimes full of grace . In the province of pantomime they are themselves the masters , and those who hold intercourse with them , must be content to receive the instrument at their hands . The elements of this language , the words , so to speak , which compose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly of imitations , whether of objects or of actions , and beyond that limit , first of those universally intelligible signs , by which the mind involuntarily betrays its emotions , and secondly of metaphoric expressions , founded upon the analogies which exist between objects and actions in the physical world and intellectual and moral notions , require an accurate eye , and a constant exercise of ingenuity on the part of its inventor . A language , the work of a single individual , and that one laboring under the painful privation to which the deaf and dumb are subject , must necessarily suffer in comparison with those , which , in the lapse of ages , have been approaching perfection , and on which a multitude of minds have left the traces of their labors . Still , imperfect as it is , it has its advantages ; it employs no expletives merely to fill a place ; its signs are not rendered uncertain by being made to represent a multiplicity of ideas ; it is unencumbered by the forms of artificial grammar , with their exceptions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and description as it basis , it interprets itself . If , therefore , it is less the language of philosophy , it is more that of nature . Its copiousness is found to vary with different individuals , and with different ages . Those deaf and dumb persons , on whom particular attention is bestowed by their parents and friends , who have been , in short , willing learners , will prove themselves ready inventors , and delighted teacliers . Those , on the contrary , who are neglected and thrust out of society , will hardly extend their dictionary of signs beyond the limit to which their physical wants compel them . Still it would be unjust to conclude that this is likewise the limit of their ideas . Signs are , primarily instituted , whatever uses they may afterwards subserve , as instruments of communication . He , with whom none will hold intercourse , will hardly busy himself in perfecting a language , which he will never have occasion to use . This is not , however , to suppose him without ideas , wherever signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind employs itself with ideas , directly , rather than with their representatives . In like manner // as a draughtsman , in copying a design , fixes in his mind the image of a particular line , which he is about to transfer into his work , without being conscious of giving it a name ; so the deaf and dumb conceive ideas , for which they have no visible rep-. resentative . To persons not familiar with the language of action , it will hardly be found comprehensible , in its present state . However accurate originally may be its imitations , however striking its analogies , it invariably undergoes , in the hands of the dumb , a sp ) ecies of abbreviation , which leaves it little title to the character which has been claimed for it , of constituting a natural and universal language . Thought continually outstrips the slowness of pantomine ; and the mind , impatient of delay , rejects the details of description , and seizing the characteristic , which , in each object , stands most prominently forth , substitutes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same is true of ideas purely intellectual . The metaphor which supplies them with a visible representative , is reduced to a single sign ; which , to be intelligible , must presuppose a knowledge of the subordinate portion of the picture , and which is , consequently , always more or less arbitrary . By the institution of these abbreviated signs , usually denominated signs of reduction , the language of action becomes singularly elliptical , as well as figurative . The ellipses will readily be supplied by one in frequent intercourse with the deaf and dumb , even when they occur in cases entirely new . But to a stranger , it will be necessary to exhibit the language as it is in its infancy , before the process of reduction has commenced ; and to sacrifice rapicity for the sake of clearness . This necessity will be instantly perceived by the dumb , and cheerfully complied with . And if one form of expression is found to fail , another and another will be supplied , with an almost exhaustless fertility of invention . Here will he apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure up no circumstance , likely afterwards to be of use in recounting past events , in describing absent objects , or in assisting those inquiries , by which the observer desires to obtain information from others . As , on the one hand , the dialects invented by deaf and dumb persons , living separately , are seldom extensively similar ; so , on the other , they are rarely , if ever , without some resemblance . But that which they have in common is but a small portion of the whole . Degerando remarks , that the signs // which usually differ are those denoting the very numerous class of material objects ; while those which indicate the affections of the soul , the few intellectual ideas in possession of the individuals , the common wants and ordinary usages of life , and objects of immediate personal use , are often identical . It can not be doubted , that , under ordinary circumstances , the uninstructed deaf and dumb possess a certain power of discrimination on moral subjects . They are certainly capable of distinguishing between good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express their indignation against the perpetrator of any enormity , though by no means affecting them directly or indirectly . They are conscious of possessing certain rights , and they can not but infer the existence of such Tights in others . Thus , , they have a notion of the right of property , which is not the less real , that it does not always prevent them from invading that right . What is there wonderful in this ? How many , with the light of revelation to guide them , and with the denunciations of the civil and the divine laws equally hanging over their heads , are guilty of similar violence to their consciences ! But it would little avail the culprit to plead his crime in extenuation of his criminality . We moreover believe that the deaf and dumb have , in this respect , been severely judged . When M. Paulmier , a gentleman associated with Sicard , asserts that newly arrived pupils itsually plunder each other , he says Lhat , which our own observation , at least , will not hear him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain , without instruction , the same degree of distinctness , is not to be supposed . Much depends upon the early situation of the dumb , within the family or social circle . Some are indeed alone in the world , neglected and despised by all around them ; others are regard ed as objects of high interest , not only by their connexions , but also by all the intelligent and the humane in their vicinity . These latter partake , in some degree , the blessings of social intercourse , and experience its beneficial effects in the multiplication of their ideas , and the expansion of their minds . Hence may arise a diversity almost infinite . Cases may , doubtless , occur , in which the mental faculties will remain buried in a deathlike slumber for years . If , as the Abb6 de l'Epe3 asserts , some parents , holding themselves disgraced by the birth of a deaf child , confine it in a cloister , ' what can we expect of such a being , but that he should strictly // correspond to Sicard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain for life a living automaton , a walking statue ? Two things seem to be necessary to intellectual development , viz , the observation of objects , actions , facts and phenomena , and the intercourse of mind with mind . If neither of these conditions exist , the human being remains a mere animal . To the truth of this position , we have the melancholy testimony of experiment , in the case of the injured Caspar Hauser . If either exist singly , the expansion of the mind will proceed but slowly . Thus , we shall deceive ourselves , if , from the absence or the obtuseness of the moral sense , in the case of a dumb person who has , all his life , been treated like a brute , and has , therefore , been dependent almost wholly upon observation and solitary reflection for the ideas he possesses , we hastily infer a similar deficiency in all his companions in misfortune . The view here taken of this question , is far from having received the unanimous suffrage of those , who have published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montaigne , a French ecclesiastic , formerly connected with the school at Paris in the capacity of chaplain , has endeavored to establish a contrary position ; as well by argument , as by collecting the testimony of eminent teachers. * The Abb6 seems fully to have entered into the views of his favorite author , M. De Bonald , that language is the necessary instrument of every intellectual operation , and the means of every moral existence ; ' and that , to consider moral notions , words are indispensable . ' The conclusions of such a writer need not be detailed . They are discoverable in his premises . The particular reference of the Abb6 Montaigne 's inquiry is to the subject of Religion . In this respect , his views are not widely different from our own . But when , in his argumeut , he includes the whole field of morals , we are compelled to enter our dissent . And when , in his array of testimony , he cites the names of Sicard , B6bian , and Berthier , we are forced to believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of language , or to the exercise of candor . We have already cited the explicit recantation , made by the first of these men , of his early views . The second affords us so many * Recherches sur les connoissances intellectuelles des sourdsmuets , consid*n*s par rapport * 1'administration des sacr.hnens . Paris , 1829. // instances of opposition to the positions of Montaigne , that it is hardly worth our while to quote . The opinion of the third , being that of one dumb from birth , deserves attention ; and we accordingly give it a place . It relates to the religious notions of the deafand dumb . It is possible , ' he says , that some deaf and dumb persons may attribute certain effects , as storms , wind and hail , to a certain cause ; and may figure to themselves one or more extraordinary beings commanding the rain , the lightning and other natural phenomena ; but a deaf and dumb person , without instruction , will never have a notion , even vague and confused , of a superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revere and obey , and to whom he must give an account of his thoughts , and of his actions . ' Such is our own belief . We are acquainted with no instance of a deaf and dumb person , who has arrived , without instruction , at the idea of a God . Nor can we believe with Degerando , that a mind possessing so few resources , can ever attain , by its unaided reflections , to a notion of a supreme power , possessing a right to our worship and gratitude . Yet we are very far from believing language , whether written or spoken , necessary to communicate this notion ; and we know , in fact , that , in all our American institutions , religious knowledge is , to a great extent , imparted to the pupils , through the medium of signs of action , long before words are available to them as an instrument of communication . From this sketch of the natural condition of the deaf and dumb , we pass to consider the means , by which they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently , that a medium of reciprocal communication shall exist between the instructer and the instructed* To the former , we suppose pantomime a novel language . He is incapable of holding a connected conversation with his pupil ; for he can neither understand nor can he make himself understood . The parties must , therefore , for the time , change places . The first requisite to his own instruction , must be supplied by the pupil himself . He must give lessons , and the master must become the learner . A short time will suffice for the establishment of a common language , sufficiently extensive for the first exigencies of the teacher 's task . But this extent will soon be found too restricted . Yet it can hardly be enlarged , except as the circle of ideas , common to the teacher and the pupil , expands itself // For , beside identity of signs , a second condition is essential to intelligent intercourse , viz , identity of ideas . When two natives of different countries meet , each unacquainted with the language of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas in common , while the audible or written signs , representing those ideas , differ , for the two , as widely as caprice can make them . These two individuals fulfil the second condition , but not the first ,  --  they possess identity of ideas without identity of signs . Between them , the establishment of a common language resolves itself into a series of conventions . Vastly different is the case with the deaf and dumb , and their instructers ; where the number of common ideas is small , and even those not presenting themselves always under the same aspect to the minds of both . Between the ignorant and the learned in any country , there certainly exists a wide difference , as respects their habits of reflection , and the extent of their information ; and consequently as respects the number of well-defined ideas which they possess . But this difference is not greater , than that which divides uneducated deaf and dumb persons even from the inferior order of those who speak . So far as there is an actual community of ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of words may be communicated by the simple process of translation . But this limit must soon be passed , and we must then enter upon that labor , which constitutes , whatever be the particular system pursued , the real peculiarity , and , it may be added , the real difficulty of the art , viz. that of leading the pupil , by judicious methods , to the formation of a system of ideas , corresponding with the words of spoken language . Here , inded , is a task of no trifling magnitude . But the learner , though not yet possessed of the ideas themselves , possesses , nevertheless , the materials of which they are to he formed . The whole circle of ideas , which make up the sum of human knowledge , pertain , of ne* cessity , to the world of matter , or to that of mind . The one lies open before the deaf and dumb ,  --  it is our part only to teach him system in conducting his observations . For the other , he possesses the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring them into operation . We should remember , that it is no creative power , which we are called upon to exercise . We neither fabricate minds , // nor the material on which they are to be employed . We can not even he said to impart ideas , according to the vulgar notion of such a process . What is more common than the remark , that while there seems to he nothing wonderful or mysterious in the fact that the deaf and dumb may be taught the nomenclature of visible objects , it is impossible to conceive how notions , purely abstract , can , for the first time , be communicated to them ? The difficulty , however , is in a great degree created by the manner of considering it . It is , indeed , hard to imagine , how , by means of any a priori description , such an idea as that to which we apply the name justice , could be conveyed to an intelligence , to which it should be new . It is not by such means that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we ourselves have learned to associate this and similar words with their corresponding ideas . The deaf and dumb are not to be placed on the pinnacle of the temple of science in a day . They can not plant their feet upon the last step of the ascent , but by passing the intermediate points . There is no great gulf fixed between the extremes of simplicity and difficulty in language , which it is necessary with one mighty effort to overleap , or to abandon in despair the hope of those advantages , which artificial nomenclatures afford to mankind . From the highest to the lowest point , the chain of association is unbroken , and , if strictly followed , will lead , through every maze , into the clear light of day . From the remarks just made , result the four propositions ( with the exception of the last of which the reason is obvious , ) which follow ; and which may be regarded as fundamental in the instruction of the deaf and dumb . I. Instruction should commence , with borrowing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantomime , in its full extent . II . The instructer should carefully ascertain how far the ideas of his pupils extend before instruction , and how far they are just : he should know the extent , that he may build upon it , and the limit , that he may not exceed it . III . He should avail himself of those materials , possessed by the deaf and dumb in common with us , to aid in the formation of a system of ideas , corresponding to that represented by the words of our language . IV . He must present to the eye of his pupil , language under a visible form , and under this form must teach him to associate its terms directly with their corresponding ideas . // 324 April , To restore language merely to the deaf and dumb , is not however , the teacher 's only task . Language , as written , must be made to subserve , for him , all the purposes , which speech fulfils in the case of other men . it is the office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal means of communication among men , but also to aid the conception and arrangement of ideas ; and to facilitate the operations of the intellect . Every instrument , it is true , which shall answer the first of these ends , must , necessarily , at least to some extent , assist the exercise of the intelligence . But it is not equally true , that whatever instrument shall supply the intellect with the means of activity , shall also enable the individual who employs it , freely to hold intercourse with other men : since the teacher may devise a language , whether of action or of writing , which may he intelligible only to himself and his pupil . In the present case , indeed , he might easily create one , mut*h more easy of acquisition , than any which actually exists . Yet , as this would but partially fulfil the purposes of his education , the deaf and dumb must be content to take language as it is , encumbered with all its difficulties , its anomalies , its phrases and its idioms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to put the deaf and dumb in possession of the common language of his country , in so effectual a manner , that he may , first , find in this instrument the means of obtaining , in the highest possible degree , the intellectual culture , in which he is deficient ; and , secondly , that it may afford him the means of communication , the most constant and general , with his fellow-men . Whence it follows , that to enable him to use this language , we must afford him the material means , which is , itself , of most universal and familiar use . ' Here are presented two different species of labor in the field of instruction ; the one relating simply to the material or mechanical means , by which language is to be employed in practice ; the other , to the value of language itself . Thus early does the art begin to ramify ; and , from this point , the systems of instruction , most widely differing , date their divergence . By adopting the material form under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and under which it may he most easily acquired by one incapable of distinguishing between articulate sounds , time is gained for the more accurate study of language itself ; while , as respects ease and rapidity of communication with the world , something is neces // sarily lost . By cultivating , on the other hand , a more rapid means of communication , time is wasted in an employment almost wholly mechanical ; while the ease of intercourse , consequent on such an attainment , will render it a valuable auxiliary to the pupil , in rectifying his knowledge of words , and of the forms of speech in ordinary use among his more favored fellow beings . The material instrument which first suggests itself , as adapted to the wants of the deaf and dumb , is writing . Being already in use , and generally understood in society , it affords all the means absolutely necessary to the purposes of communication between man and man . Still it is a process always laborious , often exceedingly inconvenient ; it exacts a great consumption of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always furnished with the materials which its employment renders indispensable . It is , therefore , certainly desirable , that the deaf and dumb should acquire , if such an acquisition be possible , some method more rapid than this , for the purposes of colloquial intercourse . Still , the nature of things confines our choice within narrow limits . Writing and artificial articulation are the only means which present themselves , available to the deaf and dumb , and , at the same Lime , universally intelligible among men . The field is less circumscribed , when we address ourselves to the second part of our task , which is that of teaching language itself . We may here pursue the course , which nature has made necessary in ordinary education ; to give the learner , first a practical knowledge of language , and afterwards methodical instruction in its principles ; or we may combine these two branches of instruction into one . The latter is evidently the most cumbrous method , and the most tardy in its results ; yet it is the plan of Sicard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other respectable names . Either plan subdivides itself into two branches , of which the one is logical , the other grammatical . It will be the province of the former to acquaint the pupil with the value of language in discourse , and of the other to develope its prir*ciples . Each of these ramifications will have two subordinate divisions : the former embracing the significations of isolated words , and the consideration of their combined value in propositions ; the latter , the elements of language on the one hand , and the principles of construction on the other . Thus // in this second , and more difficult part of the undertaking , four distinct objects present themselves . Whichever route , of those distinguished above , it is determined to pursue , the teacher xviii be more or less at liberty to make his selection from among all the different combinations of means , which have received the name of methods of instruction . He should not , however , forget the influence of methods upon the development of the intellectual faculties ; but , bearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply the pupil with means for self-education , after he is removed from the eye of the master , as to convey positive knowledge to his mind , he should rather choose those methods , which call the mental faculties into most active , continued and beneficial exercise . We have now , in general terms , stated that which is to be accomplished in the education of the deaf and dumb . Methods must next occupy our attention , together with the material instruments which they employ , and by the combination of which they are distinguished from one another . Since , however , all methods equally propose to teach , or rather to create for the deaf and dumb a language , we will first present some preliminary considerations , peculiar to no individual system . There is , ' says Degerando , in the operations of the human mind , a primitive and principal phenomenon , to which all others attach themselves , and upon which the creation and the use of our languages exercise a considerable influence . This phenomenon , which we will denominate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholds the objects of its knowledge . Intuition is , to the human intelligence , the sole fountain of all light . ' Intuition is of two kinds , distinguished by Degerando as real , and rational . The mind , by means of the former , immediately and directly perceives whatever actually exists . This is the intuition of things and their images . The other is the perception of conditions and relations , which subsist among notions previously formed . It is the intuition of reflection and reasoning . It is the immediate act of judging . The objects of real intuition pertain alike to the physical , the intellectual and the moral worlds . It is by rational intuition that we seize the results of comparison , perceive the connexion between truths , and foresee consequences in principles . It presides , therefore , in every mental operation . // The exercise of rational intuition implies the presence of objects , with respect to which it may be exerted . Wherever real intuition exists , rational intuition follows as a consequence . It is involuntary ; and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every subject of thought in all its minute particulars , could we hold them up at once to the immediate vision of the mind , truths , which are now the deductions of laborious reasoning , would become axioms . But the power which we possess , of thus directly contemplating objects , is inadequate to such an effort . it is restricted in its operation within a narrow compass : and were the total of our knowledge limited to that which is strictly intuitive , we should be condemned to a lamentable degree of intellectual poverty . It is by the aid of the signs which language affords , that we are enabled to exercise rational intuition , when the real view of its objects is no longer possible . To obtain a clear idea of a new and*complicated machine , we observe carefully all its parts . When we recall the same machine to mind , we rapidly retrace the image , not at once of the whole , but of the individual parts successively . The idea of this machine can not be perfect , until the detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of real intuition , is at once tardy and laborious . Were it necessary that the elements of every complex idea should be thus set in array before the mind , as often as that idea is recalled , it is evident that no room would remain for the exercise of rational intuition ; in short , that our reasonings must sink under their own weight , and that the extension of our sphere of knowledge , beyond the list of truths which receive the name of axioms , would be impossible . But happily this is not necessary . A single brief sign takes the place of a load of details , and , like the light and portable representative of a metallic currency , enables us to use our wealth , without being encumbered by its weight . Names , further , enable us not merely to dispense with this mass of particulars ; but they afford us the means , also , of operating upon objects , which can not be submitted to real intuition . Take , for example , the word man . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties , whether of mind or of body , in which the individuals of the human race constantly resemble each other , and rejecting every particular , not appertaining to the whole family , is an acknowledged impossibility . Considering man as a collective , rather than an abstract term , the difficulty is // equally great . It is too high an effort for the mind , really and at once to conceive a clear and distinct image of the various races , ages and sexes , which go to make up the world of mankind . Thus we perceive , that , though the terms of our language may not always he the names of images , which the mind can directly and immediately behold , they still represent objects of positive knowledge . Signs , from their simplicity , may be immediately contemplated . The conditions , which were obscured by a mass of details , so long as real objects were kept laboriously in view , now stand prominently forth . The mind employs itself with signs simply , it is true ; but in so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this manner it advances gradually to the formation of notions , which , like the exam le above , are beyond the limit of real intuition . To pursue this subject farther , xvould draw us aside from our main design , which is to introduce the principle , that instruction in language should be founded upon the observation and study of real objects ,  --  that words should only appear , when the real acquisition of knowledge renders them necessary . This principle is a simple one , but its reason lies deeper than would at first be imagined . It is , that from this very primitive observation , by refinements more or less extended , have sprung all the terms of language . They are the landmarks established by the mind , to note its progress , and assist in directing its course , as it advances beyond the boundary of real intuition . As ideas without words are a possession of little value ; so words without ideas are worse than useless , yet how many words do children acquire by rote , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A method of instruction , resting strictly upon the principle of intuition , is by no means as easy in practice , as it appears in theory . There is so great a tendency in the human mind to overleap details , especially when they are familiar and simple , that the teacher will often find himself involuntarily leading his pupil , by strides too rapid for his unpractised steps . But , much more frequently , this principle fails to receive due attention in the school-room , from ignorance or wilful neglect . It is to restore it to its rightful preeminence , and to compel a universal and practical acknowledgement of its paramount importance , that the efforts of modern reformers in education are chiefly exerted . // In applying the principle of intuition to the instruction of the deaf and dumb , we perceive at once the importance , the necessity even , of some system of nomenclature , which shall follow , as nearly as possible , the genealogical succession of ideas ; that order , in which each idea naturally suggests its succession , and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothing of the clearness , which such an arrangement is adapted to create in the ideas of the learner , the labor of instruction , by means of it , is very materially economized . We have a measure of the pupil 's attainments in the number of words which he has acquired ; and thus we know where to avoid the repetition of details , which have already been made familiar . The words , which the learner successively adds to his vocabulary , constitute a kind of mechanical power , to aid in extending the circle of his knowledge . It is far otherwise , where words are taught as chance may direct . The same series of particulars must he actually presented to the mind in repeated instances , and without the pauses and points of repose , presented by the successive steps of a judiciously arranged system . The mind is , in consequence , encumbered by its burthen ; its ultimate ideas are indistinct and vague ; and it can hardly he said to possess the knowledge which it has acquired , Since , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of its conceptions . Still , a system of nomenclature , arranged on the principle above suggested , is perhaps an impracticable creation ; at least if it is designed to embrace the great body of words , which compose a language . It is an ideal perfection , to which we can only approximate . Particular sciences afford an illustration of the desideratum ; but it is perhaps too much to expect that this can ever be attained in that portion of a language , which does not admit of the exactness of mathematical definition . Systems classify themselves according to the different degrees of importance which they attach , respectively , to the different instruments , which may be made to fulfil the office of speech . These instruments are five in number ; viz , design , the language of action , dactylology , alphabetic writing , and the labial alphahet , accompanied by artificial pronunciation . The principle of classification will be more readily comprehended , after a brief examination of each of these particulars , and of the extent to which it can be beneficially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to // which the instruments , just enumerated , arrange themselves under two heads ; to wit , those which more properly represent ideas , and those which represent words merely . To the former description belong design and the language of action ; to the latter , writing , dactylology , and the oral and labial alphabets . The utility of design would , at first view , seem to be confined to the simple interpretation of the nomenclature of visible objects . A little consideration will show , however , that the resources , which it offers to the teacher , are much more extended . Actions , conditions , qualities , relations , are all capable of being depicted ; and hence verbs , adjectives and prepositions are within its province . M. B6bian has availed himself of its facilities to explain the use of the articles , the formation of abstract nouns , and the degrees of comparison . It is easily applicable to the exhibition of passions and emotions , by imitating the traces of their effects in the countenance and attitude . By means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notions still more refined . There exists no subject , however removed from the domain of sense , , to the elucidation of which its aid may not be invoked . Systems have been built upon the use of this instrument alone . It has been made the basis even of religious instruction . It was by means of pictures and diagrams , that Father Vanin , an instructer at Paris before the time of De l'Epe6 , attempted even to expound the mysterious doctrines of the Incarnation , and of a Triune God . The result of his efforts was , however , very unsatisfactory . NI . Saboureux de Fontenay , one of his pupils , afterwards highly distinguished under the tutelage of Pereir* , speaks thus of the effect produced upon his own mind . I believed that God the Father was a venerable old man , residing in the heavens ; that the Holy Ghost was a dove , surrounded with light ; that the Devil was a hideous monster , dwelling in the depths of the earth , &amp;c . Thus I possessed sensible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recital might shake our faith in the utility of emblematic explanations , as applied to iioral or religious notions , did we not perceive that the result in this case was the natural consequence of the original error , which made design the great instrument of instruction . A proper distinction must be observed in the mode of its use ; according to the nature of the subject , with regard to which it is employed . Whatever is material may // be directly explained by design ; and this instrument may , here , be implicitly relied on with security . That which pertains to the intellectual and moral world , can only he illustrated hy visible metaphorical representations ; which though liable to mislead when made the principal dependence , impart , nevertheless , a very happy light to difficult notions , when used as accessory to othcr more certain means . The great utility of design consists in the economy of time , which it introduces into the system of instruction ; and in the certainty and precision , which ( whenever employed not in an emblematic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed . A picture is not necessarily limited to the definition of a single word . It may represent a proposition . It may be made to explain the different usages of language ; and here is one of the great advantages , which this instrument possesses , for the instructer . The use of design in the education of the deaf and dumb , is a subject which has not yet received from teachers the attention which it merits . The resources , afforded by this instrument , have not been fully developed , nor well understood , even by those who have employed it most in practice. * The Abb6 de l'EpQe rejected it entirely . In this country it has been principally employed , in defining the nomenclature of visible objects . A system of designs , judiciously chosen and judiciously arranged , is exceedingly to he desired . The task of preparing such a series , is not indeed one of small magnitude . Of all the attempts which have been made , and the plans which have been proposed in Europe , no one seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found an advocate beyond the original proposer . Still an imperfect system is better than none , and we can not refrain , here , from * In these remarks we have , perhaps , done injustice to M. Piroux , the able director of the Institution at Nancy . A series of designs has been projected by that gentleman , intended to exhibit objects , qualities , relations , actions and states of being ; and to afford visible illustrations of formulas of language , considerably involved . Thus , sentences like the following are explained by single pictures : A woman who is carrying a child in her arms , ' A dog , which is chasing a hare across a plain . ' The object of M. Piroux is , chiefly , to diminish the expense of education , by furnishing the means for primary instruction , in the common schools or within the family circle , before admission into a special institution . He would have his books universally distributed , at the public expense . But one number , we believe , has yet appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert , to supply the deficiency . The language of action is of essential importance in the education of the deaf and dumb . No system can dispense with the employment of this instrument . Its necessity , as a first means of communication , hetween the master and the pupil , is an axiom ; and is the substance of the first fundamental principle of the art . Still no question has been more vigorously discussed , than that of the extent to which this means should be employed in instruction , and of the degree of development which should be given to it as a language . That the language of action is capable of being reduced to system , and advanced to the perfection of spoken language , is a truth self-evident , at least to those , who have been accustomed to its use . No one can doubt , that , were a whole people of deaf and dumb persons to exist together from generation to generation , they would construct a visible language , equally copious , and equally perfect with the languages now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding system of ideographic writing . But this perfection could only exist in a state of high intellectual cultivation . Language being simply the nomenclature of ideas , its copiousness must always be the measure of their multiplication . Supposing the language of action , therefore , to have attained an extent comparable to that of speech ; we must suppose also a corresponding development of intellect , and a corresponding accumulation of knowledge in those with whom it originates . Such a language would , of course , be far from being adapted to the circumstances of the deaf and dumb as they exist . Its signs , to them , xvould be without meaning ; except so far as the limited circle of their ideas extends . it was , nevertheless , the notion of De l'Epe* , a notion adopted by his illustrious successor , that to extend the vocabulary of signs , until it is made to correspond with that of spoken language , is all that is xvariting , to reduce the labor of instruction to a mere process of translation . He conceived that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same process which enables us to acquire a second and a third . But in this view of the subject , plausible as it appears , there is a radical error . We have already seen , that what is peculiar in this art consists , not in the imposition of signs upon ideas , but in conducting the pupil // to the formation of the ideas themselves . A language of action may be , indeed , devised and taught , which , in conformity with the views of De l'Epée and Sicard , shall strictly correspond , even in its grammatical forms , with that of speech . This language may be translated into that of speech or writing ; yet , after all , the process may prove merely mechanical ; and we shall have accomplished nothing toward the removal of the real difficulty . From personal observation , we can , in fact , bear witness to the possibility of dictating to deaf and dumb persons complicated sentences , embracing the most serious grammatical difficulties , and of obtaining from them the corresponding words , properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comprehending that which they have produced . Let us look at this subject in the light of reason . The deaf and dumb present themselves before us , with a stock of ideas comprised within narrow limits ; and for these they have usually corresponding si0ns . Our task is to multiply these ideas . It will not suffice merely to extend the vocabulary . Each addition to the list of signs must represent some reality , now , for the first time , made a part of the pupil 's knowledge . Let us suppose our efforts successful in extending the circle of that knowledge but a single step . We have communicated one notion , to which the learner was previously a stranger . It remains to impose a sign upon this notion . Whether this sign shall be a word or an action is for us to choose . If an action , then translation must follow . Why this circuitous route ? Is any thing gained by it ? On the contrary , is there not something lost ? We desire to make our own language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of communication but of thought . This is among our fundamental principles . How can we more successfully attain this end , than by giving him but a single sign for each new idea ; and that sign , one appertaining to the class which we desire him to adopt ? But , again , the imposition of signs upon words , if the principle of the Abb6 de l'Epée be adopted , must take place , in many instances , without a careful determination of the corresponding idea . Otherwise there can be no translation , worthy of the name ; but only a double imposition of signs upon the same idea , constituting a load cumbrous to the memory , and dividing the attention between synonymous terms . If signs of action on the other hand be instituted , which are in themselves // insignificant , they may be productive of very bad consequences . The deaf and dumb person is accustomed to tecognise nothing in his language which has not meaning . He does not , and he can not , suspect insignificancy in any sign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea above his capacity , he attaches an idea of his own ; an idea in the nature of things erroneous . By giving , then , to his language the degree of development aimed at by De l'Ep*e , the master is sure to encumber him with a mass , either of useless , or of unintelligible signs ,  --  useless , in the first instance , when we consider that it is in words , and not in pantomime , that we desire him to think ; unintelligible , in the second , when we remember that these signs are imposed upon no real basis . In the one case , we thwart our own principal design ; in the other , we , at best , bewilder the learner . Signs , established in the manner considered above , have received the appellation methodical . It was the favorite labor of Sicard to systematize and perfect them . In spite of the disadvantage inseparable from their use , pupils , distinguished for their attainments , have been produced by the masters who have employed them but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . In determining how far the language of action may be really useful in facilitating instruction , we must consider it in the several stages in which it is intelligible to the pupil ; in which , in fact , it is his own work ; guided , it may be , by the teacher ; but not reduced , as the theory of methodical signs presumes , to conformity with a language , which must be understood before the conformity can be comprehended . Great imperfection must be expected in the signs which are the creation of the deaf and dumb person himself . These signs may be submitted to the correction of the master . In fact , in an institution where numbers are collected together , a more philosophical system , the joint production of t*achers and pupils will be early established ; and will be adopted by each pupil on his arrival . It is hardly possible , with every individual , to follow out a series of lessons , by which he may be guided , from a more accurate understanding of things , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandons his own signs for those which he finds actually in use , not because they appear to him more appropriate , but because they are universally intelligible . Still his own individual // signs will be carefully observed by the instructer ; since they afford a valuable means of penetrating the extent of his knowledge , of discovering how far his ideas of things are just , of determining the degree of his intellectual development , and of ascertaining the limit of his capacity . The language of action , rectified as above by the care of the teacher , will be useful to a certain extent , as affording the means of instruction by translation . But , by the freedom of communication which it establishes , it will also render the pupil , in a measure , the architect of his own intellectual edifice ; for it will enable him to profit by his own independent reflection . He possesses the means of interrogating his master ,  --  a means which he will not fail to employ . Still this language has its disadvantages , which , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of thought , are inseparable from the nature of its elements . These elements are threefold ; consisting , first , in the copies of those spontaneous expressions , by which the emotions of the soul manifest themselves to sight ; secondly , in imitations of external nature , whether of objects or of actions ; and , thirdly , in that species of figurative descriptions , by which , alone , that which is ideal can be made to assume a material form . These will evidently be intelligible , in the order in which they are here arranged . With regard to the first , there can be no mistake . The second , less self-explanatory , may still be rendered sufficiently complete to be comprehended . The third , however , are liable to greater uncertainty ; and , in more cases than one , when in practice they introduce no obscurity , may be presumed to borrow something of their significancy from tacit convention . It is in conformity with our first fundamental principle , to employ , for purposes of instruction , the entire language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have a meaning for him , and which , whether natural or not , may be denominated colloquial . Still it is the suggestion of reason , that , when these have fulfilled their purpose , and have found , by translation , their equivalents in spoken language , they should thenceforth yield their places to words . To continue their use is practically to deny another of our fundamental principles , and one of the highest importance , viz , that language should be made to the deaf and dumb what it is to other men ,  --  the instrument of thought ; for it is to render language subordinate // to pantomime , to make it the representative of a representative , and cause it to remain for the dumb what the learned languages are to us . In that case he will continue , perhaps for life , to be a mere translator , whether in conversation he occupy the place of the speaker , orof the person addressed . If we would , in any case , admit a departure from the strictness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of signs to the exercises of religious worship ; which , in a large institution , can not otherwise be rendered universally intelligible . Of the class of instruments , the office of which is merely to exhibit words under a material form , writing first demands consideration ; since this is indispensable , and this , alone , is sufficient to fulfil all the purposes for which such an instrument is desired . From the latter part of the proposition here laid down , however , many respectable instructers have withheld their assent . Written language , in their estimation , must always occupy a secondary rank . It must constitute the representative of some more privileged instrument , standing between it and the ideas , with which it is presumed unsuited to be directly associated . This instrument is found in methodical signs , or artificial pronunciation and the labial alphabet , according to the peculiar notions of the instructer . The reasoning intended to depreciate writing as an instrument of thought , seems hardly to afford anything sufficiently tangible to merit a very labored reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccustomed to employ the images of written signs , in conducting mental operations . We employ such signs as habit has rendered familiar ; but they are signs , of which the deaf and dumb can never avail themselves . For we must remember , that , with whatever labor and success we may bring the deaf and dumb to imitate sounds , and read the fleeting characters which appear in succession upon the lips of a speaker , speech , to them , can never be what speech is to us . Hearing is not restored with articulation , or with the power of reading on the lips . The deaf and dumb , then , can never possess that species of signs , intermediate between ideas and written words , with which our ideas are associated . The movements of the lips are to them visible , not audible signs ; and written words are nothing more . But argument is unnecessary , where the evidence of facts is at hand . The ideographic portion of the Chinese writing is a case in point . And it is matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate ideas with words for which they have no determinate sign . For them writing is truly ideographic . Alphabetic writing is , indeed , sufficiently ill adapted to the wants of the unfortunate deaf and dumb . Constructed originally for a purpose altogether aside from their instruction , and without regard to their convenience ,  --  founded on no analogy , which they can comprehend ,  --  it imposes a severe burthen upon their memory . Still it is the sole instrument , common to them with other men , which presents itself to both parties , under the same aspect . It has the advantage over articulation , of requiring little effort for its acquisition , and of being immediately availahle in the earliest stages of instruction . The language of the visible alphabet is also the language of study . It is the store-house of all human knowledge . It may be perused , and it may be composed with deliberation . It affords room for the mind to rest , to resume its train of thought , to modify , to correct and to improve . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will , for the same reason , retrench superfluities , compel conciseness and precision of expression , and force the dumb to think with greater clearness , that they may express themselves with greater accuracy . From the importance of writing in this art , has resulted a wish , almost , if not entirely , universal , that some means might be devised to diminish the labor , which its employment exacts ; and to render it a more rapid instrument of communication . He who shall devise a system of stenography , applicable to the circumstances of the deaf and dumb , will confer upon them an inappreciable benefit . Space will not permit us , here , to point out at length the principles , which might serve as guides in the construction of such a system . It is , nevertheless , sufficiently evident , that the stenography of reporters , in our courts and public assemblies , will not answer the purpose . To the deaf and dumb , there are neither*vowels , consonants , nor silent letters . If articulation be taught , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise , these may be neglected . We are aware but of a single attempt to adapt a system especially to the use of deaf aid dumb persons , that of M. Recoing , author of " Le . sourd-muet enfendant par les yeux. " * We are not aware that // this system , which is intended to accompany articulation and syllabic dactylology , has ever been tested in practice . The stenography of M. Recoing , being adapted to the French language , could not , of course , be transplanted into ours . It remains for the ingenuity of instructers in our own country , to devise a plan fitted to our circumstances ; and we can not but hope that this ingenuity will be called into speedy and successful exercise . Dactylology , or the manual alphabet , has , with hardly an exception , been admitted as an auxiliary - in the instruction of the deaf and dumb . It consists in a set of signs , formed by the fingers , in partial imitation of alphabetic characters ; and it is employed simply as a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common consent has assigned it a subordinate rank ; but as a means of communication with society , or at least with those persons who will devote half an hour to its acquisition , it is very useful . The rapidity with which deaf and dumb persons employ it in their mutual conversations , and the readiness with which they will often seize a word , even from its initial letter , areastonishing . Under the head of dactylolo*y may he classed alphabetic signs , executed with one or with two hands , syllabic signs , and writing in the air . The two-handed alphabet is peculiar to England . Syllabic signs have been employed only by particular instructers . It is here that there remains a chasm , yet to be supplied . M. Recoing , by means of a system of his own invention , was able to interpret to his son a continued discourse , as a sermon or an oration , as rapidly as it was pronounced . Much of the success of the celebrated Pereir6 , is supposed to have been due to a system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished with him . In proportion as the manual alphabet is-made to represent syllables , the number of its signs is , of necessity , multiplied . The advantage , therefore , which it thus gains , is accompanied by an inconvenience ; - an inconvenience , however , not serious , if the abbreviation be not extended too far . Stenography and syllabic dactylology seem naturally to associate themselves together . He who shall devote his attention to the one , may munication avec ces infortun*s , par des proc*d*s abreviatifs de 1 ' *-criture ; suivi d'un projet d'imprimerie syllabique ; par le pdre d'un sourd-mnuet. - Paris , 1829. // with propriety make both the subject of his labors . Should the pupil , however , acquire a facility of articulation and reading on the lips , he may dispense with dactylology altogether . A question now presents itself , of the highest moment in the practice of this art ; and one on which the opinions of instructers have been most widely at variance . This question relates to the expediency of making the oral and labial alphabets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Entire systems derive their character from the view which is taken of this subject in detail . Before entering upon the discussion of the question , two propositions may be laid down , with regard to which there can be no possibility of dispute . It is evident from what has already been said , that the instrument we are now considering is not essential in the instruction of the deaf and dumb . Articulation is not necessary to the operations of the intellect , nor to the purposes of communication with society . On the other hand , it affords facilities , in the latter respect , too important to be disregarded . Hence results the second principle , that , if its acquisition be really practicable , no consideration should induce us to neglect it . We must be careful to remark , nevertheless , an important distinction among deaf and dumb persons , which renders the instrument we are considering , much more easy of acquisition to one class than to another . With those , who in early age have been possessed of hearing , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this faculty may be revived , more easily than it can be created in others . Certain reminiscences of articulate sounds will remain , long after their use has been discontinued . The power will not always be wholly lost , of supplying in the sentence , as pronounced , those subordinate parts which may not be distinctly observed . This is not , however , to deny to the deaf and dumb from birth , the power of acquiring the oral and labial alphabets . Experience has demonstrated the practicability of such an acquisition , in a multitude of instances . A person who is deaf and dumb from birth is dumb only because he is deaf . For him , indeed , the oral alphabet has no basis , either in the perception , or the recollection of sounds . Its foundation , its material , is in the sense of touch alone . His sole dependence is upon a circumstance , so entirely accidental to speech , that we ourselves only perceive // its existence , by a special effort of attention . Heinicke , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste . But between this sense and articulation , no connexion exisils in nature ; nor can we perceive how it can be created by art . Yet , under all these disadvantages , articulation is certainly available to the deaf and dumb . Another circumstance here demands attention . To us , the language of utterance and that of hearing are identical . They are the language of sound . We give no attention to the play of our vocal organs , nor to the movements which accompany articulation in others . Whether we speak , or whether we listen , we recognise but a single instrument of communication . It is otherwise with the deaf and dumb . To them the labial alphabet presents a system of signs , addressing itself to sight ; a system having its parallel in dactylology or in writing . Articulation , or the guttural alphabet , as it is denominated by Degerando , on the other hand , employs a different sense . Its elements are sensations of contact , resembling , remotely , those which the blind experience when they pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of reading . There consequently exists for the deaf and dumb in conversation , the necessity of making an abrupt transition from one instrument to another ; a necessity , which renders , for them , the employment of the oral and labial alphabets less simple than speech is to us . To the disadvantages already enumerated , others still remain to be added . The labial alphabet exacts proximity , and usually a direct view of the countenance . In darkness its use is entirely lost . It distracts the attention of the observer from his employment . One or other of these evils , however , is common to it with writing , with dactylology , or with the language of action . To say that they exist , therefore , is only to say , that they must exist for the deaf and dumb , under all circumstances . But further , both the oral and labial alphabets require time and labor for their acquisition . They exhaust a vast portion of the space allotted to instruction ; and take the place of those exercises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , and the enlargement of the sphere of knowledge . Worse than all , they exact individual lessons , and thus compel the instructer of a class to neglect the many while he occupies himself with a few . It must finally be said , that there are those , who , by reason of early neglect , or the // late period at which their education commences , do not possess the docility or flexibility of muscle , requisite for the attainment of artificial speech . Under all these disadvantages , is it desirahle , that the deaf and dumb pupil should be taught to speak , and to read upon the lips ? Most unquestionably it is . What labor , what study , what patient and unremitted exercise of the attention , can be weighed in the balance with the immense benefit which these instruments afford , in restoring him , absolutely and really , to the ordinary intercourse of society ! How broad a channel do they lay open , for the expansion of his views , the development of his intellect , the increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional , information in possession of all who hear , hut nowhere to be found in books , will thus be placed within his reach ! How will his moral perceptions be refined , his affections purified , his character , as a whole , exalted ! How will his acquaintance with language he extended ! What a variety of phrases , idioms , proverbial and colloquial expressions , will he added to the treasury of his knowledge ! With how much greater certainty will that important end of his education be answered , which requires that he shall be weaned from his favorite language of pantomime , and induced to adopt words as the Instruments of his intellectual operations ! Articulation is an instrument available under all circumstances , and with all classes of persons . It exacts not even an acquaintance with writing in those with whom the deaf and dumb may be associated . It will serve the purposes of communication , on one l ) ai't , at least , in darkness . This instrument has received the united suffrage of the great body of teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very authors of that system , which has led , in many instances , to the exclusion of the oral and labial alphabets , have testified in favor of their use , both in precept and practice . The former has given to the world , as a part of his work entitled La v6ritable maniire d'instruire les sourds-muets , ' a treatise on the means of restoring articulation to deaf and dumb persons , which , so late as the year 1819 , was republished at Paris , with a preface by the latter . In the course of this preface , the . Abh6 Sicard thus expresses himself . The deaf and dumb man is not completely restored to society , until he has been taught to express himself vivd voce , and to read speech in the // movement of the lips . It is only then that we can say that his education is entirely finished 1 ' We are now in a situation to consider the distinctive characteristics of different systems , and to determine , if we please , that which appears , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential difference we have already remarked , viz , that which exists between the instructers , who have chosen to separate practical and methodical , or , to use the words of Degerando , ordinary and classical instruction , and those , who prefer to unite these two branches into one . This principle of distinction by no means interferes with another , which we are about to lay down . We have noticed a classification of the instruments , employed to replace speech . We have seen that it is the pro* vince of one of these classes , more directly to represent ideas ; of the other , words . The superior prominence which different systems assign , in practice , to one or the other of these classes , constitutes the basis of their widest differences . On the one side , therefore , stand the advocates of methodical signs ; on the other , those of articulation . Two other species of systems remain , of which the one rejects both the above instruments , and presents , in the use of writing alone , the simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most complex . After what we have said , it is hardly necessary to declare our preference . In adopting the views of those who are in favor of articulation , however , we are admonished , by the extent to which our remarks have been protracted , that it is impossible in this place to discuss the merits , or even unfold all the peculiarities of the different systems . A brief recapitulation will nevertheless show , that the difference of opinion , presumed to exist among instructers , is vastly wider in imagination than in reality . The controversies , in which De l'Epée was engaged , have had their effect in magnifying the distinctions , which really exist . They have created parties among men who should have been united in the inquiry after truth . Had our notions of the art been derived from the writings and the experiments of those who preceded that distinguished philanthropist in the same field , we should have avoided those prejudices , under the influence of which we have acquired the information we possess ; and we should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather as our coadjutors , // than our opponents . In what respect are the opinions of different masters really at variance ? In questions merely of secondary importance . Perfect unanimity prevails in the employment of writing . No individual is so absurd as to reject the language of action . No one will deny the utility of design . Hardly a school rejects the manual alphabet . None question the expediency of employing the oral and labial alphabets , if it be practicable ; and few deny its practicability , at least in many cases , where deafness is not profound . Methodical signs are continually losing ground . Minor differences of opinion are continually vanishing , before the light of knowledge . Systems are amal*arnating ; and the time may be anticipated , as not far distant , when this art shall , like other arts , upon which the light of reason has been permitted freely to play , possess the character of unity which belongs to them . Why should the views of instructers differ ? Truth is every where the same . Experience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness the happy consummation , or whether it shall be reserved for another generation , perfect unanimity will , nay , must ultimately prevail . To this result , the plan of correspondence , established a few years since by the Institution at Paris , will materially contribute . The object of this correspondence is to bring about an interchange of views among instructers , by the publication of their letters , either in full or in substance , in a biennial circular . But three publications of this nature have yet appeared , of which we have affixed the title of the third to this article . It is drawn up , we understand , as was also the second , by the able Professor Morel , and embraces memoirs from various instructers , among which we look in vain for any from an American hand . In a country , which embraces within its limits at least three institutions , in numbers surpassing any three in any other , we can not view this circumstance without mortification . It would seem that a moral obligation should be felt among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to contribute , if it be but their mite , to the common stock of improvement . Cursory as is the view which we have taken of our subject , it is exceedingly incomplete . To those , who would pursue inquiries respecting it with greater minuteness , we recommend a careful perusal of the work of Degerando ; a work , of which we do not pretend , here , to have offered even an imperfect // analysis . What we have further to say , relates to the history of the art . This history , for the sake of convenience , is divided by Degerando into two distinct periods ; of which the first extends from the earliest essays attempted in the instruction of the deaf and dumb , to the time of De l'Ep*e ; the second , commencing from that era , reaches our own time . The first period comprehends a space ofnearly two centuries ,  --  the second , little more than sixty years . During the first , i nstructers were few and scattered ; in the second , comparatively numerous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of labor . The fir*a is the period of invention ; the second of improvement . The instructers of the first period were occupied , chiefly , upon the mechanical means of rep lacing speech ; those of the second , upon the logical teaching of language , and the cultivation of the intellect . During the first , the oral and labial alphabets were the instruments most generally employed ; with the second , methodical signs make their appearance , to the exclusion , in some instances , of articulation . The first period is that , in which instruction is principally individual ; the second is the period of institutions . During the first , the art seems to have constituted a species of masonry ; its processes were a mystery , and each instructer seems to have guarded his secret knowledge with peculiar jealousy . Since the commencement of the second , the veil has been torn away , systems have been opened to the light , and the discussion of their merits invited . The early instructers generally followed their art as an instrument of gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued it at great personal sacrifice . They have regarded the education of the deaf and dumb as a part of the great cause of humanity ; and have been stimulated to put forth exertion , by a sense of duty . The former seem , in most instances , to have been ignorant that others were , or had been , laboring in the same field ; they have known little or nothing of their . predecessors or contemporaries . The same processes have , therefore , been a first and a second time invented ; and the art has , consequently , for years , made little progress . It is the endeavor of modern times to promote improvement by a union of effort , and , for this purpose , to render the intercourse of instructers as frequent and as familiar as possible . The first period may , consequently , afford more interest to the curious inquirer ; the second to the professor , who is eager for practical information . // Spain may be called the cradle of this art . The first instructer , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a monk of the order of St. Benedict at Oi'ia . He published no account of his methods , and left behind him no manuscript . Our knowledge of him is principally derived from the brief notices of Francis Vall*s , and Ambrose Morales , two of his contemporaries . From these , we learn that he taught his pupils to speak ; and it is added by the former ( what is very improbable ) that , for this purpose , he employed only indicative signs . Another writer tells us that , in the archives of the convent at Oiia , is found a paper which attests , that the pupils of Ponce spoke , wrote , prayed aloud , attended mass , confessed , spoke Greek , Latin , Italian , ( as well as Spanish ) and reasoned remarkably well upon physics and astronomy . ' They were , ' said Ponce himself , so distinguished in the sciences , that they would have passed for men of talent , in the eyes of Aristotle . ' If this extravagant use of the hyperbole excite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful . Second in point of time , and the earliest author of a practical treatise on the art , was a countryman of the last , John Paul Bonet . Urged , as he says , by sentiments of personal affection , he undertook to instruct the brother of an officer of state , to whom he was secretary . He seems to have been ignorant of what his predecessor had accomplished ; though , with little reason , he has been accused of borrowing lis processes and exhibiting them as his own . Bonet employed the language of action , writing , dactylology and the oral alphabet . His work presents the hasty outlines of a philosophic system . The labial alphabet appeared to him an unavailable instrument ; one , at least , which could not be taught according to any fixed method . We are told of another Spaniard , deaf and dumb himself from birth , but how instructed we know not , by name Ramirez de Canon , who taught one of his pupils , a person of rank , to speak and write four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early found their attention arrested by the art , which at present occupies us . Among these , we find the names of Affinat* , the author of a treatise not remarkable for its merit , of Fabrizio d'Aqua* pendente , and of the father Lana-Terzi , a jesuit of Brescia . The latter , being occupied with a variety of curious questions , such as the art of flying , the quadrature of the circle , and tho // 346 April , philosopher 's stone ; of writing in cypher , of the means of teaching the blind to read and write , and of telegraphic coinmumcation , fell naturally upon the inquiry which forms the subject of this article . He examined the mechanism of speech , and the art of instructing the deaf in the knowledge of language . England , in the seventeenth century , presents us with the names of Bulwer , Wallis , holder , Dalgarno and Sibscota , all of whom directed their attention either to the theory or the practice of this art . Wallis , by common consent , seems to occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the author of a treatise on speech , and of other occasional papers , relating to our present subject . In a few instances he took the trouble to teach articulation ; but this instrument he afterwards abandoned ; not , however , because his views of its utility were altered . He avowed himself to be , as he believed , the original inventor of the art ; a claim which was disputed by William Holder of Blechington . Holder had , in fact , taught articulation to a single deaf and dumb person , who , having afterwards lost the faculty , attained it a second time under Wallis . But of him little is known , except that his views were rather superficial than otherwise . In passing to Holland , we meet with the name of Peter Montans , who is said to have offered some remarks upon the subject of teaching the deaf and dumb . Those , however , whose opinions are best known , and most remarkable , are Mercur* Van Helmont and John Conrad Amman . These men , both distinguished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildness of their notions , to have been moved by a spirit of philanthropy . They agree in attributing to language a divine origin ; in supposing the original language of man to have possessod properties , for which we search in vain in the degenerate dialects of modern days . They beheld in speech , not merely a conventional instrument of thought , but one possessing privileges , high , mysterious , inexplicable . Van Helmont held the opinion , that there exists a language natural to man ;  --  a language more simple in its construction and in its pronunciation , than any now in use ; that this language is the Hebrew , in the characters of which he seems to discover a resemblance to the positions of the vocal organs , requisite to give them utterance . The boldness of // these assumptions is a little remarkable , when we recollect that the pronunciation of Hebrew is forever lost . Van Helmont , ' says Degerando , pretended , in three weeks , to have put a deaf and dumb person in a condition to answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This person , if we believe Van Helmont , learned afterwards , in very brief space , the Hebrew language , by his unaided efforts , in comparing the Liebrew text with a German translation of the Bible . Of the probability of this statement we leave teachers to judge . Conrad Amman undertook the education of the deaf and dumb , without being aware that others had preceded him . He became afterwards acquainted with their works , and engaged in a correspondence with Wallis . We can not better convey an idea of his peculiar notions respecting the human voice , than by quoting his own words . There is in us , ' he says , no faculty , which more strikingly bears the character of life , than speech . I repeat it , the voice is a living emanation of that immortal spirit , which God breathes into the body of man at his creation . Among the immense number of gifts from God to man , it is speech , in which eminently shines the imprint of Divinity . In like manner as the Almighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to man , not only , in an appropriate language , to celebrate worthily his Author ; but , farther , to produce by speech whatever he desires , in conformity with the laws of his existence . This divine mode of speaking almost disappeared from the earth , along with so many other perfections , at that unhappy epoch , the fall . Hardly , in the long course of ages since elapsed , has the precious prerogative been accorded to a few privileged individuals . These were no other than souls , sanctified and united to God by fervent and continual prayer ; who , interrogating the very essences of things , have been endowed with the gift of miracles . These holy personages have exhibited to the view of other men traces of an empire , once common to all , but which most have suffered to escape . ' * If such notions excite surprise , we can not but smile , when we find the same writer gravely questioning , whether the apostles , on the day of Pentecost , really spoke in different tongues ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Dissertation sur la Parole , &amp;c. a translation , printed at the close of the volume of Desehamps . Paris , 1779. // 348 April , by means of which the well disposed of every kindred and people and tongue and nation , simultaneously comprehended their thoughts . In Holland , as in Spain and England , the art fell during a long period into total disuse , after the time of its first inventors . Our attention is next attracted to Germany . Names here begin to multiply . We are presented with those of Kenger , Ettmuller , Wild , Niederoff , Raphel , Pascha , Pasch , Schuize , Conradi , Soirig , Lasius , Arnoldi , and Heinicke . Among such a multitude we can notice only individuals . Kerger , assisted by his sister , undertook the task of instruction at Liegnitz in Silesia , early in the eighteenth century . He availed himself at once of design , of pantomime , of the oral and labial alphabets , and of writing . Of dactylology he makes no mention ; but of the utility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest terms ; entertaining , in this respect , views materially resembling those of De l'Ep*e at a later period . Contemporary with Kerger , was George Raphel , the father of three deaf and dumb children . Led first by parental affection to become an instructer , and having subsequently succeeded even beyond his hopes , he committed to paper an account of his method , for the information of others . This work was first published at Lunenburg , in the year 1718 . Lasius confined himself to the teaching of language under a visible form . He made use neither of the manual alphabet nor of design . Arnoldi , on the other hand , gave to this latter instrument considerable expansion , and taught the use of the oral and labial alphabets . He employed also pantomime , but only so far as it is the work of the deaf and dumb themselves . Samuel Heinicke was the director of the first institution for the deaf and dumb , established under the patronage of a government . This institution was founded at Leipzig in 1778 . Heinicke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , that , in the course of six weeks , he had taught a deaf and dumb person to answer , by ' writing , whatever questions were proposed to him . Arnoldi , says Degerando , could not but declare , that such a result seenied to him incomprehensible . Still , Heinicke was a man of no common ability ; and his success is attested by the reputation , which obtained for him the direction of a public institution . But he was , at the same time , a man of immeasurable self-conceit , irritable in // his temper , rude , coarse and overbearing in his manners . In consequence of the existence of such traits in his character , though his pupils were the principal sufferers , all who had to do with him were subject to more or less annoyance . He attributed to himself the honor of invention , but so far as his processes have come to the light , they afford no justification of his claim . In some trifling particulars , his methods were indeed peculiar , lie placed instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions of the vocal organs in emitting sounds . And he asserted ( what is very improbable , ) that he had made particular sensations of taste to correspond to particular articulations . Heinicke was a believer in the exclusive prerogative of the voice to serve as an instrument of thought . Otherwise , his views were eminently in accordance with sound philosophy . France seems not only to have been behind other European nations in her efforts for the education of the deaf and dumb , but even in the knowledge of what had been accornplished abroad . Hence , when at length she saw the advocates of this unfortunate class spring up within her limits , she opposed to them all those prejudices , which had elsewhere found their refutation in actual experiment . Still there exists testimony , that the practice of the art had not been wholly unknown , even in France , before the time of Pereir* and Ernaud . In 1769 , a man deaf and dumb from birth , named Guibal , is recorded to have made his will in writing ; and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will was confirmed . We have also some further evidence that the deaf and dumb were instructed but nothing satisfactory until the time of Father Vanin , who rested instruction , as we have seen , principally upon the use of design . After him sprung up Pereir6 , a Portuguese . Two of his pupils , whom he exhibited , at different times , before the Academy of Sciences , were remarkable for their attainments . These were Saboureux de *ontenay , and li'Azy d'Etavigny . Pereir6 made a secret of his processes . He offered to disclose them for a suitable consideration ; but this consideration being withheld , they perished with him . It is even said that he bound his pupils by an oath , not to discover his modes of ins.truction ; and made them a secret even to his family . We know , nevertheless , that the grand instrument of his system was a method of syllabic dactylology ; which , by its rapidity in voi4. xxxvflr-NO. 83. 45 // exhibiting words , enabled him , to a great extent , to rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apprised of the advantage of a logical method , in the teaching of languages . Few , if any , have been more successful than Pereir6 . Of his pupil Fontenay , De l'Epée records , that he translated foreign works , and himself composed a number of productions designed for the press . Ernaud , as well as Pereir6 , obtained the approbation of the Academy of Sciences . He employed himself very much in reviving the sense of hearing , where it was partially lost . He asserts , indeed , that he had met with no instance of entire deafness . Articulation was , of course , his principal instrument . The Abb6 Deschamps published , in 1779 , a work on the instruction of the deaf and dumb . To this branch of education , he devoted , in practice , his fortune and his life . Acknowledging the practicability of instructing by means of signs , he still accorded the preference to articulation and the labial alphabet . He refused , therefore , though solicited , to unite himself with the Abb6 de l'Ep*e . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assailed by the deaf and dumb Desloges , xv ho very earnestly vindicated the methods of De 1'Ep6e , and spoke , in the most enthusiastic terms , of the language of action . In glancing at the second period of this history , we have to regret that our notice of it must be but a glance . The Abb&amp; de l'Epée commenced the labor , to which his entire life , and the whole of his pecuniary means were afterwards consecrated , with completing the education of two twin sisters , who had been pupils of Father Vanin . The grand feature of his system we have already noticed . It consisted in giving to the language of action the highest degree of expansion , and rendering it , by means of methodical signs , parallel to that of speech . He attempted also the task of teaching articulation ; and , as we have seen , was the author of a treatise on this branch of the art . The actual success of the Abb6 de l'Ep3e was far from being equal to that of his successors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written in 1783 , he says , Do not hope that your pupils can ever express their ideas by writing . Let it suffice that they translate our language into theirs , as we ourselves translate foreign languages , without being able to think or to express ourselves in those Ianguages. ' // He has more to the same purpose . With the evidence of Pereir6 's success , in the case of Fontenay , under his eyes , these views are certainly remarkable . De 1'Ep6e commenced the preparation of a dictionary of signs , which was never published . He felt himself , from time to time , called upon to defend his views . He seems , voluntarily , to have thrown down the gauntlet to Pereir* . With Heinicke he held a controversial correspondence of some length , in which that instructer seems to have exhibited very little courtesy . A third time he came into collision with Nicolai , an academician of Berlin . The Abh6 Storck , a disciple of De PEp6e , had established a school in the latter city ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the former , that Nicolaf took occasion to attack the system of instruction . The details of these controversies , though interesting , are too extensive to be exhibited here . A few years after the death of De l'Ep*e , was established the Royal Institution of Paris , to the direction of which Sicard was summoned . It was the endeavor of this instructer , whose title to our veneration is beyond dispute , to perfect the views of his immediate predecessor and master ; and to carry out fully in practice the theory , which makes the instruction of the deaf and dumb a process of translation . Of Sicard 's success , we have living evidence in our own country , in the case of M. Clere at Hartford ; whose acquaintance at once with the French and the English languages leaves nothing to be desired . Massieu , also , whose education forms the subject of an entire work from the pen of his master , is an astonishing instance of the extent to which the intellectual faculties of deaf and dumb persons may be cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from noticing a few of the answers of these pupils to questions , of the nature of which they could have had no previous intimation . When Clerc was asked if he loved the Abb6 Sicard , be replied in the following words . . Deprived at birth of the sense of hearing , and , by a necessary consequence , of speech , the deaf and dumb were condemned to a most melancholy vegetation ; the Abb6 de l'Ep*e and the Abh6 Sicard were born , and these unfortunate persons , confided to their regenerating care , passed from the class of brutes to that of men : whence you may judge how much I must love the Abbe Sicard . ' Massieu , being once asked the difference between God and // nature , replied , God is the first Framer , the Creator of all things . The first beings all sprang fiom his divine bosom . He said to the first , you shall produce the second ; ' his wishes are laws ,  --  these laws are nature . ' Eternity , ' he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the flower of happiness . ' Gratitude is the memory of the heart . ' In this second period of the history , it is impossible that we should proceed further , with any thing like particularity . Germany affords us the names of Neumann , Eschke , C*esar , Petschke , Venus , Wolke , Daniel , Stephani , Ernsdorffer , Scherr , Neumaier , Gieger , Siemon , Grasshoff , and a multitude of others ; Switzerland those of Ulrich and Na*f ; Holland of Peerlkamp and the Messrs . Guyot ; England of Watson , Arrowsmith , and Ro6et ; Scotland of Braidwood and Kinniburgh ; Spain of D'Alea and Hernandez , and Italy of Scagliotti . France also presents us with many names , among which we notice those of B*bian , Piroux , P&amp;ier Jamet , Dud*sert , Gondelin , Ordinaire , Valade , and Morel ; to the last , we understand , was intrusted , at the Royal Institution , the preparation of the second and third circulars . It would afford us pleasure , here , to examine , specifically , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut our own country exacts of us the space which yet remains . In April 1815 , were taken the first steps toward the erection of an institution for the deaf and dumb in America . A feeble beginning , in the establishment of a small private school , had been previously made in Virginia . But of this nothing was known , at least no account was taken in Hartford . An interesting girl , the daughter of a highly-respected physician in that city , had lost her hearing at the age of two years . The Rev. T. H. Gallaudet , having become interested in her case , visited Paris , for the purpose of acquiring a knowledge of the system , employed in the Royal Institution . Returning , he brought with him M. Laurent Clerc , whose name has been already men tioned , and with whose assistance he laid the foundation of the Connecticut Asylum . This institution , which , having since experienced the fostering care of the Federal Government , has assumed the more exclusive epithet American , has always maintained a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the direction of Mr. Gallaudet , // pupils remarkably distinguished for their attainments . Of these , George H. Loring of Boston , who was retained for some years as an assistant instructer , after the completion of his education , acquired so great a facility in the use of the French language , as to astonish native Frenchmen with whom he conversed . Articulation never formed a part of Mr. Gallaudet 's system . He employed methodical signs , to a great extent , in his practice , but not without a careful previous determination of their corresponding ideas . He made it an important part of his plan , to lead his pupils to the formation of habits of reflection upon the operations of their own minds ; believing , very justly , that intellectual expansion will be more rapid , as the power of discrimination , between ideas having no palpable representatives , is increased . Mr. W. C. Woodbridge , editor of the American Annals of Education , was an early associate of Mr. Gallaudet . From this school , also , proceeded Mr. Peet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The American Asylum likexvise lent its aid to the establishment of the Pennsylvania Institution upon a secure basis . This school , first a private seminary commenced by David G. Seixas , was erected into a public institution , by an act of the State Legislature , passed in February , 18*1 . Soon after , Mr. Seixas having been removed , Mr. Clerc spent some time at Philadelphia , and was succeeded , on his return to Hartford , by Mr. Lewis Weld , an instructer of the same school . Mr. Weld was , in 1830 , recalled to Hartford , to supply the place of Mr. Gallaudet ; who , to the deep regret of every friend to the deaf and dumb , ceased , in the autumn of that year , to direct the American Asylum , and retired from the employment . The Pennsylvania Institution , under the direction of Mr. Abraham B. Hutton , has from that time continued to proceed with distinguished success . The first movements made toward the establishment of an institution in the city of New York , originated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Akerly , its first director , of a letter written by a dumb person in Bordeaux , offering to come to this country to establish a school . ' In the beginning of 1817 , a public meeting was held on the subject , at which many gentlemen , believing that two institutions were unnecessary , and could not be sustained , opposed the project . A better acquaintance with the statistics of our population soon // 354 April , rendered the necessity of another establishment self-evident . More than sixty deaf and dumb persons were ascertained to exist in the city of New York alone , and the returns were still incomplete . An act of incorporation was obtained in April 1817 . Under this act , a school was opened in the spring of 1818 , which , struggling against many difficulties , principally self-created , it is true , continued for years to languish on , hut seemed to hold its existence by a very uncertain tenure . It was the early error of this institution , to employ men entirely inadequate to the task they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake the confidence of its friends , and ultimately even of the Legislature , on which it was dependent , in the capacity of its conductors . They afforded also ample ground for the strictures which occasionally appeared , aimed directly or indirectly at the institution , and which were believed at New York to originate in a spirit of hostility to its interests . It was further believed , upon no reasonable ground whatever , that this spirit was cherished in the American Asylum and industriously propagated by its friends . The utmost forbearance was certainly exhibited by that institution , under imputations the most uncharitable , and most directly suited to excite indignant feeling ; and any one who knows Mr. Gallaudet , knows also that he is incapable of being influenced , even for a moment , by any unworthy motive . Something like a controversy seemed , notwithstanding , to spring up between the schools of New York and Hartford . We remark with some surprise , that this controversy embraces very little that is essential , in the art of instruction . It seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even here to involve the question commonly agitated on this topic , viz , how far this language should he employed in practice ; but only to concern the visible form of the signs used in the two institutions . It is asserted in the Encyclop*iedia Americana , that the New York Institution originated its own system of instruction . This statement , here first made in a standard work , is not indeed novel , neither is it true . The teachers at New York endeavored , to the best of their ability , to walk in the footsteps of Sicard . If , in the mere form of their signs of reduction , they differed from the school of Paris , nothing more was true of them , than is true of half the European institutions at the present day . Uniformity among many institutions , however desirable , * not essential within the walls of one . // It has been asserted that signs do not admit of description , and that those employed by Sicard can not be gathered from his works . His T/t6orie des Signes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictionary of such as deserve to be called methodical ; or such as were used by him to abbreviate the indication of words in practice . But this reasoning , as applied to the New York Institution in its infancy , rests upon a false basis . The pupil is the book in which the teacher must read . He brings with him all the signs which are available to him , in the commencement of his education . The number of these may be increased as the circle of his ideas expands ; but their particular form is far from being essential to the purposes which they are to fulfil . The Abb6 Jamet , at Caen , has instituted his own system of methodical signs , rejecting those of Sicard . In like manner , the instructers at New York had theirs , many of which are still held in recollection among the pupils , and are still intelligible . But the real evils under which the New York Institution labored , the real points of difference between it and the institution at Hartford , were the incompetency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which they chiefly relied , or their neglect to avail themselves of any thing like logical method in the teaching of language . They erred , in encumbering the memory of the pupil with isolated words , designated , each by its methodical sign , while the proper use of those words , in connected discourse , was yet but imperfectly understood . We have had visible evidence , in a multitude of instances , that their pupils were accustomed to regard written language , not as a practical instrument of communication , available under all circumstances , but as a possible means of exhibiting particular propositions . We must admit , therefore , that the New York Institution did not early fulfil the purposes of its charitable founders . The year 1830 was , however , the era of a radical reformation . It was during this year that Mr. Vaysse , from the Institution of Paris , entered upon his duties at New York ; and that Mr. Peet , the principal , previously for nine years an instructer in the American Asylum , concluded to accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Vaysse and Mr. Peet brought with them the methods and the signs , in use at Paris and at Hartford . As a natural // consequence , the institution at once assumed a character , which it had never before possessed ; and which immediately won for it anew the confidence , which had before been partially withdrawn . Uniformity , too , in the sign language , if that be considered an advantage worth mentioning , was , by means of this revolution , rendered universal among American institutions . There now exists but a single sign ( lialect , in the schools for the deaf and dumb on this continent . The system of methodical signs , early , as we have seen , in use at New York , was , after the arrival of Mr. Vaysse , gradually abandoned . The advantages , consequent upon thus shaking off the yoke of an artificial system , have been strikingly perceptible . Thus France , at whose hands our country first received the art , has furnished us with its most decided improvement here , in the correction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institution , on its new basis , is now proceeding with remarkable success . In addition to the methods already employed , it is seriously considering the expediency of introducing articulation ; the number of its pupils , capable of acquiring such a means of communication in some degree through the ear , being sufficient to warrant the attempt . Beside the establishments already noticed as existing in America , there is a school for the deaf and dumb in Kentucky , another in Ohio , a third at Canajoharie , New York , and a fourth in Quebec . All these have derived their methods from the American Asylum . That at Canajoharie , having been established merely for temporary purposes , by the Legislature of the State of New York , will probably be discontinued in 1836 . In reviewing the labors of American teachers , we can not but be surprised that so little has been done by them towards the preparation of books . It is an admitted fact , that the deaf and dumb need exercises , written expressly for their use . Yet , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note . Seixas and Gallaudet puhlished , indeed , some disjointed exercises , but upon these , we presume , they did not desire to stake their reputation . In the year 1821 , there appeared , at New York , a course of lessons by Dr. Samuel Akerly , which from its extent might seem to challenge criticism . Had the doctor , in preparing his work , fully understood the nature of his undertaking , we should have been disposed to meet the challenge . // To do so under existing circumstances , however , since his book has neither been found practically useful in the New York Institution , for which it was originally designed , nor any where else , would be a mere waste of words . The want of printed lessons is the disadvantage under which , at present , American institutions chiefly labor . To remedy this deficiency , along with that of a systematic series of designs , is the point , toward which the labors of instructers should , for the time , be principally directed . Can not a congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attempted ? Can not a division of labor be determined , which shall cause its advanta0es to be felt by the deaf and dumb now existing ? We have , hitherto , had too little concert . We have been employed rather in creating , than in perfecting institutions . We have been struggling , as we still are , against pecuniary embarrassments . We have been laboring that the patronage of the Federal Government , already extended to two seminaries , might foster also our undertakings . We have toiled , not so much for celebrity , as for existence . Confident in the belief , that the claims of the deaf and dumb would ultimately be acknowledged in their fullest extent , we have sought to establish points , around which the public charity might rally , and pour out , upon its objects , its blessings in their most efficacious form . For the Northern United States , these points are determined . For the Southern , they remain to he designated . Virginia owes it to her character , and to the numerous deaf and dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another , or it may be two , will be requisite for the South-western states . Regarding the promptitude of our countrymen to meet the calls of justice or of charity , in whatever form presented , we can not doubt that the wants of the deaf and dumb will soon be supplied ; and that the public beneficence , already extended to a portion , will , before the lapse of many years , be accorded to the whole . * By an act of the Legislature of Virginia , passed during the session of 1832-3 , a charter was granted for an Institution to be situated at Staunton , a position nearly central in the State . This place was selected in compliance with the conditions of a very liberal donation , said to have been made by one of its inhabitants for the purposes contemplated by the law . It is not known that any measures have yet been taken to carry the provisions of the act into effect.                    @
