txt THIS is very much the sort of work that might have been looked for from a " clever girl , " as the author repeatedly describes herself , educated in the green-room , under the eye of " my father , " in immediate contact with the not very straitlaced morals , and still less rigid manners of the children of ' Thespis , - a little " elated , " by repeated draughts from the intoxicating cup of public applause , in the old and new // world , - above all things bent on " fun , " but at the same time full of real talent , and influenced in the main by correct principles and good feelings . A series of observations , hastily noted down by a person of this description , in the intervals of acting , riding , romping , feasting , and coquetting , must of course be very desultory , and might well be expected to contain many things that were better omitted , but would be likely enough to furnish , on the whole , a piquant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little work before us . It is written throughout in a spirited style , and will be read in almost every part with interest . There is much indiscretion and bad taste , going , at times , to an extent which we hardly know how to excuse or account for ; but , mixed up with these unpleasant ingredients , there is also a great deal of correct observation and pleasant description , particularly of natural objects . The fair journalist appears , in one or two passages , to entertain doubts as to her capacity for writing English , and once formally proposes to herself the question , - Can I write good prose ? We feel no hesitation in answering this question in the affirmative . Her prose is , in the main , just what it should be for a work of this kind ; natural and colloquial , sometimes to excess , but constantly enlivened by pointed and felicitous turns of language , and rising , when the subject requires it , into elegance . The best passages are the descriptions of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of fine paintings : the next in value are the accounts of her own theatrical performances , and the critical observations on the drama . The strictures on men and manners , if not instructive , are , at least , as the author remarks of the italian Opera at New York , amusing . There are several attempts at poetry interspersed through the volumes , some of which are quite successful , and display a talent , that , with exercise and cultivation , may be made to produce very valuable fruits . It is remarked by Madame de Stael , that the adventures of almost every individual would supply , in competent hands , the materials for an interesting novel . The truth of this observation is in some degree illustrated in the work before us . It is , no doubt , as it purports to be , a section from a real journal , kept perhaps , at the time , without any direct view to publication , but as it happens to record precisely the most adventurous // and romantic portion of the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , the form of a romance . There is , to be sure , no great variety of characters , " I and my father " being the only ones which are brought forward with any distinctness , but the action is not without interest . A clever young actress of eighteen , the heroine of her own story , sets forth upon a voyage of adventures in a distant land , for the purpose of retrieving the fortunes of her family . She crosses the ocean , presents herself in her professional capacity to the notice of a new world , and encounters the alternations of favor and fickleness that make up the fortunes of the candidate for popular favor in every sphere . In general , she succeeds to her mind : sometimes , however , she is only " so-so-ish , " and at others she is reduced so low that she wishes she were " a caterpillar under a gree*i gooseberry bush . " In the natural progress of her course she travels far and wide through the land , sees men and cities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that comes into her head . After a while the golden thread of love begins to entwine itself in the " mingled yam " of her destiny . Among the numerous blanks that are continually clustering about her , the lottery of life throws up at her feet the rich prize of a devoted heart . Sundry bouqucts which are presented to her , are received in a way that seems to indicate a more than ordinary interest in " the author of the flowers . " Her equestrian excursions are not " companionless . " The sentimental part of the story occupies , it is true , but little space ; the hero is throughout a blank , and the narrative terminates abruptly , without any distinct intimation of the nature of the denouement . But thanks to those faithful chroniclers of the times , whom our author rather unceremoni* ously denominates " the press gang , " we are at no loss to divine what it is The heroine , after accomplishing the object of her expedition , terminates her achievements in the received manner by a fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors and triumphs , into the tranquil shades of domestic life . Here is certainly adventure enough to form the groundwork of a very interesting romance , in the hands of a writer possessing the qualifications necessary to excel in that kind of composition . Our author is amply provided with some of the most important of these requisites , such as imagination and power of language . In correctness of taste and maturity of // judgment she is singularly deficient . Although the merits oC the work preponderate , in our opinion , over its defects , the latter are so apparent , and in some cases of so unpleasant a kind , that a judicious friend would undoubtedly have recommended either an absolute suppression of it , or a much more thorough and careful revision than it appears to have received . It will , however , readily occur to our readers , that a person who was capable of writing precisely such a work as this , would be also very likely to publish it without much regard to any wholesome caution that might be given her upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my father " are the parties that will suffer more than any body else by the publication , if they are willing to " take the responsibility , " we do not know that the public at large need to complain . In noticing the work , we shall indicate , in a very succinct and rapid manner , the principal incidents in the narrative , and add a few extracts , by way of illustration , of the style and temper of the writer . The narrative commences with the author 's embarkation at Liverpool . The description of the voyage which follows , is lively and amusing , though containing rather more than the usual proportion of extravagancies in thought and diction . The ship " is every thing that could be wished . " She " writes doggrel upon it for the captain 's album , and swears that when she is once out of it she will love it infinitely . " The captain himself is a " very intelligent , good-natured person , and only one and twenty , which makes his having the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers " consist chiefly of traders in cloth and hard ware , clerks , and counting house men ; a species , with but few peculiarities of interest to one who can not talk pounds , shillings and pence as glibly as less substantial trash . ' ' The only of our crew** whom she " cottons to fairly , " are the - and that good-natured lad , Mr. , though the former rather distress her by their abundant admiration . " She pays the usual tribute of a fit of sea-sickness to the capricious element on which she is tossing , but in the intervals , what with walking , dancing , working nightcaps and bible covers , reading Moore , Byron and Dante , writing poetry , and looking at the moon and stars , she contrives , on the whole , to amuse herself tolerably well . We do not know that we have ever seen the curiously incongruous medley of accidents and characters that fill up the tedious six // weeks of a voyage across the Atlantic , more graphically brought before the mind than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the observations just and pointed ; at other times , however , they are amusing only in the sense in which our author afterwards applies the term to the opera at New York . Will it be credited that a lady , who has much to say in the sequel of a want of refinement in the manners of the people of this country , gives utterance to her feelings , dunn a night of storm and sickness , in the following elegant strain ? " Lay all day on my back , most wretched , the ship heaving like any earthquake ; in fact there is something irresistibly funny in the way in which people seem dispossessed of their power of volition by this motion , rushing hither and thither in all directions but the one they purpose going , and making as many angles , fetches , and sidelong deviations from the point they aim at , as if the devil had tied a string to their legs and jerked it every now and then in spite , - by the by , not a bad illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And again , - " At twelve went to bed ; the men kept up a horrible row on deck half the night ; singing , dancing , whooping , and running over our heads . " We quote these , which are not the most objectionable passages , in justification of our remarks upon the occasional display of bad taste and incorrect jud* , ment . The entry for Sunday , Aug. 19 , is a specimen of a much better manner , and proves that the writer , in the midst of her lighter pursuits and pleasures , flnd* some moments for serious reflection . " Did not rise till late , - dressed and came on deck , - the morning was brilliant ; the sea , bold , bright , dashing its snowy crests against our ship 's sides , and flinging up a cloud of glittering spray round the prow . I breakfasted , - and then amused myself with finding the lessons , collects and psalms for the whole ship 's company . After lunch , they spread our tent , a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being rung , we collected in our rude church . It affected me much , this praying on the lonely sea , in the words that at the same hour were being uttered by millions of kindred tongues in our dear home ; there was something , too , impressive and touching in this momentary union of strangers , met but for a passing day , to part perhaps never to behold each other 's faces again in the holiest of all unions , that // 114 July , of Christian worship . Here I felt how close , how strong that wondrous tie of common faith that thus gathered our company , unknown and unconnected by any one worldly interest or bond , to utter the same words of praise and supplication , to think perhaps the same thoughts of humble and trustful dependance on God 's great goodness in this our pilgrimage to foreign lands , to yearn perhaps with the same affection and earnest imploring of blessings towards our native soil and its beloved ones left behind . Oh , how I felt all this as we spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my most earnest prayers , Almighty God , who hast promised where two or three are gathered together in thy name , ' etc. * * * The bright cloudless sky and glorious sea seemed to respond ) in their silent magnificence , to our Te Deum . I felt more of the excitement of prayer than I have known for many a day , and t was good , - oh ! very , very good ! * * * * * * * * * " T is good to behold this new universe , this mighty sea which he hath made , this glorious cloudless sky , where hang , like dew drops , his scattered worlds of light , - to see all this and say , - These are thy glorious works , Parent of good ! ' After prayers , wrote journal , - some sea weeds floated by the ship to-day , borne from the gulf stream ; I longed to have it , for it told of land : gulls too came wheeling about , and the little petrells like sea-swallows , skimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sunny sea , now flickering away in rapid circles , like black butterflies . They got a gun , to my horror , and wasted a deal of time in trying to shoot these feathered mariners , but they did not even succeed in scaring them . We went and sat on the forecastle to see the sun set ; he did not go down cloudless , but dusky ridges of vapor stretched into ruddy streaks along the horizon , as his disk dipped into the burnished sea . The foam round the prow , as the ship made way with all sail set before a fair wind , was the most lovely thing I ever saw . Purity , strength , glee , and wondrous beauty were in those showers of snowy spray that sprang up above the black ship 's sides , and fell like a cataract of rubies under the red sunlight . We sat there till evening came down ; the sea , from brilliant azure , grew black as unknown things , the wind freshened , and we left our cold stand to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warm ourselves . This we continued , till one by one the stars had lit their lamps in heaven ; their wondrous brilliancy , together with the Aurora Borealis , which rushed like sheeted ghosts along the sky , and the stream of fire that shone round the ship 's way , made heaven and sea appear like one vast world of flame , as though the thin blue // veil of air and the dark curtain of the waters were but drawn across a universe of light . " On the third of September they arrived at New York . The following passage describes , in a lively and picturesque manner , the entrance into port . " I called H- , and we remained on deck watching the clouds like visions of brightness and beauty , enchanted creations of some strange spell-land , - at every moment assuming more fantastic shapes and gorgeous tints , - dark rocks seemed to rise , with dazzling summits of light , pale lakes of purest blue spread here and there between , the sun now shining through a white wreath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye shrank from , the edges of some black cloudy mass . Oh , it was surpassing ! - We were becalmed , however , which rather damped all our spirits , and half made the captain swear . Towards mid-day we had to thank heaven for an incident . A brig had been standing aft against the horizon for some hours past , and we presently descried a boat rowing from her towards us . The distance was some five miles , the sun broiling ; we telescoped and stood on tip-toe ; they rowed stoutly , and in due time boarded us . She was an English brig from Bristol , had been out eleven weeks , distressed by contrary winds , and was in want of provisions . The boat 's crew was presently surrounded , grog was given the men , porter to the captain and his companion . Our dear captain supplied them with every thing they wanted , and our poor steerage passengers sent their mite to the distressed crew in the shap* of a sack of potatoes . They remained half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering might and main . As H --  said , they were new faces at least , and though two of the most ill-favored physiognomies I ever set eyes on , there was something refreshing even in their ugly novelty . After this the whole day was one of continual excitement , nearing the various points of land , greeting vessels passing us , and watching those bound on the same course . At about four o clock a schooner came alongside with a news collector ; lie was half devoured with queries ; news of the cholera , reports of the tariff and bank questions were loudly demanded ; poor people , how anxiously they looked for replies to the first . Mr.  --  , upon whose arm 1 leant , turned pale as death while asking how it had visited Boston . Poor fellow ! poor people all , my heart ached with their anxiety . As thc evening darkened , the horizon became studded with sails ; at about eight o'clock we discovered the highlands of Neversink , the entrance to New York harbor , and presently the twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . We were all in high spirits , a fresh breeze had sprung up , we were making rapidly to land , the lovely ship , with all sails set , co urtesying along the smooth waters . The captain alone seemed anxious , and was eagerly looking out for the pilot . Some had gathered to the ship 's side , to watch the progress of Colonel - , who had left us and gone into the news boat , which was dancing like a fairy by the side of our dark vessel . Cheering resounded on all sides , rockets were fired from the ship 's stern , we were all dancing , when suddenly a cry was echoed round of A pilot , a pilot , ' and close under the ship 's side a light graceful little schooner shot like an arrow through the dim twilight , followed by a universal huzza ; she tacked , and lay to , but proved only a news boat : while , however , all were gathered round the collector , the pilot-boat came alongside , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glories of command , and we danced an interminable country dance . All was excitement and joyous confusion ; poor Mr.  --  alone seemed smitten with sudden anxiety ; the cholera reports had filled him with alarm , lest his agent should have died , and his affairs on his arrival be in confusion and ruin , - poor fellow , I was very sorry for him . We went down to supper at ten , and were very merry , in spite of the ship 's bumping twice or thrice upon the sands . Came up and dawdled upon deck , saw them cast anchor ; away went the chain , down dropped the heavy stay , the fair ship swung round , and there lay New York before us , with its clustering lights shining like a distant constellation against the dark outline of land . Remnained on deck till very late , were going to bed , when the gentlemen entreated us to join their party once more ; we did so , sang all the old songs , laughed at all the old jokes , drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperity , and came to bed at two o'clock . Our cradle rocks no longer , but lies still on the still waters ; we have reached our destination , thank God ! I did so with all my soul . " Her first care , after getting into lodgings , is , of course , to ascertain the state of her wardrobe , which proves , on the whole , to be pretty satisfactory . " Unpacked and sorted things . Opened with a trembling heart my bonnet box , and found my precious D6vy squeezed to a crush , - I pulled it out , rebowed , and reblonded , and reflowered it , and now it looks good enough pour les thauvages mamtkelle Fannie . ' Worked at my muslin gown , in short did a deal .

Thus on the 10th of Sept. after going to the Battery and seeing the fire works , she returns at 9 o'clock , and embroiders till midnight . " We ivent down to the Battery : the aquatic Vauxhall was lighted up very gaily , and they were sending up rockets every few minutes , which , shooting athwart the sky , threw a bright stream of light over the water , and falling back in showers of red stars , seemed to sink away before the steadfast shining of the moon , who held high supremacy in heaven . The bay lay like molten silver under her light , and every now and then a tiny skiff , emerging from the shade , crossed the bright waters , its dark hull and white sails relieved between the shining sea and radiant sky . Came home at nine , tea 'd , and sat embroidering till twelve o'clock , industrious little me We have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " my father , " upon witnessing these repeated traits of prudence and industry in his fair offspring , expressed his satisfaction with the same cordiality which was manifested by the honest train-band captain of famous London town at the managing spirit of his wife .

" Industrious little me , " in addition to her other good qualities , has a laudable desire to accomplish herself in all the useful and ornamental arts and sciences . " When they were gone , read a canto in Dante , and sketched till four o'clock . I wish I could make myself draw . I want to do every thing in the world that can be done .

" I am half inclined to believe that poetry is but a hothouse growth , and yet I do n't know ; I wish somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ca n't make out . " The following account of her visit to the ship which brought her over , and of an excursion to Hoboken , will serve as a specimen of her power of description . // " Rose late : there was music in the night , which is always a strange enchantment to me . After breakfast wrote journal . At eleven , Captain - and - called for us , and my uncle having joined us , we proceeded to the slip , as they call the places where the ships lie , and which answer to our docks . Poor dear Pacific ! I ran up her side with great glee , and was introduced to Captain - , her old commander ; rushed down into my berth , and was actually growing pathetic over the scene of my sea-sorrows , when Mr. - clapped his hands close to ' me , and startled me out of my reverie . Certainly my adhesiveness must either be very large , or uncommonly active just now , for my heart yearned towards the old timbers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her best , and after sitting for some time in our cabin , we adjourned to the larger one and lunched . Mr. - joined our party , and we had one or two of our old ship songs , with their ridiculous burthens , with due solemnity . Saw Mr. but not dear M- . Visited the forecastle , whence I have watched such glorious sunsets , such fair uprisings of the starry sisterhood ; now it looked upon the dusty quay and dirty dark water , and the graceful sails were all stripped away , and the bare masts and rigging shone in the intense sunlight . " The day was bright and beautiful , and my father proposed crossing the river to Hoboken , the scene of the turtle-eating expedition . We did so accordingly . Himself , D- , Mr. - , and I. Steamers go across every five minutes , conveying passengers on foot and horse-back , gigs , carriages , carts , anything and everything . The day was lovely , - the broad , bright river was gemmed with a thousand sails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placid and blue as a lake ; to the left , in the rocky door-way of the narrows , two or three ships stood revealed against the cloudless sky . We reached the opposite coast , and walked . It was nearly three miles from where we landed to the scene of the spoon exercise . ' The whole of our route lay through a beautiful wild plantation , or rather strip of wood , I should say , for t is nature 's own gardening which crowns the high bank of the river ; through which trellice-work of varied foliage , we caught exquisite glimpses of the glorious waters , the glittering pity , and the opposite banks , decked out in all the loveliest contrast of sunshine and shade . As we stood in our leafy colonnade looking out upon this fair scene , the rippling water made sweet music far down below us , striking with its tiny silver waves the smooth sand and dark-colored rocks from which they were ebbing . Many of the trees were quite new to me , and delighted me with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hickory with its bright coral-colored berries . Many lovely , lowly things , too , grew by our path-side , // which we gathered as we past , to bring away , but which withered in our hands ere we returned . Gorgeous butterflies were zigzagging through the air , and for the first time I longed to imprison them . In pursuing one , I ran into the midst of a slip of clover land , but presently jumped out again , on hearing the swarms of grasshoppers round me . Mr. - caught one ; it was larger and thicker than the English grasshopper , and of a dim mottled brown color , like the plumage of our common moth ; but presently on his opening his hand to let it escape , it spread out a pair of dark purple wings , tipped with pale primrose color , and flew away a beautiful butterfly , such as the one I had been seduced by . The slips of grass ground on the left of our path were the only things that annoyed me ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted mowing ; and if they had been mowed soft , and thick , and smooth , like an English lawn , how gloriously the lights and shadows of this lovely sky would fall through the green roof of this wood upon them . There is nothing in nature that to my fancy , receives light and shade with as rich an effect as sloping lawn land . Oh ! England , England ! how I have seen your fresh emerald mantle deepen and brighten in a summer 's day . " The contemplation of the beauties of our natural scenery seems in general to carry her thoughts by contrast , back to England , and with all her enthusiasm for the glories of sun and shade on this side the Atlantic , she recurs , with a kind of longing , to the fogs and fens of her dear country : like poor Vandeventer in the Elying Dutchman , who said that he would rather be a stone post fixed firmly in the streets of Amsterdam , than captain of the finest craft that ever sailed round the Cape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry and feeling , in the following extracts . " We had seated ourselves on the ship 's side , but he being called away , we rushed oft to the forecastle to enjoy the starlight by ourselves . We sat for a little time , but were soon found out ; Mr. - and Mr. - joined us , and we sat till near twelve o'clock , singing and rocking under the stars . Venus , - The star of love , all stars above , ' - threw a silver column down the sea , like the younger sister of the moon 's reflection . By the by , I saw today , and with delight , an American sunset . The glorious god strode down heaven 's hill , without a cloud to dim his downward path ; - as his golden disk touched the panting sea , I turned my head away , and in less than a minute he had fallen beneath the horizon , - leapt down into the warm waves , and left one glow of amber round half the sky ; upon whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to meet its golden fringe , // The maiden , With white fire laden , Whom mortals call the moon , ' stood , with her silver lamp in her hand , and her pale misty robes casting their wan lustre faintly around her . Oh me , how glorious it was ! how sad , how very , very sad I was ! , And again : " To-night , as I stood watching that surpassing sunset , I would have given it all , - gold , and purple , and all , - for a wreath of English fog stealing over the water . " Her first appearance on the stage in this country was as Bianca , in Milinan 's Fazio . A certain Mr. Keppel , who was the Fazio of the night , was a sort of b6te noire to " dear good little me . " She qualifies him as " the washed-out man , who failed in London , when he acted Romeo with me , " and hopes that he will " know more of his words tomorrow night , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the rehearsal , however , the state of things was not much better . " Mr. Keppel is just as nervous , and as imperfect as ever ; what on earth will he , or shall I do to-night ? " At length the first night comes , but brings no change in the unfortunate Fazio . In other respects , however , the result is pretty satisfactory . The house was very full ; all the - were there , and Colonel . Mr. Keppel was frightened to death , and in the very second speech was quite out ; it was in vain that I prompted him , he was too nervous to take the word , and made a complete mess of it . This happened more than once in the first scene , and at the end of the first act , as I left the stage I said to D , it 's all up with me , I ca n't do anything now , ' for having to prompt my Fazio , frightened by his fright , annoyed by his forgetting his crossings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like excitement , I thought the whole thing must necessarily go to pieces . However , once rid of my incumbrance , which 1 am at the end of the second act , I began to move a little more freely , gathered up my strength , and set to work comfortably by myself ; whereupon , the people applauded , I warmed , ( warmed , quotha ? the air was steam , ) and got through very satisfactorily , at least so it seems . My dresses were very beautiful , but oh , but oh , the musquetoes had made dreadful havoc with my arms , which were covered with hills as large and red as Vesuvius in an eruption . " // Her next character was Juliet , and luckily for her , it is settled that Mr. Keppel is not to be the Romeo . " Mr. Keppel has been dismissed , poor man ! I 'm sorry for him ; my father is to play Romeo with me , I 'm sorrier still for that . " And again , - " After breakfast went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly laid on the shelf ; I 'm sorry for him ! What a funny passion he had , by the bye , for going down upon his knees . In Fazio , at the end of the judgment scene , when I was upon mine , down he went upon his , making the most absurd , devout looking vis-a-vis , I ever beheld ; in the last scene , too , when he ought to have been going off to execution , down he went again upon his knees , and no power on earth could get him up again , for Lord knows how long . Poor fellow , he bothered me a good deal , yet I 'm sincerely sorry for him . " On a subsequent occasion , however , Mr. K. appears as Jaffier to her Belvidere . In this new trial he acquits himself still less to her satisfaction than before . " After breakfast , went to rehearsal . Venice Preserved , with Mr. Keppel , who did not appear to me to know the words even , and seemed perfectly bewildered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mercy on me ! what will he do tonight ? ' thought I. Came home and got things ready for the theatre . Received a visit from poor Mr.- , who has got the lumbago , as Sir Peter would say , on purpose , ' I believe , to prevent my riding out to-morrow . Dined at three : after dinner , played and sang through Cinderella , wrote journal ; at six went to the theatre . My gown was horribly ill-plaited , and I looked like a blue-bag . The house was very full , and they received Mr. K- with acclamations and shouts of applause . When I went on , I was all but tumbling down at the sight of my Jaffier , who looked like the apothecary in Romeo and Juliet , with the addition of some devilish red slashes along his thighs and arms . The first scene passed well and so ; but oh , the next , and the next , and the next to that . Whenever he was not glued to my side , ( and that was seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did nothing but seize my hand , and grapple to it so hard , that unless I knocked him down , ( which I felt much inclined to try , ) I could not disengage myself . In the senate scene , when I was entreating for mercy , and struggling , as Otway has it , for my life , he was prancing round the stage in every direction , flourishing his dagger in the air ; I wish to Heaven I had got up and run away , it // would have been but natural , and have served him extremely right . In the parting scene , - oh , what a scene it was ! - instead of going away from me when he said , farewell forever , ' he stuck to my skirts , though in the same breath that I adjured him in the words of my part not to leave me , I added , aside , Get away from me , oh do ! ' When I exclaimed , Not one kiss at parting ? ' he kept embracing and kissing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing him , and calling after him , Leave thy dagger with me , ' he hung himself up against the wing , and remained dangling there for five minutes . I was half crazy , and the good people sat and swallowed it all ; they deserved it , by my troth , they did . I prompted him constantly , and once , after struggling in vain to free myself from him , was obliged in the middle of my part to exclaim , You hurt me dreadfully , Mr. Keppel ! ' He clung to me , cramped me , crumpled me , - dreadful ! I never experienced anything like this before , and made up my mind that I never would again . I played of course like a wretch , finished my part as well as I could , and as soon as the play was over , went to my father and Mr. Simpson , and declared to them both , my determination not to go upon the stage again , with that gentleman for a hero . Three trials are as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come what come may , I will not be subjected to that sort of experiment again . " After Mr. Keppel , the musquitoes and other insects seem to have given her more annoyance than any thing else which she met with at New York . In the agony of her distress she appeals to them in the following pathetic apostrophe , which , if they have as much sensibility to eloquence as the fishes had in the time of St. Antony , must have saved her all farther trouble . " Oh bugs , fleas , flies , ants , and musquitoes , great is the misery you inflict upon me ! I sit slapping my own face all day , and lie thumping my pillow all night ; t is a perfect nuisance to be devoured of creatures before one 's in the ground ; it is n't fair . " The inipression made upon the mind of Mrs. Butler by the natural scenery of New York and elsewhere , seems , as our readers will have seen , to have made an agreeable impression upon her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception , both in public and private . " Nothing , " she says , " can exceed the kindness and attention which has encountered us every where since we have been in this country . I am sure I am bound to remember America and Americans thankfully , for whatever I may think of their ways , manners , // or peculiarities , to me they have shewn unmingled good will , and cordial real kindness . " And again , in her notes at Boston . " But for the climate I should like to live in Boston very much , my stay here has been delightful . It is in itself a lovely place , and- The country round it is charming . The people are intellectuab and have been abundantly kind and good-natured to me . " Notwithstanding the favorable prejudice that would naturally have been created in her mind by a reception of this sort , her views of the state of society in the principal cities are not very flattering . They are given from time to time in the text with a flippancy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she elsewhere insists at some length , the professional artist owes no gratitude to his employers or to the public , for their patronage , - a doctrine in itself somewhat questionable , - it can hardly be denied , and is , indeed , expressly admitted by the fair journalist , that she is " bound to be thankful " for a personal reception of the kind here described . If the attention she received did not prevent her from noticing what she thought censurable in the manners and institutions of the country , it should most certainly have induced her to abstain from sarcastic and splenetic allusions , not merely to the state of society in general , but to the very persons to whose kindness she is indebted . The substance of her views of the state of society in the principal cities , is given in a condensed form in the following passage , which appears as a note , and was probably written while the work was passing through the press . We may remark here , that this and the other notes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judgment and sobriety of taste than the text , and give a favorable idea of what may be expected from the influence of years and experience upon the mind of the writer . " When we arrived in America , we brought letters of introduction to several persons in New York ; many were civil enough to call upon us , we were invited out to sundry parties , and were introduced into what is there called the first society . I do not wish to enter into any description of it , but will only say , that I was most agreeably astonished , ; and had it been my fate to have passed through the country as rapidly as most travellers do , I should have carried away a very unfavorable impression of the best society of New York . Fortunately , however , for me , my visits were repeated and my stay prolonged ; and in the course of // time , I became acquainted with many individuals whose manners and acquirements were of a high order , and from whose intercourse I derived the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit me , and I still could not imagine how it happened that I never met them at the parties to which I was invited , and in the circles where I visited . I soon discovered that they formed a society among themselves , where all those qualities which I had looked for among the self-styled best , were to be found . When I name Miss Sedgwick , Halleck , Irving , Bryant , Paulding , and some of less fame , but whose acquirements rendered their companionship delightful indeed , amongst whom I felt proud and happy to find several of my own name ; it will no longer appear singular that they should feel too well satisfied with the resources of their own society , either to mingle in that of the vulgar fashionables , or seek with avidity the acquaintance of every stranger that arrives in New York . It is not to be wondered at , that foreigners have spoken as they have , of what is termed fashionable society here , or have condemned , with unqualified censure , the manners and tone prevailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regards what they see ; nor perhaps would they be much inclined to moderate them , when they found that persons possessing every quality that can render intercourse between rational creatures desirable , were held in light esteem , and neglected , as either bores , blues , or dowdies , by those so infinitely their inferiors in every worthy accomplishment . The same separation , or if anything , a still stronger one , subsists in Philadelphia , between the self-styled fashionables , and the really good society . rhe distinction there , is really of a nature perfectly ludicrous ; a friend of mine was describing to me a family whose manners were unexceptionable , and whose mental accomplishments were of a high order ; upon my expressing some surprise that I had never met with them , my informant replied , Oh , no , they are not received by the Chestnut-street set . ' If I were called upon to define that society in New York and Philadelphia , which ranks ( by right of self-arrogation , ) as first and best , I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indispensable to keep its members awake ; and where their brains and tongues seem , by common consent , to feel that they had much better give up the care of mutual entertainment to the feet of the parties assembled , and they judge well . Now , I beg leave clearly to be understood ; there is another , and a far more desirable circle ; but it is not the one into which strangers find their way generally . To an Englishman , this fashionable society presents , indeed , a pitiful sample of lofty pretensions without adequate foundation . Here is a constant endeavor to imitate those states of European society , which have for their basis the feudal spirit of the early ages ; and // which are rendered venerable by their rank , powerful by their wealth , and refined , and in some degree respectable , by great and general mental cultivation . Of Boston , I have not spoken . The society there is of an infinitely superior order . A very general degree of information , and a much greater simplicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hereafter . " Another of the notes contains the following remarks on the manners of the female part of society . " The manners of the young girls of America appear singularly free to foreigners , and until they become better acquainted with the causes which produce so unrestrained a deportment , they are liable to take disadvantageous and mistaken impressions with regard to them . The term which I should say applied best to the tone and carriage of American girls from ten to eighteen , is hoy .. denish ; laughing , giggling , romping , flirting , screaming at the top of their voices , running in and out of shops , and spending a very considerable portion of their time in lounging about in the streets . In Philadelphia and Boston , almost all the young ladies attend classes or day schools , and in the latter place , I never went out , morning , noon , or evening , that I did not meet , in some of the streets round the Tremont House , a whole bevy of young school girls , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretext of going to , or returning from school , appeared to me to be always laughing , and talking , and running about in the public thoroughfares ; a system of education which we should think by no means desirable . The entire liberty which the majority of young ladies are allowed to assume , at an age when in England they would be under strict nursery discipline , appears very extraordinary ; they not only walk alone in the streets , but go out into society , where they take a determined and leading part , without either mother , aunt , or chaperon of any sort ; custom , which renders such an appendage necessary with us , entirely dispenses with it here ; and though the reason of this is obvious enough in the narrow circles of these small towns , where every body knows every body , the manners of the young ladies do not derive any additional charm from the perfect self-possession which they thus acquire . Shyness appears to me to be a quality utterly unknown to either man , woman , or child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , and the boys , from being absolutely thrown into the world , and made men of business before they are sixteen , are alike deficient in anything like diffidence ; and I really have been all but disconcerted at the perfect assurance with which I have been addressed , upon any and every subject , by little men and women just half way through their teens . That very common character among us , a shy man , is not to be met with in these latitudes . An // rjuly , American conversing on board one of their steamboats is immediately surrounded , particularly if his conversation , though strictly directed to one individual , is of a political nature ; in an instant a ring of spectators is formed round him , and whereas an Englishman would become silent at the very first appearance of a listener , an American , far from seeming abashed at this " audience " continues his discourse , which thus assumes the nature of an harangue , with perfect equanimity , and feels no annoyance whatever at having unfolded his private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fifty people whom they could in no possible way concern . Speechifying is a very favorite species of exhibition with men here , by the bye , and besides being self-possessed , they are all remarkably fluent . Really eloquent men are just as rare in this country as in any other , but the " gift of the gab " appears to me more widely disseminated amongst Americans , than any other people in the world . Many things go to make good speakers of them , great acuteness , and sound common sense , sufficient general knowledge , and great knowledge of the world , an intense interest in every political measure , no matter how trivial in itself : , no sense of bashfulness , and a great readiness of expression . But to return to the manners of the young American girls : - it is Rousseau , I think , who says , " Dans un pays ou les mceurs sont pures , les filles seront faciles , et les femmes sev*res . " This applies particularly well to the carriage of the American women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manners of my own young countrywomen and his , I expressed my disapprobation of the education which led to such a result , he replied , " You forget the comparatively pure state of morals in our country , which admits of this degree of freedom in our young women , without its rendering them liable to insult or misconstruction . " This is true , and it is also most true , for I have seen repeated instances of it , that those very girls , whose manners have been most displeasing to my European ways of feeling , whom I should have pointed out as romps and flirts pre-eminent , not only make excellent wives , but from the very moment of their marriage , seem to forsake society , and devote themselves exclusively to household duties and retirement . But that I have seen and known of repeated instances of this , I could scarcely have believed it , but it is the case ; and a young American lady , speaking upon this subject , said to me , " We enjoy ourselves before marriage ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater degree of freedom , and indulge in the pleasures and dissipations of society . " She was not , I think , greatly mistaken . " The following remarks on the same subject are given in the text on the occasion of a dinner party soon after her arrival at New York . // " At five dressed , and went to the , where we were to dine . This is one of the first houses here , so I conclude that I am to consider what I see as a tolerable sample of the ways and manners of being , doing , and suffering , of the best society in New York . There were about twenty people ; the women were in a sort of French demi-toilette , with bare necks , and long sleeves , heads frizzed out after the very lastpetit courier , and thread net handkerchiefs and capes ; the whole of which , to my English eye , appeared a strange marrying of incongruities . The younger daughter of our host is beautiful ; a young and brilliant likeness of Ellen Tree ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to say a ray , but a whole focus of sun rays , a perfect blaze of light ; she was much taken up with a youth , to whom , my neighbor at dinner informed me , she was engaged . * * * * * * * The women here , like those of most warm climates , ripen very early , and decay proportionably soon . They are , generally speaking , pretty , with good complexions , and an air of freshness and brilliancy , but this I am told is very evanescent ; and whereas , in England , a woman is in the full bloom of health and beauty from twenty to five-and-thirty ; here , they scarcely reach the first period without being faded , and looking old . They marry very young , and this is another reason why age comes prematurely upon them . There was a fair young thing at dinner to-day , who did not look above seventeen , and she was a wife . As for their figures , like those of French women , they are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are , for the most part , short and slight , with remarkably pretty feet and ankles ; but there 's too much pelerine and petticoat , and de quoi ' of every sort , to guess anything more . " The same train of thought is again brought into view in the following note , which is introduced toward the close of the second volume . " I have had occasion to observe , in a former note , that foreigners travelling through this country , see only the least desirable society of the various cities they visit . There is another class of Americans , whom they rarely , if ever , become acquainted with at all . By far the most interesting , in my opinion , which the country affords . I speak of those families thickly scattered through all the states , from whose original settlers many of them are immediately descended ; who reside upon lands purchased by their grandfathers in the early days of the British Golonies ; and who , living remote from the Atlantic cities , and the more travelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which displease an // European in the societies of the towns , and possess traits of originality in their manners , minds , and mode of life , infinitely refreshing to the observer wearied of the eternal sameness which pervades the human congregations of the old world . In mixing with the commercial fashionables and exclusives of the American cities , the European is at once amused and annoyed with the assumption of a social tone and spirit at variance with the whole make of the country . He is told that he is in the best society of the place , and with perfect justice condemns this best society , as probably the worst he ever saw - a society assuming the airs of separate rank where no rank at all exists , attempting to copy the luxury and splendor of the residents of European capitals , without possessing one tithe of their wealth to excuse the extravagance , or enable them to succeed in the endeavor ; and presenting the most incongruous and displeasing mixture possible , of pretension , ignorance , affectation , and vulgarity . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are circles of a very different order ; but yet freer from all these drawbacks is the society formed by the class of people of whom I have spoken above , and whom I should designate as the gentry of this country ; using that term in the best sense in which it was once used in England . Among this large but widely scattered portion of the community , should the European traveller 's good fortune lead him , he will find hospitality without ostentation , purity of morals , independent of the dread of opinion , intellectual cultivation , unmixed with the desire of display , great simplicity of life and ignorance of the world , originality of mind naturally arising from independence and solitude , and the best because the most natural manners . Of such I know , from the lower shores of the Chesapeake , to the half savage territory around Michilimakinack . " The description of the state of society in the principal cities of the country , given in these passages , is founded , we think , in a great and very singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , no right to take exception to any of the remarks . In these and all the other parts of the work , where the subject is touched upon , the state of society here is uniformly spoken of in favorable and even flattering terms , and is considered as forming a sort of exception to that which exists in other parts of the country . We do not , however , feel ourselves at liberty to accept this distinction in favor of our own metropolis . The state of society here , though perhaps a little influenced by the neighborhood of an ancient and well-endowed university , is substantially the same as in the other principal cities ; nor is there , as we conceive , the least foundation // in any of them , for the suggestion , that the circles commonly regarded as the first , hold in light esteem and even exclude from their acquaintance , the members of other more cultivated and intellectual circles . The incorrectness of this remark is clearly shewn by the attempt at specification in regard to New York , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Sedgwick , Halleck , Irving , Bryant , Paulding , and some of less fame , but whose acquiremeuts rendered their companionship delightful indeed , " are not recognized as belonging to the first circles , and are condemned to figure in a secondary sphere . It is quite possible that these distinguished persons may not be so constant in their attendance at the fashionable assemblies , as the mere butterflies of the gay world ; but we apprehend that any one , who should intimate , in conversation , that the Sedgwicks or the Irvings , - and the case is substantially the same with the rest , - occupied any other than the highest places in the estimation of their fellow-citizens of all circles and classes , would be answered merely by a shrug of the shoulders . It is generally known that the large family connexions which are now illustrated by the well-earned literary glory of these charming writers , have long possessed every other advantage of social position in the wealth , political standing , and acknowledged intellectual and nioral elevation of their members . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives of the United States , a judge of the highest court of Massachusetts , and by general consent one of the first men in the country . His family is among the most considerable and most considered in the western counties of this commonwealth . A brother of Mr. Irving is at present a highly respected judge , in the city of New York . But we need not enlarge on these details , as the statement has not even the appearance of plausibility . The truth is , that the fact most strongly characteristic of the state of society in all our principal cities , as compared with those of Europe , is precisely the absence of this distinction between the fashionable and the intellectual circles , which our author is pleased to represent as particularly marked in this country . in the capitals of England , and of most of the other kingdoms of Europe , such a distinction really exists . The hereditary privileged orders , including the reigning families , constitute a separate class , occupying by general acknowledgment the highest von . XLI. - NO. 88. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms with any other . The prominent members of the various professions , who have acquired wealth or competency by the successful exercise of their respective callings , and are able to surround themselves with the elegancies of life , form , in all these cities , another class much superior to the court circle in every intellectual and moral quality , hut confessedly below it in rank . The line of separation between these two classes is drawn in the most rigid manner , and is nearly as impassable as that between the two colors in this country . In half the novels that have been written , as those of our readers who are familiar with this branch of learning are well aware , the distress is created by building up between the lovers the ideal but impenetrable and impassable wall of separation , resulting from a difference of rank , which is commonly removed at the end of the fourth volume , not by sacrificing the prejudice to good sense and good feeling , but by proving , in some extraordinary way , that the hero is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been changed in her cradle . The right to be presented at court , determines that of being admitted into the aristocratic circle ; and it is a standing rule at most of the courts , that no merchant , no member of the learned professions , as such , and in general no person exercising any useful or profitable calling , can pretend to the honor of a personal introduction to the sovereign . This is a distinction reserved for professed idlers ; and so entirely has habit inverted the natural course of feeling on the subject , that these drones not only exclude all the industrious portion of the community from their society , but affect to look down upon them with contempt . In France , the privileged order invented and applied to the body of the nation an epithet of rather obscure etymology , but in practice significant of utter ignominy and disgrace . Every person not belonging to the three or four hundred families of the nobility , was called a Roturier . Now and then a young man of aristocratic origin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of a wealthy banker or a farmer general , and he was then said , in the polite dialect of the court , to enrich his lands by a draught upon the dung-/till of the commonalty , - Ic fumier de la rdture . The English language , thanks to the manly virtues of our puritan forefathers , has no term of reproach corresponding to the French rot urier . In England , a commoner was always an honorable title ; hut // even in England , the line of distinction between the privileged and the professional circles is strictly drawn . In this country no such distinction exists , and this is the great and only real difference between the state of society here and in Europe . With us , in the absence of any hereditary privileged class , the prominent members of the various professions , mercantile , mechanical and literary , - for they all stand in public opinion , for this purpose , precisely on a footing , - take their places naturally and without controversy in the front rank , and compose the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus constituted , undertake to exclude any other persons , and especially the more enlightened and intellectual members of society , as unfit to keep company with them , is really too absurd , and we can not but wonder that Mrs. Butler should have been led , by any accidental error of observation , to make a representation so entirely gratuitous . It is well known , that individuals of any pretensions to intellectual distinction , and who sustain , at the same time , a respectable moral reputation , whether natives or foreigners , are more valued and noticed in this than they are in any other country . Mrs. Butler , herself , affords a striking example of the correctness of this remark , in its application to foreigners ; and the persons whom she has mentioned as the victims of invidious distinction at New York , are , as we have said before , precisely those whom we should have cited ourselves as the petted favorites of the public of all classes and circles . Our fair censor has , therefore , described as a leading feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise distinction of which the absence constitutes the great and only real difference between our social constitution and that of Europe . It is also remarkable , as a proof how little she has matured her opinions on the subject , that while she condemns , in strong terms , this distinction , as she incorrectly represents it to exist here , she looks back to it as it really does exist in Europe , with a sort of longing regret ; and , what is even more curious , she seems to suppose that every body she sees here , is infected with the same feeling . " A republic is a natural anomaly . " What the world may be fit for six hundred years hence , she can not exactly say : but in the mean time , " it is my conviction that America will be a monarchy before I am a skeleton . " At an interview with the Recorder of New York , and some other gentlemen , she had opportunity of perceiving how // thorough a chimera the equality is , that we talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aristocracy and their democracy , and if nothing else bore testimony to the inherent love of higher things , which , I believe , exists in every human creature , the way in which the lawyer dwelt upon the Duke of Montrose , to whom , in Scotch kindred , he is allied at the distance of some miles , and Lady Loughborough , whom , heaven knows how he got hold of , would have satisfied me that my Lord or my Lady are just as precious in the eyes of these 1evellers , as in those of Lord and Lady-loving John Bull himself . " All this is pleasant enough , and it would be curious , if there were room , to examine the nature of these higher things , of which Mrs. Butler , and , in her opinion , every body else , is naturally so much enamored . Take , for instance , the Duke of Montrose . The real higher thing called a duke , is a general , - dux , - a leader of armies . These are things that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wanted , as our author 's countrymen know to their cost . Our Washingtons , Lincolns , Greenes , Lees , and Jacksons , were , or are , all real dukes . But what is the Duke of Montrose ? A person who is called , by courtesy , duke or general , because one of his ancestors was a general some centuries ago . Now , supposing even that this kind of misnomer may , for certain purposes , have its use , we can not think that there can be , in human nature , any " inherent love " for an object so entirely artificial ; or that mere names , thus falsely applied , can be described with propriety as the higher things that naturally excite the enthusiasm of the generous and aspiring mind , if the son of Sir Walter Scott were called , by courtesy , the Author of Waverley , should we have a better chance for the further continuation of the Waverley novels , than we have now ? The high things , connected with that appellation , were the novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the course of nature , came to an end , the day of high things was over , and that of small things commenced , and it would make no difference to the lover of high things whether some person were complimented , by courtesy , with a title indicating the power of producing these works , or not . The case is the same with political and military distinctions . If titular dukes should continue to exist in England half a century longer , which may be looked upon as somewhat doubtful , the next generation will have its // Duke of Wellington , like the present ; but the high thing now represented by this title , will be gone , and the one which takes its place will resemble it about as much as one of the gilt paper crowns , worn by " my father , " upon the stage , resembles the real symbol of royalty . Why Mrs. Butler should feel so much enthusiasm about this composition jewelry of conventional rank and titles , we do not exactly see . Perhaps it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy between her late profession and the existence of a titled nobility , which is , in fact , from first to last , a sort of theatrical representation . N ' ai-je pas bienjou6 mon role ? was a que*tion put by the Empress Catharine of Russia , to the French ambassador S*gur . More probably , however , the feeling of our author is the common illusion , by the effect of which things unknown pass for magnificent . As an actress , she had no access on equal and familiar terms to the aristocratic circles of her country ; hut in consequence of the distinction of her family in their profession , and their private respectability , was occasionally permitted to come and contemplate , at a respectful distance , the splendor with which the nobility are surrounded . This is precisely the view of high life which is best fitted to make a favorable impression upon a susceptible observer ; and when , with this wholly ideal impression of the state of society in Europe fresh in her mind , Mrs. Butler came to this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed , to find that the ordinary sayings and doings of our working-day world did not quite realize all the glorious dreams of her poetical and theatrical imagination . Hence a constant longing for the brilliant vanities of European rank and fashion ; and hence her belief , already alluded to , that America will be a monarchy before she is a skeleton . " Thy wish was father , Fanny , to that thought . " From the present aspect of the times , the probability is certainly much greater that before that period , as yet , we trust , a far distant one , shall arrive , the parent country will have put on the simple and manly guise of a republic . Mrs. Butler 's remarks upon the manners and condition of the female part of society , are rather more conformable to facts , than her observations on the distinctions of rank to which we have now alluded . It is no doubt true , as is stated in the above extracts , that young ladies , in this country , between the // time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , enjoy more liberty , and mix more freely in society , than they do after they have taken upon themselves the responsibility and care of a family . There is , however , less difference , in this respect , hetween the state of society here and elsewhere , than Mrs. Butler and some other late writers , who have made remarks of nearly the same kind , appear to suppose . It is the order of nature , every where , that a married lady should assume the management of the domestic concerns of her family ; and the entire devotion of every thought , faculty and feeling , to the performance of this duty , which is generally exhibited by the mothers of America , is one of the finest and most honorable features in the national character . The distinction , however , as we have said , is not between the usages of this country and of Europe , but between the usages of society in general throughout the civilized world , and that of the privileged classes of Europe , who seem to occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather conservative journalist . The mode of life of these classes is in every particular , and in this , among the rest , entirely unnatural and conventional . The daughters of the royal and aristocratic families of Europe are not perinitted to mix freely in society before their marriage , because it is feared that they may form attachments ; and their alliances are matters of too much political importance , to be trusted to the impulse of mere unsophisticated youthful feeling . They are secluded in the nursery , or perhaps in convents , until after the parents have agreed upon the connexion which they are to form , and they are supposed to marry not from inclination or affection , but for the mutual convenience of the families . They now enter the world , but the troops of attendants by which they are surrounded , exempt them , in a great measure , from any personal responsibility for the care of their household while the habits of the circles in which they move , and the circumstances under which their domestic relations have been formed , naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to devote almost their whole time to the pursuit of pleasure . Their life is a continual round of amusements . Riding and visiting occupy the day : the opera and the asseinbly fill up the night , through the winter . An excursion int . the country , to the watering-places , to the continent , or in these later days of steamboats and railroads , to Greece , // Egypt , or India , furnishes diversion for the summer . The young men of the same class , relieved in like manner by the possession of hereditary fortunes , or of places in the various departments of the public service , from all care for their subsistence , are left at full liberty to join in these pursuits . In a class of society , of which idleness is the badge and boast ,  --  . which considers all useful and profitable labor as a derogation , - the state of morals may easily be imagined . The excitements of gallantry and gambling are the usual resources against the overwhelming ennui of a life of total inaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of things , that the younger married ladies occupy a commanding station in society ; but they purchase their influence at a very high price . rVhis state of things is , however , as entirely foreign to the manners of the great mass of the population of Europe , as it is , and we trust ever will be , to those of the whole population of this country . In the circles composed of the prominent members of the various professions which form the middle classes of society in Europe , the married and unmarried ladies occupy respectively the same positions as in this country . The former are devoted to the cares and duties of their peculiar relations as wives and mothers , and without renouncing entirely what is sometimes called the " gay world , " pass their time and place their happiness chiefly in the sanctuary of domestic life . The latter , having more leisure , and less oppressive cares and duties , indulge themselves more freely in the innocent amusements that suit their age . This is precisely the case with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of nature is not violated by artificial institutions . The introduction in this , or any other country , of a privileged order , monopolizing , by hereditary right , a large proportion of the wealth and power of the community , and holding all useful labor a disgrace and a derogation , would give at once to the younger married ladies of that class , not merely the ascendency in their own social circles , hut the virtual control of the whole machinery of the govermnent . Such was the state of things in France , - under the old regime , the great example of this form of social life , - through the whole century preceding the revolution , and the disgust felt by the people at the undisguised and unblushing corruption which attended it , was one of the chief causes which produced that political convulsion . Whether Mrs. Butler and the other wri // ters to whom we have alluded , contemplate a reform of this kind in its full extent , we do not pretend to know ; but it is in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we think we may add , that the people of the United States are not yet prepared for such a change in the forms of private or political life . After playing some time at New York , our author proceeded to Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington . She afterwards visited Boston , and returning thence to New York , made an excursion into the interior of that state , in the midst of which the journal terminates , rather abruptly , with her arrival at Niagara . We shall not undertake to follow her in detail through the long course of her excursions , which were diversified with the usual number of hair-breadth scapes , and moving accidents by flood and field . As a specimen at once , of the activity displayed by the fair journalist in encountering these adventures , and the spirit with which she knows how to describe them , we give the following extract . The scene is at the residence of her namesake and kinsman , near West Point . " I was not inclined to rest , and Mr. - having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the house , he and his brother , and I , set forth thither . We passed through the ironworks : t was Sunday , and everything except a bright water-course , laughing and singing as it ran , was still . They took me over the works , showed me the iron frames of large mill wheels , the machinery and process of boring the cannon , the model of an iron forcing-pump , the casting-houses , and all the wonders of their manufactory . All mechanical science is very interesting to me , when I have an opportunity of seeing the detail of it , and comprehending , by illustrations presented to my eyes , the technical terms used by those conversing with me . We left these dark abodes , and their smouldering fires , and strange , powerful-looking instruments , and taking a path at the foot of the mountains , skirted the marsh for some time , and then struck into the woods , ascending a tremendous stony path , at the top of which we threw ourselves down to pant , and looked below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , on the river , and rocks , and mountains , bright with the noon-day splendor of the unclouded sky . After resting here a few moments , we arose and climbed again , through the woods , across a sweet clover field , to the brow of the hill , where stands the highland school , - a cheerful-looking cottage , with the mountain tops all round , the blessed sky above , and the downward sloping woods and lake-like river below . Passing // through the ground surrounding it , we joined a road skirting a deep ravine , from the bottom of which the waters called to rue . I was wild to go down , but my companions would not let me . It was in vain that I strained over the brink , the trees were so thickly woven together , and the hollow so deep , that I could see nothing but dark boughs , except every now and then , as the wind stirred them , the white glimmer of the leaping foam , as it sprang away with a shout that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to decline , and presently a silver thread of gushing water ran like a frightened child across our way , and flung itself down into the glen . At length we reached the brown , golden-looking stream . Mr. - was exhorting us to take an upper path , which he said would bring us to the foot of the fall ; but I was not to be seduced away from the side of the rivulet , and insisted upon crossing it then and there , through the water , over moss-capped stones , across fallen trees , which , struck by the lightning , or undermined by the cold-kissing waters , had choked up the brook with their leafy bridges . So , striving on , as best we might , after wading through the stream two or three times , we reached the end and aim of our journey , the waterfall . We stood on the brink of a pool , about forty feet across , and varying in depth from three to seven or eight feet : it was perfectly circular , and except on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glen , - closed round with a wall of rock about thirty feet high , in whose crevices trees , with their rifted roots , hung fearlessly , clothing the grey stone with a soft curtain of vivid green . Immediately opposite the brook , and at the north of the pool , the water came tumbling over this rocky wall in three distinct streams , which , striking the projecting ledges of iron-looking stone , at different angles , met within eight or ten feet of the pool , and fell in a mingled sheet of foam . The water broke over the rocks like a shower of splintered light ,  --  the spray sprang up in the sunlight ) and fell again all glittering into the dark basin below , that gleamed like a magic jewel set in the mossy earth . On the edge of the rocks , beside the waterfall , a tree stood out among its greenly-mantled fellows , bare , broken , and scathed to the very roots with lightning . Its upper half had fallen aslant one branch of the waterfall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half falling down its course , half stayed by some rocky ledges on which it rested . As I gazed up in perfect ecstacy , an uncontrollable desire seized me to clamber up the rocks by the side of the fall , and so reach the top of it . My companions laughed incredulously as I expressed my determination to do so , but followed where I led , until they became well assured that I was in earnest . Remonstrance and representation of impossibility having been tried in vain , Mr. - prepared to guide me , and // Mr.- , with my bag , parasol , and bonnet in charge , returned to the edge of the pool to watch our progress . Away we went over the ledges of the rocks , with nothing but damp leaves , and slippery roots of trees for footing . At one moment the slight covering of mould on which I had placed my foot , crumbled from beneath it , and I swung over the water by a young sapling , which upheld me well , and by which I recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the waterfall , and my guide began ascending the slippery , slanting rocks down which it fell . I followed : in an instant I was soaked through with the spray , - my feet slipped , - I had no hold ; he was up above me , - the pool far below . With my head bowed against the foam and water , I was feeling where next to tread , when a bit of rock , that my companion had thought firm , broke beneath his foot , and came falling down beside me into the stream . I paused , for I was frightened . I looked up for a moment , but was blinded by the water , and could not see where my guide was ; I looked down the slanting ledge we had climbed , over which the white water was churning angrily . Shall I come down again ? ' I cried to Mr. - , who was anxiously looking up at our perilous path . Give me your hand ! ' shouted his brother above me . I lifted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not go on , -J do not know what to do . ' Give me your hand ! ' he exclaimed again ; and I , planting one foot upon a ledge of rock so high as to lift me off the other , held up my arm to him ; but my limbs were so strained from his height above me , that I had no power to spring or move , either up or down . However , I felt my presence of mind going ; I knew that to go down was impossible , except headlong , - the ascent must therefore be persevered in . Are you steady , quite , quite steady ? ' I inquired : he replied , Yes ; ' and holding out his hand , I locked mine in it , and bade him draw me up . But he had not calculated upon my weight , - my slight appearance had deceived him , and as I bore upon his arm , we both of us slipped -I turned as sick as death , but only cried out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' which I was , upon a rocky rim about three inches wide , with my arm resting on the falling stump of the blasted tree . He did re* cover his balance , and again holding out his hand , drew me up beside where he was sitting , on the edge of the rocks , in the water . We pledged each other in the clear stream , and standing on the top of our hardly gained eminence , in the midst of the rushing brook , I wrang my handkerchief triumphantly at Mr. - ; which was rather a comical consideration , as I was literally dripping from head to foot , - no Naiad ever looked so thoroughly watery , or could have taken more delight in a ducking . As soon as he // saw us safe , he scrambled up through the woods to the road , and we doing the same , we presently all met on the dusty highway , where xve congratulated each other on our perseverance and success , and laughed very exceedingly at my soaked situation . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we extract the following reflections on the natural disposition of the sex for devotional feelings . " There are many reasons why women are more religious than men . Our minds are not generally naturally analytical , - our educations tend to render them still less so : t is seldom in a woman 's desire , ( because seldom in her capacity , ) to investigate the abstract bearings of any metaphysical subject . Our imaginations are exceedingly sensitive , our subservience to early impressions , and exterior forms , proportionate ; and our habits of thought , little enlarged by experience , observation , or proper culture , ren der us utterly incapable of almost any logical train of reasonings . With us , I think therefore , faith is the only secure hold ; for dis . belief acting upon mental constructions so faulty and weak , would probably engender insanity , or a thousand species of vague , wild , and mischievous enthusiasms . I believe too , that women are more religious than men , because they have warmer and deeper affections . There is nothing surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for loving which exists in every woman 's nature . Even when her situation in life is such as to call forth and constantly keep in exercise the best affections of her heart , as a wife , and a mother , it still seems to me as if more would be wanting to fill the measure of yearning tenderness , which , like an eternal fountain , gushes up in every woman 's heart ; therefore I think it is that we turn , in the plenitude of our affections , to that belief which is a religion of love , and where the broadest channel is open to receive the devotedaess , the clinging , the confiding trustfulness , which are idolatry when spent upon creatures like ourselves , but become a holy worship when offered to heaven . Nor is it only from the abundance and overflowing of our affections that we are devout ; t is not only from our capacity of loving , but also from our capacity of suffering that our piety springs . Woman 's physical existence , compared with that of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessity for patience , a seeking after strength , a holding forth of the hands for support ; thus , the fragile frame , the loving heart , and the ionorant mind , are in us sources of religious faith . But it often 1'appens that those affections , so strong , so deep , so making up the sum and substance of female existence , instead of being happily employed , as I have supposed above , are converted into // springs of acute suffering . These wells of feeling hidden in the soul , upon whose surface the slightest smile of affection falls like sunlight , but whose very depths are stirred by the breath of unkindness , are too often unvisited by the kindly influence of kindred sympathies , and go wearing their own channels deeper , in silence and in secresy , and in infinite bitterness , - undermining health , happiness , the joy of life , and making existence one succession of burden-bearing days , and toilsome , aching , heavy hours . It is in this species of blight , which falls upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a consolation , more especially that merciful and compassionate faith whose words are , Come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . ' To that rest betakes itself the wearied spirit , the wounded heart ; and it becomes a blessing beyond all other blessings ; a source of patience , of fortitude , of hope , of strength , of endurance ; a shelter in the scorching land , - a spring of water in the wilderness. ** The remarks of Mrs. Butler upon the political institutions of the country , are , as we have said , among the feeblest parts of the book ; but we deem it unnecessary to undertake to refute them in detail . They are little more than a repetition of observations made by former travellers , which , as far as they require attention , have been repeatedly noticed and reduced to their proper value . As a specimen , however , of the style and tone of the political part of the work , we copy the following short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purpose ; universal suffrage is a political fallacy : and will be one of the stumbling-blocks in the path of this country 's greatness . I do not mean that it will lessen her wealth , or injure her commercial and financial resources ; but it will be an insuperable bar to the progress of mental and intellectual cultivation , - t is a plain case of action and reaction . If the mass , i. e. , the inferior portion , ( for when was the mass not inferior ? ) elect their own governors , they will , of course , elect an inferior class of governors , and the government of such men will be an inferior government ; that it may be just , honest , and rational , I do not dispute ; but that it ever will be enlarged , liberal , and highly enlightened , I do not , and can not believe . " Whether universal suffrage be , or be not , in the abstract , a correct principle , is a point which we need not examine . In every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , are those under which the people have grown // up from youth to maturity , and to which their feelings and habits are accommodated . This is the ground upon which the usage of universal suffrage rests in the United States , and were it even attended by the inconveniences supposed by our author , it must still continue to exist . It is the birthright of the nation , and nothing but a violent revolution can ever deprive them of it . We can not say , however , that we think the reasoning of Mrs. Butler against it , very conclusive . " If the mass elect their own governors , they will , of course , elect an inferior class of governors , and the government of such men will be an inferior government . " This conclusion , though given in a somewhat oracular tone , is far from according with the experience of this or of other periods . If " industrious little me " can find time to look into the history of Rome , she will ascertain that when the plebeians had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the consuls at discretion , they always elected him from among the patricians . And to come nearer home , if the presidents and governors of the United States , from the beginning of our history to the present time , - if the political men of all parties , who are at this moment rendered prominent by the principle of universal suffrage , - the Clays , the Websters , the Caihouns , the Forsyths , the Van Burens , and others , - if these " belong to an inferior class , " we should be glad to know to what class we are to look for their betters , either in moral or intellectual qualities . The most acute and profound speculative politicians , - Montesquieu , for example , the master of the science , - while they deny the capacity of the people to administer the government in person on the principle of pure democracy , acknowledge , in the fullest manner , their capacity to elect their rulers , and refer , in proof of the principle , to the examples we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all . Were it even admitted , that the principle of universal suffrage does not , in all cases , bring out the best men , before you make a change , the important question arises , what are you to substitute for it ? The rulers elected on this principle , are , according to Mrs. Butler , an inferior class ; but to whom are they inferior ? Are they inferior to the hereditary rulers of the old world ? Are the Washingtons , the Adamses , the Jeffersons , the Jacksons , of this country , inferior to the Georges , the Lewises , the Ferdinands , and the Frederics , of Europe ? Are the Websters and Whites of the American senate , inferior to the great hereditary peers of Eng // land , - the Norfolks , for example , or the Northumberlands ? This will not even he pretended . If the elective principle brings out an " inferior class of men , " the hereditary principle brings out a still lower one , - " In the lowest deep a lower depth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? If the statesmen whom we now employ are inferior men , they are inferior not to those who are placed in power in other countries , by the opposite hereditary principle , but to the " illustrious obscure " of some hitherto unexplored stratum of society . By what process , then , are we to arrive at these political phwfixes ? Shall we limit the right of suffrage ? This plan , too , has been always practised among us in connexion with that of universal suffrage , and it does not appear from any experience we have yet had , that the results of the two are materially different . In Massachusetts the right of suffrage is nearly universal ; in Virginia it is limited to freeholders . These have always been , intellectually , the leading , as they are the oldest states in the union , and have both been remarkable for putting forward their ablest and best men in political employments . Thus the two states , whose forms of election differ most widely , are precisely those in which the results have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the state where the right of suffrage is limited , has always been considered the great champion of democracy ; while Massachusetts , with her system of universal suffrage , has been always accused , whether justly or not , of an aristocratic tendency . We are compelled to say , therefore , if Mrs. Butler will excuse us for differing from her , that she is , in our opinion , wrong , upon this point , both in her facts and in her principles . The men who are brought into public life in this country , by the operation of our system of election , far from belonging to an inferior class , are , in general , the prominent persons in their respective parties ; and such , from the nature of the case , they must be , under any form of election . Whatever , in fact , may be the nature of the government , the men who really exercise political influence , are , substantially , self-appointed . The irresistible vocation of talent and character , - in other words , the decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human power can prevent them from accomplishing their destiny . In // barbarous countries , where military skill and talent are the only means of influence , they employ the sword ; in civilized countries , the press arid the tribune . If the persons or parties in possession of power , recognize their claims , they take their places naturally in the social order , and operate through the regular channels ; if their claims are resisted , they create a personal influence around them , which , in arbitrary governments , changes the ruler , and in free countries , the majority . The different forms of election are only different modes in which the voice of the 1 ) eople declares their election to the places of trust arid power . Universal suffrage points them out as distinctly as any other system ; in arbitrary governments the hereditary ruler is compelled , at his risk and peril , to put them where they ought to be . What form of election in England would have failed to place Pitt and Fox at the head of their respective parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at discretion ; but the consequence was , that they soon found the Bastille and the Tuilcries tumbling about their ears , and were too happy to treat with him upon his own terms . If the men who are naturally called by their character and talents to exercise political influence , sometimes fail to do all that might be expected from them , it is not because the forms of election or administration in the countries where they reside , operate against them , but because their high endowments are combined with defects of character , which wholly , or in part , neutralize their efficiency . The different forms of election and administration are only different sorts of machinery which the men of talent use with equal facility to accomplish their objects ; if they fail to govern others , it is because they are unable to govern themselves . The real objection to universal suffrage , so far as there is any , is not that it brings out men of an inferior class , which , in fact , is not the case ; but that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some circumstances , unsafe mode of doing what might be nearly or quite as well done by a much simpler process . The whole country is kept in a state of permanent excitement , which , at one time or another , may not improbably take the form of civil war , upon the question of the presidency , when almost any simple provision , such , for example , as that the oldest member of the senate should be , ex ofticio , president , would , so far as the public service is concerned , answer the purpose just about as well as the present mode of // 144 July , election . The hereditary principle , employed in other countries , was doubtless introduced , or at least is most plausibly defended , as a simpler mode of solving the problem , who shall govern ? than popular suffrage . But , on the other hand , this and all other " simple machines , " are attended with inconveniences and dangers of other kinds , not less serious than the toil and trouble of voting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endeavors as far as he can to avoid its inconveniences , and to turn its advantages to the best account . Universal suffrage or an extension of the elective franchise , amounting substantially to the same thing , is our " Sparta ; " it is our duty and policy to do the best we can with it , and so far as the character of the persons elected to office under it is concerned , we see no reason yet to believe that we are less fortunate than contemporary communities which proceed upon different principles . But we find that we are growing serious , and must hasten to a close . " Dear good little me , " though she uses some naughty language , and is rather ultra-conservative in her notions upon government , is , upon the whole , a favorite with us , and we trust that we shall not part upon ill terms . If we have lost any portion of her good graces by disputing her political theories , we must endeavor to make up for it by praising her poetry . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and the fugitive pieces which she has since published , are very unequal . But some of them evince a real talent . Her fortunate release from the slavery of the sock and buskin , will give her ample leisure to cultivate this faculty , and enable her to supply , with excitement of a higher and nobler kind , the void that must be left in her feelings by the ab . sence of the popular applause upon which she had so long fed . Of the poetical essays in the present volume , the one entitled " Autumn " is perhaps the best . It combines the same correct , graphic , and brilliant delineation of nature , which we have seen in some passages of her journal , with a power of versification which would do credit to a practised poet . Our readers will be pleased to see it entire . " Thou comest not in sober guise , In mellow cloak of russet clad , - Thine are no melancholy skies , Nor hueless flowers , pale and sad ; But , like an Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyes , Full flush of fragrant blossoming , And glowing purple canopies . How call ye this the season 's fall , That seems the pageant of the year ? Richer and brighter far than all The pomp that spring and summer wear , Red falls the westering light of day , On rock and stream and winding shore ; Soft woody banks and granite gray , With amber clouds are curtained o'er ; The wide clear waters sleeping lie Beneath the evening 's wings of gold , And on their glassy breast the sky And banks their mingled hues unfold . Far in the tangled woods , the ground Is strewn with fallen leaves , that lie Like crimson carpets all around Beneath a crimson canopy . The sloping sun , with arrows bright , Pierces the forest 's waving maze ; The universe seems wrapt in light , A floating robe of rosy haze . Oh Autumn ! thou art here a king , - And round thy throne the smiling hours A thousand fragrant tributes bring Of golden fruits and blushing flowers . Oh ! not upon thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to thee , My home !  --  but o'er thy mountains and thy dells His footsteps fall slowly and solemnly . Nor flower nor bud reinaineth there to him , Save the faint-breathing rose , that , round the year , Its crimson buds and pale soft blossoms dim , In lowly beauty constantly doth wear . O'er yellow stubble lands in mantle brown , He wanders through the wan October light : Still as he goeth , slowly stripping down The garlands green that were the spring 's delight . At morn and eve thin silver vapors rise Around his path : but sometimes at mid-day He looks along the hills with gentle eyes , That make the sallow woods and fields seem gay . Yet something of sad sov'reignty he hath , - A sceptre crown 'd with berries ruby red , // And the cold sobbing wind bestrews his path With wither 'd leaves , that rustle neath his tread ; And round him still , in melancholy state , Sweet solemn thoughts of death and of decay , In slow and hush 'd attendance , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
