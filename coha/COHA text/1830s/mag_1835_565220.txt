txt If the duration of men 's lives is to be determined by the number and importance of their actions , not by the term of years which may pass between their birth and dissolution , then has such a man as Mr. Edward Everett arrived at the fullness of age . Before he is yet old , he has performed sufficient to distinguish a long life . When we are asked what those performances have been , we point to events which are rehearsed by his opponents in the lang , uage of reproach . We dwell with admiration on the early developement of his powers - on his great distinction as a scholar , an orator , and a man , at a period of existence when the follies of youth can scarcely he tolerated hy the wisdom of manhood , and rashness is rebuked by experience ; at a period when we are hurried away from calm thoughts into every pursuit which wears the grace of novelty - fond , alike , of everything that is new , and wandering about from one object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age , Jr . Everett , having completed an academic and clerical education , preached to one of the most enlightened congregations of a community which boasts a high order of intelligence and refinement . After a few years ' study at a German university , he returned to fill a Professor 's chair in the best endowed college in the United States ; to instruct youn* men , many of whom-if we measure life by number of years-were older than himself . Acquiring , at this time , a taste for political studies becoming , as every true patriot should , deeply interested in the affairs of government ; inspired by a laudable ambition to exercise his great talents in a hieher and wider sphere , - he surrendered his profession , and was , by the free suffrage of the people of the county in which he resided , sent to Congress . This was his first political step . Deeply versed in the theory , yet , from want of service , unacquainted with the practice of legislation , he took his seat among the representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended by the bri*htest anticipations of success , he performed , faithfully and well , the laborious duties of his station . In the splendor of his career , he may have disappointed the expectations of many , who hoped for his abilities nothing short of the attainment of the Presidential chair ; but the reasonable expectations of // 463 his friends he has never disappointed ; and when they recall the actions and works of his life , from his first election to Con*ress to his present election as Governor of Massachusetts , from the appearance of his remarkable Defence of Christianity ' to the addresses , which , with a power and rapidity almost inconceivable , he has poured forth during the present year , they feel their admiration undiminished , their anticipations realized . The readers of this Magazine may remember that , when the name of Mr. Everett was first presented to the people of this Commonwealth as a candidate for Governor , we warmly applauded the nomination and advocated his election . XVe heartily congratulate our fellow-citizens on the splendid result . All good men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere party success . It indicates nobler things than even a prevalence of honest political principles among our people . It indicates a respect for genius elevated hy learnina a superiority to the contemptible prejudices of low minds against mental cultivation a belief , that scholastic honors and literary fame are not incompatible with the faithful execution of the highest political trusts . For this indication , rather than for the triumph of the whigs , we rejoice that the voices of the people of Massachusetts , by a majority of more than twelve thousand , have spoken to the country their estimation of the integrity and talents of EDWARD EVERETT . There are other reasons why sober and thinking men should shake hands when they meet , congratulating one another on this event . It shews that there are portions of the republic still free from the rule of demagogues ; that reason and good sense still distinguishes the sons of the pilgrims that the spirit of the most contumacious and oldest rebels to the British government is still alive , stubborn and steady in a maintenance of the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be thought that we sate down to write a paper on the late election ; not so - in proceeding to notice the two addresses , whose titles are on the other page , we could not refrain from giving utterance to our feelings , with regard to the important relation in which their author now stands to the public . Before turning , however , to the addresses , we must , as conductors of a literary journal , allude to an observation of certain sapient croakers who aver , to use their own elegant expression , that Mr. Everett missed it ' by going into political life . He should , say they , have addicted himself wholly to literary pursuits , of which he would have attained the noblest rewards . By deserting the quiet shades of learning and letters , for the high-road glare and bustle of politics , he displayed a desire for temporary applause , for popular renown . Is it to be supposed , we ask of such observers , is it to be supposed that Mr. Everett would not , had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study to the labor of serving his country ? But , as there are actions above the capacity of certain men , so there are motives beyond their comprehension . Mr. Everett has constantly had the noblest ends in view in the course which he has pursued . It seems to have been his creed that the service of one 's country is no matter of preference , but an absolute duty . What writes a great author , on this head ? The service of our country is no chimerical , but a real duty . He who admits the proof of any other moral duty , drawn from the constitution of human nature , or from the moral fitness and unfitness of things , must admit them in favor of this duty , or be reduced to the most absurd inconsistency . When he has once admitted the duty on these proofs , it will be // no difficult matter to demonstrate to him , that his obligation to the performance , of it , is in proportion to the means and the opportunities he has of performing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as he has these means and these opportunities in his power , and as long as his country continues in the same want of his serviccs . These obligations , then , to the public service , may become obligations for life on certain persons . No doubt they may : and shall this consideration become a reason for denying or evading them ? On the contrary , it should become a reason for acknowledging and fulfilling them , with the greatest gratitude to the Supreme Being , who has made us capable of acting so excellent a part , and with the utmost benevolence to mankind . Superior talents and superior rank , among our fellow-creatures , whether acquired by birth or by the course of accidents , and the success of our own industry , are noble prerogatives . Shall he , who possesses them , repine at the obligations they lay him under , of passing his whole life in the noblest occupation of which human nature is capable ? To a what higher station , to what greater glory can any mortal aspire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , the support of good , the control of bad government , and the guardian of public liberty ? ' Mr. Everett 's devotion to the service of his country has been such as to make him worthy of her first distinctions . His recent election to the gubernatorial office has placed him in a station corresponding to his merits , before the eyes of the world . These addresses display the peculiar powers of their author to great advantage - the one having been pronounced before a literary association , and the other before a popular assembly , in commemoration of a political event . The orator seems to be equally at home in both ; but the Amherst address contains passages which have been rarely surpassed . Thrilling must have been its effect on an audience of bookmen . Mr. Everett 's periods are enough to make even the illiterate in love with knowledge . He touches the heart with the power of a master who draws music from a many-stringed instrument . Who , of the youthful band that listened to him on the eve of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been encouraged to go cheerfully forth on the toilsome pilgrimage before them ? His was indeed no onten pipe , like that of the classic muse , inviting to dalliance and luxurious days ; nor again was it , to use his own language , the iron trumpet at whose sound a whole people was to be aroused for some mi*hty charge : it was the sweet voice of advice and persuasion which inspired the doubting , strengthened the weak , and confirmed the strong-hearted . After Gibbon 's autobiography  --  the style of which , compared with that of his history , is like the beautiful pace of a palfrey by the side of the strong and showy tramp of the war-horse - we know nothing better calculated to excite in the mind of the desponding student new hope , to breathe into him the breath of life , to inspire him , in short , with enthusiasm for his books , than this address . Jts object is to shew that the extension of the means of education and the general diffusion of knowledge are beneficial to mankind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue - the only three things , says Mr. Everett , that deserve a name below . Though we doubt not that most of our readers have seen this Address , we camiot refrain from copying a dirge-like and touching passage , sounding in our ears , as we read it alone , like a solemn chorus of Handel , or a mournful requiem of Mozart : - . // 465 It is plain that Copernicus , like his great contemporary , Columbus , though fully conscious of the boldness and the novelty of his doctrine , saw but a part of the changes it was to effect in science . After harboring in his bosom , for long , long years , that pernicious heresy , - the solar system , - he died on the day of the appearance of his book from the press . The closing scene of his life , with a little help from the imagination , would furnish a noble subject for an artist . For thirtyfive years he has revolved and matured in his mind his system of the heavens . A natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encounter controversy , and a dread of persecution , have led him to withold his work from the press ; and to make known his system but to a few confidential disciples and friends . At length he draw* near his end ; he is seventy-three years of age , and lie yields his work on the revolutions of the heavenly orbs ' to his friends for publication . The day at last has come , on which it is to be ushered into the world . It is the twenty-fourth of May , 1543 . On that day , - the effect , no doubt , of the intense excitement of his mind , operating upon an exhausted frame , - an effusion of blood brings him to the g* tes of the grave . His last hour has come ; he lies stretched upon the couch , from which he will never rise , in his apartment at the Canonry at Franenberk , East Prussia . The beams of the setting sun glance through the gothic windows of his chamber ; near his bed-side is the armillary sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens , - his picture , painted by himself , the amusement of his earlier years , hangs before him ; beneath it , his Astrolabe and other imperfect astronomical instruments ; and around him are gathered his sorrowin* discipks . The door of the apartment opens ; the eye of the departing sage is turned to see who enters : it is a friend , who brings him the first printed copy of his immortal treatise . He knows that in that book , he contradicts all that had ever been distinctly taught by former philosophers ; he knows that he has rebelled against the sway of Ptolemy , which the scientific world had acknowledged for a thousand years ; he knows that the popular mind will be shocked by his innovations ; be knows that the attempt will be made to press even religion into the service against him  --  but he knows that his book is true . He is dying but he leaves a glorious truth , as his dying bequest to the world . He bids the friend , who has brought it , place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun 's rays may fall upon the precious volume , and he may behold it once before his eye grows dim . He looks upon it , takes it in his hands , presses it to his breast , and expires . But no , he is not wholly gone ! A smile lights up his dying countenance ; a beam of returning intelligence kindles in his eye ; his lips move and the friend , who leans ovum him , can hear bins faintly murmur the beautiful sentiments , which the Christian lyrist , of a later age , has so finely expressed in verse : Ye golden lamps of Heaven ! farewell , with all your feeble light , Farewell , thou ever-changing moon , pale empress of the night ! And thou , refulgent orb of day , in brighter flames arrayed , My soul , which springs beyond thy sphere , no more demands thy aid . Ye stars , are but the shining dust of my divine abode , The pave* sent of those heavenly courts , where I shall reign with God . So died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are acquainted with our early history , the title of the second address , under notice , will call to mind the whole narrative of the events , in comnmernoration of which it was delivered . The orator stood under an old tree , near which the bloody tragedy was acted , and spoke to the multitude , assembled under the open sky . Here is a picture of the past - a highly-wrought and poetical descrip-tion : As I stand on this hallowed spot , my mind filled with the traditions of that disastrous day , surrounded by these enduring memorials , impressed with the touching ceremonies we have just witnessed , - the affecting incidents of the bloody scene crowd upon my imagination . This compact and prosperous village disappears , and // Critical A/'otices. a few scattered log-cabins are scen , in the bosom of the primeval forest , clustering for protection around the rude block house in the centre . A cornfield or two has been rescued from the all-surrounding wilderness , and here and there the yellow husks are heard to rustle in the breeze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine-woods . Beyond , the interminable forest spreads in every direction , the covert of the wolf , of the rattlesnake , of the savage ; and between its gloomy copses , what is now a fertile and cultivated meadow , stretches out a dreary expanse of unreclaimed morass . I look and listen . All is still - solemnly , frightfully still . No voice of human activity or enjoyment breaks the dreary silence of nature , or mingles with the dirge of the woods and the watercourses . All seems peaceful and still - and yet there is a strange heaviness , in the fall of the leaves , in that wood that skirts the road ; - there is an unnatural flitting in those shadows ; - there is a plashing sound in the waters of that brook , which makes the flesh creep with horror . Hark ! it is the click of a gun-lock from that thicket ; no , it is a pebble , that has dropped from the overhanging cliff upon the rock beneath . It is , it is the gleaming blade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown off from that dancing ripple , it is , it is the red feather of a savage chief , peeping from behind that maple-tree ; no , it is a leaf , which September has touched with her many-tinted pencil . And now a distant drum is heard ; yes , that is a sound of life , conscious proud life . A single fife breaks upon the ear ; a stirring strain . It is one of the marches , to which the stern warriors of Cromwell moved over the field at Naseby and Worcester . There are no loyal ears to take offence at a puritanical march in a transatlantic forest ; and hard by , at Hadley , there is a gray-haired fugitive , who followed the cheering strain , at the head of his division in the army of the great usurper . The warlike note grows louder ; - I hear the tread of armed men but I run before my story . ' Before proceeding to the details of the catastrophe , some space is occupied by an account of the state of thiuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of the war , of which this was a prominont*occurruncC . This is exceedingly interesting . We will not detain the reader with a reference to the history of the events which follow , but prefer rather to present him with a beautiful extract , which succeeds a thrilling account of the death of king Philip . And what was the fate of Philip 's wife and son ? This is a tale for husbands and wives , for parents and children . Young men and women , you can not understand it . What was the fate of Philip 's wife and child ? She is a woman , he is a lad . They did not surely hang them . No , that would have been mercy . The boy is the grandson , the mother the daughter-in-law of good old Massasoit , the first and the best friend the En*lish ever had , in New-England . Perhaps , - perhaps , now Philip is slain and his warriors scattered to the four winds , they will allow his wife and son to go back , - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrows in their native wilderness . They were sold into slavery - West-Indian slavery - an Indian princess and her child , sold from the cool breezes of Mount Hope , from the wild freedom of a New-England forest , to gasp under the lash , beneath the blazing sun of the tropics ! Bitter as death ! ' aye , bitter as hell ! Is there anything - I do not say in the range of humanity - is there anything aninsated , that would not struggle against this ? Is there , I do not say a man , who has ever looked in the face of his sleeping child ; - a woman , that has given suck and knows How tender t is to love the babe , that milks her ; is there a dumb beast , a brute creature , a thing of earth or of air , the lowest in creation , so it be not wholly devoid of that mysterious instinct which binds the generations of beings together , that will not use the arms , which nature has given it , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where its cubs are crying for their meat ? Then think of the country for which the Indians fonght ! Who can blame them ? As Philip looked down from his seat , on Mount Hope , that glorious eminence , that - throne of royal state , which far Outshone the wealth of Ormus or of md , Or where the gorgeous east , with richest hand , Showers on her kings barbaric pomp and gold , - as he looked down on the lovely scene which spread beneath , at a summer sunset , - the distant hill-tops blazing with gold , the slanting beams streaming along the waters , the broad plains , the island groups , the majestic forest , - could he be blamed if his heart burned within him , as he beheld it all passing , by no tardy process , from beneath his control into the hands of the stranger ? As the river chieftains-the lords of the waterfalls and the mountains - ranged this lovely valley , can it be wondered at if they beheld with bitterness the forest disappearing beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw-mills ? Can we not fancy the feelings with which some strong-minded savage , the chief of the Pocomtuck Indians , who should have ascended the summit of the sugar-loaf mountain , ( rising as it does before us , at this moment , in all its loveliness and grandeur ) in company with a friendly settler , contemplating the progress already made by the white man , and marking the gigantic strides , with which he was advancing into the wilderness , should fold his arms and say , White man , there is eternal war between me and thee I quit not the land of roy fathers , but with my life . In those woods , where I bent my youthful bow , I will still hunt the deer ; over yonder waters I will still glide unrestrained in my hark-canoe . By those dashing waterfalls I will still lay up my winter 's store of food ; on these fertile meadows I will still plant my corn . Stranger , the land is mine I understand not these paper rights . I gave not my consent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased , for a few baubles , of my fathers . They could sell what was theirs ; they could sell no more . How could my father sell that which the Great Spirit sent me into the world to live upon ? They knew not what they did . The stranger came , a timid suppliant , - few and feeble , and asked to lie down on the red man 's hear-skin , and warm himself at the red man 's fire , and have a little piece of land , to raise corn for his women and children ; - and now he is become strong , and mighty , and hold , and spreads out his parchment over the whole , and says , it is mine . Stranger there is not room for us both . The Great Spirit has net made us to live together . There is poison in the white man 's cup ; the white man 's dog barks at the red man 's heels . If I should leave the land of my fathers , whither shall I fly ? Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graves of the Pequots ? Shall I wander to the west ? - the fierce Mohawk , the man-eater , is my foe . Shall I fly to the east ? - the great water is before me . No , stranger ; here have I lived and here will I die ; and if here thou abidest , there is eternal war between me and thee . Thou hast taught me thy arts of destruction ; for that alone I thank thee ; and now take heed to thy steps - the red man is thy foe . When thou goest forth by day , my bullet shall whistle by thee ; when thou liest down , at night , my knife is at thy throat . The noonday sun shall not discover thy enemy , and the darkness of midnight shall not protect thy rest . Thou shalt plant in terror and I will reap in blood ; thou shalt sow the earth with corn , and I will strew it with ashes ; thou shalt go forth with the sickle , and I will follow after with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the white man or the Indian shall cease from the land . Go thy way for this time in safety ; but remember , stranger , there is eternal war between me and thee ! ' ' Such are specimens of these eloquent addresses . Within the year past , Mr. Everett has delivered several others , of equal length and equal power . His eloquence flows like the waters of a perpetual fountain ; it does not , like the speechifying of some of our small-great men , spout forth a little frothy water , on some // gaudy day , and remain dry the rest of the year ; but it wells out continually . His is the eloquence that charms mankind ; and how much nobler a superiority does it confer than power , or even that high office to which he has just been chosen , not elevated ; for Edward Everett is among the few who confer new honor upon station . The Poetical Works of . lIIrs . Felicia Hemans ; complete in one volume ; with a Critical Preface . Philadelphia : Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by B. B. Thatcher , Esq. , a man of genius , who is not only capable of appreciating , but of producing the bright thoughts of poetry . In a moment of critical ferocity , we were unnecessarily harsh with regard to some funny verses of his in the Token ' ; we ought to have remembered that the best poets are sometimes at fault ; witness Mr. Bryant 's attempts at wit , thrown in like pieces of glass among his gleaming diamonds . Mr. Thatcher has attained a highly-respectable rank among American writers ; and that he is deserving , every reader of this preface will agree . It displays good taste , deep feeling , and a competent ability to edit even these works of the first English poetess of this or any other ago . The volume is very clearly and beautifully printed ; but , probably owing to the distance of the editor 's residence from that of the publisher , some errors have been overlooked , which , as they do not materially impair the value of the work to the public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may be corrected in a future edition . One or two pieces have inadvertently found a place here , which we know not to be the production of Mrs. Hemans ; and one or two , which , from their distinctive marks , we confidently guess not to be her 's . They were found , no doubt , in the newspapers , attributed to Mrs. Hemans . Some lines , by a friend of our 's , which would never have attracted notice with his bumble name , were , by some sapient editor , given to Mrs. Ilemans , and straightway they flew , from paper to paper , from Wiscasset to Appalachicola , as one of the most graphic and exquisite effusions of her glowing pen . ' So much for the prejudice of a popular name !
