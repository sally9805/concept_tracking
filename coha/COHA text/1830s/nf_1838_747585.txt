txt and perhaps bearing some bloody mandate of his royal master ; and perhaps he will have seen and blushed for his own image in the person of some beggarly Italian refugee . Entering the gate , guarded by Arab soldiers in a bastard European uniform , he will cross a large square filled with officers and soldiers , surrounded by what are called palaces , but seeing nothing that can interest him save the house in whic'the gallant Kleber , the hero of many a bloody field , died ingloriously by the hands of an assassin . Crossing this square , he will plunge into the narrow streets of Cairo . Winding his doubtful and perilous way among tottering and ruined houses , jostled by camels , dromedaries , horses , and donkeys , perhaps he will draw up against a wall , and , thinking of plague , hold his breath and screw himself into nothing , while he allows a corpse to pass , followed by a long train of howling women , dressed in black , with masks over their faces ; and entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for protection against any sudden burst of popular fury , and seating himself in a miserable Italian locanda , he will ask himself , Where is the ' * Cairo of the califs , the superb town , the holy city , the delight of the imagination , greatest among the great , whose splendour and opulence made the Prophet smile ? ** Almost immediately upon my arrival I called upon Mr. Gliddon , our vice-consul , and upon /q/ NubarBey , an Armenian dragoman to the Pacha , to whom I had a letter from a gentleman in Alexandria . The purport of my visit to the latter was to procure a presentation to the Pacha . He told me that several English officers from India had been waiting several days for that purpose ; that he thought the Pacha would receive them the next day , and , if so , he would ask permission to present me . Having arranged this , and not being particularly pleased with the interior , and liking exceedingly the donkeys on which it is the custom there to mount on all occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that was particularly gay and sprightly , and , followed by an Arab boy who had picked up a few Italian words , I told him to take me anywhere outside the city . He happened to take me out at the same gate by which I had entered , and I rode to Old Cairo . Old Cairo is situated on the river , about four miles from Boulac . The road is pretty , and some of the points of view , particularly in returning , decidedly beautiful . The aqueduct which conveys water into the citadel at Cairo is a fine substantial piece of workmanship , and an item in the picture . The church and grotto in which , as tradition says , the Virgin Mary took refuge with the infant Saviour , when obliged to fly from the Tetrarch of Judea , are among the few objects worthy of note in Old Cairo . The grotto , which is guarded with pious care by the Coptic priest , is a VOL . I. c /z/ small excavation , the natural surface covered with smooth tiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crawl in and sit upright . It is very doubtful whether this place was ever the refuge of the Virgin , but the craft or simplicity of the priests sustains the tradition ; and a half dozen Coptic women , with their faces covered and their long blue dresses , followed me down into the vault and kneeled before the door of the grotto , with a devotion which showed that they at least believed the tale . At my locanda this morning I made acquaintance with two English parties , a gentleman , his lady and nephew , who had been travelling in their own yacht on the Mediterranean , and the party of English officers to whom I before referred , as returning from India by way of the Red Sea . They told me that they were expecting permission from the Pacha to wait on him that day , and asked me to accompany them . This suited me better than to go alone , as I was not ambitious for a tete-a-tete with his highness , and merely wished to see him as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note from the consul , telling me that his highness would receive me at half past three . This , too , was the hour appointed for the reception of the others , and I saw that his highness was disposed to make a lumping business of it , and get rid of us all at once . I accordingly suggested to Mr. Gliddon that we should all /q/ go together : but this did not suit him ; he was determined that I should have the benefit of a special audience . I submitted myself to his directions , and in this , as in other things while at Cairo , found the benefit of his attentions and advice . It is the custom of the Pacha upon such occasions to send horses from his own stable , and servants from his own household , to wait upon the stranger . At half past three I left my hotel , mounted on a noble horse , finely caparisoned , with a dashing red cloth saddle , a bridle ornamented with shells , and all the decorations and equipments of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and escorted by the consul , with no small degree of pomp and circumstance I arrived at the gate of the citadel . Passing through a large yard , in which are several buildings connected with the different offices of government , we stopped at the door of the palace , and , dismounting , ascended a broad flight of marble steps to a large or central hall , from which doors opened into the different apartments . There were three recesses fitted up with divans , where officers were lounging , smoking , and taking coffee . The door of the divan , or hall of audience , was open , at which a guard was stationed , and in going up to demand permission to enter , we saw the Pacha at the further end of the room , with four or five Turks standing before him . c 2 /z/ Not being allowed to enter yet , we walked up and down the great hall , among lounging soldiers and officers of all ranks and grades , Turks , Arabs , and beggars , and went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting objects in the vicinity of Cairo , and there are few prospects in the world which include so many ; the land of Goshen , the Nile , the obelisk at Heliopolis , the tombs of the Califs , the pyramids , and the deserts of eternal sands . While standing upon the balcony , a janizary came to tell us that the Pacha would receive us , or , in other words , that we must come to the Pacha . The audience-chamber was a very large room , with a high ceiling  --  perhaps eighty feet long and thirty high  --  with Arabesque paintings on the wall , and a divan around . The Pacha was sitting near one corner at the extreme end , and had a long and full view of every one who approached him . I , too , had the same advantage , and in walking up I remarked him as a man about sixty-five , with a long and very white beard , strong features , of a somewhat vulgar cast , a short nose , red face , and rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of determination and energy . He wore a large turban and a long silk robe , and was smoking a long pipwith an amber mouthpiece . Altogether , he looked the Turk much better than his nominal master the Sultan . His dragoman , Nubar Bey , was there , and pre- /z/ Rented me . The Pacha took his pipe from his mouth , motioned me to take a seat at his right hand on the divan , and with a courteous manner said I was welcome to Egypt . I told him he would soon have to welcome half the world there : he asked me why ; and , without meaning to flatter the old Turk , I answered that everybody had a great curiosity to visit that interesting country ; that heretofore it had been very difficult to get there , and dangerous to travel in when there ; but DOW the facilities of access were greatly increased , and travelling in Egypt had become so safe under his government , that strangers would soon come with as much coniSldence as they feel while travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be many Americans among them . He took his pipe from his mouth and bowed . I sipped my cofiee with great complacency , perfectly satisfied with the manner in which , for the first time , I had played the courtier to royalty . Knowing his passion for new things , I went on , and told him that he ought to continue his good works , and intro-* duce on the Nile a steamboat from Alexandria to Cairo . He took the pipe from his mouth again , and in the tone of Let there be light , and there was light , ' said he had ordered a couple . I knew he was fibbing , and I afterward heard from those through whom he transacted all his business in Europe that he had never given any such order . Considering that a steamboat was an appropriate /z/ weapon in the hands of an American , I followed up my blow by telling him that I had just seen mentioned , in a European paper , a project to run steamboats from New York to Liverpool in twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him , and lie said nothing and smoked on . He knew America , and particularly from a circumstance which , I afterward found , had done wonders in giving her a name and character in the East , the visit of Commodore Patterson in the ship Delaware . So far I had taken decidedly the lead in the conversation ; but the constant repetition of ' Son Altesse by the dragoman began to remind me that I was in the presence of royalty , and that it was my duty to speak only when I was spoken to . I waited to give him a chance , and the first question he asked was as to the rate of speed of the steamboats on our rivers . Remembering an old , crazy , five or six mile an hour boat that I had seen in Alexandria , I was afraid to tell him the whole truth , lest he should not believe me , and did not venture to go higher than fifteen miles an hour ; and even then he looked as Ilderim may be supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having crossed over a lake like the Dead Sea without wetting bis horses hoofs . I have no doubt , if he ever thought of me afterward , that it was as the lying American ; and just at this moment , the party of English coming in , I rose and took my leave . Gibbon /z/ says , " When Persia was governed by the descendants of Sefis , a race of princes whose wanton cruelty often stained their divan , their table , and their bed with the blood of their favourites , there is a saying recorded of a young nobleman , that he never departed from the sultanas presence without satisfying himself whether his head was still on his shoulders. * " It was in somewhat of the same spirit that , in passing , one of the Englishmen whispered to me , " Are you sure of your legs P** During my interview with the Pacha , although my cx ) nversation and attention were directed towards him , I could not help remarking particu* larly his dragoman , Nubar Bey . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an olive complexion , and a countenance like marble . He stood up before us , about half way between the Pacha and me , his calm eye finely contrasted with the roving and unsettled glances of the Pacha , a perfect picture of indifference , standing like a mere machine to translate words , without seeming to comprehend or take the least interest in their import ; and though I had been particularly recommended to him , he did not give me a single glance to intimate that he had ever seen me before , or cared ever to see me again ; He was an ambitious man , and was evidently acting , and acted well , a part suited to an Eastern court ; the part necessary in his responsible and dangerous position , as the depositary of import- /z/ ant secrets of government . He was in high favour with the Paeha , and , when I left , was in a fair way of attaining any honour at which his ambitious spirit might aim . On my return to Alexandria , four months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammed Aly are a study and a problem . Like Bemadotte of Sweden , he has risen from the rank of a common soldier , and now sits firmly and securely on a throne of his own making . He has risen by the usual road to greatness among the Turks : war , bloodshed , and treachery . In early life his bold and daring spirit attracted the attention of beys , pachas , and the Sultan himself ; and having attained a prominent position in the bloody wars that distracted Egypt under the Mamelukes , boldness , cruelty , intrigue , and treachery placed him on the throne of the califs , and neither then nor since have these usual engines of Turkish government , these usual accompaniments of Turkish greatness , for a moment deserted him . The extermination of the Mamelukes , the former lords of Egypt , as regards the number killed , is perhaps nothing in comparison with the thousands whose blood cries out from the earth against him ; but the manner in which it was effected brands the Pacha as the prince of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly visit , while they were smoking the pipe of peace he was preparing to murder them ; and no sooner had they /z/ left his presence than they were pent up , ' fired upon , cut down and killed , bravely but hopelessly defending themselves to the last . This cruel deed must not be likened to the slaughter of the janizaries by the Sultan , to which it is often compared , for the janizaries were a powerful body , insulting and defying the throne . The Sultan staked his head upon the issuer and it was not till he had been driven to the desperate expedient of unfurling the sacred standard of the Prophet , and calling upon all good Mussulmans to rally round it ; in a word , it was not till the dead bodies of thirty thousand janizaries were floating down the Bosphorus , that he became master in his own dominions . Not so with the Pacha ; the Mamelukes were reduced to a feeble band of four or five hundred men , and could effect nothing of importance against the pacha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when , in passing out of the citadel , the stranger is shown the place where the unhappy Mamelukes were penned up and slaughtered like beasts , one only leaping his gallant horse over the walls of the citadel , he feels that he has left the presence of a wholesale murderer . Since that time he has had Egypt quietly to himself ; has attacked and destroyed the Wahabees on the Red Sea , and subdued the countries above the Cataracts of the Nile , to Sennaar and Dongola . He has been constantly aiming at introducing Euro- c5 /z/ pean improvements ; has raised and disciplined an army according to European tactics ; increased the revenues , particularly by introducing the culture of cotton , and has made Egypt , from the Mediterranean to the Cataracts , as safe for the traveller as the streets of New York . It remains to be seen whether , after all , he has not done more harm than good , and whether the miserable and oppressed condition of his subjects does not more than counterbalance all the good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidences he gave of his civilizing inclinations is the tendency he once manifested to fall under petticoat government . He was passionately fond of his first wife , the sharer of his poverty and meridian greatness , and the mother of his two favourite children , Youssouff and Ibrahim Pacha ; and whenever a request was preferred in her name , the enamoured despot would swear his favourite oath , By my two eyes , if she wishes it , it shall be done . ' ' Fond of war , and having an eye to the islands of Candia and Cyprus , he sent a large fleet and army , commanded by his son Ibrahim Pacha , to aid the Sultan in his war against Greece , and with his wild Egyptians turned the tide against that unhappy country , receiving as his reward the islands which he coveted . More recently , availing himself of a trifling dispute with the governor of Acre , he turned his arms against the Sultan , invaded Syria , and , after a /q/ long siege , took and made himself master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept all Syria ; Jerusalem , Damascus , and Aleppo fell into his hands ; and beating the SuU tan 's forces whenever he met them , in mid winter he led his Egyptians over Mount Taurus , defeated the grand vizier with more than one hundred thousand men almost under the walls of Constantinople , and would have driven the Sultan from the throne of his ancestors , if the Russians , the old enemies of the Porte , had not come in to his relief . According to the policy of the Porte , that which is wrested from her and she can not get back , she confirms in the possession of the rebel ; and Palestine and Syria are now in the hands of Mohammed Aly , as the fruits of drawing his sword against his master . He still continues to pay tribute to the Sultan , constrained doubtless to make the last payment by the crippled state in which he was left by the terrible plague of 1834 ; and , without any enemy to fear , is at this moment draining the resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one can fathom his intentions , and probably he does not know them himself , but will be governed , as the Turks always are , by caprice and circumstances . On leaving the Pacha , Mr. Gliddon proposed that we should call upon the governor of Cairo . We stopped at what would be called in France the " Palais de Justice , " and , mounting a dozen /z/ Steps , entered a large hall , at one end of which stood the governor . He was a short stout man of about fifty-five , with a long beard , handsomely dressed , and stood gently rubbing his hands , and constantly working his jaws like an ox chewing the cud . A crowd was gathered around him , and just as we were approaching the crowd fell back , and we saw an Arab lying on his face on the floor , with two men standing over him , one on each side , with whips like cowskins , carrying into effect the judgment of the munching governor . The blows fell thickly and heavily , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been given , he could not move ; he was picked up by his friends and carried out of doors . It was precisely such a scene as realized the reference in the Scriptures to the manners of the East , in the time of our Saviour , when a complaint was made to the judge , and the judge handed the offender over to justice ; or the graphic accounts in the Arabian Nights , of summary justice administered by the cadi or other expounder of the law , without the intervention of lawyers or jury . The poor Arab was hardly removed before another complaint was entered ; but not feeling particularly amiable towards the governor , and having seen enough of the great Turks for that day , I left the citadel , and rode to my hotel . /q/ /z/ The Slave market at Cairo .  --  Tomb of the Pacha.  --  The Pyramid of Cheops.  --  Oppressive Attentions of the Arabs .  - -  The Sphinx . Nearly all the time I was at Cairo , Paul and myself were ill , and for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young English army surgeon was there , on his way to India , and hearing there was a sick traveller in the house , he with great kindness called upon me , and prescribed for our ailments . If this book should ever meet the eye of Dr. Forbes , he will excuse my putting his name in print , as it is the only means I have of acknowledging his kindness in saving me from what would otherwise have been a severe and most inconvenient illness . At that time there was no English physician in Cairo , and I believe none at all , except some vile , halfbred Italian or French apothecaries , who held themselves fully qualified to practise , and were certainly very successful in relieving the sick from all their sufferings . On my return I found Dr. Walne , and though for his own sake I could wish /z/ him a better lot , I hope , for the benefit of sick travellers , that he is there still. * One of my first rambles in Cairo was to the slave-market . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it appeared to me , although after turning half a dozen corners in the narrow streets of a Turkish city , I will defy a man to tell where he is exactly . It is a large old building , enclosing a hollow square , with chambers all around , both above and below . There were probably five or six hundred slaves sitting on mats , in groups of ten , twenty , or thirty , each belonging to a different proprietor . Most of them were entirely naked , though some , whose shivering forms evinced that even there they felt the want of their native burning sun , were covered with blankets . They were mostly from Dongola and Sennaar ; but some were Abyssinians , with yellow complexions , fine eyes and teeth , and decidedly handsome . The Nubians were very dark , but with oval , regularly-formed , and handsome faces , mild and amiable expressions , and no mark of the * I have seen with great pleasure , in a late English paper , that Dr. Walne has been appointed English vice-consul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between England and Egypt by means of the Red Sea passage to India , it is a matter of no small consequence to England to have at Cairo as her representative a man of character and talents ; and I am sure I but express the opinion of all who know Dr. Walne , when I say that a more proper appointment could not have been made . /z/ /q/ African except the colour of their skin . The worst spectacle in the bazaar was that of several lots of sick , who were separated from the rest and arranged on mats by themselves ; their bodies thin and shrunken , their chins resting upon their knees , their long lank arms hanging helplessly by their sides , their faces haggard , their eyes fixed with a painful vacancy , and altogether presenting the image of a man in his most abject condition . Meeting them on their native sands , their crouching attitudes , shrunken jaws , and rolling eyes might have led one to mistake them for those hideous animals the orang-outang and ape . Prices vary from twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying within them the seeds of probable death , are coolly offered for almost nothing , as so much damaged merchandise which the seller is anxious to dispose of before it becomes utterly worthless on his hands . There was one , an Abyssinian , who had mind as well as beauty in her face ; she was dressed in silk , and wore ornaments of gold and shells , and called me as I passed , and peeped from behind a curtain , smiling and coquetting , and wept and pouted when I went away ; and she thrust out her tongue to show me that she was not like those I had just been looking at , but that her young blood ran pure and healthy in her veins . Cairo is surrounded by a wall ; the sands of the desert approach it on every side , and every /z/ gatei except that of Boulac , opens to a Bandy waste . Passing out by the Victory Gate , the contrast between light and darkness is not greater than between the crowded streets and the stilhiess of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immediately without commehces the great burialplace of the city . Among thousands and tens of thousands of Mussulmans ' headstones , I searched in vain for the tomb of the lamented Burckhardt ; there is no mark to distinguish the grave of the enterprising traveller from that of an Arabian camel-driven At a short distance from the gate are the tombs of the califs , large and beautiful buildings , monuments of the taste and skill of the Saracens . From hence , passing around outside the walls , I entered by the Gate of the Citadel , where I saw what goes by the name of Joseph 's Well , perhaps better known as the Well of Saladin . It is fortyfive feet wide at the mouth , and cut two hundred and seventy feet deep through the solid rock to a spring of saltish water , on a level with the Nile , whence the water is raised in buckets on a wheel , turned by a buffalo . On the 25th , with a voice that belied my feeU ings , L wished Paul a merry Christmas ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mounted a donkey and rode to the site of the ancient Heliopolis , near the village of Matarea , about four miles from Cairo , on the borders of /q/ the rich land of Goshen . The geographer Strabo visited these ruins thirty years A.C. , and describes them almost exactly as we see them now . A great temple of the sun once stood here . Herodotus and Plato studied philosophy in the schools of Heliopolis ; a barbarous Persian overturned her temples ; a fanatic Arabian burnt her books ; " and a single obelisk , sixty-seven feet high , in a field ploughed and cultivated to its very base , stands a melancholy monument of former greatness and eternal ruin . Passing out by another gate is another vast cemetery , ranges of tombs extending miles out into the desert . In Turkey I had admired the beauty of the graveyards , and often thought how calmly slept the dead under the thick shade of the mourning cypress . In Egypt I admired still more the solemn stillness and grandeur of a last resting-place among the eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead stand the tombs of the Mamelukes , originally slaves from the foot of the Caucasus , then the lords and tyrants of Egypt , and now an exterminated race : the tombs are large , handsome buildings , with domes and minarets , the interior of the domes beautifully wrought , and windows of stained glass , all going to ruins . Here , too , is the tomb of the Pacha . Fallen , changed , completely revolutionized as Egypt is , even to this day peculiar regard is paid to the structure of tombs and the burial-places of the dead . The tomb of the /z/ Pacha is called the greatest structure of modern Egypt . It is a large stone building , with several domes , strongly but coarsely made . The interior , still , solemn , and imposing , is divided into two chambers ; in the first , in a conspicuous situation is the body of his favourite wife , and around are those of other members of his family ; in the other chamber are several tombs , covered with large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one corner a large vacant place , reserved for the Pacha himself . Both apartments are carpeted , and illuminated with lamps , with divans in the recesses , and little wicker chairs for the different members of the family who come to mourn and pray . Two ladies were there , sitting near one of the tombs , their faces completely covered ; and , that I might not disturb their pious devotions , my guide led me in a different direction . During the time that I had passed in lounging about Cairo , I had repeatedly been down to Boulac in search of a boat for my intended voyage up the Nile ; and going one Sunday to dine on the Island of Rhoda with Mr. Trail , a young Englishman , who had charge of the palace and garden of Ibrahim Pacha , I again rode along the bank of the river for the same purpose . In coming up from Alexandria I had found the inconveniences of a large boat , and was looking for one of the smallest dimensions that could be at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk in the water , which I remarked to Paul was about the right size ; and while we stopped a moment , without the least idea that it could be made fit for use , an Arab came up and whispered to Paul that he could pump out the water in two hours , and had only sunk the boat to save it from the officers of the Pacha , who would otherwise take it for the use of government . Upon this information I struck a bargain for the boat , eight men , a rais , and a pilot . The officers of the Pacha were on the bank looking out for boats , and , notwithstanding my Arabs ingenious contrivance , just when I had closed my agreement , they came on board and claimed possession . I refused to give up my right , and sent to the agent of the consul for an American flag . He could not give me an American , but sent me an English flag , and I did not hesitate to put myself under its protection . I hoisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid no regard to its broad folds . The majesty of England did not suffer , however , in my hands , and Paul and I spent more than an hour in running from one officer to another , before we could procure the necessary order for the release of the boat . Leaving this with the rais , and the flag still flying , I went on to Rhoda , and spent the day there in decidedly the prettiest spot about Cairo . At the head of this island is the celebrated Nilometer , which , for no one knows /z/ how long , has marked the annual rise and fall of the Nile . I had been ten days in Cairo without going to the pyramids . I had seen them almost every day , but my doctor , who was to accompany me , had delayed my visit . He was obliged to leave Cairo , however , before I was ready to go ; and as soon as he was off , like a schoolboy when the master is out of sight , I took advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with me , and joining me at Old Cairo , we crossed over to Ohizeh . Almost from the gates of Cairo the pyramids are constantly in sight , and , after crossing the ferry , we at first rode directly towards them ; but the waters were yet so high that we were obliged to diverge from the straight road . In about an hour we separated , my guide taking one route and my friends another . With my eyes constantly fixed on the pyramids , I was not aware of our separation until I had gone too far to return , and my guide proved to be right . Standing alone on an elevated mountainous range on the edge of the desert , without any object with which to compare them , the immense size of the pyramids did not strike me with full force . Arrived at the banks of a stream , twenty Arabs , more than half naked , and most of them blind of an eye , came running towards me , dashed through the stream , and pulling , hauling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me /q/ to carry me over . All seemed bent upon having something to do with me , even if they carried me over piecemeal ; but I selected two of the strongest , with little more than one eye between them , and keeping the rest off as well as I could , was borne over dryshod . Approaching , the three great pyramids , and one small one , are in view , towering higher and higher above the plain . I thought I was just upon them , and that I could almost touch them ; yet I was more than a mile distant . The nearer I approached , the more their gigantic dimensions grew upon me , until , when I actually reached them , rode up to the first layer of stones , and saw how very small I was , and looked up their sloping sides to the lofty summits , they seemed to have grown to the size of mountains . The base of the great pyramid is about eight hundred feet square , covering a surface of about eleven acres , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high ; or , to give a clearer idea , starting from a base as large as Washington Parade Oround , it rises to a tapering point nearly three times as high as Trinity Church steeple . Even as I walked around it , and looked up at it from the base , I did not feel its immensity until I commenced ascending ; then , having climbed some distance up , when I stopped to breathe and look down upon my friend below , who was dwindled to insect size , and up at the great distance between // qwq /q/ considering that moment an epoch not to be forgotten . Thousands of years roll through his mind , and thought recalls the men who built them , their mysterious uses , the poets , historians , philosophers , and warriors who have gazed upon them with wonder Uke his own . For one who but yesterday was bustling in the streets of a busy city , it was a thing of strange and indescribable interest to be standing on the top of the great pyramid , surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they bad never been , the stirring scenes of his distant home . But even here petty vexations followed me , and half the interest of the time and scene was destroyed by the clamour of my guides . The descent I found extremely easy : many persons complain of the dizziness caused by looking down from such a height , but I did not find myself so afiected ; and though the donkeys at the base looked like flies , I could almost have danced down the mighty sides. * * A few years ago an unfortunate accident happened at this pyramid . An English officer , Mr. M. , who bad come up die Red Sea from India with his friend , had mounted to the top , and , while his friend was looking another way , Mr. M. was wa ; lking around the upper layer of stones and fell j he rolled down eight or ten steps ; for a moment he turned up his fece with an expression that his friend spoke of as horrible beyond all description , when his /z/ The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stone , and a hundred thousand men are said to have been employed twenty years in building it . The four angles stand exactly in the four points of the compass , inducing the belief that it was intended for other purposes than those of a sepulchre . The entrance is on the north side . The sands of the desert have encroached upon it , and , with the fallen stones and rubbish , have buried it to the sixteenth step . Climbing over this rubbish the entrance is reached , a narrow passage three and a half feet square , lined with broad blocks of polished granite , descending in the interior at an angle of twenty-seven degrees for about ninetytwo feet ; then the passage turns to the right , and winds upward to a steep ascent of eight or nine feet , and then falls into the natural passage , which is five feet high and one hundred feet long , forming a continued ascent to a sort of landing place ; in a small recess of this is the orifice or shaft called the well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he pitched headlong , rolling over and over to the bottom of the pyramid . Every bone in his body was broken ; his mangled corpse was sewed up in a sack , carried to Old Cairo and buried , and his friend returned the same day to Cairo . There were at the time imputations that Mr. M. had premeditated this act , as he had left behind him his watch , money , and papers , and had been heard to say what a glorious death it would be to die by jumping from the top of a pyramid . /q/ through a long passage , the explorer comes to what is called the Queen 's Chambers , seventeen feet long , fourteen wide , and twelve high . I entered a hole opening from this crypt , and crawling on my hands and knees , came to a larger opening , not a regular chamber , and now cumbered with fallen stones . Immediately above this , ascending by an inclined plane lined with highly polished granite , and about one hundred and twenty feet in length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in the sides , I entered the King 's Chamber , about thirty-seven feet long , seventeen feet wide , and twenty feet high . The walls of the chamber are of red granite , highly polished , each stone reaching from the floor to the ceiling ; and the ceiling is formed of nine large slabs of polished granite , extending from wall to wall . It is not the least interesting part of a visit to the interior of the pyramids , as you are groping your way after your Arab guide , to feel your hand running along the sides of an enormous shaft , smooth and polished as the finest marble , and to see by the light of the flaring torch chambers of red granite from the Ca  - -  taracts of the Nile , the immense blocks standing around and above you , smooth and beautifully polished in places , where , if our notions of the pyramids be true , they were intended but for ftw mortal eyes . At one end of the chamber stands a sarcophagus , also of red granite ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depth three and a haUv breadth three feet three inches . Here is supposed to have slept one of the great rulers of the earth , the king of the then greatest kingdom of the world , the proud mortal for whom this mighty structure was raised . Where is he now ? Even his dry bones are gone , torn away by rude hands , and scattered by the winds of heaven . There is something curious about this sarcophagus too . It is exactly the size of the orifice which forms the entrance of the pyramid , and could not have been conveyed to its place by any of the now known passages ; consequently , must have been deposited during the building , or before the passage was finished in its present state . The interior of the pyramid is excessively hot , particularly when surrounded by a number of Arabs and flaring torches* Leaving the Kings Chamber , I descended the inclined plane , and prepared to descend the well referred to by Pliny . The shaft is small ; merely large enough to permit one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in little niches , and hands clinging to the same . Having no janizary with me to keep them ofi , I was very much annoyed by the Arabs following me . I had at first selected two as my guides , and told the others to go away ; but it was of no use . They had nothing else to do ; a few paras would satisfy them for /q/ their day ' s labour ; and the chance of getting these either from charity or by importunity , made them all follow . At the mouth of the well I again selected my two guides , and again told the others not to follow ; and , sending the two before me , followed down the well , being myself quickly followed by two others . I shouted to them to go back , but they paid no regard to me ; so , coming out again , I could not help giving the fellow next me a blow with a club , which sent him bounding among his companions . I then flourished my stick among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I attempted the descent once more . A second time they followed me , and I came out perfectly furious . My friend was outside shooting , the pyramids being nothing new to him , and unfortunately I had been obliged to leave Paul at Cairo , and had no one with me but a little Nubian boy . Him I could not prevail upon to . descend the well ; he was frightened , and begged me not to go down ; and when he saw them follow the second time , and me come out and lay about me with a club , he began to cry , and , before 1 could lay hold of him , ran away I could do nothing without him , and was obliged to follow . There was no use in battling with the poor fellows , for they made no resistance ; and I believe I might have brained the whole of them without one offering to strike a blow . Moreover , d2 /z/ it was very hat and smothenng ; mod as there was natiuDg particular to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it up ; and calling my guides to return , in a few moments escaped fiom the hot and confined air d the pyramid . At the base I found my friend sitting quiedy with his gun in his hand , and upon him the homets nest which had so worried me within . The Arabs , considering their work done , gathered around me , clamorous for bucksheesh , and none were more importunate than the fdlows who had followed me so pertinaciously . I gave them liberally , but this only whetted their appetites . There was no getting rid of them ; a sweep of my club would send them away for a moment , but instantly they would reorganize and come on again , putting the women and children in the front rank . The sheik came ostensibly to our relief ; but I had doubts whether he did not rather urge them on . He , however , protected us to ' a certain extent , . while we went into one of the many tombs to eat our luncheon . For a great distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of the traveller , were they not lost in the overwhelming interest of the pyramids . That in which we lunched had a deep shaft in the centre , leading to the pit where the mummies had been piled one upon another . The Arabs had opened and rifled the graves and bones and fragments were still /q/ lying scattered around . Our persecutors were sitting at the door of the tomb looking in upon us , and devouring with their eyes every morsel that we put into our mouths . We did not linger long over our meal : and , giving them the fragments , setoff for a walk roupd the pyramid of Cephrenes the second in grandeur . This pyramid was opened at great labour and expense by the indefatigable Belzoni , and a chamber discovered containing a sarcophagus , as in that of Cheops . The passage , however , has now become choked up and hardly accessible . Though not so high , it is much more difficult to mount than the other , the outside being covered with a coat of hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken . Two English officers had mounted it a few days before , who told me that they had found the ascent both difficult and dangerous . One of the Arabs who accompanied them , after he had reached the top , became frightened , and , not daring to descelhd , remained hanging on there more than an hour , till his old father climbed up and inspired him with confidence to come down . A new attempt is now making to explore the interior of this pyramid . Colonel Vyse , an English gentleman of fortune , has devoted the last six months to this most interesting work . He has for an associate in his labours the veteran Caviglia , who returns to the pyramids rich with the expe- /z/ rience of twenty years in exploring the temples and tombs of Upper Egypt . By a detailed report and drawing received by Mr. Gliddon ( now in America ) from Caviglia himself , and by private letters of later date , it appears that they have already discovered a new passage and another chamber , containing on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then under the consideration of the savans and pupils of the Champolion school in Egypt ; and , whether they succeed in reading it or not , we can not help promising ourselves the most interesting results from the enterprise and labours of Colonel Vyse and Caviglia . The pyramids , like all the other works of the ancient Egyptians , are built with great regard to accuracy of proportion . The sepulchral chamber is not in the centre , but in an irregular and outof-the-way position in the vast pile ; and some idea may be formed of the great ignorance which must exist in regard to the whole structure and its uses , from the fact that by computation , allowing an equal solid bulk for partition walls , there is sufficient space in the great pyramid for three thousand seven hundred chambers as large as that containing the sarcophagus . Next to the pyramids , probably as old , and hardly inferior in interest , is the celebrated Sphinx . Notwithstanding the great labours of Caviglia , it is now so covered with sand that it is /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its head , neck , shoulders , and breast are sdll uncovered ; its face , though worn and broken , is mild , amiable , and intelligent , seeming , among the tombs around it , like a divinity guarding the dead . /z/ Journey up the Nile .  --  An Arab Burial .  --  Pilgrims to Mecca .  --  Trials of Patience .  --  A Hurricane on the Nile .  --  A Turkish Bath . On the first of January I commenced my journey up the Nile . My boat was small , for greater convenience in rowing and towing . She was , however , about forty feet long , with two fine latteen sails , and manned by eight men , a rais or captain , and a governor or pilot . This was to be my home from Cairo to the Cataracts , or as long as I remained on the river . There was not a place where a traveller could sleep , and I could not expect to eat a meal or pass a night except on board ; consequently , I was obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole voyage . My outfit was not very extravagant . It consisted , as near as I can recollect , of two tin cups , two pairs of knives and forks , four plates , cofiee , tea , sugar , rice , maccaroni , and a few dozen of claret . My bedroom-furniture consisted of a mattress and coverlet , which in the daytime were tucked up so as to make a divan . Over the head of my bed were my gun and pistols , and at the foot was a little swinging shelf , con* /q/ taining my Library , which consisted of the Modern Travellers on Egypt , Volney 's Travels , and an Italian grammar and dictionary . My only companion was my servant ; and as he is about to be somewhat intimate with me , I take the liberty of introducing him to the reader . Paollo Nuozzo , or , more familiarly , Paul , was a Maltese . I had met him at Constantinople travelling with two of my countrymen ; and though they did not seem to like him much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought myself quite fortunate , on my arrival at Malta , to find him disengaged . He was a man about thirty-five years old ; stout , square-built , intelligent ; a passionate admirer of ruins , particularly the ruins of the Nile ; honest and faithful as the sun , and one of the greatest cowards that luminary ever shone upon . He called himself my dragoman , and , I remember , wrote himself such in the convent of Mount Sinai and the temple at Petra , though he promised to make himself generally useful , and was my only servant during my whole tour . He spoke French , Italian , Maltese , Greek , Turkish , and Arabic , but could not read any one of these languages . He had lived several years , in Cairo , and . had . travelled on the Nile before , and understood all the little arrangements necessary for the voyage . At about twelve oclock , then , the hour when at home my friends were commencing their Newyear idsits , accompanied to the boat by my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and best friend in I embarked ; and with a fair windy and * the star-spangled banner ( made by an Arab tailor ) floating above me , I commenced my journey on the Nile . It is necessary here for every stranger to place himself under the flag of his country , else his boat and men are liable to be taken at any moment by the officers of the Pacha . It was the first time I had myself ever raised the banner of my country , and I felt a peculiar pride in the consciousness that it could protect me so ( ar from home . We started , as when I first embarked upon the Nile , with a fair wind , at sunset , and again to the gentle tap of the Arab drum we passed the great pyramids of Ohizeh and the giant monuments of Sachara and Dashoor . Long after sunset their dark outline was distinctly visible over the desert : I sat on the deck of my boat till their vast masses became lost in ' the darkness . My situation was novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation ; but with the morrow came a very essential change . A feeling of gloom came over me when I found the wind against my progress . The current was still running obstinately the same way as before , and to be so soon deserted by the element that I needed gave rather a dreary aspect to the long journey before me . That day , however , we contrived to do something ; my boat being small , my men /q/ were almost continually ashore with ropes around their breasts , towing ; and , occasionally , rowing across from side to side would give us the advantage of a bend in the river , when we would carry sail and make some progress . The scenery of the Nile , about fifty miles from Cairo , differed somewhat from the rich valley of the Delta , the dark mountains of Mokattam in the neighbourhood of Cairo bounding the valley on the Arabian side , while on the African the desert approached to the very banks of the river . Though travelling in a country in which , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , every foot of ground is said to possess an exciting interest , during my first day 's journey on the Nile I was thrown very much upon my own resources . My gun was the first thing that presented itself . I had bought it in Cairo , doubled-barrelled and new , for fifteen dollars . I did not expect to make much use of it , and it was so very cheap that I was rather doubtful of its safety , and intended to make trial of it with a double charge and a slow match . But Paul had anticipated me ; he had already put in two enormous charges , and sent one of the boatmen ashore to try it . I remonstrated with him upon the risk to which he had exposed the man ; but he answered in the tone in which he . ' ( like all European servants ) always spoke of the degraded inhabitants of Egypt , /z/ " Poh , he is only an Arab ! ** and I was soon relieved from apprehension by the Arab returning , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots . One thing disheartened me even more than the head wind . Ever since I left home I had been in earnest search of a warm climate , and thought I had secured it in Egypt ; but , wherever I went , I seemed to carry with me an influence that chilled the atmosphere . In the morning , before I rose , Paul brought in to me a piece of ice as thick as a pane of glass , made during the night ; a roost extraordinary , and to me unexpected circumstance . The poor Arabs , accustomed to their hot and burning sun , shrank in the cold almost to nothing , and early in the morning and in the evening were utterly unfit for labour . I suffered verymch also roy self . Obliged to sit with the door of my cabin closed , my coat and greatcoat on , and with a prospect of a long cold voyage , by the evening of the second day I had lost some portion of the enthusiasm with which , under a well-filled sail , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was again exceedingly cold , the . wind still ahead , and stronger than yesterday . I was still in bed , looking through the many openings of my cabin , and the men were on shore towing , when I was roused by a loud voice of lamentation , in which the weeping and wailing of women predominated . I stepped out , and saw on /q/ the bank of the river the dead body of an Arab , surrounded by men , women , and children , weeping and howling over it previous to burial . The body was covered with a wrapper of coarse linen doth , drawn tight over the head and tied under the neck , and fastened between two parallel bars , intended as a barrow to carry it to its grave . It lay a little apart before the group of mourners , who sat on the bank above , with their eyes turned towards it , weeping , and apparently talking to it . The women were the most conspicuous among the mourners .. The dead man had been more happy in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the women sitting there were really mourning his death . Whether they were real mourners , or whether they were merely going through the formal part of an Egyptian funeral ceremony , I can not say ; but the big tears rolled down their cheeks , and their cries sounded like the overflowings of distressed hearts . A death and burial-scene is at any time solemn , and I do not know that it loses any of its solemnity even when the scene is on the banks of the Nile , and the subject a poor and oppressed Arab . Human af fection probably glows as warmly here as under a gilded roof , and I am disposed to be charitable to the exhibition that I then beheld ; but I could not help noticing that the cries became louder as I approached , and I had hardly seated myself at a little distance from the corpse before the women /z/ seemed to be completely carried away by their grief , and with loud cries , tearing their hair and beating their breasts , threw out their arms towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away with shrieks piteous enough to touch the heart of the dead . * The general territqrial division of Egjrpt , from time immemorial , has been into upper and lower ; the latter beginning at the shores of the M editer* ranean , and extending very nearly to the ancient Memphis , and the former commencing at Memphis and extending to the cataracts . Passing by , for the present , the ruins of Memphis , on the fourth day , the wind dead ahead , and the men towing at a very slow rate , I went ashore with my gun , and about eleven o'clock in the morning walked into the town of Beni Souef . This town stands on the Libyan side of the river , on the borders of a rich valley , the Nile running close under the foot of the Arabian mountains ; and contains , as its most prominent objects , a mosque and minaret , and what is here called a palace or seraglio ; that is , a large coarse building covered with white cement , and having grated windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an excursion to Medineh el Fayoun , the ancient Crocodopolis , or Arsinoe , near the great Lake Moeris . This lake was in ancient days one of the wonders of Egypt . It was sixty miles long /q/ ( about the size of the lake of Geneva ) , and Herodotus says that it was an artificial lake , and that in his time the towering summits of two pyramids were visible above its surface . The great labyrinth , too , was supposed to be somewhere near this ; but no pyramids nor any ruins of the labyrinth are now to be seen . The lake is comparatively dry , and very little is left to reward the traveller . At sunset we hauled up to the bank , alongside a boat loaded with pilgrims ; and , kindling a fire on shore , the two crews , with their motley passengers , spent the night quietly around it . It was the first time since we had left Cairo that we had come in contact with pilgrims , although we had been seeing them from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimage to Mecca . The great caravan was already gathering at Cairo , while numbers , not wishing to wait , were seen on aU parts of the Nile on their way to Kenneh , from thence to cross the desert to Cos  - -  gier , and down the Red Sea to the Holy City . They were coming from all parts of the Mussulman dominions , poor and rich , old and young , women and children , almost piled upon each other , by scores , for several months exposing themselves to all manner of hardships , in obedience to one of the principal injunctions of the Koran , once in their lives to perform a pilgrimage to Mecca . /z/ On the fifth the wind was still dead ahead ; the men continued to tow , but without making much progress ; and the day dragged heavily . On the 9ixth I saw another burial . Early in the morning Paul called me to look out . We were lying , in company with another boat , fast to a little island of sand nearly in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a dead man lying on the sand , his limbs drawn up and stiff . He was a boatman on board the other boat , and had died during the night . A group of Arabs were sitting near , making coffee , while two were preparing to wash the body previous to burial . They brought it down to the margin of the river and laid it carefully upon the sand , then washed it , pressed down the drawn-up legs , and wrapped it in fragments of tattered garments , contributed by his fellow-boatmen , who could ill spare even these scanty rags ; and , laying it with great decency a little way from the river , joined the other group , and sat down with great gravity to pipes and coffee . In a few moments two of them ros , and going a little apart , with their bare hands scratched a shallow grave , and the poor Arab was left on a little sandbank in the Nile , to be covered in another season by the mighty river . He was an entire stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out from Cairo . In all probability , he was one of an immense in &ss; which swarms in the crowded streets of Cairo , . /q/ without friends , occupation , or settled means of living . On the seventh the wind was still ahead and blowing strong , and the air was very cold . Having no books , no society , and no occupation except talking with Paul and my boatmen , and the stragglers on shore , I became dispirited , and sat , hour after hour , wrapped in my greatcoat , deliberating whether I should not turn back . One of the most vexatious things was the satisfaction apparently enjoyed by all around me . If we hauled up alongside another boat , we were sure to find the crew sprawling about in a most perfect state of contentment , and seemingly grateful to the adverse wind that prevented their moving . My own men were very obedient , but they could not control the wind . I had a written contract with my rais , drawn up by a Copt in Cairo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , although neither knew a word of its contents . The captains manner of signing , I remember , was very primitive ; he dipped the end of his finger in the ink , and pressed it on the paper , and in so doing seemed to consider that he had sold himself to me almost body and soul . I know I am obliged to go if Howega says so , " was his invariable answer ; but , though perfectly ready to go whenever there was a chance , it was easy enough to see that they were all quite as contented when there was none . Several times I was on the point of turning back /z/ the wind drew down the river so invitingly ; but , if I returned , it was too early to go into Syria , and Thebes , * Thebes with her hundred gates , ' beckoned me on . On the eighth I had not made much more than fifty miles , and the wind was still ahead , and blowing stronger than ever ; indeed , it seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had really commenced in earnest . I became desperate and went ashore , resolved to wear it out . We were l3ring along the bank , on the Libyan side , in company with fifteen or twenty boats wind-bound like ourselves . It was near a little mud village , of which I forget the name , and several Bedouin tents were on the bank , in one of which I was sitting smoking a pipe . The wind was blowing down with a fury I have never seen surpassed in a gale at sea , bringing with it the light sands of the desert , and at times covering the river with a thick cloud which prevented my seeing across it . A clearing up for a moment showed a boat of the largest class , heavily laden , and coming down with astonishing velocity ; it was like the flight of an enormous bird . She was under bare poles , but small portions of the sail had got loose , and the Arabs were out on the very ends of the long spars getting them in . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had plunged into the river , and with strong swimming reached the bank , where a hundred men ran to his assistance . Their /q/ United strength turaed her bows around , up stream , but nothing could stop her ; stern foremost , she dragged the whole posse of Arabs to the bank , and broke away from them perfectly ungoyemable ; whirling around , her bows pitched into our fleet with a loud crash , tore away several of the boats , and carrying one off , fast locked as in a death-grasp , she resumed her headlong course down the river . They had gone but a few rods , when the stranger pitched her bows under and went down in a moment , bearing her helpless companion also to the bottom . It was the most exciting incident I had seen upon the river . The violence of the wind , the swift movement of the boat , the crash , the wild figures of the Arabs on shore and on board , one in a red dress almost on the top of the long spar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all formed a strange and most animating scene . I need scarcely say that no lives were lost , for an Arab on the bosom of his beloved river is as safe as in his mud cabin . On the ninth the wind was as contrary as ever ; but between rowing and towing we had managed to crawl up as far as Minyeh . It was the season of the Ramadan , when for thirty days , from the rising to the setting of the sun , the followers of the Prophet are forbidden to eat , drink , or even smoke , or take the bath . My first inquiry was for a bath . It would not be heated or lighted up till eight oclock ; at eight o'clock I went , and was /z/ surprised to find it so large and comfortable . I was not long surprised , however , for I found that no sooner was the sacred prohibition removed , than the Turks and Arabs began to pour in in throngs ; they came without any respect of persons , the haughty Turk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , every one who could raise a few paras . It was certainly not a very select company , nor over clean , and probably very few Europeans would have stood the thing as I did . My boatmen were all there . They were my servants , said the rais , and were bound to follow me everywhere . As I was a Frank , and , as such , expected to pay ten times as much as any one else , I had the best place in the bath , at the head of the great reservoir of hot water . My white skin made me a marked object among the swarthy figures lying around me ; and half a dozen of the operatives , lank , bony fellows , and perfectly naked , came up and claimed me . They settled it among themselves , however , and gave the preference to a dried-up old man , more than sixty , a perfect living skeleton , who had been more than forty years a scrubber in the bath . He took me through the first process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over me a copious ablution of warm water , left me to recover at leisure . I lay on the marble that formed the border of the reservoir , only two or three inches above the sur- /z/ face of the ater , into which I put my hand and found it excessively hot ; but the old man , satisfied with his exertion in rubbing me , sat on the edge of the reservoir , with his feet and legs hanging in the water , with every appearance of satisfaction . Presently he slid off into the water , and , sinking up to his chin , remained so a moment , drew a long breath , and seemed to look around him with a feeling of comfort . I had hardly raised myself on my elbow to look at this phenomenon , before a fine brawny fellow , who had been lying for some time torpid by my side , rose slowly , slid off like a turtle , and continued sinking until he too had immersed himself up to his chin . I expressed to him my astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that he was a boatman , had been ten days coming up from Cairo , and was almost frozen , and his only regret was that the water was not much hotter . He had hardly answered me before another and another followed , till all the dark naked figures around me had vanished . By the fitful glimmering of the little lamps , ail that I could see was a parcel of shaved heads on the surface of the water , at rest , or turning slowly and quietly as on pivots . Most of them seemed to be enjoying it with an air of quiet , dreamy satisfaction ; but the man with whom I had spoken first seemed to be car-r ried beyond the bounds of Mussulman gravity . It operated upon him like a good dinner ; it made /z/ him loquacious , and he urged me to come in , nay , he even became frolicsome ; and , making a heavy surge , threw a large body of the water over the marble on which I was lying . I almost screamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon me ; even while standing up it seemed to blister the soles of my feet , and I was obliged to keep up a dancing movement , changing as fast as I could , to the astonishment of the dozing bathers , and the utter consternation of my would-be friend . Roused too much to relapse into the quiet luxury of perspiration , I went into another apartment , of a cooler temperature , where , after remaining in a bath of moderately warm water , I was wrapped up in hot cloths and towels , and conducted into the great chamber . Here I selected a couch , and , throwing myself upon it , gave myself to the operators , who now took charge of me , and well did they sustain the high reputation of a Turkish bath : my arms were gently laid upon my breast , where the knee of a powerful man pressed upon them ; my joints were cracked and pulled ; back , arms , the palms of the hands , the soles of the feet , all visited in succession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo ; but who would have thought of being carried to the seventh heaven at the little town of Minyeh ? The men who had me in hand were perfect amateurs , en  - -  thusiasts , worthy of rubbing the hide of the Sultan himself ; and the pipe and coffee that followed /q/ were worthy too of that same mighty seigneur . The large room was dimly lighted , and , turn which way I would , there was a naked body , apparently without a soul , lying torpid , and tumbled at will by a couple of workmen . I had had some fears of the plague ; and Paul , though he felt his fears gradually dispelled by the soothing process which he underwent also , to the last continued to keep particularly clear of touching any of them : but I left the bath a different man ; all my moral as well as physical strength was roused ; I no longer drooped or looked back ; and , though the wind was still blowing a hurricane in my teeth , I was bent upon Thebes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recluse.  --  An Egyptian Hebe .  - -  Siout  --  A wolf-race among the Tombs .  --  Adventure with a Governor . January 13.  --  In the morning , the first thing I did was to shoot at a flock of ducks , the next to shoot at a crocodile . He was the first I had seen , and was lying on a sandbank on an island in the middle of the river . I might as well have thrown a stone at him , for he was out of range twice over , and his hard skin would have laughed at my bird- shot , even if I had hit him ; but I did what every traveller on the Nile must do , I shot at a crocodile . I met several travellers , all abundantly provided with materials , and believe we were about equally successful . I never killed any , nor did they . During the day the wind abated considerably , and towards evening it was almost calm . My boat rowed as easily as a barge , and we were approaching Manfaloot . For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of the river . The general character of the scenery of the /q/ Nile is that of a rich valley , from six to eight or ten miles wide , divided by the river , and protected on either side from the Libyan and Arabian Deserts by two continuous and parallel ranges of mountains . These are the stronglymarked and distinguishing features ; and from Cairo to the Cataracts , almost the only variety is that occasioned by the greater or less distance of these two ranges . Before approaching Manfaloot they changed their direction , and on the Arabian side the dark mountains of Mokattam advanced to the very border of the river . Here we began to approach the eternal monuments of Egyptian industry . For a long distance the high range of rocky mountain was lined with tombs , their open doors inviting us to stop and examine them ; but , most provokingly , now , for the first time since the day we started , the wind was fair . It had been my peculiar bad luck to have a continuance of headwinds on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and almost the very moment I came to an object of interest , the wind became favourable , and was sweeping us along beautifully . One of the few pieces of advice given me at Cairo , of which my own observation taught me the wisdom , was , with a fair wind never to stop going up ; and though every tomb seemed to reproach me for my neglect , wd went resolutely on . In one of the tombs lives an old man , who has /z/ been there more than fifty years , and an old wife , his companion for more than half a century , is there with him . His children live in Upper Egypt , and once a year they come to visit their parents . The old man is still hale and strong ; at night a light is always burning in his tomb , a basket is constantly let down to receive the offerings of the charitable , and few travellers , even among the poor Arabs , ever pass without leaving their mites for the recluse of the sepulchres . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being the season of the Ramadan , the Mussulman day had just begun ; the bazaars were open , and the cook and coffee shops thronged with Turks and Arabs , indemnifying themselves for their long abstinence . My boatmen wanted to stop for the night ; but as I would not stop for my own pleasure at the tombs below , I of course would not stop here for theirs ; and after an hour or two spent in lounging through the bazaars , and making a few necessary purchases , we were again under way . At about eight o'clock , with a beautiful wind , I sailed into the harbour of Siout . This is the largest town on the Nile , and the capital of Upper Egypt . Brighter prospects now opened upon me . The wind that had brought us into Siout , and was ready to carry us on farther , was not the cold and cheerless one that for more than two weeks had blown in my teeth , but mild , balmy . /q/ and refreshing , raising the drooping head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like walking , running , climbing , or clearing fences on horseback . Among the bourriquires who surrounded me the moment I jumped on the bank , was a beautiful bright-eyed little Arab girl , about eight years old , leading a donkey , and flourishing a long stick with a grace that would have shamed the best pupil of a fashionable dancing-master . By some accident , moreover , her face and hands were clean , and she seemed to be a general favourite among her ragged companions , who fell back with a gallantry and politeness that would have done honour to the ball-room of the dancing-master aforesaid . Leaving her without a competitor , they deprived me of the pleasure of showing my preference ; and putting myself under her guidance , I followed her nimble little feet on the road to Siout . I make special mention of this little girl , because it is a rare thing to see an Egyptian child in whom one can take any interest . It was the only time such a thing ever occurred to me ; and really she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open , and engaging expression , and such propriety of behaviour as she walked by my side , urging on the donkey , and looking up in my face when I asked her a question , that I felt ashamed of myself for riding while she walked . But , tender and delicate as she looked , she would have walked by the side of e2 /z/ her donkey , and tired down the strongest man . She was , of course , the child of poor parents , of whom the donkey was the chief support . The father had been in the habit of going out with it himself , and frequently taking the little girl with him as a companion . As she grew up , she went out occasionally alone ; and even among the Turks her interesting little figure made her a favourite ; and when all the other donkeys were idle , hers was sure to be engaged . This and many other things I learned from her own pretty little lips on my way to Siout . Siout stands about a mile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest valleys of the Nile . At the season of inundation , when the river rolls down in all its majesty , the whole intermediate country is overflowed ; and boats of the largest size , steering their course over the waste of waters by the projecting tops of the palm-trees , come to anchor under the walls of the city . A high causeway from the river to the city crosses the plain , a comparatively unknown and unnoticed , but stupendous work , which for more than three thousand years has resisted the headlong current of the Nile at its highest , and now stands like the pyramids , not so striking , but an equally enduring , and perhaps more really wonderful monument of Egyptian labour . A short distance before reaching the city , on the right , are the handsome palace and garden of Ibrahim Pacha . A stream /q/ winds through the valley , crossed by a stone bridge , and over this is the entrance-gate of the city . The governor 's palace , the most imposing and best structure I had seen since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed like a warder at the door . The large courtyard before the door of the palace contained a group of idlers , mostly officers of the household , all well armed , and carrying themselves with the usual air of Turkish conceit and insolence . Sitting on one side , with large turbans and long robes , unarmed , and with the large brass inkhorn by their sides , the badge of their peaceful and inferior , if not degrading profession , was a row of Copts , calling themselves , and believed to be , the descendants of the ancient Egyptians , having , as they say , preserved their blood intact during all the changes of their country . Boasting the blood of the ancient Egyptians , with the ruins of the mighty temples in which they worshipped , and the mighty tombs in which they were buried , staring them in the face , they were sitting on the bare earth at the door of a petty delegate of a foreign master , a race of degraded beggars , lifeless and soulless , content to / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tyrant , the wretched privilege of living as slaves in the land where their fathers reigned as masters . I do not believe that the contents of all the bazaars in Siout , one of the largest towns in Egypt , /z/ were worth as much as the stock of an ordinary dealer in dry goods in Broadway . But these are not the things for which the traveller stops at Siout . On the lofty mountains overlooking this richest valley of the Nile , and protecting it from the Libyan Desert , is a long range of tombs , the burial-place of the antient Egyptians ; and looking for a moment at the little Mohammedan burying-ground , the traveller turns with wonder from the little city he has left , and asks . Where is the great city which had its graves in the sides of yonder mountains ? Where are the people who despised the earth as a burial-place , and made for themselves tombs in the eternal granite ? The mountain is about as far from the city as the river , and the approach to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leaving our donkeys at its foot , and following the nimble footsteps of my little Arab girl , we climbed by a steep ascent to the first range of tombs . They were the first I had seen , and are but little visited by travellers ; and though I afterward saw all that were in Egypt , I still consider these well worth a visit . Of the first we entered , the entrance-chamber was perhaps forty feet square , and adjoining it on the same range were five or six others , of which the entrance-chambers had about the same dimensions . The ceilings were covered with paintings , finished with exquisite taste and delicacy , and in some places fresh as if /q/ just executed ; and on the walls were hieroglyphics enough to fill volumes . Behind the principal chamber were five or six others nearly as large , with smaller ones on each side , and running back perhaps a hundred and fifty feet . The back chambers were so dark , and their atmosphere was so unwholesome , that it was unpleasant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in far , there was always a loud rushing noise , and , as Paul suggested , their innermost recesses might now be the abode of wild beasts . . Wishing to see what caused the noise , and at the same time to keep out of harm 's way , we stationed ourselves near the back door of the entrance-chamber , and I fired my gun within ; a stream of fire lighted up the darkness of the sepulchral chamber , and the report went grumbling and roaring into the innermost recesses , rousing their occupants to frenzy . There was a noise like the rushing of a strong wind ; the light was dashed from Paul 's hand ; a soft skinny substance struck against my face ; and thousands of bats , wild with fright , came whizzing forth from every part of the tomb to the only avenue of escape . We threw ourselves down and allowed the ugly frightened birds to pass over us , and then hurried out ourselves . For a moment I felt guilty ; the beastly birds , driven to the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , flying and whirling blindly about , were dashing themselves against the rocky /z/ side of the mountain and falling dead at its base . Cured of all wish to explore very deeply , but at the same time relieved from all fears , we continued going from tomb to tomb , looking at the pictures on the walls , endeavouring to make out the details , admiring the beauty and freshness of the colours , and speculating upon the mysterious hieroglyphics which mocked our feeble knowledge . We were in one of the last when we were startled by a noise diflFerent from any we had yet heard , and from the door leading to the dark recesses within , foaming , roaring , and gnashing his teeth , out ran an enormous wolf : close upon his heels , in hot pursuit , came another , and almost at the door of the tomb they grappled , fought , growled fearfully , rolled over , and again the first broke loose and fled ; another chase along the side of the mountain , another grapple , a fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we lost sight of them . The whole afiair had been so sudden , the scene so stirring , and the interest so keen , that Paul and I had stood like statues , our whole souls thrown into our eyes , and following the movements of the furious beasts . Paul was the first to recover himself ; and , as soon as the wolves were fairly out of sight , with a characteristic movement , suddenly took the gun out of my hand , and started in pursuit . It is needless to say that he did not go far . But the interest of the day was not yet over . /z/ While walking along the edge of the mountain , in spite of bats and beasts , still taking another and another look , my ears were suddenly struck with a loud voice of lamentation coming up from the valley below ; and , looking in the direction of the city , I saw approaching over the elevated causeway a long funeral procession , and the voice came from the mourners following the corpse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of the mountain , and I immediately left the tombs of the ancient Egyptians to see the burial of one who but yesterday was a dweller in the land . Being far beyond the regular path for descending , and wishing to intercept the procession before its arrival at the burying ground , I had something like the wolf-race I had just beheld to get down in time ; unluckily , I had sent Paul back to the place where we had left our cloaks , and donkeys , and the little girl , with directions to ride round the foot of the hill and meet me at the burying  - -  ground . How I got down I do not know ; but I was quietly sitting under a large palm tree near the cemetery when the procession came up . It approached with funeral banners and devices which I could not make out , but probably containing some precept of the Koran , having reference to death , and the grave , and a paradise of houries and the loud wailing which had reached me on the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange procession came the beggars , or santons , men who are supposed to lead peculiarly pure and holy lives , denying themselves all luxuries and pleasures , labouring not , and taking no heed for themselves what they shall eat or what they shall drink , and living upon the willing , though necessarily stinted charity of their miserable countrymen . I could read all this at the first glance ; I could see that poverty had been their portion through life ; that they had drunk the bitter cup to its very dregs . Their beards were long white , and grizzled ; over their shoulders and breasts they wore a scanty covering of rags fastened together with strings , and all with some regard to propriety . This ragged patchwork covered their breasts and shoulders only , the rest of their bodies being entirely naked , and they led the funeral procession among a throng of spectators , with heads erect and proud step , under what , anywhere else , would be called an indecent and shameless exposure of person , unbecoming their character as saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes large jars of water , which , for charity 's sweet sake , and for the love of the soul of the deceased they carried to distribute gratis at his grave . After them came a parcel of boys , then the sheiks and two officers of the town , then the corpse tightly wrapped from head to foot in a red sash , on a bier carried by four men ; then a procession of men , and more /q/ than a hundred women in long cotton dresses , covering their heads and drawn oer their faces , so as to hide all except their eyes . These were the last , but by no means the least important part of the procession , as , by general consent , the whole business of mourning devolved upon them ; and the poor Arab who was then being trundled to bis grave bad no reason to complain of their neglect . Smiles and tears are a womans weapons ; and she is the most to be admired , and has profited most by the advantage of education , who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refinement can no doubt do wonders ; but the most skilful lady in civilized life might have taken lessons from these untutored Egyptians . A group of them were standing near me , chattering and laughing until the procession came up , when all at once big tears started from their eyes , and their cries and lamentations rent the air as if their hearts were breaking . I was curious to see the form of a modem burial in Egypt , but I hesitated in following . Some of the /z/ Arabs had looked rudely at me in passing , and I did not know whether the bigoted Mussulmans would tolerate the intrusion of a stranger and a Christian . I followed on , however , looking out for Paul , and fortunately met him at the gate of the burying-ground . The sheik was standing outside ordering and arranging ; and I went up to him with Paul , and asked if there was any ob /z/ jection to my entering ; he not only permitted it , but , telling me to follow him , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scabbard of his sword , he cleared a way through the crowd , and even roughly breaking through the ranks of the women , so as materially to disturb their business of mourning , and putting back friends and relations , gave me a place at the head of the tomb . It was square , with a round top , built of Nile mud , and whitewashed ; . two men were engaged in opening it , which was done simply by pulling away a few stones and scooping out the sand with their hands . In front , but a few feet from the door , sat the old mother , so old as to be hardly conscious of what was passing around her , and probably long before this buried in the same grave ; near her was the widow of the deceased , dressed in silk , and sitting on the bare earth with an air of total abandonment ; her bands , her breast , the top of her head and her face , plastered with thick c5ats of mud , and her eyes fixed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rolled away , and the door , or rather the hole , was opened ; the two men crawled in , remained a minute or two , came out , and went for the corpse . The poor widow followed them with her eyes , and when they returned with the body , carefully and slowly dragging it within the tomb , and the feet and the body had disappeared , and the beloved head was about to be shut for ever from t A widow 's lamentation. 85 her eyes , she sprang up , and passionately throwing her arms towards the tomb , broke forth in a perfect frenzy of grief . " Twenty years we have lived together ; we have always lived happily ; you loved me , you were kind to me , you gave me bread ; what shall I do now ? I will never marry again . Every day I will come and weep at your tomb , my love , my life , my soul , my heart , my eyes . Remember me to my father , remember me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remember half she said ; but , as Paul translated it to me , it seemed the very soul of pathos ; and all this time she was walking distractedly before the door of the tomb , wringing her hands , and again and again plastering her face and breast with mud . The mourning women occasionally joined in chorus , the santons ostentatiously crying out , " Water , for the love of God and the Prophet , and the soul of the deceased ; * " and a little girl about seven or eight years old was standing on the top of the tomb , naked as she was born , eating a piece of sugar cane . Paul looked rather suspiciously upon the whole affair , particularly on that part where she avowed her determination never to marry again . " The old Beelzebub , " said he , ** she will marry to-morrow if any one asks her . " Leaving the burying-ground , we returned to Siout . On my way I made acquaintance with the governor , not only of that place , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three tails ; /z/ a great man by virtue of his office , and much greater in his own conceit . I saw coming towards me a large , fine-looking man , splendidly dressed , mounted on a fine horse , with two runners before him , and several officers and slaves at his side . I was rather struck with his appearance , and looked at him attentively as I passed , without , however , saluting him , which I would have done had I known his rank . I thought he returned my gaze with interest ; and , in passing , each continued to keep his eyes fixed upon the other , to such a degree that we must either have twisted our necks off or turned our bodies . The latter was the easier for both ; and we kept turning , he on horseback and I on foot , until we found ourselves directly facing each other , and then both stopped . His guards and attendants turned with him , and silent as statues , stood looking at me . I had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mightiness opened his lips , and his myrmidons , with their hands on their sword-hilts , looked as if they expected an order to deal with me for my unparalelled assurance . His mightiness spoke , and I have no doubt but the Turks around him thought it was with the ne plus ultra of dignity , and wondered that such words had not confounded me . But it was not very easy to confound me with words I could not understand , although I could perceive that there was nothing very gradous in his manner . Paul answered , and , after the governor had /q/ turned his back , told me that his first address was , " Do I owe you anything ? " which he followed up by slapping his horse on the neck , and saying , in the same tone , " Is this your horse ? ' * Paul says that he answered in a tone of equal dignity , " A cat may look at a king ; though , from his pale cheeks and quivering lips , I am inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was exceedingly amused at the particulars of the interview , and immediately resolved to cultivate the acquaintance . During the long days and nights of my voyage up the Nile , in poring over my books and maps , I had frequently found my attention fixed upon the great Oasis in the Libyan desert . A caravan-road runs through it from Siout , and I resolved , since I had had the pleasure of one interview with his excellency , to learn from him the particulars of time , danger , &c.; I therefore hurried down to the boat for my firman , and , strong in this as if I had the Pacha at my right-hand , I proceeded forthwith to the palace ; but my friend observed as much state in giving audience as the Pacha himself . Being the season of the Ramadan , he received nobody on business until after the evening meal , and so my purpose was defeated . Several were already assembled at the gate , waiting the appointed hour ; but it did not suit my humour to sit down with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Turkish tyranny in being /z/ kept to the last ; so I marched back ' to my boat . It was still an hour before sunset ; my men had laid in their stock of bread , the wind was fair , a boat of the largest size , belonging to a Turkish officer , with a long red satin flag , was just opening her large sails to go up the river , and , bidding good-bye to my little Arab girl , we cast off our fastening to the bank at Siout . It was the first day I had spent on shore in the legitimate business of a tourist , and by far the most pleasant since I left Cairo . /q/ /z/ Small Favours thankfully received .  --  Slavery in Egypt .  --  How to catch a Crocodile .  --  An elahorate Joke .  --  Imaginary Perils .  --  Arabs not so bad as they might be . The next day , at about four o'clock , we arrived . at Djiddeh , formerly the capital of Upper Egypt , and the largest town on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been growing upon me , and , finding that there was a track from this place also , I landed , and working my way through the streets and bazaars , went to the governor ' *s palace . As I before remarked , the place where the governor lives is always , by extraordinary courtesy , called a palace . The governor was not at home ; he had gone to Siout , on a visit to my handsome friend the governor there , but he had left his deputy , who gave us such an account of the journey and its perils as almost put an end to it for ever , at least so far as Paul was concerned . He said that the road was dangerous , and could not be travelled except under the protection of a caravan or guard of soldiers ; that the Arabs among the mountains were a fierce and desperate people , and would certainly cut the throats of any unprotected tra- /z/ vellers . He added , however , that a caravan was about forming , which would probably be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before that time the governor would return and give me a guard of soldiers . It did not suit my views to wait the uncertain movements of a caravan , nor did it suit my pocket to incur the expense of a guard . So , thanking the gentleman for his civility ( he had given us pipes and coffee , as usual ) , I bade him good-bye , and started for my boat ; but I had not gone far before I found him trotting at my heels . In the palace he had sat with his legs crossed , with as much dignity as the governor himself could have displayed ; but , as soon as he slid down from the divan , he seemed to have left dignity for his betters , and pounced upon Paul for " bucksheesh . " I gave him five piasters ( about equal to a quarter of a dollar ) , for which the deputy of the Governor of Djiddeb , formerly the capital of Upper Egypt , laid his hand upon his heart and invoked upon my head the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time , I saw carried on one of the great branches of trade on the Nile , a trade which once stained the annals of our own country , and the fatal effects of which we still continue to experience . There were two large boat-loads  --  perhaps five or six hundred slaves  - -  collected at Dongola and Sennaar , probably bought from their parents for a shawl , a string /q/ of beads , or some trifling article of necessity . Bom under the burning sun of the tropics , several of them had died of cold even before reaching the latitude of Lower Egypt ; many were sick , and others dying . They were arranged on board the boats and on the banks in separate groups , according to their state of health . Among them was every variety of face and complexion , and it was at once startling and painful to note the gradations of man descending to the brute . I could almost see the very line of separation . Though made in Gods image , there seemed no ray of the divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true , but they sat , as I had seen them in the slave-market at Cairo , perfectly naked , with their long arms wound round their legs , and their chins resting upon their knees , precisely as we see monkeys , baboons , and apes ; and as , while looking at these miserable caricatures of our race , I have sometimes been almost electrified by a transient gleam of resemblance to humanity , so here I was struck with the closeness of man 's approach to the inferior grade of animal existence . Nor was there much difference between the sick and well ; the sick were more pitiable , for they seemed doomed to die , and death to anything that lives is terrible ; but the strong and lusty , men and women , were bathing in the river ; and when they came out they smeared themselves with oil , and laid /z/ their shining bodies in the sun , and slept like brutes . To such as these , slavery to the Turk is not a . bitter draught ; philanthropists may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is liberty to men dying for bread , and what hardship is there in being separated from the parents who have sold them , or doomed to labour where that labour is light compared with what they must endure at home ? In the East slavery exists now precisely as it did in the days of the patriarchs . The slave is received into the family of a Turk in a relation more confidential and respectable than that of an ordinary domestic ; and , when liberated , which very often happens , stands upon the same footing with a free man . The curse does not rest upon him for ever ; he inay sit at the same board , dip his hand in the same dish , and , if there are no other impediments , may marry his master 's daughter . In the evening we left Djiddeh , arid about ten o " *clock hauled up to the bank , and rested quietly till morning . Next day the wind was fair , but light , and I passed it on shore with my gun . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion to me on my journey than I had expected . There were always plenty of pigeons ; indeed , advancing in Upper Egypt , one of the most striking features in the villages on the Nile is the number of pigeon-cots , built of mud in the form /q/ of a sugar-loaf , and whitewashed . They are much more lofty than any of the houses , and their winged tenants constitute a great portion of the wealth of the villagers . It is not , however , allowable to shoot at these , the laws regulating the right of property in animals yi ? rB natures being as well established on the banks of the Nile as at Westminster Hall ; but there are hundreds of pigeons in the neighbourhood of every village which no one claims . In some places , too , there is fine sport in hunting hares ; and , if a man can bring himself to it , he may hunt the gazelle , and almost the whole line of the river , at least above Siout , abounds with ducks and geese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , very tough ; and , except for the sport , are not worth shooting . No keeping and no cooking could make them tender , and good masticators were thrown away upon them . But the standing shots on the Nile are crocodiles and pelicans . The former still abound , as in the days when the Egyptian worshipped them ; and as you see one basking in the sun , on some little bank of sand , even in the act of firing at him , you can not help going back to the time when the passing Egyptian would have bowed to him as to a god ; and you may imagine the descendant of the ancient river-god , as he feels a ball rattling against his scaly side , invoking the shades of his departed worshippers , telling his little ones of the /z/ glory of his ancestors , and cursing the march of improvement , which has degraded him from the deity of a mighty people into a target for strolling tourists . I always liked to see a crocodile upon the Nile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the associations . In one place I counted in sight at one time twenty-one , a degree of fruitfulness in the river probably equal to that of the time when each of them would have been deemed worthy of a temple while living , and embalment and a mighty tomb when dead . While walking by the river side I met an Arab with a gun in his hand , who pointed to the dozing crocodiles on a bank before us , and , marking out a space on the ground , turned to the village a little back , and made me understand that he had a large crocodile there . As I was some distance in advance of my boat , I accompanied him , and found one fourteen feet long , stuffed with straw , and hanging under a palm-tree . He had been killed two days before , after a desperate resistance , having been disabled with bullets and pierced with spears in a dozen places . I looked at him with interest and compassion , relBecting on the difference between his treatment and that experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purchase ; and though our languages were as far apart as our countries , bargain sharpens the intellect to such a degree that the Arab and I soon came to an understand* /q/ ing , and I bought him as he hung , for forty piasters and a charge of gunpowder . I had conceived a joke for my own amusement . A friend had requested me to buy for him some- mosaics , cameos , &c.; in Italy , which circumstances had prevented me from doing , and I had written to him , regretting my inability , and telling him that I was going to Egypt , and would send him a mummy or a pyramid ; and when I saw the scaly monster hanging by the tail , with his large jaws distended by a stick , it struck me that he would make a still better substitute for cameos and mosaics , and that I would box him up , and , without any advice , send him to my friend . The reader may judge how desperately I was pushed for amusement , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and having sent my Nubian to hail the boat as she was coming by , I followed with my little memorial . The whole village turned out to escort us , more than a hundred Arabs , men , women , and children , and we dragged him down with a pomp and circumstance worthy of his better days . Paul looked a little astonished when he saw me with a rope over my shoulder , leading the van of this ragged esQort , and rather turned up his nose when I told him my joke . I had great difficulty in getting my prize on board , and , when I got him there , he deranged everything else ; but the first day I was so tickled that I could have thrown all my /z/ other cargo overboard rather than him . The second day the joke was not so good , and the third I grew tired of it , and tumbled my crocodile into the river . I followed him with my eye as his body floated down the stream ; it was moonlight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moaning spirit of an ancient Egyptian , indignant at the murder and profanation of his god . It was , perhaps , hardly worth while to mention this little circumstance , but it amused me for a day or two , brought me into mental contact with my friends at home , and gave me the credit of having myself shot a crocodile , any one of which was worth all the trouble it cost me . If the reader will excuse a bad pun , in consideration of its being my first and last , it was not a dry joke ; for , in getting the crocodile on board , I tumbled over , and , very unintentionally on my part , had a January bath in the Nile . During nearly the whole of that day I was walking on the bank of the river ; there was more tillable land than usual on the Arabian side , and I continually saw the Arabs , naked or with a wreath of grass around their loins , drawing water to irrigate the ground , in a basket fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles . On the seventeenth we approached Dendera . I usually dined at one o'clock , because it was then too hot to go on shore , and also , to tell the truth . /q/ because it served to break the very long and tedious day . I was now about four hours from Dendera by land , of which two and a half were desert , the Libyan sands here coming down to the river . It was a fine afternoon ; there was no wind , and I hoped , by walking , to have a view of the great temple before night . It was warm enough then ; but as it regularly became very cold towards evening , I told my Nubian to follow me with my cloak . To my surprise he objected . It was the first time he had done so ! He was always glad to go ashore with me , as indeed were they all , and it was considered that I was showing partiality in always selecting him . I asked one of the others , and found that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made objections , on the ground that it was a dangerous road . This is one of the things that vex a traveller in Egypt , and in the East generally . He will often find the road which he wishes to travel a dangerous one , and , though no misadventure may have happened on it for years , he will find it impossible to get his Arabs to accompany him . My raia took the matter in hand , began kicking them ashore , and swore they should all go . This I would not allow . I knew that the whole course of the Nile was safe as the streets of London ; that no accident had happened to a traveller since the Pacha had been on the throne ; and that women and children might travel with perfect /z/ safety from Alexandria to the Cataracts ; and vexed with their idle fears , after whipping Paul over their shoulders , who I saw was quite as much infected as any of them , I went ashore alone . Paul seemed quietly making up his mind for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things about the boat , shutting up the doors of the cabin , buttoning his coat , and with my cloak under his arm , and a sword in his hand , he jumped ashore and followed me . He had not gone far , however , before his courage began to fail . The Arabs , whom we found at their daily labour drawing water , seemed particularly black , naked , and hairy . They gave dubious and suspicious answers , and when we came to the edge of the desert he began to grumble outright ; he did not want to be shot down like a dog ; if we were strong enough to make a stout resistance it would be another thing , &c.; &c.; In truth , the scene before us was dreary enough , the desert commencing on the very margin of the river , and running back to the eternal sands of Africa . PauFs courage seemed to be going with the green soil we were leaving behind us ; and as we advanced where the grass seemed struggling to resist the encroachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielding to the terror of his own imagination , until I suggested to him that we could see before us the whole extent of desert we were to cross ; that there was /q/ not a shrub or bush to interrupt the view , and not a living thing moving that could do us harm . He then began to revive ; it was not for himself , but for me he feared . We walked on for about an hour , when , feeling that it was safe to trust me alone , and being tired , he sat down on the bank , and I proceeded . Fear is infectious . In about half an hour more I met three men , who had to me a peculiarly cut-throat appearance ; they spoke but I , of course could not understand them . At length , finding night approaching , I turned back to meet the boat , and saw that the three Arabs had turned too , and were again advancing to meet me , which I thought a very suspicious movement . Paul 's ridiculous fears had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could : but there was no bush to hide behind . I almost blushed at myself for thinking of dodging three Arabs , when I had a doublebarrelled gun in my hand and a pair of pistols in my sash ; but I must say I was not at all sorry , before I met them again , to hear Paul shouting to me , and a moment after to see my boat coming up under full sail . One who has never met an Arab in the desert can have no conception of his terrible appearance . The worst pictures of the Italian bandits or Greek mountain robbers I ever saw are tame in comparison . I have seen the celebrated Gasperini , who ten years ago kept in terror the whole country f2 /z/ between Rome and Naples , and who was so strong as to negotiate and make a treaty with the pope . I saw him surrounded by nearly twenty of his comrades ; and when he told me he could not remember how many murders he had committed , he looked civil and harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexion of the latter , his long beard , his piercing coal-black eyes , half-naked figure , an enormous sword slung over his back , and a rusty matchlock in his hand , make the best figure for a painter I ever saw ; but , happily , he is not so bad as he looks to be . /q/ /z/ The Temple of Dendera .  --  Practice against Theory .  --  Regulating the Sun .  --  The French at Thebes .  --  The Curse of Pharaoh .  --  An Egyptian Tournament .  --  Preparations for Dinner .  --  An English travelling Lady . Sunday , January 18.  --  At eight o ' *cIock in the morning we arrived at Ghenneh , where , leaving my boat and crew to make a few additions to our stock , Paul and I crossed over in a sort of ferryboat to Deudera . The temple of Dendera is one of the finest specimens of the arts in Egypt , and the best preserved of any on the Nile . It stands about a mile from the river , on the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a great distance . The temples of the Egyptians , like the chapels in Catholic countries , in many instances stand in such positions as to arrest the attention of the passer-by ; and the Egyptian boatman , long before he reached it , might see the open doors of the temple of Dendera , reminding him of his duty to the gods of his country , I shall not attempt any description of this beautiful temple ; its grea , t dimensions , its magnificent propylon or gateway , portico , and columns ; the sculptured figures on /z/ the walls ; the spirit of the devices , and their admirable execution ; the winged globe and the sacred vulture , the hawks and the ibis , Isis , Osiris , and Horus , gods , goddesses , priests , and women ; harps , altars , and people clapping their hands , and the whole interior covered with hieroglyphics and paintings , in some places , after a lapse of more than two thousand years , in colours fresh as if but the work of yesterday . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , although I ought not perhaps to say so , I was disappointed . I found it beautiful , far more beautiful than I expected ; but , look at it as I would , wander round it as I would , the ruins of the Acropolis at Athens rose before me ; the severe and stately form of the Parthenon ; the beautiful fragment of the temple of Minerva , and the rich Corinthian columns of the temple of Jupiter , came upon me with a clearness and vividness I could not have conceived . The temple is more than half buried in the sand . For many years it has formed the nucleus of a village . The Arabs have built their huts within and around it , range upon range , until they reached and almost covered the tops of the temple . Last year , for what cause I know not , they left their huts in a body , and the village , which for many years had existed there , is now entirely deserted . The ruined huts still remain around the columns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chamber , beautifully sculptured , /q/ and formed for other uses , now blackened with smoke , and the polished floors strewed with fragments of pottery and culinary vessels . . Nor is this the worst affliction of the traveller at Dendera . He sees there other ruins , more lamentable than the encroachments of the desert and the burial in the sand , worse than the building and ruin of successive Arab villages ; he sees wanton destruction by the barbarous hand of man . The beautiful columns , upon which the skilful and industrious Egyptian artist had laboured with his chisel for months , and perhaps for years , which were then looked upon with religious reverence , and ever since with admiration , have been dashed into a thousand pieces , to build bridges and forts for the great modem reformer . It is strange how the organ of mischief developes itself when it has something to work upon . I sat down upon the sculptured fragments of a column , which perhaps at this moment forms the abutment of some bridge , and , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverencing the noble ruin , began breaking off the beautifully chiselled figure of a hawk , and , perhaps in ten minutes , had demolished the work of a year . I felt that I was doing wrong , but excused myself by the plea that I was destroying to preserve , and saving that precious fragment from the ruin to which it was doomed , to show at home as a specimen of the skill of the Old World , So far I did /z/ well enough ; but I went farther . I was looking intently , though almost unconsciously , at a pigeon on the head of Isis , the capital of one of the front columns of the temple . It was a beautiful shot ; it could not have been finer if the temple had been built expressly to shoot pigeons from . I fired : the shot went smack into the beautifully sculptured face of the goddess , and put out one of her eyes ; the pigeon fell at the foot of the column , and while the goddess seemed to weep over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult to herself and to the arts , I picked up the bird and returned to my boat . On board I had constantly a fund of amusement in the movements of my Arab crew . During the Ramadan , a period of thirty days , " no good Mussulman eats , drinks , or smokes , from the rising to the setting of the sun . My men religiously observed this severe requisition of the Koran , although sometimes they were at work at the oar under a burning sun nearly all day . They could form a pretty shrewd conjecture as to the time of the setting of the sun , but nevertheless they fell into the habit of regulating themselves by my watch , and I did not think the Prophet would be particularly hard upon them if I sometimes brought the day to a close half an hour or so before its time . Sometimes I was rather too liberal ; but , out of respect for me , they considered the sun set when I told them it was ; and /q/ it was interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount the upper deck , and , spreading out their cloaks , with their faces towards the tomb of the Prophet , kneel down and pray . On the twentieth , the wind was light but favourable , and part of the time the men were on shore towing with the cords . We were now approaching the most interesting spot on the Nile , perhaps in the world . Thebes , immortal Thebes , was before us , and a few hours more would place us among her ruins . Towards noon the wind died away , and left us again to the slow move  - -  ment of the tow-line . This was too slow for my then excited humour . I could not bear that the sun should again set before I stood among the ruins of the mighty city ; and , landing on the right side of the river , I set out to walk . About an hour before dark the lofty columns of the great temple at Luxor , and the still greater of were visible . The glowing descriptions of travellers had to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the expedi* tion to Egypt , says , that when the French soldiers first came in sight of Thebes , the whole army involuntarily threw down their arms and stood in silent admiration ; a sublime idea , whether true or not ; but I am inclined to think that the French soldiers would have thrown down their arms , and clapped their hands with much /z/ greater satisfaction , if they had seen a living city ' and prospect of good quarters . For my own part , without at this moment referring to particulars , I was disappointed in the first view of the ruins of Thebes . We walked on the right side of the river , the valley , as usual , running back to the desert . It was nearly dark when we arrived at the ruined village , which now occupies part of the site of the once magnificent city . The plough has been driven over the ruins of the temples , and grass was growing where palaces had stood . A single boat was lying along the bank ; a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazily against the mast ; and though it be death to my reputation as a sentimental traveller , t that moment I hailed the sight of that flag with more interest than the ruined city . Since I left Cairo I had seen nothing but Arabs ; for three weeks I had not opened my lips except to Paul ; and , let me tell the reader , that though a man may take a certain degree of pleasure in travelling in strange and out-of-the-way places , he can not forget the world he has left behind him . In a land of comparative savages he hails the citizen of any civilized country as his brother ; and when on the bank of the river I was accosted in my native tongue by a strapping fellow in a Turkish dress , though in the broken accents of a Sicilian servant , I thought it the purest English I had /q/ ever heard . I went on board the boat , and found two gentlemen , of whom I had heard at Cairo , who had been to Mount Sinai , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thence across the desert to Thebes , where they had only arrived that day . I sat with them till a late hour . I can not flatter myself that the evening passed as agreeably to them as to me , for they had been a party of six , and I alone ; but I saw them after ward , and our acquaintance ripened into intimacy ; and though our lots are cast in different places , and we shall probably never meet again , if I do not deceive myself , neither will ever forget the acquaintance formed that night on the banks of the Nile . Our conversation during the evening was desultory and various . We mounted the pyramids , sat down among the ruins of temples , groped among tombs , and , mixed up with these higher matters , touched incidentally upon rats , fleas , and all kinds of vermin . I say we touched incidentally upon these things ; but , to tell the truth , we talked so much about them , that when I went to my boat I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse provoked by Pharaoh still rests upon the land , and that rats , fleas , and all those detestable animals into which Aaron converted the sands , are still the portion of the traveller and sojourner in Egypt . I had suffered considerably during the last four days , but , not /z/ willing to lose a favourable wind , had put off resorting to the usual means of relief . To-night , however , there was no enduring it any longer ; the rats ran , shrieked , and shouted , as if celebrating a jubilee on account of some great mortality among the cats , and the lesser animals came upon me as if the rod of Aaron had been lifted for my special affliction . I got up during the night , and told Paul that we would remain here a day , and early in the morning they must sink the boat . Before I woke we were half across the river , being obliged to cross in order to find a convenient place for sinking . I was vexed at having left so abruptly my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We pitched our tent on the bank , and immediately commenced unlading the boat . On a point a little above , in front of a large house built by the French , at the south end of the temple of Luxor , and one of the most beautiful positions on the Nile , were two tents . I knew that they belonged to the companions of the two gentlemen on the opposite side , and that there was a lady with them . I rather put myself out of the way for it , and the first time I met the three gentlemen on the bank , I was not particularly pleased with them . I may have deceived myself , but I thought they did not greet me as cordially as I was disposed to greet every traveUer I met in that remote country . True , I was not a very inviting-looking object ; but , as I /q/ said to myself , Take the beam out of your own eye , and then  --  " true , too , their beards were longer , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think that gave them any right to put on airs . In short , I left them with a sort of go-to-the-devil feeling , and did not expect to have any more to do with them . I therefore strolled away , and spent the day rambling among the ruins of the temples of Luxor and Camac . I shall not now attempt any description of these temples , nor of the ruins of Thebes generally ( no easy task ) , but reserve the whole until my return from the Cataracts . At about three o'clock I returned to my tent . It was the first day of the feast of Bairam , the thirty days of fasting ( Ramadan ) being just ended . It was a great day at Luxor ; the bazaars were supplied with country products , the little cafterias were fiUed with smokers , indemnifying themselves for their long abstinence , and the fellahs were coming in from the country . On my return from Carnac I for the first time saw dromedaries richly caparisoned , mounted by wellarmed Arabs , and dashing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dromedaries before except in caravans , accommodating themselves to the slow pace of the camel , and I did not think the clumsy , lumbering animal could carry himself so proudly and move so rapidly . Their move ment , however , was very far from realizing the /z/ extravagant expression of " swift as the wind , ' ' applied to it in the East . I was somewhat fatigued on my return , and Paul met me on the bank with a smiling face , and information that the English party had sent their janizary to ask me to dine with them at six o'clock . Few things tend to give you abetter opinion of a man , of his intelligence , his piety , and morals , than receiving from him an invitation to dinner . I am what is called a sure man in such cases , and the reader may suppose that I was not wanting upon this occasion . It was an excessively hot day . You who were hovering over your coal fires , or moving about wrapped in cloaks or greatcoats , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were refreshing their heated bodies by a bath in the Nile , and that I was lying under my tent actually panting for breath . 1 had plenty to oc* cupy me , but the heat was too intense ; the sun seemed to scorch the brain , while the sands blistered the feet . I think it was the hottest day I experienced on the Nile . While leaning on my elbow , looking out of the door of my tent towards the temple of Luxor , I saw a large body of Arabs , on foot , on dromedaries and on horseback , coming down towards the river . They came about half way across the sandy plain between the temple and the river , and stopped nearly opposite to my tent , so as to give me a /z/ full view of all their movements . The slaves and pipe-bearers immediately spread mats on the sand , on which the principal persons seated themselves , and , while they were taking coffee and pipes , others were making preparations for equestrian exercises . The forms and ceremonies presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a tournament ; and the intense heat and scorching sands reminded me of the great passage of arms in Scott 's Crusaders , near the Diamond of the Desert , on the shores of the Dead Sea . The parties were on horseback , holding in their right hands long wooden spears , the lower ends resting on the sand , close together , and forming a pivot around which their movements were made . They rode round in a circle , with their spears in the sand and their eyes keenly fixed on each other , watching an opportunity to strike ; chased , turned , and doubled , but never leaving the pivot ; occasionally the spears were raised , crossed , and struck together , and a murmuring ran through the crowd like the cry in the fencing-scene in Hamlet , a hit , a fair hit , and the parties separated , or again dropped their poles in the centre for another round . The play for some time seemed confined to slaves and dependants , and among them , and decidedly the most skilful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was sitting on the mat , seemed particularly pleased with his success . The whole of this seemed merely a preliminary , /z/ designed to stir up the dormant spirit of the masters . For a long time they sat quietly puffing their pipes , and probably longing for the stimulus of a battle-cry to rouse them from their torpor . At length one of them , the master of the Nubian , slowly rose from the mat and challenged an antagonist . Slowly he laid down his pipe , and took and raised the pole in his hand ; but still he was not more than half roused . A fresh horse was brought him , and , without taking off his heavy cloth mantle , he drowsily placed his left foot in the broad shovel stirrup , his right on the rump of the horse , behind the saddle , and swung himself into the seat . The first touch of the saddle seemed to rouse him ; he took the pole from the hand of his attendant , gave his horse a severe check , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sides , dashed through the sand on a full run . At the other end of the course he stopped , rested a moment or two , then again driving his irons into his horse , dashed back at full speed ; and when it seemed as if his next step would carry him headlong among the Turks on the mat , with one jerk he threw his horse back on his haunches , and brought him up from a full run to a dead stop . This seemed to warm him a little ; his attendant came up and took off his cloak , under which he had a red silk jacket and white trousers , and again he dashed through the sand and back as before . This time he brought /q/ up his horse with furious vehemence ; his turban became unrolled , he flew into a violent passion tore it off and threw it on the sand , and , leaving his play , fiercely struck the spear of his adversary , and the battle at once commenced . The Turk , who had seemed too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an endurance of fatigue , that would have been terrible in battle . Both horse and rider scorned the blazing sun and burning sands , and round and round they ran , chasing , turning , and doubling within an incredible small circle , till an approving murmur was heard among the crowd . The trial was now over , and the excited Turk again seated himself upon the mat , and relapsed into a state of calm indifference . The exercise finished just in time to enable me to make my toilet for dinner . As there was a lady in the case , I had some doubt whether I ought not to shave , not having performed that operation since I left Cairo ; but , as I had already seen the gentlemen of the party , and had fallen , moreover , into the fashion of the country , of shaving the head and wearing the tarbouch , ( one of the greatest luxuries in Egypt , by-the-way , ) and could not in any event sit with my head uncovered , I determined to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , and giving directions to my boatmen to be ready to start at ten oclock , I walked along the bank to the tent /z/ of my new friends I do not know whether my notion in the morning was right , or whether I had misapprehended things ; but , at any rate , I had no reason to complain of my reception now ; I think myself that there was a difference , which I accounted for in my own way , by ascribing to their discovery that I was an American . I have observed that English meeting abroad , though they would probably stand by each other to the death in a quarrel , are ridiculously shy of each other as acquaintances , on account of the great difference of caste at home . As regards Ameri-p cans , the case is different , and to them the English display none of that feeling . After I had started on my ramble , Paul had planted my flag at the door of the tent , and , among the other advantages which that flag brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one of the most pleasant evenings I spent on the Nile . Indeed , I hope I may be pardoned a burst of national feeling , and be allowed to say , without meaning any disrespect to any other country , that I would rather travel under the name of an American than under any other known in Europe . Every American abroad meets a general prepossession in favour of his country , and it is an agreeable truth that the impression made by our countrymen abroad generally sustains the prepossession . I have met with some , however , who destroyed this good effect , and made them /q/ selves disagreable and gave ofPence by a habit of intruding their country and its institutions , and of drawing invidious comparisons , with a pertinacity and self-complacency I never saw in any other people . But to return to the dinner : a man may make a long digression before a dinner on paper , who would scorn such a thing before a dinner de facto . The party consisted of four , a gentleman and his lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title ; a brother of the lady , an ex-captain in the guards , who changed his name and resigned his commission on receiving a fortune from an uncle ; and another gentleman , I do not know whether of that family , but bearing one of the proudest names in England . They were all young , the oldest not more than thirty-five , and , not excepting the lady , full of thirst for adventure and travel . I say not excepting the lady ; I should rather say that the lady was the life and soul of the party . She was young and beautiful , in the most attractive style of English beauty ; she was married , and therefore dead in law ; and as we may say what we will of the dead , I venture to say that she had shone as a beauty and belle in the proudest circles of England , and was now enjoying more pleasure than Almack 's or drawingrooms could give , rambling among ruins and sleeping under a tent on the banks of the Nile . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinai and the Red Sea , and they talked of Bagdad . I bad often met on the Continent with Englishmen who " were out , *** as they called it , for a certain time , one year or two years , but this party had no fixed time ; they " were out " for as long as suited their humour . To them I am indebted for the most interesting part of my journey in the East , for they first suggested to me the route by Petra and Arabia Petraea . We made a calculation by which we hoped , in reference to what each had to do , to meet at Cairo and make the attempt together . It was a great exertion of resolution that I did not abandon my own plans , and keep in company with them , but they had too much time for me ; a month or two was no object to them , but to me a very great one . All this , and much more , including the expression of a determination , when they had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New , took place while we were dining under the tent of the captain and his friend . The table stood in the middle on canteens , about eight inches from the ground , with a mattress on each side for seats . It was rather awkward sitting , particularly for me , who was next the lady , and in that position felt some of the trammels of conventional life ; there was no room to put my legs under the table , and , not anticipating the precise 9tate of things , I had not arranged straps and suspenders , and my feet seemed to be bigger than /q/ even I doubled them under me ; they got asleep , not the quiet and tranquil sleep which makes you forget existence , but the slumber of a troubled conscience , pricking and burning , till human nature could endure it no longer , and I kicked out the offending members with very little regard to elegance of attitude . The ice once broken , I felt at my ease , and the evening wore away too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , that my ears fairly tingled with pleasure at bearing myself talk . It was , in fact , a glorious evening ; a bright spot that I love to look back upon , more than indemnifying me for weeks of loneliness . I sat with them till a late hour ; and , when I parted , I did not feel as if it was the first time I had seen them , or think it would be the last , expecting to meet them a few days afterward at the Cataracts . But I never saw them again ; we passed each other on the river during the night . I received several messages from them ; and at Beyroot , after I had finished my tour in Arabia Petrsea and the Holy Land , I received a letter from them , still on the Nile . I should be extremely sorry to think that we are never to meet again , and hope that , when wearied with rambling among the ruins of the Old World , they will execute their purpose of visiting America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of the Nile . I went back to my boat /z/ to greater loneliness than before , but there was a fine wind , and in a few minutes we were again under way . I sat on deck till a late hour smoked two or three pipes , and retired to my little cabin . /q/ /z/ The Rock of the Chain .  --  Ravages of the Plague .  --  Deserted Quarries  --  A. youthful Navigator :  --  A recollection of Sam Patch .  --  Ancient Inscriptions .  --  A perplexed Major-domo ,  - -  A Dinner without parallel .  --  An awkvvard Discovery . The next day and the next still brought us favourable winds and strong , and we were obliged to take down one of our tall latteens , but made great progress with the other , even against the rapid current of the river . The Nile was very wide , the water turbulent , and the waves rolling with such violence that Paul became sea-sick ; and , if it had not been for the distant banks , we could hardly have believed ourselves on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the evening we were approaching Hadjar Silsily , the Rock of the Chain , the narrowest part of the river , where the mountains of Africa and Arabia seem marching to meet each other , and stopping merely to leave a narrow passage for the river . Tradition says that in ancient days an iron chain was drawn across . the narrow strait , which checked the current ; and the Arab boatman believes he can still see , in the sides of the mountains , the marks of the rings and bolts to which the miraculous chain was fastened . /z/ We hauled up alongside of the bank for part of the night , and the next morning with a strong and favourable wind , were approaching Assouan , the last town in Egypt , standing on the borders of Ethiopia and at the foot of the Cataracts of the Nile . For some time before reaching Assouan the river becomes broader and the mountains again retire , leaving space for the islands and a broad surface for the body of the river . About three miles this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace of Ibrahim , where he retired and shut himself up during the terrible plague of last year . On the right , the top of the Libyan mountain is crowned with the tomb of a Marabout sheik , and about half way down are the ruins of a convent , picturesque and interesting , as telling that before the crescent came and trampled it under foot , the cross , the symbol of the Christian faith , once reared its sacred form in the interior of Africa . In front is the beautiful island of Elephantina , with a green bank sloping down to the river . On the left are rugged mountains ; and projecting in rude and giant masses into the river are the rocks of dark grey granite from which came the mighty obelisks and monuments that adorned the ancient temples of Egypt The little town of Assouan stands on the bank of the river , almost hid among palm-trees ; and back at a distance on the height are the ruins of the old city . From the deck of my boat the approach to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nile , possessing a variety and wildness equally striking and beautiful after the monotonous seenery along the whole ascent of the river . With streamers gallantly flying I entered the little harbour , and , with a feeling of satisfaction that amply repaid me for all its vexations , I looked upon the end of my journey . I would have gone to the second cataract if time had been no object to nie , or if I had had at that time any idea c writing a book , as the second cataract is the usual terminus for travellers on the Nile ; and a man who returns to Cairo without having been there is not considered entitled to talk much about his voyage up the river . I am , perhaps , publishing my own want of taste when I say that the notion of going to the great Oasis had taken such a hold of me , that it was mainly for this object that I sacrificed the voyage to the second cataract . With the feeling , , therefore that here was the end of my journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , having been pent up on board for two days , I put myself in rapid action , and , in one of the cant phrases of continental tourists , began to knock down the lions . ' " My first move was to the little town of Assouan ; but here I found little to detain me . It was better built than most of the towns on the Nile , and has its street of bazaars ; the slave- /z/ bazaars being by far the best supplied of any . In one of the little cafterias opposite the slavemarket , a Turk meanly dressed , though ' with arms , and a mouthpiece to his pipe that marked him as a man of rank , attracted my particulatr attention . He was almost the last of the Mamelukes , but yesterday the lords of Egjt ; one of the few who escaped the general massacre of his race , and one of the very few permitted to drag out the remnant of their days in the Pachas dominions . The ruins of the old town are in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , the cataracts , the island of Elephantina , and the Arabian desert . More than a thousand years ago , this city contained a large and flourishing population ; and some idea may be formed of its former greatness , from the fact that more than twenty thousand of its inhabitants died in one year of the plague . In consequence of the terrible ravages of this scourge , the inha bitants abandoned it ; but , still clinging to thdlr ancient homes , commenced building a new town , beginning at the northern wall of the old . Tlie valley here is very narrow ; and the desert of Arabia , with its front of dark granite mountains , advances to its bank . The Southern gate of the modem town opens to the sands of the desert , and immediately outside the walls is a large Mohammedan burying-ground , /z/ by its extent and the number of its tombstones exciting the wcmder of the stranger how so small a town coold pay such a tribute to the king of terrors . In many jdaces the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been qNTinkled over them having been blown away . Sculls , 18 , and arms were scattered about in every direction ; and in one place we saw a pile of sculls and bones , which seemed to have been collected by some pious hand , to save them from the foot of the passing traveller . In another , the rest of the body still buried , the feet were sticking out , and the naked skull , staring at us from its sightless sockets , seemed struggling to free itself from the bondage of the grave , and claiming the promise of a resurrection from the dead . We buried again these relics of mortality , and hoping it might not be our lot to lay our bones where the grave was so little reverenced , continued our way to the ancient granite quarries of Syene . These quarries stand about half an hours walk from the river , in the bosom of a long range of granite mountains , stretching off into the desert Arabia . Time and exposure have not touched the freshness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was but yesterday that the Egyptian left it . You could imagine that the workman had just gone to his noonday meal ; and as you look at the mighty obelisk lying rude and unfinished at your feet , you feel /z/ disposed to linger till the Egyptian shall come to resume his to carve his mysterious characters upon it , and make it a fit portal for some mighty temple . But the hammer and chisel will never be heard there more . The Egyptian workmen have passed away , and these immense quarries are now and for ever silent and deserted . Aside from the great interest of these ancient quarries , it is curious to notice how , long before the force of gunpowder and the art of blasting rocks were known , immense stones were separated from the sides of the mountains , and divided as the artist wished , by the slow process of boring small holes , and splitting them apart with wedges . I returned by the old city , crossing its burying ground , which , like that of the new town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , before the city was destroyed , it too had paid a large tribute to the grave . This burying-ground has an interest not possessed by any other in Egypt , as it contains , scattered over its extended surface , many tombstones with Coptic inscriptions , the only existing remains of the language of a people who styled themselves and are styled the descendants of the ancient Egyptians . It was late in the afternoon , as I stood on the height crowned by the ruins of the ancient city , with a momentary feeling of returning loneliness , and gazed upon the sun retiring with glorious splendour towards my far-distant home I turned /q/ my eyes to my boat , and beyond it , at a distance down the river , I saw a boat coming up under full sail , bearing what my now practised eye told me was the English flag . I hurried down , and arrived on the bank in time to welcome to the Cataracts of the Nile the two gentlemen I had first met at Thebes . We spent the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own boat up the cataracts , and agreed to go up with them . In the morning , after an early breakfast , we started for the Island of Philce , about eight miles from Assouan , and above all the cataracts ; an island singularly beautiful in situation , and containing the ruins of a magnificent temple . The road lay nearly all the way along the river , commanding a full view of the cataracts , or rather , if a citizen of a new world may lay his innovating hand upon things consecrated by the universal consent of ages , what we who have heard the roar of Niagara would call simply the rapids . " We set off on shaggy donkeys , without saddle , bridle , or halter . A short distance from Assouan , unmarked by any monument , amid arid sands , we crossed the line which , since the days of Pharaoh , has existed as the boundary between Egypt and Ethiopia . We passed through several villages , standing alone at the foot of the granite moun tains , without green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a blade of grass , and irresistibly suggesting the question , How do the miserable inhabitants live ? " It was not the first time I had had occasion to remark the efiect of blood on physical character , and the strong and marked difference of races among people living under the same sun , and almost on a common soiL In the first village in Nubia , though not half an hbur from Assouan , there is a differaice obvious to the most superficial observer , and here , on the very confines of Egypt , it would be impossible to mistake a border Nubian for an Arab of Assouan . Before arriving at Philoe the river is filled widi rocks and islands , and the view becomes singularly bold and striking . At the foot of one of the islands is a sort of ferry , with a very big boat and a very little boy to manage it . We got on boardf and were astonished to see with what courage and address the little fellow conducted us among the islands washed by the cataracts . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to take advantage of an eddy to get to one point , jump ashore , tow the boat to another , again drop to another , tow her again , and so on , and all this time the little fdlow was at the helm , at the oar , at the rope , leading the chorus of a Nubian song , and ordering his crew , which consisted of three boys and one little gu4* In this way we worked to an island inhabited by a few miserable Nubians , dossing it , came to the point of the prin* /q/ dpal cataract ( I contiiiue to call it cataract by oourtesy ) , being a fall of about two feet . And these were the great Cataracts of the Nile , whose roar in ancient days afirighted the Egyptian boatmen , and which history and poetry have infested with extraordinary and ideal terrors ! The traveller who has come from a country as far distant as mine , bringing all that freshness of feeling with which a citizen of the New World turns to the storied wonders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk of the rivers of Greece , will have found himself so often cheated by the exaggerated accounts of the ancients , the descriptions of poets , and his own imagination , that he will hardly feel disappointed when he stands by this apology for a cataract . Here the Nubian boys had a great feat to show , viz. , jump into the cataract and float down to the point of the island . The inhabitants of the countries bordering on the Nile are great swimmers , and the Nubians are perhaps the best of all ; but this was no great feat . The great and everto-be-lamented Sam Patch would have made the Nubians stare , and shown them , in his own pithy phrase ' that some folks could do things as well as other folks ; ' and I question if there is a cataract on the Nile at which that daring diver would not have turned up his nose in scorn . We returned by the same way we had come , and under the same guidance , augmented , however , /z/ by a motley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our escort . In paying for the boat we showed a preference for our little boy , which brought down upon him all the rest , and he had to run to us for protection . We saved him for the present , but left him exposed to one of the evils attendant upon the acquisition of money all the world over , the difficulty of keeping it , which difficulty , in his case , was so great physically , that I have no doubt he was stripped of more than half before we were out of sight . Getting rid of them , or as many of them as we could , we again mounted our shaggy donkeys , and rode to the Island of PhilcB . This island makes one of the most beautiful pictures I ever saw . Perhaps the general monotony of the scenery on the Nile gives it a peculiar beauty ; but I think it would be called beautiful anywhere even among the finest scenes in Italy . It brought forcibly to my mind , but seemed to me far more lovely than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isola Madre . It is entirely unique , a beautiful lusus naturae , a little island about a thousand feet long and four hundred broad , rising in the centre of a circular bay , which appears to be cut off from the river , and forms a lake surrounded by dark sandstone rocks ; carpeted with green to the water 's edge , and covered with columns , propylons , and towers , the ruins of a majestic temple . A sunken wall en  --  /z/ circles it on all sides , on which , in a few moments we landed . I have avoided description of ruins when I could . The fact is I know nothing of architecture and never measured anythuig in my life ; before I came to Egypt I could not tell the difference between a dromos and a propylon , and my whole knowledge of Egyptian antiquities was little more than enough to enable me to distinguish between a mummy and a pyramid . I picked up about enough on the spot to answer my purpose ; but I have too much charity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , I have already forgotten more than half of the little that I then learned , and I should show but a poor return for his kindness if I were to puzzle him with the use or misuse of technical phrases . Still I must do something ; the temples of Egypt must have a place here ; for I might as well leave out Jerusalem in the story of a tour through the HcdyLand . The temple of Philoe is a magnificent ruin , four hundred and thirty-five feet in length , and ( me hundred and five in width . It stands at the aouth-west comer of the island , close upon the bank of the river , and the approach to it is by a grand colonnade , extending two hundred and forty feet along the edge of the river to the grand propylon* The propylon is nearly a hundred feet long , and rises on each side the gateway g5 /z/ in two lofty towers , in the form of a truncated pyramid . The front is decorated with sculpture and hieroglyphics ; on eadi side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon over her head , and near the front formerly stood two obelisks and two sphinxes , the pedestals and ruins of which still remain . The body of the temple contains eleven chambers , covered with sculpture and hieroglyphics , the figures tinted in the most lively colours , and the ceiling painted azure and studded with stars . But there are other things which touch the beholder more nearly than the majestic ruins of the temple ; things which carry him from the works of man to a grander and higher subject , that of man himself . On the lofty towers in front of the temple , among the mysterious and unknown writings of the Egyptians , were inscriptions in Greek and Latin , telling that they whose names were there written had come to worship the great goddess Isis ; that men had lived and looked upon the sun , moon , and stars , the mountains and the rolling river , and worshipped a mute idol ! And again , on the front wall was the sacred Gross , the emblem of the Ghristian faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plastered over , showing that another race had been there to worship , who scorned and trampled on the gods of the heathen . And again there was an inscription of later days , that in the /z/ ruins of the temple carried with it a wild and fearful interest ; telling that the thunder of modam war had been heard above the roar of the cataract , and that the arm of the soldier , which had struck terror in the frozen regions of the north , had swept the burning sands of Af rica  - -  In the grand propylon , among the names of tourists and travellers , in a small plain hand , is written  --  " L'an 6 de la rpublique , le 13 Messidor , une arme Franfaise , commandee par Buonaparte , est descendue k Alexandrie ; I'armee ayant mis , vingt jours aprs , les Mamelukes en fuite aux pyramides , Dessaiz , commandant la premiere divisioi ) , les a poursuivi , au des cataractes , oii il est arriv6 le 13 Ventose , de Fan 7 . " Near this was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest : the name of an early friend ,  --  C3 B , U. S. of America , " written with his own hand . I did not know that be had been here , although I knew he had been many years from home , and I had read in a newspaper that he had died in Palestine . A thousand recollections crowded upon me , of joys departed , never to return , and made me sad . I wrote my name under his , and left the temple . I was glad to get back to my rascally donkey . If a man were oppressed and borne down with mental anxiety , if he were mourning and melancholy , either from the loss of a friend or an un* digested dinner , I would engage to cure him . I /z/ would put him on a donkey without saddle or halter , and if he did not find himself by degrees drawn from the sense of his misery , and worked up into a towering passion , getting off and be labouring his brute with his stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ass , and his own folly in attempting to ride one , man is a more quiet animal than I take him to be . As I intended going the next day up the cataracts with my companions , and expected to spend the day on board their boat , I had asked them to dine with me in the evening . After giving the invitation , I held a council with Paul , who told me that the thing was impossible , and , with a prudence worthy of Caleb Balderstone , expressed his wonder that I had not worked an invitation out of them . I told him , however , that the thing was settled , and dine with me they must . My housekeeping had never been very extravagant , and macaroni , rice , and fowl had been my standing dishes . Paul was pertinacious in raising objections , but I told him peremptorily there was no escape ; that he must buy a cow or a camel , if necessary , and left him scratching his head and pondering over the task before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had entirely forgotten Paul and his perplexities . Once only , I remember , with a commendable prudence , I tried to get my companions to expend some of their /q/ force upon dried dates and Nubian bread , which they as maliciously declined , that they might do justice to me . Returning now , at the end of nine hours ' bard work , crossing rivers and rambling among ruins , the sharp exercise , and the grating of my teeth at the stubborn movements of my donkey , gave me an extraordinary voracity , and dinner , the all-important , never-to-be-forgotten , business of the day , the delight alike of the ploughman and philosopher , dinner , with its uncertain goodness , began to press upon the most tender sensibilities of my nature . My companions fdt the vibrations of the same chord , and , with an unnecessary degree of circumstance , talked of the effect of air and exercise in sharpening the appetite and the glorious satisfaction , after a days work , of sitting down to a good dinner . I had perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to have some misgivings . I felt a hungry devil within me , that roared as if he would never be satisfied . I looked at my companions , and heard them talk ; and , as I followed their humour with an hysteric laugh , I thought the genius of famine was at my heels in the shape of two hungry Englishmen . I trembled for Paul , but the first glimpse I caught of him reassured me . He sat on the deck of the boat , with his arms folded , coolly , though with an air of conscious importance , looking out for us . Slowly and with dignity he came to assist us from our /z/ accursed donkeys ; neither a smile nor frown was on his face , but there reigned an expression that you could not mistake . Reader you have seen the countenance of a good man lighted up with the consciousness of having done a good action ; even so was PauFs . I could read in his a consciousness of having acted well his part . One might almost have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face could speak , one , two , three , four , five courses and a dessert , or , as they say at the tifofranc restaurants in Paris , Quatre plats , une demi bouteilie de vin , et pain a discretion . In fact , the worthy butler of Ravenswood could not have stood in the hall of his master in the days of its glory , before thunder broke duna and soured buttermilk , with more sober and con* ' * scious dignity than did Paul stand on the deck of my boat to receive us . A load was removed from my heart . I knew that my credit was saved , and I led the way with a proud step to my little cabin . Still I asked no questions and made no apologies . I simply told my companions we were in PauPs hands , and he would do with us as seemed to him good . Another board had been added to my table , and my towel had been washed and dried during the day , and now lay , clean and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table-cloth . I noticed , tod , tumblers , knives and forks , and plates , which were strangers to me , but I said nothing ; we seated ourselves and waited , /z/ nor did we wait loDg ; soon we saw Paul coming towards us , staggering under the weight of his burden , the savoury odour of which preceded him . He entered and laid before us an Iridi stew . Reader , did you ever eit an Irish stew ? Gracious Heaven ! I shall never forget that pu'agon of dishes ; how often in the desert , among the mountains of Sinai , in the Holy Land , rambUng along the valley of Jehoshaphat , or on the shores of the Dead Sea , how often has that Irish stew risen before me to tease and tantalize me , and haunt me with the memory of departed joys I The potato is a vegetable that does not grow in Egypt* I had not tasted one for more than a month , and was almost startled out of my propriety at seeing them ; but I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul himself . Without much ceremony we threw ourselves with one upon the stew . I think I only do our party justice when I say that few of those famished gentlemen , from whose emerald isle it takes its name could have shown more affection for the national dish . For my own part , as I did not know what was coming next , if anything , I felt loath to part with it . My companions were knowing ones , and seemed to be of the same way of thinking , and , without any consultation , all appeared to be approaching the same end , to wit , the end of the stew . With the empty dish before him , demonstrative to Paul that so far we were per- /z/ fectly satisfied with what he had done , that worthy purveyor came forward with an increase of dignity to change our plates . I now saw that something more was coming . I had suspiected from the beginning that Paul was in the mutton line , and involuntarily murmured , * This day a sheep has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murdered innocent , in cutlets , accompanied by fried potatoes . Then came boiled mutton and boiled potatoes , and then roast mutton and roast potatoes , and then came a macaroni pate . I thought this was going to damn the whole ; until this I had considered the dinner as something extraordinary and recherch6 . But the macaroni , the thing of at least six days in the week , utterly disconcerted me . I tried to give Paul a wink to keep it back , but on he came ; if he had followed with a chicken , I verily believe I should have thrown it at his head . But my friends were unflinching and uncompromising . They were de ? termined to cftand by Paul to the last , and we laid in the macaroni pat6 with as much vigour as if we had not already eaten a sheep . Paul wound us up and packed us down with pancakes . I never knew a man that did not like pancakes , or who could not eat them even at the end of a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulness which puts a man above kings , princes , or pachas , we lighted our long pipes and smoked . Our stomachs were full and our hearts /q/ were open . Talk of mutual sympathy , of congenial spirits , of similarity of tastes , and all that ; t is the dinner which unlocks the heart ; you feel yourself warming towards the man that has dined with you . It was in this happy spirit that we lay like warriors , resting on our arms , and talked oyer the particulars of our battle . And now , all dignity put aside and all restraint removed , and thinking my friends might have recognised acquaintances among the things at the table which were strangers to me , and thinking , too , that I stood on a pinnacle , and , come what might , I could not fall , I led the way in speculating upon the manner in which Paul had served us . The ice once broken , my friends solved many of the mysteries , by claiming this , that , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were going on most unscrupulously , making it somewhat doubtful whether I had furnished anything for my own dinner , and I called in Paul . But that functionary had no desire to be questioned ; he hemmed , and hawed , and dodged about ; but I told him to make a clean heart of it , and then it came out , but it was like drawing teeth , that he had been on a regular foraging expedition among their stores . The potatoes with which he had made such a flourish were part of a very small stock furnished them by a fiiend , as a luxury not to be had on the Nile ; and , instead of the acknowledgments /z/ which I expected to receive on account of mjr dinner , my friends congratulated me rather ironically upon possessing such a treasure of a steward . We sat together till a late hour ; were grave , gay , laughing , and lachrymose by turns ; and when we began to doze over our pipes , betook ourselves to slumber . /z/ Ascent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A Nubian DamseFs Wardrobe .  --  A test of Friendship .  --  East and West .  --  Moonlight on the Nile .  - -  Uses of a Temple . In the morning we were up betimes , expecting another stirring day in mounting the cataracts . Carrying boats up and down the rapids is the great business of the Nubians who live on the borders of Egypt . It is a business that requires great knowledge and address ; and the rais who commands the large squad of men necessary to mount a boat is an important person among them . He was already there with part of his men , the others being stationed among the islands of the cataracts , at the places where their services would be needed . This rais was one of the most noble-looking men I ever saw . He was more than eighty , a native of Barbary , who had in early life wandered with a caravan across the Libyan Desert , and been left , he knew not why , on a little island among the Cataracts of th Nile . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddling with his hands , he had /z/ floated in every eddy , and marked every stone that the falling river lays bare to the eye ; and now , with the experience of years he stood among the Nubians confessedly one of their most skilful pilots through a difficult and sometimes dangerous navigation . He was tall and thin , with a beard of uncommon length and whiteness , a face dried , scarred , and wrinkled , and dark as it could be without having the blackness of a negro . EUs costume was a clean white turban , red jacket , and red sash , with white trousers , red slippers , and a heavy club fastened by a string around his wrist . I am particular in describing the appearance of the hardy old man , for we were exceedingly struck with it . Nothing could be finer than his look , his walk , his every movement ; and the picturesque effect was admirably heightened by contrast with his swarthy assistants , most of whom were desperately ragged , and many of them as naked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dignity that savoured more of a youth passed amid the polish of a European court , than on the sands of Barbary , or the rude islands of the Nile . We received him as if he had been the great Pacha himself , gave him coffee and pipes , and left him to the greatest luxury of the East , perfect rest , until his services should be required . In the mean time , with a strong and favourable wind , we started from the little harbour of /q/ Assouan , while a throng of idlers , gathered together on the beach , watched our departure with as much interest as though it were not an event of almost daily occurrence . Almost immediately above Assouan the view extends over a broad surface , and the rocks and islands begin to multiply . The strong wind enabled us to ascend some distance with the sails ; but our progress gradually diminished , and at length , while our sails were yet filled almost to bursting , we came to a dead stand , struggled vainly for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old rais , who had sat quietly watching the movements of the boat , now roused himself ; and at his command , a naked Nubian , with a rope over his shoulders , plunged into the river and swam for the shore . At first he swam boldly add vigorously ; but soon his strength began to fail , and the weight of the slackened rope effectually stopped his progress ; when , resting for a little space , he dived like a duck , kicking his heels in the air , came up clear of the rope , and sooned gained the bank . A dozen Nubians now threw themselves into the water , caught the sinking rope , carried it ashore , and wound it round a rock . Again the rais spoke , and fifty swarthy bodies were splashing in the water , and in a moment more they were on the rocky bank , hauling upon the rope ; others joined them , but where they came from nobody could see ; and by the /z/ strength of a hundred men , all pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the first cataract . Above this the passage became more difficult , and the old rais seemed to rise in spirit and energy with the emergency . As we approached the second cataract half a dozen ropes were thrown out , and the men seemed to multiply as if by magic , springing up among the rocks like a parcel of black river-gods . More than two hundred of them were hauling on the ropes at once , climbing over the rocks , descending into the river , and again mounting , with their naked bodies shining in the sun , all talking , tugging , ordering , and shouting together ; and among them , high above the rest , was heard the clear voice of the rais ; his noble figure , too , was seen , now scramblii along the base of a rock , now standing on its summit , his long arms thrown above his head , his white beard and ample dress streaming m the wind , until the inert mass had triumphed over the rushing river ; when he again took his seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe forgot the animating scene that for a moment had cheated him back to youth . At this season there was in no place a fall of more than two feet ; though the river , breaking among the almost innumerable rocks and islands hurried along with great violence and rapidity . In the midst of the most furious rushing of the /q/ waters , adding much to the striking wildness of the scene , were two figures , with their clothes tied above their heads , sitting upon the surface of the water apparently , and floating as if by a miraclew They were a man and his wife , crossing from one of the islands ; their bark a log , with a bundle of corn-stalks on each side ; too frail to support their weight , yet strong enough to keep them from sinking . And now all was over ; we had passed the cataracts , catching our dinner at intervals as we came up . We had wound round the beautiful Island of Philce , and the boat had hauled up alongside the bank to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my former loneliness had come and I felt my courage failing . I verily believe that if my own boat had been above the cataracts , I should have given up my own project and accompanied my English friends . Paul was even more reluctant to part than his master . He had never travelled except with a party where the other servants and dragomen were company for him , and after these chance encounters he was for a while completely prostrated . The moment of parting came and passed ; warm adieus were exchanged , and , with Paul and my own rais for company , I set out on foot for Assouan . Directly opposite the Island of Philoe is a sto  - -  ping- place for boats , where dates , the great pro- /z/ duce of Upper Egypt , are brought in large quantities , and deposited preparatory to being sent down to Cairo . All along the upper part of the Nile the palm-tree had become more plentiful , and here it was the principal and almost only product of the country . Its value is inestimable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upper Egypt ; and so well is this value known , and so general is the progress of the country in European improvements , that every tree pays an annual tax to the great reformer . The Nubian is interesting in his appearance and character ; his figure is tall , thin , sinewy , and graceful , possessing what would be called in civilized life an uncommon degree of gentility ; his face is rather dark , though far removed from African blackness ; his features are long and aquiline , decidedly resembling the Roman ; the expression of his face mild , amiable , and approach ing to melancholy . I remember having thought , when reading Sir Walter Scotts Crusaders , that the metamorphosis of Kenneth into a Nubian was strained and improbable , as I did not then understand the shades of difference in the features and complexion of the inhabitants of Africa ; but observation has shown me that it was my own ignorance that deceived me ; and in this , as in othar descriptions of Eastern scenes , I have been forced to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unequalled novelist , and his truth and liveliness of description . The inhabitants of Nubia , like all who come under the rod of the Pacha , suffer the accumulated ills of poverty . Happily , they live in a country where their wants are few ; the sun warms them , and the palm-tree feeds and clothes them . The use of fire-arms is almost unknown , and their weapons are still the spear and shield , as in ages long past In the upper part of Nubia the men and women go entirely naked , except a piece of leather about six inches wide , cut in strings , and tied about their loins ; and even here , on the confines of Egypt , at least one half of the Nubians appear in the same costume . I do not know what has made me introduce these remarks upon the character and manners of the Nubians here , except it be to pave the way for the incidents of my walk down to Assouan . Wishing to get rid of my unpleasant feelings at parting with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large heavy clubs , made of the palm-tree which every Nubian carries , and bought what a Kentuckian would call a screamer , or an Irishman a toothpick ; a large round club , about two inches in diameter , which seldom left my hand till I lost it in the Holy Land . Then seeing a Nubian riding backward and forward on a dromedary , showing his paces like a jockey at a horse-market , I began to bargain for him . I vot . I. H /z/ mounted him ( the time I had mounted a dromedary ) , and as I expected to have considerable use for him , and liked his paces , I was on the point of buying him , but was prevented by the sudden reflection that I had no means of getting him down to Cairo . My next essay was upon more delicate grounds I began to bargain for the costume of a Nubian lady , and , to use an expressive phrase , though in this case not literally true , I bought it off her back . One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of ladies ' costumes , and , to a man curious in those things , it struck me that nothing could be more curious than this . One of the elements of beauty is said to be simplicity ; and if this be not a mere poetical fiction , and beauty when unadorned in really adorned the most , then was the young Nubian girl whose dress I bought adorned in every per-* fection . In fact , it was impossible to be more simple , without going back to the origin of all dress , the simple fig-leaf . She was not more than sixteen , with a sweet mild face , and a figure that the finest lady might be proud to exhibit in its native beauty : every limb charmingly rounded , and every muscle finely developed . It would have been a burning shame to put such a figure into frock , petticoat , and the other et ceteras of a lady 's dress . I now look back upon this , and many other scenes , as strange , of which I thought /q/ ttothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armity . I remember , however , though I thought Bothing of seeing women all but naked , that at first I did fee ) somewhat delicate in attempting to bay the few inches that constituted the young girl 's wardrobe . Paul had no such scruples , and I found , too , that , as in the road to vice , * ce Dest que le premier pas qui codte . ' ' In short , I bought it , and have it with me , and to the curious in such matters I have no hesitation in saying , that the costume of a Nubian lady is far more curious than anything to be found in Italy , and would make a decided sensation at a masquerade or fancy ball . It was nearly dark , when , from the ruined height of the old city of Assouan , I saw my little boat with the flag of my country , and near it , hardly less welcome to my eyes , the red-cross banner of England . The sight of these objects , assisted by my multifarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parting from my friends ; - and I went on board the English boat , hoping to find a party with which I had partially arranged to set out from Cairo , and which I was every day expecting . I was disappointed , however ; but found a gentleman to whom I was then a stranger , the English consul at Alexandria . He had been eighteen years in the country , closely devoted to his public and private duties , without ever having been in Upper Egypt . On the point h2 /z/ of returning home , to enjoy in his own country and among his own people the fruits of his honourable labours , he had now for the first time ascended the Nile . He was accompanied by his daughter , who had reigned as a belle and beauty in the ancient city of Cleopatra , and her newlymarried husband . Coming from home , their boat was furnished and fitted up with all kinds of luxuries . Their tea-table , in particular , made such a strong impression on me , that when I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board their boat regularly about the time for the evening meal . I was exceedingly pleased with Mr. T. ; so much so , that at Thebes , I gave him the strongest mark of it a man could give , I borrowed money of him ; and I have reason to remember his kindness in relieving me from a situation which might have embarrassed me . Early the next morning the sails were already loosed and the stake pulled up , when Paul , from the bank , cried out , * A sail ! and , looking down the river , I saw a boat coming up , and again the English flag . I furled my sails , fastened the stake , and waited till she came up , and found the party I had expected . I went on board and breakfasted with them . They had started from Cairo on the same day with me ; but with their large boats could not keep up with me against the wind . They bad heard of me along the river ; and , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waiting to see them off for the Uand of Philoe , and bidding them good-bye until we should meet at Thebes , I returned to my boat , and letting fall the sails , before they were out of sight was descending the Nile . My face was now turned towards home . Thousands of miles , it is true , were between us ; but I was on the bosom of a mighty river , which was carrying me to the mightier ocean , and the waves that were rolling by my side were rapidly hurrying on , and might one day wash the shores of my native land . It was a beautiful prospect , I had before me now . I could lie on the deck of my boat , and float hundreds of miles , shooting at crocodiles , or I could go ashore and ramble among modem villages , and the ruins of ancient cities , and all the time , I thought , I would be advancing on my journey . Before night , however , the wind was blowing dead ahead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our oars . But it was all of no use ; our boat was blown along like a feather ; carried around , backward and forward , across the river , zigzag , and at last fairly driven up the stream . With great difficulty we worked down to Ombos ; and here , under the ruins of an ancient temple , part of which had already fallen into the river , we hauled up to the bank , and , in company with half a dozen Arab boats , lay by till morning . Man is a gregarious animaL My boatmen aU qwq At daylight I had mounted the bank , and wais groping among the ruins of the temple . The portico fronting the river is a noble ruin , nearly a /q/ himdred feet in length , with three rows of colunins five in each row , thirty feet high , and ten feet io diameter at the base . The principal figure on the walls is Osiris , with a crocodile head , and the sacred tau ip his hand . The Ombites were distinguished for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated to that bestial god : among the ruios are still to be seen the wall on which the sacred animal was led in religious procession , and the tank in which he was bathed . Towards noon we were approaching Hadjar Silsily , or the Rock of the Chain , the narrowest part of the river , bounded on each side by ranges of sandstone mountains . On the eastern side are andent quarries of great extent , with the same appearance of freshness as at Assouan . Nothing is known of the history of these quarries ; but they seem to have furnished material enough for all the cities on the Nile , as well as the temples and monuments that adorn them . Whole mountains have been cut away ; and while the solitary traveller walks among these deserted workshops , and looks at the smooth sides of the mountains , and the fragments of unfinished work around him , he feels a respect for the people who have passed away greater than when standing among the ruins of thdr mighty temples ; for here he has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gross and disgusting purposes to which that industry was prostituted . The roads /z/ worn in the stone by the ancient carriage-wheels are still to be seen , and somewhere among these extensive quarries travellers have found an unfinished sphinx . I remember one place where there was an irregular range of unfinished doors , which might well have been taken for the work of beginners , practising under the eyes of their masters . Paul took a philosophic and familiar view of them , and said that it seemed as if , while the men were at work , the boys playing around had taken up the toolsj and amused themselves by cutting these doors . On the opposite side , too , are quarries , and several ranges of tombs , looking out on the river , excavated in the solid rock , with pillars in front , and images of deities in the recesses for the altars . I remember a beautiful chamber overhanging the river like a balcony . It had been part of a temple or perhaps a tomb . We thought of stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our want of provisions was somewhat of an impediment . At about four o'clock we saw at a distance the minaret of Edfou . There was no wind , the men were gently pulling at the oars , and I took one myself , much to the uneasiness of the rais , who thought I was dissatisfied . Sloth forms so proininent a feature in the composition of the Orientals , and quiet is so material an item in their ideas if enjoyment , , that they can not conceive why a /q/ man should walk when he can stand , why he should stand when he can sit , or , in short , why he should do anything when he can sit still and do nothing . It was dark before we arrived at Edfou . I mean it was that period of time when , by Nature 's laws , it should be dark ; that is , the day had end ed , the sun had set with that rich and burning lustre which attends his departing glories nowhere but in Egypt , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nile . But it was a moon that lighted up all nature with a paler , purer , and more lovely light ; a moon that would have told secrets ; a moon  --  a moon  --  in short , a moon whose light enabled one to walk over fields without stumbling , and this was , at the moment , the principal consideration with me . Edfou lies about a mile from the bank of the river , and , taking Paul and one of the Arabs with me , I set off to view the temple by moonlight . The town , as usual , contained mud houses , many of them in ruins , a mosque , a bath , bazaars , the usual apolgy for a palace , and more than the usual quantity of ferocious dogs ; and at one comer of this miserable place stands one of the magnificent temples of the Nile . The propylon , its lofty proportions enlarged by the light of the moon , was the most grand and imposing portal I saw in Egypt . From a base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it risei on each h5 /z/ side the gate , in the form of a truncated pyramid , to the height of a hundred feet , gradually narrowing till at the top it measures seventy-five feet in length and eighteen in breadth . Judge , then , what was the temple to which this formed merely the entrance ; and this was far from being one of the largest temples of Egypt . It measured , however , four hundred and forty feet in length and two hundred and twenty in breadth , about equal to the whole space occupied by St. PauFs churchy yard . Its dromos , pronaos , columns , and capitals all correspond , and enclosing it is a high wall , still in a state of perfect preservation . I walked round it twice , and , by means of the wall erected to exclude the unhallowed gaze of the stranger , I looked down upon the interior of the temple . Built by the Egyptians for the highest uses to which a building could be dedicated , for the worship of their gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and storehouse . The portico and courtyard , and probably the interior chambers , were filled with grain . A guard was stationed to secure it against the pilfering Arabs ; and , to secure the fidelity of the guard himself , he was locked in at sunset , and the key left with the governor . The lofty entrance was closed by a wooden door ; the vigilant guard was already asleep , and we were obliged to knock some time before we could wake him . It was a novel and extraordinary scene , our /q/ parley with the guard at the door of the temple . We were standing under the great propylon , mere insects at the base of the lofty towers ; behind us at a little distance sat a group of the miserable villagers , and leaning against a column in the porch of the temple was the indistinct figure of the guard , motionless , and answering in a low deep tone , like an ancient priest delivering the answers of the oracles . By the mellow light of the moon everything seemed magnified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the miserable huts around it still more miserable , and the past glory and the present ruin of this once most favoured land rushed upon me with a force I had not felt even at the foot of the pyramids . If the temple of that little unknown city now stood in Hyde Park or the garden of the Tuileries , France , England , all Europe would gaze upon it with wonder and admiration ; and when thousands of years shall have rolled away , and they too shall have fallen , ther wiU be no monument in those proudest of modern cities , like this in the little town of Edfou , to raise its majestic head and tell the passing travel* ler the story of their former greatness . Some of the Arabs proposed to conduct me to the interior , through a passage opening from the ruined huts on the top ; but , after searching a while , the miserable village could not produce a candle , torch , or taper to light the way . But I /z/ did not care much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressions and general effect of that moonlight scene ; and though in this , as in other things , I subject myself to the imputation of having been but a superficial observer , I would not exchange the lively recollection of that night for the most accurate knowledge of every particular stone in the whole temple . I returned to my boat , and , to the surprise of my rais , ordered him to pull up stake and drop down the river . I intended to drop down about two hours to Elythias , or , in Arabic , Elkob . No one on board knew where it was , and , tempted by the mildness and beauty of the night , I stayed on deck till a late hour . Several times we saw fires on the banks , where Arab boatmen were passing the night , and hailed them , but no one knew the place ; and though seeking and inquiring of those who had spent all their lives on the banks of the river , we passed , without knowing it , a.city which once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the traces of a road to the emerald mines and the fallen city of Berenice are still to be seen , and the ruins of whose temples , with the beautiful paintings in its tombs , excite the admiration of every traveller . We continued descending with the current all night , and in the morning I betook myself to my old sport of shooting at crocodiles and pelicans . At about eleven o'clock we arrived at Esneh , the /q/ ancient Latopolis , so called from the worship of a fish ) now containing fifteen hundred or two thousand inhabitants . Here , too , the miserable subjects of the Pacha may turn from the contemplation of their degraded state to the greatness of those who have gone before them . In the centre of the village , almost buried by the accumulation of sand from the desert and the ruins of Arab huts , is another magnificent temple . The street is upon a level with the roof , and a hole has been dug between two columns , so as to give entrance to the interior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation at the barbarity of converting the wonderful remains of Egyptian skill and labour to the meanest uses ; and , descending between the excavated columns , finds himself , without any feeling of surprise , in a large cleared space , filled with grain , earthern jars , and Arabs . The gigantic columns , with their lotusleaved capitals , are familiar things ; but , among the devices on the ceiling , his wandering eye is fixed by certain mysterious characters , which have been called the signs of the zodiac , and from which speculators in science have calculated that the temple was built more than six thousand years ago , before the time assigned by the Mosaic account as the beginning of the world . But this little town contains objects of more interest than the ruin of a heathen temple ; for here , among the bigoted followers of Mohammed , /z/ dwell fifty or sixty Christian families ; being the last in Eg3rpt , and standing on the very outposts of the Christian world . They exhibited , however , a melancholy picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scowling Arab , and , as Paul said , looked more like a robber than a pastor . He followed us for buck* sheesh , and , attended by a crowd of boys , we went to the house of the bishop . This bishop , as he is styled by courtesy , is a miserable-looking old man ; he told us he had charge of the two churches at Esneh , and of all the Christians in the world beyond it to the south . His flock consists of about two hundred , poor wanderers from the true principles of Christianity and knowing it only as teaching them to make the sign of the cross , and to call upon the Son , and Virgin , and a long calendar of saints . Outride the door of the church was a school ; a parcel of dirty boys sitting on the ground , under the shade of some palm-trees , with a more dirty blind man for their master , who seemed to be at the work of teaching because he was not fit for anything else . I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the presence of the haughty Mussulmans , to recognise the ignorant and degraded objects around me as my Christian brethren . /z/ /q/ /z/ Thebesy its Temples and great Ruins .  --  The Obelisk of Luxor , now of Paris .  --  An Avenue of Sphinxes.  --  Camac.  --  The Mummy-pits.  --  The Tombs of the Kings .  --  The Memnonium . It was nearly noon , when , with a gentle breeze , we dropped into the harbour of Thebes . The sun was beating upon it with meridian splendour ; the inhabitants were seeking shelter in their miserable huts from its scorching rays , and when we made fast near the remains of the ancient port , to which , more than thirty centuries ago , the Egyptian boatman tied his boat , a small group of Arabs , smoking under the shade of some palm-trees on a point above , and two or three stragglers who came down to the bank to gaze at us , were the only living beings we beheld in a city which had numbered its millions . When Greece was just emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rome was known , Egypt was far advanced in science and the arts , and Thebes the most magnificent city in the world . But the Assyrian came and overthrew for ever the throne of the Pharaohs . The Persian war-cry rang through the crowded streets of Thebes , Cambyses /z/ laid his destroying hands upon the temples of its gods , and a greater* than Babylon the Great fell to rise no more . The ancient city was twenty-three miles in circumference . The valley of the Nile was not large enough to contain it , and its extremities rested upon the bases of the mountains of Arabia and Africa . The whole of this great extent is more or less strewed with ruins , broken columns , and avenues of sphinxes , colossal figures , obelisks , pyramidal gateways , porticoes , blocks of polished granite , and stones of extraordinary magnitude , while above them , ** in all the nakedness of desolation , " the colossal skeletons of giant temples are standing *in the unwatered sands , in solitude and silence . They are neither grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no rank grass or mantling ivy to robe them and conceal their deformities . Like the bones of man , they seem to whiten under the sun of the desert . The sand of Africa has been their most fearful enemy ; blown upon them for more than three thousand years , it has buried the largest monuments , and ) in some instances , almost entire temples . At this day the temples of Thebes are known almost everywhere , by the glowing reports of travellers . Artists have taken drawings of all their minute details , and I shall refer to them very briefly . On the Arabian side of the Nile are the great temples of Luxor and Garnac . The /z/ /q/ temple of Luxor stands near the bank of the river , built there , is supposed , for the convenience of the Egyptian boatmen . Before the magnificent gateway of this temple , until within a few years , stood two lofty obelisks , each a single block of red granite , more than eighty feet high , covered with sculpture and hieroglyphics fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them has been lately taken down by the French , and at this moment rears its daring summit to the skies in the centre of admiring Paris ; the other is yet standing on the spot where it was first erected . Between these and the grand propylon are two colossal statues with mitred head-dresses , also single blocks of granite , buried to the chest by sand , but still rising more than twenty feet above die ground . The grand propylon is a magnificent gateway , more than two hundred feet in length at its present base , and more than sixty feet above the sand* The whole front is covered with sculpture ; the battle-scenes of an Egyptian warrior , designed and executed with extraordinary force and spirit . In one compartment the hero is represented advancing at the head of his forces , and breaking through the ranks of the enemy ; then standing , a colossal figure , in a car drawn by two fiery horses , with feathers waving over their heads , the reins tied round his body , his bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead and I6e INCIDENTS OF TKAYSL. wounded lying under the wheels of his car and the hoofc of his horses . In another place seTeral ears are seen in full speed for the walls of a town , fugitives passing a rtrer , horses , chmriota , and men struggling to readi the opposite bank , whOe the hero , hurried impetuously beyond the rank ol his own followers , is standing alone among the sbdn and wounded who have fiedlen under his formidaUe arm . At the farthest extremity he is sitting on a throne as a conqueror , with a soqpt in his hand , a row of the jNrincipal captives before him , eadi with a rope around bis neck ; erne with outstretched hands imploring pity , and anoth. on his knees to receive the blow of the executioner , while above is the vanquished monarch , with his hands tied to a car , about to grace the triumph of the conqueror . Passing this magnificent entrance , the risiter enters the dromos , or large open court , surround** ed by a ruined portico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hieroglyphics ; and , working his way over heaps of rubbish and Arab huts , among stately columns twelve feet in diameter , and between thirty and forty feet in height , with spreading capitals resembling the budding lotus , some broken , some prostrate , some half buried , and some lofty and towering as when they were erected , at the distance of six hundred feet reaches the sanctuary of the temple  --  But great and magnificent as was the temple of /q/ Luxor , it served but as a portal to the greater Cammc . Standing neariy two miles from Luxor , the whole road to it was lined with rows of sphinxes eadi of a solid block of granite . At this end they are broken , and , for the most part , buried under the sand and heaps of rubbish . But , approaching Camac , they stand entire , still and solemn as when the ancient Egyptian passed between them to worship in the great temple of Ammon . Four grand propylons terminate this smiue of sphinxes , and , passing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belsmii remarks of the ruins of Thebes generally , that he felt as if he was in a city of giants ; and no man can look upon the ruins of Camac without feeling humbled by the greatness of a people who have passed away for ever . The western entrance , facing the temple of Northern Dair on the opposite side of the river , also approached between tind rows of sphinxes , is a magnificent propylon four hundred feet long and forty feet in thickness . In the language of Dr. Richardson , Uooking forward from the centre of this gateway , the vast scene of havoc and destruction presents itself in all the extent of this immense temple , with its columns , and walls , and immense propylons , all prostrate in one heap of ruins , looking as if the thunders of heaven had smitten it at the command of an insulted 6od . The field of ruins is about a mile in diameter ; /z/ the temple itself twelve hundred feet long and four hundred and twenty broad . It has twelve principal entrances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as across the plain from Luxor , and each is composed of propylons , gateways , and other buildings , in themselves larger than most other temples ; the sides of some of them are equal to the bases of most of the pyra mids , and on each side of many are colossal statues , some sitting , others erect , from twenty to thirty feet in height . In front of the body of the temple is a large court , with an immense colonnade on each side , of thirty columns in length , and through the middle two rows of columns fifty feet in height ; then an immense portico , the roof supported by one hundred and thirty-four columns , from twenty-six to thirty-four feet in circumference . Next were four beautiful obelisks , more than seventy feet high , three of which are still standing ; and then the sanctuary , consisting of an apartment twenty feet square , the walls and ceiling of large blocks of highly-polished granite , the ceiling studded with stars on a blue ground , and the walls covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious uses of this sacred chamber , and showing the degrading character of the Egyptian worship . Beyond this is another colonnade , and again porticoes and walls to another /q/ propyloD , at a distance of two thousand feet from the western extremity of the temple . But these are not half of the ruins of Thebes . On the western side of the besides others prostrate and nearly buried under the sands , but the traces of which are still visible , the temples of Gomou , Northern Dair , Dair-el-Medinet , the Memnonium , and Medinet Abou , with their columns , and sculpture , and colossal figures , still raise their giant skeletons above the sands . Volumes have been written upon them , and volumes may yet be written , and he that reads all will still have but an imperfect idea of the ruins of Thebes . I will only add , that all these temples were connected by long avenues of sphinxes , statues , propylons , and colossal figures , and the reader 's imagination will work out the imposing scene that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when , with all the gorgeous ceremonies of pagan idolatry , the priests , bearing the sacred image of their god , and followed by thousands of the citizens , made their annual procession from temple to temple , and , with harps , and cymbals , and songs of rejoicing , ' ' brought back their idol and replaced him in his shrine in the grand temple at Carnac . The rambler among the ruins of Thebes will often ask himself , " Where are the palaces of the kings , and princes , and people who worship- /z/ ped in these mighty temples ? With the devout though degraded spirit of religion that possessed the Egyptians , they seem to have paid but little regard to their earthly habitations ; their temples and their tombs were the principal objects ! that engrossed the thoughts of this extraordinary people . It has been well said of them that they regarded the habitations of the living merely as temporary resting-places , while the tombs were regarded as permanent and eternal mansions ; and while not a vestige of a habitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of splendour and magnificence , perhaps even more wonderful than the ruins of their temples . Clinging to the cherished doctrine of the metempsychosis , the immortal part , on leaving its earthly tenement , was supposed to become a wandering , migratcH'y spirit , giving life and vitality to some bird of the air , some beast of the field , or some fish of the sea , waiting for a regeneration in the natural body . And it was of the very essence of this faith to inculcate a pious regard for the security and preservation of the dead . The whole mountain-side on the western bank of the river is one vast Necropolis . The open doors of tombs are seen in long ranges , and at different elevations , and on the plain large pits have been opened , in which have been found a thousand mummies at a time . For many years , and until a late order of the Pacha preventing it , the Arabs have been /q/ in the habit of rifling the tombs to sell the mummies to travellers . Thousands have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and the bones meet the traveller at every step . The Arabs use the mummy-cases for firewood , the bituminous matters used in the embalment being well adapted to ignition ; and the epicurean traveller may cook his breakfast with the coffin of a king . Notwithstanding the depredations that have been committed , the mummies that have been taken away and scattered all over the world , those that have been burnt , and others that now remain in fragments around the tombs , the numbers yet undisturbed are no doubt infinitely greater ; for the practice of embalming is known to have existed from the earliest periods recorded in the history of Egypt ; and , by a rough computation , founded upon the age , the population of the city , and the average duration of human life , it is supposed that there are from eight to ten millions of mummied bodies in the vast Necropolis of Thebes . Leaving these resting-places of the dead , I turn for one moment to those of more than royal magnificencey called the tombs of the kings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has not seen them can hardly believe in their existence . They lie in the valley of Biban-elMelook , a dark and gloomy opening in the sandstone mountains , about three quarters of an hour /z/ from Gornou . The road to them is over a dreiary waste of sands , and their doors open from the most desolate spot that the imagination can conceive . Diodorus Siculus says that forty-seven of these tombs were entered on the sacred registers of the Egyptian priests , only seventeen of which remained at the time of his visit to Egypt , about sixty years B. C. In our own days , the industry and enterprise of a single individual , the indefatigable Belzoni , have brought to light one that was probably entirely unknown at the time of the Grecian traveller . The entrance is by a narrow door ; a simple excavation in the side of the mountain , without device or ornament . The entrance hall , which is extremely beautiful , is twenty-seven feet long and twenty-five broad , having at the end a large door opening into another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with figures drawn in outline , but perfect as if recently done . Descending a large staircase and passing through a beautiful corridor , Belzoni came to another staircase , at the foot of which he entered another apartment , twenty-four feet by thirteen , and so ornamented with sculpture and paintings that he called it the Hall of Beauty . The sides of all the chambers and corridors are covered with sculpture and paintings ; the colours appearing fresher as the visiter advances towards the interior of the tomb i /q/ and the walls of this chamber are covered with the figures of Eg3rptian gods and goddesses , seeming tp hover round and guard the remains of the honoured dead . Farther on is a large hall , twenty-eight feet long and twenty-seven broad , supported by two rows of square pillars , which Belzoni called the Hall of Pillars ; and beyond this is the entry to a large saloon with a vaulted roof , thirty-two feet in length and twenty-seven in breadth . Opening from this were several other chambers of different dimensions , one of them unfinished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches wide , in which he found the mummy of a bull ; but in the centre of the grand saloon was a sarcophagus of the finest oriental alabaster , only two inches thick , minutely sculptured within and without with several hundred figures , and pefectly transparent when a light was placed within it . All over the corridors and chambers the walls are adorned with sculptures and paintings in intagiio and relief , representing gods , goddesses , and the hero of the tomb in the most prominent events of his life , priests , religious processions and sacrifices , boats and agricultural scenes , and the most familiar pictures of every-day life , in colours as fresh as if they were painted not more than a month ago ; and the large saloon , lighted up with the blaze of our torches , seemed more /z/ fitting for a banqueting-hall , for song and dance , than a burial-place of the dead . All travellers concur in pronouncing the sudden transition from the dreary desert without to these magnificent tombs as operating like a scene of enchantment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belzoni , when , wandering with the excitement of a first discoverer through these beautiful corridors and chambers , he found himself in the great saloon leaning over the alabaster sarcophagus . An old Arab who accompanied us remembered Belzoni , and pointed out a chamber where the fortunate explorer entertained a party of European traveUers who happened to arrive there at that time , making the tomb of Pharaoh* ring with shouts and songs of merriment . At different times I wandered among all these tombs . All were of the same general character ; all possessed the same beauty and magnificence of design and finish , and in all , at the extreme end , was a large saloon , adorned with sculpture and paintings of extraordinary beauty , and containing a single sarcophagus . The kings of the nations did lie in glory , every one in his own house , but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch . " Every sarcophagus is broken , and the bones of the kings of 5gypt scattered . In * Supposed to be the tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I picked up a skull . I mused over it a moment , and handed it to Paul , who moralized at large . ' That man , * said he , once talked , and laughed , and sang , and danced , and ate macaroni . ' Among the paintings on the walls was represented a heap of hands severed from the arms , showing that the hero of the tomb had played the tyrant in his brief hour on earth . I dashed the skull against a stone , broke it in fragments , and pocketed a piece as a memorial of a king . Paul cut off one of the ears , and we left the tomb . Travellers and commentators concur in supposing that these magnificent excavations must have been intended for other uses than the burial , each of a single king . Perhaps , it is said , like the chambers of imagery seen by the Jewish prophet , they were the scene of idolatrous rites performed ' in the dark ; and , as the Israelites are known to have been mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate the words of Ezekiel : ' Then said he to me , Son of man , dig now in the wall ; and when I had digged in the wall , behold a door . And he said unto me . Go in , and see the abominable ' things that they do there . So I went in , and saw , and behold , every form of creeping thing and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed upon the wall round about . ' '  - -  Ezek. viii . 8  --  10. i2 /z/ Amid the wrecks of former greatness which tower aboTe the fdain of Thebes , the iDhabitants who DOW hover around the site of the ancient city are perhaps the most miserable in Egypt* On one side of the riyer they build their mud huts around the ruins of the temples , and on the other their best habitations are in the tombs ; wherever a small space has been cleared out , the inhabitants crawl in , with their dogs , goats , sheep , women , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his sleeping-place the sarcophagus of an ancient Egyptian . I have several times spoken of my intended journey to the great Oasis . Something was yet wanting in my voyage on the Nile . It was calm , tame , and wanting in that high excitement which I had expected from travelling in a barbarous country . A woman and child might go safely from Cairo to the cataracts , and my blood began to run sluggishly in my veins . Besides , I had a great curiosity to see an oasis ; a small spot of green fertile land in the great desert , rising in solitary beauty before the eyes of the traveller , after days of journeying through arid wastes , and divided by vast sandy ramparts from the rest of the world . The very name of the great Oasis in the Libyan Desert carried with it a wild and almost fearful interest , too powerful for me to resist . It was beyond the beaten track ; and the sheik with whom I made my arrangements insisted on /q/ my taking a guard , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an Arab in the desert could not resist the temptation to rob an unprotected traveller . For my own part , I had more fear of being followed by a party of the very miprepossessing fellows who were stealthily dig-p ging among the tombs , and all of whom knew of the preparations for our journey , than from any we might encounter in the desert . I must confess , however , that I was rather amused when I reviewed my body-guard , and , with the gravest air in the world , knocked out the primings from their guns , and primed them anew with the best of English powder . When I got through I was on the point of discharging them altogether ; but it would have broken the poor fellows hearts to disappoint them of their three piasters ( about fifteen cents ) per diem , dearly earned by a walk all day in the desert , and a chance of being shot at . In the afternoon before the day fixed for my departure , I rode by the celebrated Memnons , the Damy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the last time , but I had never before looked upon them with so much interest . Among the mightier monuments of Thebes , her temples and her tombs , I had passed these ancient statues with a comparatively careless eye , scarcely bestowing a thought even upon the vocal Memnon . Now I was in a different mood . finrm with a I rtood before it its scars and k . It told of ther rode assaults of man .

Early in the morning I was on the bank , waiting for my caravan and guides . I had everything ready , rice , macaroni , bread , biscuit , a hare , and a few shirts . I had given instructions to my rais to take my boat down to Siout , and wait for me there , as my intention was to go from the great Oasis to the Oasis of Siwah , containing the ruins of the temple of Jupiter Ammon , to destroy which Gambyses had sent from this very spot an army of fifty thousand men , who , by-the-way , left their bones on the sands of Africa ; and I need not remind the reader that Alexander the Great had visited it in person , and been acknowledged by the priests as the son of Jupiter . I waited a little longer , and then , becoming impatient , mounted a donkey to ride to the sheikhs . My rais and crew accompanied me a little way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , as Paul remarked , if we never got back , they were the /z/ only persons to make any report of us to our friends . The sheik 's house was situated near the mountains , in the midst of the tombs forming the great Necropolis of Thebes , and we found him surrounded by fifty or sixty men , and women and children without number , all helping to fit out the expedition . There did not appear to be much choice among them ; but I picked out my body guard , and when I looked at their swarthy visages by broad daylight , I could not help asking the sheik what security I had against them . The sheik seemed a little touched , but , pointing to the open doors of the tombs , and the miserable beings around us , he said he had their wives and children in his hands as pledges for my safety . Of the sheik himself I knew nothing , except that he was sheik . I knew , too , that though , by virtue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could for me , he was no friend to the Pacha or his government ; for one evening , in speaking of the general poverty of the Arabs , he said that if one-fourth of them owned a musket , one charge of powder , and one ball , before morning there would not be a Turk in Egypt . However , I knew all this before . At twelve o'clock , the last sack of biscuit was packed upon the camels , and I mounted a fine dromedary , while my companions bade farewell to their wives children , and friends ; a farewell so /q/ calm and quiet particularly for a people whose blood was wanned by the burning sun of Africa , that it seemed cold and heartless . My caravan consisted of six camels , or rather four camels and two dromedaries , four cameldrivers armed with swords , eight men with pistols and muskets , Paul , and myself . It was the first time I bad undertaken a journey in the desert . My first endeavour was to learn something of the character of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the journey , when , upon acquaintance , he found that their ugly outsides gave no true indication of the inward man . Our guide , he who was to conduct us through the pathless desert , was not yet with us ; he lived at a village about four miles distant , and a messenger bad been sent forward to advise him of our coming . Riding for the last time among the ruined temples of Thebes , beyond the limits of the ancient - city , our road lay behind the valley bordering the river , and along the edge of the desert . On one side was one of the richest and most extensive valleys of the Nile , well cultivated , and at this season of the year covered with the richest greens ; on the other were barren mountains and a sandy desert . In about four hours we saw , crossing the valley and stopping on the edge of the desert , a single Arab . It was our messenger , come to tell us that our guide would meet us at a Christian /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now left the borders of the valley and struck dir rectly into the desert . Before us , at some distance over a sandy plain , was a high range of sandstone mountains , and beyond these was the mighty waste of sand and barrenness . Towards evening we saw from afar the church at which we were to meet our guide . It was the only object that rose above the level of the sands ; and as the setting sun was fast reminding us that the day was closing , it looked like a resting-place for a weary traveller . Congratulating myself upon my unexpected good fortune in meeting with those who bore the name of Christians , I was still more happy in the prospect , for this night at least , of sleeping ynder a roof . As we approached , we saw the figure of a man stealing along the wall , and were near enough to hear the hasty closing of the door and the heavy drawing of bolts inside . It was nine o'clock when we dismounted and knocked at the door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again without success . We then commenced a regular battery . I rattled against the door with my Nubian club in a small way , like Richard at the gate of the castle of Front de Boeuf ; but my blows did not tell like the battleaxe of the Lionhearted , and the churlish inmates , secure behind their strong walls , paid no regard to us . Tired of knocking , and irritated at this inhospitable treatment from men calling themselves /q/ Christians , I walked round the building to see if by accident there was not some back-door left open . The convent was enclosed by a square wall of unburnt brick , twelve or fourteen feet high , and not a door , window , or loophole was to be seen It was built for defence against the roving Arabs , and , if we had intended to storm it , we could not have found an assailable point . I returned vexed and disappointed ; and , calling away my men , and almost cursing the unchristian spirit of its inmates , I pitched my tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in th desert . I had hardly stretched myself upon my mat before I heard the smart trot of a dromedary , and presently my guide , whom . I had almost forgotten , dismounted at the door of the tent . He was a tall , hard-faced , weather-beaten man of about fifty , the white hairs just beginning to make their appearance in his black beard . I wanted to have a good view of him , and , calliDg him inside , gave him a seat on the mat , a pipe , and coffee . He told me that for many years he had been in the habit of going once a year to the Oasis , on a tra* ding voyage , and that he knew the road perfectly . Almost the first thing he said was , that he supposed I intended to remain there the next day . The Arabs , like most other Orientals , have no respect for the value of time ; and among the petty vexations of travelling among them , few annoyed me more than the eternal bokhara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow. ** When they first sent to this guide to know whether he could engage with me , he said he was ready at any moment , by which he probably meant a weeks notice ; and when they sent word that I had named a particular day , he probably thought that I would be along in the course of two or three thereafter , and was no doubt Utken by surprise when the messenger came to tell him that I was already on the march . I , of course , had no idea of remaining there . He told me that I had better stay ; that one day could not make any difference , and finally said he had no bread baked , and must have a day or two to prepare himself . I answered that he had told the sheik at Thebes that he would be ready at any moment ; that it was absurd to think I would wait there in the desert ; that I would not be trifled with , and , if he was not ready the next morning , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheik . After a long parley , which those only can imagine who have had to deal with Arabs , he promised to be there at sunrise the next morning , and took his leave . After supper , when , if ever , a man should feel good-natured , I began again to feel indignant at the churlish inmates of the convent , and resolved upon another effort to see what stuff these Christians were made of . I knew that the monks in these isolated places , among fanatic Mussulmans , were /q/ sometimes obliged to have recourse to carnal weapons ; and telling Paul to keep a look-out , and give me notice if he saw the barrel of a musket presenting itself over the wall , I again commenced thundering at the door ; almost at the first blow it was thrown wide open , with a suddenness that startled me , and a dark , surly , and half-naked Arab stood facing me in the doorway . He had been reconnoitring , and though not sufficiently assured to come out and welcome us , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small degree of asperity , and certainly without the meekness of the character upon which I was then presuming , I asked him if that was his Christian spirit , to let a stranger and a Christian sleep outside his wdls when he had a roof to shelter him ; and before he could interpose a word , I had read him a homily upon the Christian virtues that would have done credit to some pulpits . He might have retorted upon me , that with the Christian duties coming so glibly from my tongue , I was ingly deficient in the cardinal virtue of forbearance ; but I had the satisfaction of learning that I had not been excluded by the hands of Christians . The priests and monks had gone to a neighbouring village , and he was left alone . I followed him through a sort of courtyard into a vestibule , where was a noble fire , with a large caldron boiling over it . He neither asked me to stay nor told me to go , and seated himself by the fire . /z/ perfectly indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself that he was alone , and saw that my Arabs had followed me , I thought I ran no risk in considering the building as a castle which I had stormed , and him as the captive of my bow and spear . I therefore required him to show me the interior of the convent , and he immediately took up a blazing stick from the fire , and conducted me within ; and when I told him that I meant to sleep there , he said it would be for him a night " white as milk. ** ' From the vestibule the door opened into the chapel , which consisted of a long apartment running transversely , the door in the centre ; the floor was covered with mats , ostrich-eggs were suspended from the ceilings , and three or four recesses contained altars to favourite saints . Directly opposite the door was a large recess , in which stood the great altar , separated by a railing , ornamented with bone and mother-of-pearl , and over the top were four pictures of St. George slaying the dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throe times , followed in silence by my swarthy friends , not altogether with the reverential spirit of a pious Christian , but with the prudence of a man of the world , looking out for the best place to sleep , and finally deposited my mat at the foot of the great altar . I might better have slept on the sand after all . /q/ for the walls of the church were damp , and a strong current of air from the large window above had been pouring in upon me the whole night . When I first awoke I felt as if pinned to the floor , and I was startled and alarmed at the recurrence of a malady , on account of which I was then an exile from home . I went outside , and found , although it was late , that the guide had not come . If he had been there I should no doubt have gone on ; but , most fortunately for me , I had time to reflect* I was a changed man since the day before ; my buoyancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dejected . I sent a messenger , however , for the guide ; and , while I was sitting under the walls , hesitating whether I should expose myself to the long and dreary journey before me , I saw four men coming across the desert towards the convent . They were the priest and three of his Christian flock ; and their greeting was such as to make me reproach myself for the injustice I had done the Arab Christians , and feel that there was something in that religion , even in the corrupt state in which it existed there , that had power to open and warm the heart . The priest was a tall thin man , his dark face almost covered with a black beard and mustaches , and wore the common blue gown of the better class of Arabs , with a square black cap on his head , and his feet bare . I could not understand him , but I /z/ could read in his face that he saluted me as a brother Christian and welcomed me to all that a brother Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land where the only religious difference is that of sect , and all sects have the bond of a common faith , it is difficult to realize the feeling which draws together believers in the same God and the same Redeemer , in lands where power is wielded by the worshippers of a false religion . One must visit a country in which religion is the dividing line ; where haughty and deluded fanatics are the masters and hear his faith reviled , and see its professors persecuted and despised , to know and feel how strong a tie it is . After exchanging our greetings outside , the priest led the way to the church . I do not know whether it was a customary thing , or done speci* ally in honour of me ( Paul said the latter ) ; but , at any rate , he immediately lighted up the edifice , and , slipping over his frock a dirty white gown , with a large red cross down the back , commenced the service of the mass . His appearance and manner were extremely interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen at Esneh . His fine head , his noble expression , his earnestness , his simplicity , his apparent piety , his long black beard and mustaches , his mean apparel and naked feet , all gave him the primitive aspect of an apostle . He was assisted by a dirty , ragged , barefooted boy , who followed him round with a censer /q/ of incense , vigorously perfuming the church from time to time , and then climbing up a stand , holding on by his naked feet , and reading a lesson from the thumbed , torn , and tattered leaves of an Arabic Bible . There were but three persons present besides myself ; poor , ignorant people , far astray , no doubt , from the path of true Christianity , but worshipping in all honesty and sincerity , according to the best b'ght they had , the God of their fathers . The priest went through many long and unmeaning forms , which I did not understand , but I had seen things quite as incomprehensible to me in the splendid cathedrals of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the humble worship of these Egyptian Christians . There were no vessels of silver and gold , no imposing array of costly implements , to captivate the senses . A broken tumbler , a bottle of wine , and three small rolls of bread , formed the simple materials for the holy rite of the Lord 's Supper . The three Arabs partook of it , and twice it was offered to me , but the feelings with which I had been accustomed to look upon this solemn sacrifice forbade me to partake of the consecrated elements , and never did I regret my unworthiness so bitterly as when it prevented me from joining in the holy feast with these simple-hearted Christians . In the mean time Paul came in , and the service being ended , I fell into conversation with the priest . He was a good man , but exceedingly ig** /z/ norant , weak , and of great simplicity of character . He conducted me around the little church into the several chapels , and pointed out all that he thought curious , and particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a most imposing air , Uke a priest in a church in Italy , uncovering the works of the first masters , he drew the curtain from the four pictured of St. George slaying the dragon , and looked at me with an air of great satisfaction to enjoy the expression of my surprise and astonishment . I did not disappoint him , nor did I tell him that I had the night before most irreverently drawa aside the curtain , and exposed these sacred , specimens of the arts to the eyes of my unbelieving Arabs ; nor did I tell him that , in each of the four , St. George seemed to be making a different thrust at the dragon . There was no use in disturbing the complacency of the poor priest ; he had but little of which he could be proud , and I would not deprive him of that . Leaving him undisturbed in his exalted opinion of St. George and his dragons , I inquired of him touching the number and condition of the Christians under his charge , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , among other things , asked him if they increased . He told me that they remained about the same , or perhaps rather decreased . I asked him if a Mus sulman ever became a Christian . He answered /q/ never , but sometimes a Christian would embrace the religion of Mohammed , and assigned a cause for this unhappy difference , which I am sorry to mention , being no less than the influence of the tender passion . He told me that , in the free intercourse now existing under the government of the Pacha between Christians and Mussulmans , it often happened that a Christian youth became enamoured of a Moslem girl , and as they could not by any possibility marry and retain their separate religions , it was necessary that one of them should change . The Moslem dare not , for death by the hands of her own friends would be the certain consequence , while the Christian , instead of running any temporal risk , gains with his bride the protection and favour of the Mussulmans . Paul seemed rather scandalized at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own account . I could not understand the conversation , but could judge , from the movements , that Paul was examining him on that cardinal point , the sign of the cross . All appeared to go smoothly enough for a little while , but I soon noticed the flashing of Paul 's eyes , and sundry other symptoms of indignation and contempt . I asked him several times what it was all about ; but , without answering , he walked backward and forward , slapping his hands under the priest 's nose , and talking louder and faster than ever , and I had to take hold of him , and ask him sharply /z/ hat the plague was the matter , before I could get a word out of him , " A pretty Christian , " said Paul ; " fast fifty-six days for Leilt , when we fast only forty-six : forty that our Saviour was in the mount , and six Sundays . " I told him there was not so much difference between them as I thought , as it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , as if fearful of trustit ) g himself , shrugged his shoulders and marched out of the chapel . During all this time , the condition of the poor priest was pitiable and amusing ; he had never been so sharply questioned before , and he listened with as much deference to Paul 's questions and rebukes as if he had been listening to the Pope of Rome , and , when it was over , looked perfectly crestfallen . It was twelve o'clock when the man we had sent after the guide returned , but before this time my malady had increased to such a degree as to leave me no option ; and I had resolved to abandon the Oasis , and go back to Thebes . I had great reason to congratulate myself upon my accidental detention , and still greater that the symptoms of my malady had developed themselves before I had advanced another day 's journey in the desert . Still , it was with a heavy heart that I mounted my dromedary to return . I had not only the regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had great uneasiness as to what was to become of /q/ me on my arrival at Thebes . My boat was probably already gone . I knew that no other could be obtained there , and , if obliged to wait for a casual opportunity , I must live in my tent on the banks of the river , or in one of the tombs . My anxieties , however , were quickly dispelled on my arrival at Thebes , where I found the English gentleman and lady whom I had met at Cairo , and afterward at the cataracts : They kindly took me on board their boat , and so ended my expedition to the great Oasis . /z/ A Travelling Artist and Antiquary .  --  An Egyptian Sugarhouse.  --  Grecian Architecture .  --  A melancholy Greeting .  - -  Tyranny of the Pacha.  --  Amateurs of Physic .  --  Memphis .  --  Adventure with a wild Boar .  --  Perils of a Pyramid .  - -  The Catacombs of Birds .  --  Amor Patriae.  --  Voyaging on the Nile . I SHALL never forget the kindness of these excellent friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me that my own boat had gone , and that I was thrown upon their hospitality ; for , in addition to the greater comforts I found with them , I had the benefit of cheerful society under circumstances when to be alone would have been horrible . Even when we arrived at Siout , after a voyage of seven days , they would not let me leave them , but assumed the right of physicians , and prescribed that I should be their guest until perfectly restored . I remained , accordingly , three days longer with them , my little boat following like a tender to a man-of-war , and passed my time luxuriously . I had books , conversation , and a medicine-chest . But one thing troubled me . We had a cook who looked upon his profession as a liberal and enlightened science , and had attained /q/ its very highest honours . He had served various noblemen of eminent taste , had accumulated fifty thousand dollars , and was now cooking at the rate of fifty dollars a month upon the Nile . Michel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalmatia , near the shores of the Adriatic ; one of a small nation who had preserved the name , and form , and spirit of a republic against Italians , Hungarians , and Turks , and fell only before the irresistible arm of Napoleon . He had been a great traveller in his youth , and , besides his attainments in the culinary art , was better acquainted with history , ancient and modem , than almost any man I ever met . He had two great passions , the love of liberty and the love of the fine arts ( cookery included ) , and it was really extraordinary to hear him , with a ladle in his hand , and tasting , from time to time , some piquant sauce , discourse of the republics of Rome and America , of the ruins of Italy , Palmyra , and Egypt . MichePs dinners , making proper allowance for the want of a daily market , would have done honour to the best lord he ever served ; and I was obliged to sit down , day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen to the praises of his dainties while they passed untasted from me . It was not until within two days of Cairo that we parted , with an agreement to meet at Jerusalem and travel together to Palmyra . We did 19St INCIDENTS OP TRAVEL/ meet for a few moments at Cairo , but the plagiiie was beginning to rage , the Pacha had been putting himself into quarantine , and we had barely time to renew our engagement , which a particular unfortunate circumstance ( the illness of Mrs. S. ) prevented us from keeping , and we never met again . Few things connected with my compelled departure from the Holy Land gave me more regret than this ; and if these pages should ever meet their eyes , they will believe me when I say that I shall remember , to the last day of my life , their kindness on the Nile. * The story of my journeying on this river is almost ended . Kenneh was our first stoppingplace on our way down ; a place of considerable note , there being a route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the pilgrims , and a great portion of the trade of the Red Sa , are conveyed . At Ramaioum , not far below Siout , we went ashore to visit a sugar-factory belonging to the Pacha . This manufactory is pointed out as one of the great improvements introduced into Egypt , and , so far as it shows the capabilities of the Arabs , of which , however , no one can doubt , it may be * Since this was in type , Mr. Gliddon , our consul at Cairo , has arrived in this country , who informs me that , on their way to Palmyra , Mr. S. and his whole party were robbed in the Desert , and stripped of everything they had . They got back safe to Damascus , but the route to Palmyra is now entirely broken up by the atrocities of the Bedouins. /q/ considered useful . Formerly eighty Europeans were employed in the factory , but now the work is carried on entirely by Arabs . The principal was educated in France at the expense of the Pacha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render any service to their country and master . The enlightened Pacha understands thoroughly that liberal principle of political economy which consists in encouraging domestic manufactures , ! io matter at what expense . The sugar costs more than that imported , and is bought by none but governors and dependants of the Pacha . It is made from cane , contains a great deal of saccharine matter , and has a good taste , but a bad colour . This factory , however , can hardly be considered as influential upon the general interests of the country , for its principal business is the making of rock candy for the ladies of the harem . They gave us a little to taste , but would not sell any except to Mrs. S. , the whole being wanted for the use of the ladies . There was also a distillery attached to the factory , under the direction of another Arab , who gave satisfactory evidence , in his own person at least , of the strength of the spirit made , being more than two-thirds drunk . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning landed to visit the tombs . Like all the tombs in Egypt , except those of the kings at Thebes , they are excavated in the sides of the mountain , commanding an extensive view /z/ of the valley of the Nile ; but in one respect they are from all others in Egjrpt . The doors have regular Doric columns , and they are the only specimens of architecture in Egypt which at all approximate to the Grecian style . This would not be at all extraordinary if they were constructed after the invasion of Alexander and the settlement of the Greeks in the country , but it is ascertained that they were built long before that time ; and , indeed , it is alleged by antiquaries that these tombs and the obelisk at Heliopolis are the oldest monuments in Egypt . The interiors are large and handsomely proportioned ( one of them being sixty feet square and forty feet high ) , and adorned with paintings , representing principally scenes of domestic life . Among them Mr. S. and myself made out one , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a half-naked Egyptian , with a skin of water across his back , precisely like the modern Arab in the streets of Cairo . We returned to our boat , and being now within two days of Cairo , and having different places to stop at below , after dinner I said farewell to my kind friends , and returned to my own boat . My crew received me with three cheers , I was going to say , but they do not understand or practise that noisy mode of civilized welcome , and gave me the grave and quiet salutation of their country , all rising as soon as I touched the deck , and /q/ one after the other taking my hand in his , and touching it to his forehead and lips . My poor Ms gave me a melancholy greeting . He had been unwell during the whole of the voyage , but , since we parted , had been growing worse . He told me that our stars were the same , and that misfortune had happened to us both as soon as we separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inseparably connected , for I looked upon him as a doomed man . I had saved him at Cairo from being pressed into the Pachas service ; and again in descending , when he stopped at Kentieh , he and his whole crew had been seized in the bazaars , and , in spite of their protestations that they were in the service of an American , the iron bands were put around their wrists and the iron collars round their necks . The governor afterward rode down to the river , and the American flag streaming from the masthead of my little boat procured their speedy release , and saved them from the miserable fate of Arab soldiers . Under all the oppressions of the Pachas government , there is nothing more grinding than this . The governor of a town , or the sheik of a village , is ordered to furnish so many men as soldiers . He frequently has a leaning towards his own subjects or followers , and is disposed to save them if he can ; and if any unlucky stranger happens to pass before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon as one of the k2 /z/ required number . It is useless for the poor captive to complain that he is a stranger , and that the rites of hospitality are violated ; he appeals to those who are interested in tightening his bonds ; and when he is transferred to the higher authorities , they neither know nor care who he is or whence he comes . He has the thews and sinews of a man , and though his heartstrings be cracking , he can bear a musket , and that is enough . For centuries Egypt has been overrun by strangers , and the foot of a tyrant has been upon the necks of her inhabitants ; but I do not believe that , since the days of the Pharaohs , there has been on the throne of Egypt so thorough a despot as the present Pacha . But to return to my rais . His first request was for medicine , which , unfortunately , I. could not give him . The Arabs have a perfect passion for medicine . Early in our voyage my crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or another of them was constantly sick until they had got it all ; and then they all got well except the rais ; and for him I feared there was no cure . On the eleventh , early in the morning , Paul burst into the cabin , cursing all manner of Arabs , snatched the gun from over my head , and was out again in a moment . I knew there was no danger when Paul was so valorous ; and , opening my broken shutter , I saw one of my men struggling with an Arab on shore , the latter holding /q/ him by the throat with a pistol at his head . The rascal had . gone on shore just at daylight to steal wood , and , while in the act of tearing down a little fence , the watchful owner had sprung upon him , and seemed on the point of correcting for ever all his bad habits . His fellows ran to the rescue , with Paul at their head ; and the culprit , relieved from the giant grasp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our progress . In the course of my last day on the Nile I visited one of the greatest of its ruined cities , and , for moral effect , for powerful impression on the imagination and feelings , perhaps the most interesting of them all . So absolute , complete , and total is the ruin of this once powerful city , . that antiquaries have disputed whether there is really a single monument to show where the great Memphis stood ; but the weight of authority seems to be , that its stately temples and palaces , md its thousands of inhabitants , once covered the ground now occupied by the little Arab village of Metrahenny . This village stands about four miles from the river ; and the traveller might pass through it and around it without ever dreaming that it had once been the site of a mighty city . He might , indeed , as he wandered around the miserable village , find , half buried in the earth , the broken fragments of a colossal statue ; and , looking from the shattered relic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , ' This is the work of other men and other times , and how comes it here ? * But it would never occur to him that this was the last remaining monument of one of the greatest cities in the world . He might stop and gaze upon the huge mounds of ruins piled among the groves of palm , and ask himself , ' Whence , too , came these ? ' ' But he would receive no answer that could satisfy him . In a curious and unsatisfied mood he would stroll on through the village , and from the other extremity would see , on the mountains towering before him , on the edge of the desert , a long range of pyramids and tombs , some crumbling in ruin , others upright and unbroken as when they were reared , and all stretcliing away for miles , one vast Necropolis ; his reason and reflection would tell him that , where are the chambers of the dead , there must also have been the abodes of the living ; and with wonder he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose inhabitants now sleep in yonder tombs ? Here are the proud graves in which they were buried ; where are the palaces in which they revelled , and the temples in which they worshipped ? ' And he returns to the broken statue and the mounds of ruins , with the assurance that they are the sad remnants of a city once among the proudest in the world . My movements in Egypt were too hurried , my /q/ means of observation and my stock of knowledge too limited , to enable me to speculate advisedly upon the mystery which overhangs the history of her ruined cities ; but I always endeavoured to come to some decision of my own , from the labours , the speculations , and the conflicting opinions of others . An expression which I had seen referred to in one of the books , as being the only one in the Bible in which Memphis was mentioned by name , was uppermost in my mind while I was wandering over its site . ' ' And Memphis shall bury them . " There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some allusion to the manner in which the dead were buried at Memphis , or to a cemetery or tombs different from those which existed in other dties of its day . It seems almost impossible to believe that a city , having for its burying-place the immense tombs and pyramids which even yet for many miles skirt the borders of the desert , can ever have stood upon the site of this miserable village ; but the evidence is irresistible . The plain on which this ancient city stood is one of the richest on the Nile , and herds of cattle are still seen grazing upon it , as in the days of the Pharaohs . The pyramids of Sacchara stand on the edge of the desert , a little south of the site of Memphis . If it was not for their mightier neighbours , these pyramids , which are comparatively seldom honoured with a visit , would alone be /z/ deemed worthy of a pUgrimage to Egypt . The first to which we came is about three hutidred and fifty feet high , and seven hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north side , one hundred and eighty feet from the base . The entrance is by a beautifully-polished shaft , two hundred feet long , and inclining at an angle of about ten degrees . We descended till we found the passage choked up with huge stones . I was very anxious to see the interior , as there is a ; hamber within said to resemble the tomb of Agamemnon at Mycene ; and having once made an interesting visit to that tomb of the king of kings , I wished to compare them ; but it was excessively close , the sweat was pouring from us in streams , and we were suffocating with heat and dust . We came out . and attempted to clamber up the side from the door to the top , but found it so difficult that we abandoned the effort , although Paul afterwards mounted , with great ease , by one of the corners . While I was walking round the base I heard a loud scream from that courageous dragoman , and saw him standing about half way up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was running away , if possible , more frightened than himself . It was a mystery to me what the animal could be doing there , unless he went up on purpose to frighten Paul . After he got over his fright , however , the boar was a great acquisition to him , for I always had /q/ great difficulty in getting him into any tomb ot other place of the kind without a guide ; * and whenever I urged him to enter a pyramid or excavation of any kind , he always threw the wild boar in my teeth , whose den , he was sure to say was somewhere within . There are several pyramids in this vicinity ; among others , one which is called the brick pyramid , and which has crumbled so gradually and uniformly that it now appears only a huge misshapen mass of brick , somewhat resembling a beehive . Its ruins speak a moral lesson . Herodotus says that this fallen pyramid was built by King Asychis , and contained on a piece of marble the vainglorious inscription , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramids composed of stone ; I am as much superior to them as Jove is to the rest of the deities . ' ' Retracing my steps , I continued along the edge of the mountain , which everywhere showed the marks of having been once lined with pyramids and tombs . I was seeking for one of the most curious and interesting objects that exist in Egypt  --  not so interesting in itself , as illustrating the character of the ancient inhabitants and their superstitions  --  I mean the burial-place of the sacred birds . Before we reached it , my Arab guide pointed to a pyramid on our left , saying that it contained a remarkable chamber , so high k5 /z/ that a stone hurled with a man 's utmost strefngth could not reach the top . As this pyramid was not mentioned in my guide-book , and I had no hope , in a country so trodden as Egypt now is , to become a discoverer of new wonders , I at paid no attention to him ; but he continued urging me to visit the lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not find it as he said , I would not give him a para of bucksheesh , I consented . There was no door to the pyramid ; but , about a hundred feet from its base , on the north side , was a square excavation or shaft about forty feet deep , at the end of which was a little hole not more than large enough to admit a man 's arm . The Arab scooped out the sand , and with his hands and feet worked his meager body through , and I followed on my back , feet foremost . Though not particularly bulky , I wanted more room than the Arab , and my shoulders stuck fast . I was trying to work out again , when he grasped me by the heels , and began pulling me in with all his might ; but , luckily , I had play for my legs , and , drawing them up , I ve him a kick with my heavy boots that kept him from taking hold again until I had time to scramble out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , the top of the pit was darkened , and , looking up , I saw two young Englishmen with whom I had dined a few days before , while com- /z/ ing down the river with Mr. S. and his lady . They had seen my boat , and come to join me , and I was very glad to see them ; for though I had no actual apprehension of the thing , yet it occurred to me that it would be very easy for my Arab friends to roll a stone against the hole , and shut me in for ever . It would have been something to be buried in a pyramid , to be sure ; but even the belief that it was the tomb of a king would hardly compensate for the inconvenience of being buried alive . We left their servant , a strapping Greek , at the door , and the Arab having enlarged the hole , we went to work systematically , laid ourselves upon our backs , and , being prepared beforehand , were dragged in by the heels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the length of the body , and once past this , there was more room to move about than in any other of the pyramids ; we could walk without stooping . Descending some hundred feet through an inclined passage excavated in the rock , with doors opening from it at regular intervals , we came to the large chamber of which the Arab had spoken . As in all the pyramids and tombs , the interior was in perfect darkness , and the feeble light of our torches gave us but an imperfect view of the apartment . The Arab immediately commenced his experiment with the stone ; we could hear the whizzing as it cut through the empty space , and , after what seemed a very long time , the sound of /z/ its fall upon the rocky floor . At some distance Up we could distinguish a door , and sending one of the Arabs up to it , by the flaring light of his torch , held as high as he could , reach , we thought , but we were not certain , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but a short distance to the catacombs of birds ; a small opening in the side of a rock leads to an excavated chamber , in the centre of which is a square pit or well . Descending the pit by bracing our arms , and putting our toes in litde holes in the side , we reached the bottom , where , crawling on our hands and knees , we were among the mummies of the sacred ibis , the embalmed deities of the Egyptians . The extent of these catacombs is unknown , but they are supposed to occupy an area of many miles . The birds are preserved in stone jars , piled one upon another as closely as they can be stowed . By the light of our torches , sometimes almost flat upon our faces , we groped and crawled along the passages , lined on each side with rows of jars , until we found ourselves again and again stopped by an impenetrable phalanx of the little mummies or rather of the jars containing them . Once we reached a small open space where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the vessels , the ofiPended deities within sent forth volumes of dust which almost suffocated us . The bird was still entire , in form and lineament perfect as the mummied man , and like /q/ him , toO wanting merely the breath of life . The Arabs brought out with them several jars , which we broke and examined above ground , more at our ease . With the pyramids towering around us , it was almost impossible to believe that th men who had raised such mighty structures had fidlen down and worshipped the puny birds whose skeletons we were now dashing at our feet . My last work was now done , and I had seen my last sight on the Nile . Leaving behind me for ever the pyramids of Egypt , and the moun* tains and sands of the Libyan Desert , I rode along the valley , among villages and groves of palmtrees , and a little before dark arrived at Ohizeh . My boat was there ; I went on board for the last time ; my men took to their oars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was dark when we arrived , and I jumped on shore searching for a donkey , but none was to be had . I was almost tired out with the labours of the day , but Paul and I set off , nevertheless on foot for Cairo . We were obliged to walk smartly , too , as the gate closed at nine oclock ; but when about half way there we met an Arab with a donkey , cheering the stillness of the evening with a song . An extravagant price ( I believe it was something like eighteen and three quarters cents ) bribed him to dismount , and I galloped on to Cairo , while Paul retraced his steps to the boat . The reader may judge how completely " turned up ' must have been the feelings /z/ of a quiet citizen of New York , when told that , in winding at night through the narrow streets of Grand Cairo , the citizen aforesaid felt himself quite at home ; and that the greeting of Francisco , the gargon at the Locanda dltalia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive letters from home , I went immediately to the American consul , and was disappdinted ; there were no letters , but there was other and interesting news for me ; and as an American , identified with the honour of my country , I was congratulated there , thousands of miles from home , upon the expected speedy and honourable termination of our with France . An English vessel had arrived at Alexandria , bringing a London paper containing the President 's last message , a notice of the ofiPer of mediation from the English government , its acceptance by France , and the general impression that the quarrel might be considered settled , and the money paid . A man must be long and far from home to feel how dearly he loves his country , how his eye brightens and his heart beats when he hears her praises from the lips of strangers ; and when the paper was given me , with congratulations and compliments on the successful and honourable issue of the affair with France , my feelings grew prouder and prouder as I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I threw up my cap in the old city of Cairo , and shouted the old gathering-cry , * Hurrah for Jackson ! VOrAGE ON THE NILE . S07 I have heard all manners of opinion expressed in regard to a voyage on the Nile ; and may be allowed , perhaps , to give my own . Mrs. S. used frequently to say that , although she had travelled in France , Switzerland , Germany , Italy , and Sicily , she had never enjoyed a journey so much ' before , and was always afraid that it would end too soon . Another lady 's sentiments , expressed in my bearing , were just the contrary . For myself , being alone , and not in very good health , I had some heavy moments ; but I have no hesitation in sajring that , with a friend , a good boat well fitted up , books , guns , plenty of time , and a cook like Michel , a voyage on the Nile would exceed any travelling within my experience . The perfect freedom from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forms an episode in a mans life that is vastly agreeable and exciting . Think of not shaving for two months , of washing your shirts in the Nile , and wearing them without being ironed . True , these things are not absolutely necessary ; but who would go to Egypt to travel as he does in Europe ? Away with all fantasies and fetters , ' is the motto of the touristy We throw aside pretty much everything except our pantaloons ; and a generous rivalry in long beards and soiled linen is kept up with exceeding spirit . You may go ashore whenever you like , and stroll through the little villages , and be stared at by the Arabs , or walk along the banks of the /z/ river till darkness covers the earth ; shooting pigeons , and sometimes pheasants and hares , besides the odd shots from the deck of your boat at geese , crocodiles , and pelicans . And then it is so ridiculously cheap an amusement . You get your boat with ten men for thirty , or forty dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a pair , a sheep for a half or three quarters of a dollar , and eggs almost for the asking . You sail under yoUr own countrys banner ; and , when you walk along the river , if the Arabs look particularly black and truculent , you proudly feel that there is safety in its folds . From time to time you hear that a French or English flag has passed so many days before you , and you meet your fellow-voyagers with a freedom and cordiality which exist nowhere but on the Nile . These are the little every-day items in the voyage , without referring to the great and interesting objects which are the traveller 's princi pal inducements and rewards , the ruined cities on its banks , the mighty temples and tombs , and all the wonderful monuments of Egypt 's departed greatness . Of them I will barely say , that their great antiquity , the mystery that overhangs them , and their extraordinary preservation amid the surrounding desolation , make Egypt perhaps the most interesting country in the world . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things , and is now dominant , and /q/ sitteth upon a sphinx and looketh into Memphis and old Thebes , while his sister Oblivion reclineth semi-sominous on a pyramid , gloriously triumphing and turning old glories into dreams . History sinketh beneath her cloud . The traveller , as he passeth amazedly through those deserts , asketh of her who buildeth them , and she mumbleth something , but what it is he heareth not. * It is now more than three thousand years since the curse went forth against the land of Egypt . The Assyrian , the Persian , the Greek , the Roman , the Arabian , the Georgian , the Circassian , and the Ottoman Turk have successively trodden it down and trampled upon it ; for thirty centuries the foot of a stranger has been upon the necks of her inhabitants ; and in bidding farewell to this once-favoured land , now lying in the most ' abject degradation and misery , groaning under the iron rod of a tyrant and a stranger , I can not help recurring to the inspired words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basest of the kingdoms , neither shall it exalt itself any more among the nations ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt . ' ' /z/ A good Word for the Arabd.  --  A Prophecy fulfilled .  --  Ruins of a Lost City .  --  A Sheik of the Bedouins.  --  Interyiews and Negotiations. - A Hadj , or Pilgrimage to Mecca .  - -  Mohammedan Heaven for Wives .  --  A French Sheik .  --  The Bastinado.  --  Departure for the Desert . I HAD now finished my journey in Egypt from the Mediterranean to the cataracts , or , as the boundaries of this ancient country are given in the Bible , from " Migdol to Syene , even unto the borders of Ethiopia . " For nearly two months I had been floating on the celebrated river , with a dozen Arabs , prompt to do my slightest bidding , and , in spite of bugs and all manner of creeping things , enjoying pleasures and comforts that are not to be found in Europe ; and it was with something more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy boatmen . I know that it is the custom with many travellers to rail at the Arabs , and perhaps to beat them , and have them bastinadoed ; but I could not and can not join in such oppression of this poor and much-abused people . On the contrary , I do not hesitate to say that I /q/ always found them kind , honest , and faithful , thankful for the smallest favour , never surly or discontented , and always ready and anxious to serve me with a zeal that I have not met in any other people ; and when they came up in a body to the locanda to say farewell , I felt that I was parting with tried and trusty friends , most probably for ever . That such was the case with the rais there could be little doubt ; he seemed to look upon himself as a doomed man , and a broken cough , a sunken eye , and a hollow cheek proclaimed him one fast hurrying to the grave . I was now about wandering amid new and different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sand , to exchange my quiet , easy-going boat for a caravan of dromedaries and camels ; to pitch my tent wherever the setting sun might find m and , instead of my gentle Arabs of the Nile , to have for my companions the wild , rude Be* douins of the desert ; to follow the wandering iTootsteps of the children of Israel when they took up the bones of Joseph , and fled before the anger of Pharaoh , from their land of bondage ; to visit the holy mountain of Sinai , where the Almighty , by the hands of his servant Moses , delivered the tables of his law to his chosen people . But I had in view something beyond the holy mountain . My object was to go from thence fo the Holy Land . If I should return to Suez , and thence cross the desert to El Arich and /z/ Gaza , I should be subjected to a quarantine of fourteen days on account of the plague in Egypt , Atid I thought I might avoid this by striking directly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Holy Land . There were difficulties and perhaps dangers on this route ; but , besides the advantage of escap* ing the quarantine , another consideration presented itself , which , in the end , I found it impossible to resist . This route was entirely new . It lay through the land of Edom  --  a land thsit occupies a large space on the pages of the Bible ; Edom denounced by God himself , once given to Esau for his inheritance , as being of the fatness of the earth , but now a desolate monument of the Divine wrath , and a fearful witness to tht truth of the words spoken by his prophets . Th6 English friends with whom I had dined at Thebes first suggested to me this route , referring me , at the same time , to Keith on the Prophecies , ill which , after showing with great clearness and force the fulfilment of prophecy after prophecy , as illustrated by the writings and reports of tra*-vellers , the learned divine enlarges upon the prophecy of Isaiah against the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ever , " and proves , by abundant references to the works of modern travellers , that though several have crossed its borders , none have ever passed through it . Burckhardt , he says , made the /q/ nearest approach to this achievement ; but , by reference to the geographical boundaries , he maintains that Burckhardt did not pass through the and of Edom ; and so strenuously does the learned divine insist upon the fulfilment of the prophecy to its utmost extent , as to contend that , if Burckhardt did pass through the land of Edom , he died in consequence of the hardships he suffered on that journey . I did not mean to brave a prophecy . I had already learned to re  - -  gard the words of the inspired penman with an interest I never felt before ; and with the evidence I had already had of the sure fulfilment of their predictions , I should have considered it daring and impious to place myself in the way of a still impending curse . But I did not go so far as the learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed sufficiently verified in the total breaking up of the route then travelled , as the great highway from Jerusalem to the Red Sea and India , and the general and probably eternal desolation that reigns in Edom . Still , however , it added to the interest with which I looked upon this route ; and , moreover , in this dreary and desolate region , for more than a thousand years buried from the eyes of mankind , its place unknown , and its very name almost for gotten , lay the long-lost city of Petra , the capital of Arabia Petraea , and the Edom of the Edomites , containing , according to the reports of the /z/ only travellers who have ever been permitted to enter it , the most curious and wonderful remains existing in the world : a city excavated from the solid rock , with long ranges of dwellings , temples , and tombs cut in the sides of the mountain , and all lying in ruins , thorns coming up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three parties had at different times visited Petra , but neither of them had passed through the land of Idumea ; and , according to the reports of the few travellers who had crossed its borders , the Bedouins who roamed over the dreary sands of Idumea were the most ferocious tribe of the desert race . It will not be considered surprising , therefore , that , having once conceived the project , I was willing to fulfil it even at the cost of some per sonal difficulty and hazard . I have said that this route was entirely new . It was known that two Englishmen , with an Italian , long resident in Egypt , and understanding thoroughly the language and character of the Arabs , had started from Cairo about a year before to make this journey , and as they had been heard of afterward in Europe , it was known that they had succeeded ; but no account of their journey had ever been published , and all the intelligence I could obtain of the route and its perils was doubtful and confused . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I had /z/ better let it alone . Almost the only person who eDcouraged me was Mr. Oliddon , our vice-consul ; and probably if it had not been for him , I should have given up the idea . Besides the difficulties of the road ) there were others of a more personal nature . I was alone . I could not speak the language , and had with me a servant who , instead of leading me on , and sustaining me when I faltered , was constantly torturing himself with idle fears , and was very reluctant to accompany me at all . Nor was this all ; my health was far from being restored , and my friend Waghom was telling me every day , with a warning voice , to turn my steps westward ; but objections presented themselves in vain ; and perhaps it was precisely because of the objections that I finally determined upon attempting the journey through the land of Idumea . By singular good fortune the sheik of Akaba was then at Cairo . The great yearly caravan of pilgrims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there on the summons of the Pacha , to escort and protect them through the desert as far as Akaba . He was the chief of a powerful tribe of Bedouins somewhat reduced by long and bloody wars with other tribes , but still maintaining , in all its vigour , the wild independence of the race , and yet strong enough to set at defiance even the powerful arm of the Pacha . A system of mutual forbearance seemed to exist between them , the Bedouins knowing that , although /z/ the Pacha might not subdue them , his long arm could reach and disturb them even in their sandy hills ; while the Pacha could not overlook the fact , that the effort would cost him the lives of his best troops , and that the plunder of their miserable tents would bring him neither glory nor profit . Thus the desert was still the possession of the Bedouins ; they still claimed a tribute from the stranger for permission to pass over it , and this induced the Pacha annually to invite the sheik of Akaba to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if not so invited , even the sacred character of the pilgrims would not protect them in passing through his country . I found him about a mile outside the walls , near the tombs of the califs , on the edge of the desert , sitting on a mat under his tent , and surrounded by a dozen of his swarthy tribe armed with long sabres , pistols , and matchlock guns . The sheik was a short stout man , of the darkest shade of bronze ; his eye keen , roving , apd unsettled ; his . teeth white ; and his skin so dried up and withered that it seemed cleaving to his very bones . At the first glance I did not like his face ; it wanted frankness , and even boldness ; and I thought at the time , that if I had met him alone in the desert I should not have trusted him . He received me with great civility , while his companions rose , gave me their low salaam , seated me on the mat beside him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise than would have attended the entrance of a gentleman into a drawing-room on a morning call . All stared at me with silent gravity ; and the sheik , though desert born and bred , with an air and manner that showed him familiar with the usages of good society in Cairo , took the pipe from his mouth and handed it to me . All being seated , the consul 's janizary , who had come with me , opened the divan ; but he had scarcely begun to declare my object before the whole group , sheik and all , apparently surprised out of their habitual phlegm , cried out together that they were ready to escort me , and to defend me with their lives against every danger . I said a few words , and they became clamorous in their assurances of the great friendship they had conceived for me ; that life was nothing in my service ; that they would sleep in my tent , guard and watch me by day and night , and , in short , that they would be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my relations in the desert ; and the final assurance was , that it would not be possible to travel that road except under their protection . I then began to inquire the terms , when , as before , all spoke at once ; some fixed one pri6e , some another , and for bucksheesh whatever I pleased . I did not like this wild and noisy negotiation . I knew that I must make great allowance for the extravagant language of the Arabs ; but there seemed to /z/ be an eagerness to get me among them which , in ray eyes , was rather ominous of bad inte &ticms.; They were known to be a lawless people , and distinguished , even among their desert brethren , as a wild and savage tribe . And these were the people with whom I was negotiating to meet in the desert , at the little fortress of Akaba , at . the eastern extremity of the Bed Sea ; into whose hands I was to place myself , and from whom I was to expect protection against greater dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , wishing to talk the matter over - more quietly with the sheik - alone , . ! asked him to go with me to my hotel ; whereupon the whole gcoup started up at once , and , some on foot , and othors on dromedaries or on horseback , prepared to fdlow . This did not suit me , and the sheik con trived to get rid of all except one , his principal and constant attendant , his black , " as he was called . He followed me on horseback , and when he came up into my room , it was , perhaps , the first time in his life that he had ever been under.a roof . As an instance of his idmplicity andignot* rance , it may be worth mentioning here , although I did not . know it until we were on the point of separating ter our journey was oompletedf that he mistook the consul 's janizary , who wore a dashing red . Turkish dress , sword , &c,; for anoffieer of/ the Pachas household , and , consequently had always looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacha . I could not come to any definite understanding with him . The precise wfYice that I required of him was to conduct me from Akaba to Hebron , through the land of Edom , diverging to visit the excavated city of Petra , a journey of about ten days . I could not get him to name any sum as compensation for diis service ; he told me that he would conduct me for nothing , that I might give him what I pleased , &c.; When I first spoke about the terms at his tent , he had said twelve dollars a camel , and , as it seemed to me , he had named this sum without the least calculation , as the first that happened to occur to him . I now referred him to this price , which he had probably forgotten , hoping to establish it as a sort of basis upon which to negotiate ; but , when his attention was called to it , he inlifted upon the twelve dollars , and something more for bucksheesh . A fair price for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him this did not satisfy me ; that I wanted everything definitely arranged beforehand , and that I would QOt give the enormous price he asked , and bucksheesh in proportion ; but I could do nothing with him ; he listened with perfect coolness ; and taking his pipe from his mouth , in answer to everything I said , told me to come to him at Akaba , come to him at his tent ; he had plenty of camels , and would conduct me without any reward , or I might give him what I pleased . W6 l2 /z/ parted without coming to an arrangement . He offered to send one of his men to conduct me from Mount Sinai to Akaba ; but , as something might occur to prevent my going , I would not take him . He gave me , however , his signet , which he told me every Bedouin on that route knew and would respect , and writing his name under it according to the sound , I repeated it over and over , until I could pronounce it intelligibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert . The next morning , under pretence that I went to see the starting of the great caravan of pilgrims for Mecca , I rode out to th sheik ; and telling him that , if I came to him , I should come destitute of everything , and he must have some good tobacco for me , I slipped a couple of gold pieces into his hand , and , without any further remark , left the question of my going undetermined . It was worth my ride to see the departure of the caravan . It consisted of more than thirty thousand pilgrims , who had come from the shores of the Caspian , the extremities of Persia , and the confines of Africa ; and having assembled , according to usage for hundreds of years , at Cairo as a central point , the whole mass was getting in motion for pilgrimage of fifty days , through dreary sands , to the tomb of the Prophet . Accustomed as I was to associate the idea of order and decorum with the observance of all rites and duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the noise , tumult , and confusion , the strifes and battles of these pilgrim-travellers . If I had met them in the desert after their line of march was formed , it would have been an imposing spectacle , and comparatively easy to describe ; but here , as far as the eye could reach , they were scattered over the sandy plain , thirty thousand people , with probably twenty thousand camels and dromedaries , men , women , and children , beasts and baggage , all commingled in a confused mass that seemed hopelessly inextricable . Some had not yet struck their tents , some were making coffee , some smoking , some cooking , some eating , many shouting and cursing , others on their knees praying , and others , again , hurrying on to . join the long moving stream that already extended several miles into the desert . It is a vulgar prejudice , the belief that women are not admitted into the heaven of Mohammed . It is true that the cunning Prophet , in order not to disturb the joyful serenity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has not given to women any fixed position there , and the pious Mussulman , although blessed with the lawful complement of four wives , is not bound to see among his seventy-two black-eyed houries the faces of his companions upon earth ; but the women are not utterly cast out ; they are deemed to have souls , and entitled to a heaven of their own ; and it may be , too , that their visions of /z/ futurity are not less bright* for that there is a mystery to be unravelled beyond the grave , and they are not doomed to eternal companionship with their earthly lords . In the wildest , rudest scene where woman appears at all , there is a sweet and undefinable charm ; and their appearance among the pilgrims , the care with which they shrouded themselves from every eye , their long thick veils , and their tents or four-post beds , with curtains of red silk , fastened down all around and secured on the high backs of camels , were the most striking objects in the caravan . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marabouts , santons , or Arab saints , having only a scanty covering of rags over their shoulders , and the rest of their bodies completely naked , yet strutting about as if clothed in purple and fine linen ; and setting off utterly destitute of everything for a journey of months across the desert , safely trusting to that open-handed charity which forms so conspicuous an item in the list of Mus* sulman virtues . But the object of universal in* terest was the great box containing the presents and decorations for the tomb of the Prophet . The camel which bears this sacred burden is adorned with banners and rich housings , is watched and tended with pious care , and , whi his journey is ended , no meaner load can touch his back ; he has filled the measure of a camel 's glory , and lives and dies respected by all good Mussulmans. /q/ JhtheeTeniiig being the last of my stay in Gairo I heoid that M. linant , the companion of M. Laborde on his visit to Petra , . had arrived at Aiegtandria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. L. is one of the many French emigres drireii ' from their native soil by political convulnonst and who have risen to distinction in foreign luids by military talents and the force of that Kttlcsa energy so jeculiar to his countrymen . Many years before , he bad thrown himself into the AarabiaU ' Desert , where he had become so nuch bdoved by the Bedouins , that on the occaikntofa dispute between two contending claim* ants , the customs of thdr tribe were waived , the pretensions of the rivals set aside , and he was dected sheik of Mount Sinai , and invested with the flattering name , which he retains to this day , of Abddl Hag , or the slave of truth . Notwithstanding his desert rank and dignity , he received me irith a politeness which savoured of the salons of Paris , and encouraged me in my intention of viiitiiig Petra , assuring me that it would abundftntiy repity me for all the difficulties attending it ; in fact , he spoke lightly of these , although I afterward found that his acquaintance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid bis lavish distribution of money and presents , had removed or diminished obstacles which , to a stranger without these advantages , were by no means of a trifling nature . In addition to much /z/ general advice , he counselled me particularly to wear the Turkish or Arab dress , and to get a letter from the Habeeb Effendi to the governor . of the little fortress of Akaba . M. Linant has been twenty years in Egypt , and is now a bey in the Pachas service ; and that very afternoon , after a long interview , had received orders from the great reformer to make a survey of the pyramids , for the purpose of deciding which of those gigantic monuments , after having been respected by all preceding tyrants for three thousand years , should now be demolished for the illustrious object of yielding material for a petty fortress , or scarcely more useful and important bridge. * Early in the morning I went into the bazaars , and fitted out Paul and myself with the necessary dresses . Paul was soon equipped with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Bedouin shoes . A native of Malta , , he was very probably of Arab descent in part , and his dark complexion and long black beard would enable him readily to pass for one born under the sun of Egypt . As for myself , I could not look the swarthy Arab of the desert , and the dress of * On my return to Alexandria , I learned that M. Linant had reported that it would be cheaper to get stone from the quarries . After all , it is perhaps to be regretted that he had not gone on , as the mystery that overhangs the pyramids will probably never be removed until one of them is pulled down , and every stone removed , under the direction of some friend of science and the arts . /q/ the Turkish houaja or gentleman , with the necessary arms and equipments , was very expensive ; so I provided myself with the unpretending and respectable costume of a Cairo merchant ; a long red silk gown , with a black abbas of camels hair over it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled round it as a turban ; white trousers , large red shoes over yellow slippers , blue sash , sword , and a pair of large Turkish pistols . Having finished my purchases in the bazaars , I returned to my hotel ready to set out , and found the dromedaries , camels , and guides , and expected to find the letter for the governor of Akaba , which , at the suggestion of M. Linant , I had requested Mr. Gliddon to procure for me . I now learned , however , from that gentleman , that to avoid delay it would be better to go myself , first sending my caravan outside the gate , and representing to the minister that I was actually waiting for the letter , in which case he would probably give it to me immediately . I accordingly sent Paul with my little caravan to wait for me at the tombs of the califs , and , attended by the consul 's janizary , rode up to the citadel , and stopped at the door of the governor 's palace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his excellency , I saw a man whipped ; this time I saw one bastinadoed . I had heard much of this , a punishment existing , L believe , l5 /z/ only in the East , but I had never seen it inflicted before , and hope I never shall see it again . As on the former occasion , I found the little governor standing at one end of the large hall of entrance , munching , and trying causes . A crowd was gathered around , and before him was a poor Arab , pleading and beseeching most piteously , while the big tears were rolling down his cheeks ; near him was a man whose resolute and somewhat angrj expression marked him as the accuser , seeking vengeance rather than justice . Suddenly the governor made a gentle movement with his hand ; all noise ceased ; all stretched their necks and turned their eager eyes towards him ; the accused cut short his crying , and stood with his mouth wide open , and his eyes fixed upon the governor . The latter spoke a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unintelligible , and , indeed , scarcely audible , but they seemed to fall upon the quick ears of the culprit like bolts of thunder ; the agony of suspense was over , and without a word or look , he laid himself down on his face at the feet of the governor . A space was immediately cleared around ; a man on each side took him by the . hand , and stretching out his arms , kneeled upon and held them down , while another seated himself across his neck and shoulders . Thus nailed to the ground , the poor fellow , knowing that there was no chance of escape , threw up his feet from the knee-joint , so as to present the soles /q/ in a horizontal position . Two men came forward with a pair of long stout bars of wood , attached together by a cord , between which they placed the feet , drawing them together with the cord so as to fix them in their horizontal position , and leave the whole flat surface exposed to the full farce of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing ready , one at each side , armed with long whips much resembling our common cowskin , but longer and thicker , and made of the tough hide of the hippopotamus . While the occupation of the judge was suspended by these preparations , the janizary had presented the oonsuPs letter . My sensibilities are not particularly acute , but they yielded in this instance . I had watched all the preliminary arrangements , nerving myself for what was to come ; but when I heard the scourge whizzing through the air , and when the first blow fell upon the naked feet , saw the convulsive movements of the body , and heard the first loud piercing shriek , I could stand it no longer ; I broke through the crowd , forgetting the governor and everything else , except the agonizing sounds from which I was escaping ; but the janizary followed close at my heels , and , laying his hand upon my arm , hauled me back to the governor . If I had consulted merely the impulse of feeling , I should have consigned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks , to the lower regions ; but it was all important /z/ not to offend this summary dispenser of justice , and I never made a greater sacrifice . of feeling to expediency than when I re-entered his presence . The shrieks of the unhappy criminal were ringing through the chamber , but the governor received me with as calm a smile as if he had been sitting on his own divan , listening to the strains of some pleasant music , while I stood with my teeth clinched , and felt the hot breath of the victim , and heard the whizzing of the accursed whip , as it fell again and again upon his bleeding feet . I have heard men cry out in agony when the sea was raging , and the drowning man , rising for the last time upon the mountain waves , turned his imploring arms towards us , and with his dying breath called in vain for help ; but I never heard such heart-rending sounds as those from the poor bastinadoed wretch before me . I thought the governor would never make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed it to him for his signature , although it contained but half a dozen lines ; he fumbled in his pocket for his seal , and dipped it in the ink ; the impression did not suit him , and he made another ; and , after a delay that seemed to me eternal , employed in folding it , handed it to me with a most gracious smile . I am sure I grinned horribly in return , and almost snatching the letter just as the last blow fell , I turned to hasten from the scene . The poor scourged wretch was silent ; he had found /q/ relief in insensibility ; I cast one look upon the senseless body , and saw the feet laid open in gashes , and the blood streaming down the legs . At that moment the bars were taken away , and the mangled feet fell like lead upon the floor . J had to work my way through the crowd , and , before I could escape , I saw the poor fellow revive and by the first natural impulse rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stepped upon red-hot irons . He crawled upon his hands and knees to the door of the hall , and here it was most grateful to see that the poor miserable , mangled , and degraded Arab yet had friends whose hearts yearned towards him ; they took him in their arms and carried him away . I was sick of Cairo , and in a right humour to bid farewell to cities , with all their artificial laws , their crimes and punishments , and all the varied shades of inhumanity from man to man , and in a few minutes I was beyond the gate , and galloping away to join my companions in the desert . At the tombs of the califs I found Paul with my caravan ; but I had not yet escaped the stormy passions of men . With the cries of the poor Arab still ringing in my ears , I was greeted with a furious quarrel , arising from the apportionment of the money I had paid my guides . I was in no humour to interfere , and , mounting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as he best could , I rode on alone . /z/ It was a journey of no ordinary interest on which I was now beginning my lonely way . I had travelled in Italy , among the mountains of Greece , the plains of Turkey , the wild steppes of Russia , and the plains of Poland , but neither of these afforded half the material for curious expectation that my journey through the desert promised . After an interval of four thousand years I wks about to pursue the devious path of the children of Israel , when they took up the bones of Joseph and fled before the anger of Pharaoh , among the mountain passes of Sinai , and through that great and terrible desert which shut them from the Land of Promise . I rode on in silence and alone for nearly two hours , and , just as the sun was sinking behind the dark mountains of Mokattam , halted to wait for my little caravan ; and I pitched my tent for the first night in the desert , with the door opening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab Political Economy .  --  A projected Rail* road .  --  The Sirocco.  --  Suez .  --  A travelled Englishman . The Red Sea .  --  Embarcation of Pilgrims .  --  A Misadventure.  --  Scriptural Localities .  --  The bitter Fountain . Thb arrangements for my journey as far as Mount Sinai had been made by Mr. Gliddon . It was necessary to have as my guides some of e Bedouins from around most implicit confidence ; and possessing another not less powerful recommendation , in the fact that he had been with Messrs . Linant and Labord to Petra . My caravan consisted of eight camels and dromedaries , and , as guide and camel-drivers , three young Bedouins from nineteen to twenty-two years old . My tent was the common tent of the Egyptian soldiers , bought at the government factory , easily carried , and as easily pitched ; my bedding was a mat tress and coverlet ; and I had , moreover , a couple of boxes , about eighteen inches high , and the width of my mattresd , filled with eatables , which I carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon each side , and at night , by the addition of two pieces of board , converted into a bedstead . My store of provisions consisted of bread , biscuit , rice , macaroni , tea , cofiPee , dried apricots , oranges , a roasted leg of mutton , and two of the largest skins containing the filtered water of the Nile . In the evening , while we were sitting around a fire , I inquired the cause of the quarrel from which I had escaped , and this led Toualeb into an explanation of some of the customs of the Bedouins . There exists among them that community of interest and property for which radicals and visionaries contend in civilized society . The property of the tribe is to a great extent common , and their earnings , or the profits of their labour , are shared among the whole . A Bedouin 's wives are his own ; and as the chastity of women is guarded by the most sanguinary laws , his children are generally his own ; his tent , also , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his tribe . The practical operation of this law is not attended with any great difficulty ; for , in general , the rest or that which belongs to the tribe , is nothing ; there are no hoarded treasures , no coffers of wealth , the bequest of ancestors , or the gains of enterprise and industry , to excite the cupidity of the avaricious . Poor is the Bedouin born , and poor he dies , and his condition is more than usually prosperous when his poverty does not lead him to the shedding of blood . /q/ I did not expect to learn lessons of political economy among the Bedouin Arabs ; but , in the commencement of my journey with them , I found the embarrassment and evil of trammelling individual enterprise and industry . The consul had applied to Toualeb . Toualeb was obliged to propose the thing to such of his tribe as were then in Cairo , and all had a right to participate . The consequence was , that when we were ready to move , instead of five there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men whom I had left wrangling at the tombs of the califs ; and even when it was ascertained that cmly five were wanted , still three supernumeraries were sent , that all might be engaged in the work . In countries where the labour of man and beast has a per diem value , the loss of the labour of three or four men and three or four camels would be counted ; but , in the East , time and labour have no value . I do not mean to go into any dissertations on the character of the Bedouins , and shall merely refer to such traits as fell under my observation and were developed by circumstances . While I was eating my evening meal , and talking with Toualeb , the three young camel-drivers sat at the door of the tent , leaning on their hands and looking at me . I at first did not pay much attention to them , but it soon struck me as singular that they did not prepare their own meal ; and . /z/ noticiDg them more attentively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at the smoking pilau before me . I asked them why they did not eat their supper ; and they told me that their matters had sent them away without a particle of anything to eat . I was exceedingly vexed at this , insomudi as it showed that I had four mouths to feed more than I had prepared for ; no trifling matter on a journey in the desert and one which Paul , as my quartermaster , said it was utterly impossible to accomplish . I at first told one of them to mount my dromedary and go back to Cairo , assuring him that , if he did not retium before daylight , I would follow and have both him and his master bastinadoed ; but before he had mounted I changed my mind , I hated all returns and delays , and , smothering my wrath , told Paul to give them some rice and biscuit , at the risk of being obliged to come down to Arab bread myself . And so ended the first day of my journey . Early in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising sun . " Before midday we were in as perfect a desert as if we were removed thousands of miles from the habitations of men ; behind , before , and around us was one wide expanse of level and arid sands , although we were as yet not more than eight hours from the crowded city of Cairo ; and I might already cry out , in the spirit of Neukomms famous cfh /z/ yatiiia , ** The sea , the sea , the open sea f ' Indeed , in all the travelling in the East , nothing strikes one more forcibly than the quick transitions from the noise of cities to the stillness of the unpeopled waste . It does , indeed , appear remarkable that , within so short a distance from Cairo , a city of so great antiquity and large population , and on a road which we know to have been travelled more than four thousand years , and which at this day is the principal route to the Red Sea , there is so little travelling . During the whole day we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps twenty or thirty camels . But a mighty change will soon be made in this particular . A railroad is about to be constructed across the desert , over the track followed by the children of Israel to the Red Sea . The Pacha had already ordered iron from England for the purpose when I was in Egypt , and there is no doubt of its practicability , being only a distance of eighty miles over a dead level ; but whether it will ever be finished , or whether , if finished , it will pay the expense , is much more questionable . Indeed , the better opinion is that the Pacha does it merely to bolster up his reputation in Europe as a reformer ; that he has begun without calculating the costs ; and that he will get tired and abandon it before it is half completed . It may be , however , that the reader will one day be hurried by a steam- /z/ engine over the route which I was now crossing at the slow pace of a camel ; and when that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey in the desert will be over . There will be no more pitching of tents , or sleeping under the starry firmament , surrounded by Arabs and camels ; no more carrying provisions , and no danger of dying of thirst ; all will be reduced to the systematic tameness of a cotton-factory , and the wild Arab will retire farther into the heart of the desert , shunning , like our native Indians , the faces of strangers , and following for ever the footsteps of his wandering ancestors . Blessed be my fortune , improvement had not yet actually begun its march . In the course of the night I was suddenly awakened by a loud noise like the flapping of sails . A high wind had risen , and my tent not being well secured , it had turned over , so that the wind got under it and carried it away . In the civilized world , we often hear of reverses of fortune which reduce a man to such a state that he has not a roof to cover him ; but few are ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way as this , and it is but fair to add that few have ever got it back so expeditiously . I opened my eyes upon the stars , and saw my house fleeing from me . Paul and I were on our feet in a moment , and gave chase , and , with the assistance of our Arabs , brought it back and planted it again ; I thought /q/ of the prudent Kentuckian who tied his house to a stump to keep it from being blown away , and irould have done the same thing if I could have found a stump ; but tree or stump in the desert there is none . I was not disturbed again during the night ; but the wind continued to increase , and towards morning and all the next day blew with great violence . It was the dread sirocco , the wind that has for ever continued to blow over the desert , carrying with it the fine particles of sand which , by the continued action of centuries , have buried the monuments , the temples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangerous , and sometimes , if the reports of travellers be true , sufibcating and burying whole caravans of men and camels . Fortunately for me , it was blowing upon my back ; but still it was necessary to draw my Arab cloak close over my head ; and even then the particles of sand found their way within , so that my eyes were soon filled with them . This was very far from being one of the worst airoccos ; but the sun was obscured , the atmosphere was a perfect cloud of sand , and the tracks were so completely obliterated , that a little after midday we were obliged to stop and take shelter under the lee of a hillock of sand ; occasionally we had met caravans coming upon us through the thick clouds of sand , the Arabs riding with their backs to the heads of their camels , and their faces /z/ covered , so that not a single feature could be seen . By the third morning the wind had somewhat abated , but the sand had become so scattered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcibly reminded of a circumstance related to me by Mr. Waghorn . A short time before I met him at Cairo , in making a hurried march from Suez , with an Arab unaccustomed to the desert , he encamped about midway , and , starting two hours before daylight , continued travelling , half asleep , upon his dromedary , until it happened to strike him that the sun had risen in the wrong places and was then shining in his face instead of warming his back ; he had been more than three hours retracing his steps to Suez . If I had been alone this morning , I might very easily have fallen into the same or a worse error . The prospect before me was precisely the same , turn which way I would ; and if I had been left to myself , I might have wandered as long as the children of Israel in search of the Promised Land before I should have arrived at the gate of Suez . We soon came in sight of the principal , per haps the only object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Suez . It is a large palm-tree , standing alone about half way across , the only green and living thing on that expanse of barrenness . We saw it two or three hours ; and , moving with the slow pace of our camels , it seemed /z/ AS if we should never reach it ; and then , again , as it we should never leave it behind us . A journey in the desert is so barren of incident , that wayfarers note the smallest circumstances , and our relative distance from the palm-tree , or half-way house , furnished occupation for a great part of the day . . At about twelve oVlock the next day we caught the first view of the Red Sea , rolling between the dark mountains of Egypt and Arabia , as in the days of Pharaoh and Moses . In an hour more we came in sight of Suez , a low dark spot on the shore , above the commencement of the chains of mountains on each side . About two hours before arriving , we passed , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the direct road to Akaba , built by the Pacha as a stopping-place , for the pilgrims on their way to Mecca . Three days before , more than thirty thousand pilgrims had halted in and around it , but now not a living being was to be seen . About half an hour on the hither side of Suez we came to a well , where , for the first time since we left Cairo , we watered our camels . Even among the miserable cities of Turkey and Egypt , few present so wretched an appearance as Suez . Standing on the borders of the desert , and on the shore of the sea , with bad and unwholesome water , not a blade of grass growing tround it , and dependant upon Cairo for the food that supports its inhabitants , it sustains a poor existence by the trade of the great caravan for /z/ Mecca , and the small commerce between the ports of Cosseir , Djiddeh , and Mocha . A new project has lately been attempted here , which , it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . The route to India by the Red Sea is in the full tide of successful experiment ; the English flag is often seen waving in the harbour ; and about once in two months an English steamer arrives from Bombay ; but even the clatter of a steamboat is unable to infuse life into its sluggish population . The gate was open , a single soldier was lying on a mat basking in the sun , his musket gleaming brightly by his side , and a single cannon projected over the wall , frowning with Tom Thumb greatness upon the stranger entering the city . Passing the gate , we found ourselves within a large open space crowded with pilgrims . Even the small space enclosed by the walls was not more than one quarter occupied by buildings , and these few were at the farthest extremity . The whole intermediate area was occupied by pilgrims , scattered about in every imaginable position and occupation , who stared at me as I passed among them in my European dress , and noticed me according to their various humours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and respectful salaam , and others with the black look and ferocious scowl of the bigoted and frank-detesting Mussulmans . We stopped in the square in front of the harbour , /q/ and inquired for an Englishman , the agent of Mr. Waghom , to whom I had a letter , and from whom I hoped to obtain a bed ; but he had arrived only two days before , and I doubt whether he had one for himself . He did all he could for me , but that was very little . I remember one thing about him , which is characteristic of a class of European residents in Egypt ; he had lived fourteen years between Alexandria and Cairo , and had never been in the desert before , and talked as if he had made a voyage to Babylon or Bagdad . He had provided himself with almost everything that his English notions of comfort could suggest , and with these he talked of his three days ' journey in the desert as a thing to be done but once in a mans life . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was as kind as he could be to me , and in one thing I felt very sensibly the benefit of bis kindness . By bad management my waterskins , instead of being old and seasoned , were entirely new ; the second day out the water was injured , and the third it was not drinkable . I did not suffer so much as Paul and the Arabs did , having fallen into the habit of drinking but little , ind assuaging my thirst with an orange ; but I suffered from a cause much worse ; my eyes were badly inflamed , and the water was so much imprnated with the noxious absorption from the leather , that it destroyed the effect of the powders which I diluted in it , and aggravated instead of /z/ relieving the inflammation . The Englishman had used kegs made for the purpose , and had more than a kegf ul left , which he insisted on my taking . One can hardly imagine that the giving or receiving a keg of water should be a matter of any moment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allimportant as it was to me for the rest of my journey , I hesitated to deprive him of it . Before going , however , I filled one of my skins , and counted it at the time one of the most valuable presents I had ever received . He had been in the desert , too , the same day that we suffered from the sirocco , and his eyes were in a worse condition than mine . The first thing he did was to find me a place to pass the night in . Directly opposite the open space was a large roquel or stone building , containing a ground and upper floor , and open in the centre , forming a hollow square . The whole building was divided by partitions into perhaps one hundred apartments , and every one of these and the open square outside were filled with pilgrims . The apartments consisted merely of a floor , roof , door , and walls , and sometimes one or the other of these requisites was wanting , and its deficiency supplied by the excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second story , and had a most unnecessary and uncomfortable proportion of windows ; but I had no choice . I regretted that I had not pitched my tent outside /z/ the walls ; but , calling to my assistance the inge* nuitjrand contriving spirit of my country , fastened it up as a screen to keep the wind from coming upon me too severely , and walked out to see the little that was to be seen of Suez . I had soon made a tour of the town ; and , having performed this duty , I hurried where my thoughts and feelings had long been carrying me , to the shore of the sea . Half a dozen vessels of lome eighty or a hundred tons , sharp built , with tall spars for latteen sails , high poops , and strangely painted , resembling the ancient ships of war , or the Turkish corsair or Arab pirate of modem days , were riding at anchor in the harbour , waiting to take on board the thousands of pilgrims who were all around me . I followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely alone . I sat down under the wall , where I had an extensive view down the sea , and saw the dace where the waters divided for the passage of the Israelites . Two hours I strolled along the shore , and when the sun was sinking behind the dark mountains of Mokattain , I was bathing my feet in the waters of the coral sea . Early in the morning I went out on the balcony , and looking down into the open Square , filled with groups of pilgrims , male and female , sleeping on the bare ground , in all manner of attitudes , I saw directly under me a dead Tartar . He had died during the night , his deathbed a single m2 /z/ plank , and he was lying in the sheepskin dress nrhich he wore when living . Two friends from the frozen regions of the north , companions in his long pilgrimage , were sitting on the ground pre  - -  paring their morning coffee , and my Arabs were sleeping by his side , unconscious that but a few feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal spirit had been called away . I gazed long and steadfastly upon the face of the dead Tartar , and moralized very solemnly  --  indeed , painfully  --  upon the imaginary incidents which my fancy summoned up in connexion with his fate . Nor was the possibility of my own death , among strangers in a distant land , the least prominent or least saddei ) Jng portion of my reverie . . I ascribe this uncommon moping fit to my exposing myself before breakfast . The stomach must be fortified , or force , moral and physical , is gone , and melancholy and blue devils are the inevitable consequence . After breakfast I was another creature . My acute sensibility , my tender sympathies , were gone ; and , when I went put again , I looked upon the body of the dead Tartar with the utmost indifference . The pilgrims were now nearly all stirring , and the square was all in motion . The balcony , and , indeed , every part of the old roquel , were filled with the better class of pilgrims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in an apartment opening on the balcony , immediately next /q/ to mine , sat a beautiful Circassian , with the regular features and brilliant complexion of her country . By her side were two lovely children , fair and beautiful as their mother . Her face was completely uncovered , for she did not know that a stranger was gazing on her , and , turning from the black visages around him to her fair and lovely face , was revelling in recollections of the beauties of his native land . And the virtue of a breakfast ! I , that by looking upon a dead Tartar had buried myself in the deserts of Arabia , written my epitaph , and cried over my own grave , was now ready to break a lance with a Turk to rob him of his wife . The balcony and staircase were thronged with pilgrims , many still asleep , so that I was obliged to step over their bodies in going down , and out of doors the case was much the same . At home I should have thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their pilgrimage to Mecca ; but , long before I had seen them start from the gate of Cairo , my feelings were essentially changed . I had hired my caravan for Mount Sinai ; but , feeling rather weak , and wishing to save myself six days ' journey in the desert , I endeavoured to hire a boat to go down the Red Sea to Tor , supposed to be the Elim , or place of palm-trees , mentioned in the Exodus of the Israelites , and only two days ' journey from Mount Sinai . The boats were all /z/ taken by the pilgrims , and these holy travellers were packed together as closely as sheep on board one of our North River sloops for the New- York market . They were a filthy set , many of them probably not changing their clothes from the time they left their homes until thei reached the tomb of the Prophet . I would rather not have travelled with them ; but , as it was my only way of going down the sea , I applied to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck of a boat for myself and servant ; but he advised me not to think of such a thing . He told me if I hired and paid for such a space , the pilgrims would certainly encroach upon me ; that they would beg , and borrow , and at last rob me ; and , above all , that they were bigoted fanatics , and , if a storm occurred , would very likely throw me overboard . With this character of his brethren from a true believer , I abandoned the idea of going by sea , and that the more readily , as his account was perfectly consistent with what I had before heard of the pilgrims . The scene itself did not sustain the high and holy character of a pilgrimage . As I said before , all were abominably filthy ; some were sitting around a great dish of pilau , thrusting their hands in it up to the knuckles , squeezing the boiled rice and throwing back their heads as they crammed the huge morsel down their throats ; others packing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whetting their sabres ; others wrangling for a Mew paras ; and in one place wai an Arab butcher , liare-legged and naked from the waist upward , with his hands , breast , and face smeared with blood , leaning over the body of a slaughtered camel , brandishing an axe and chopping off huge jHeces of meat for the sXirrounding pilgrims . A little off from the shore a large party were embarking on board a small boat to go down to their which was lying at the mouth of the harbour ; they were wading up to their middle every one with something on his shoulders or above his head . Thirty or forty had already got on board , and as maay more were trying to do the same ; but the boat was already full . A loud wrangUng commenced , succeeded by clinching , throttling , splashing in the water , and running to the shore . I saw bright swords gleaming in the air , beard the ominous click of a pistol , and in one moment more blood would have been shed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene from the govemor ' ' s balcony , and now dashmg in among them with a huge silver-headed mace , and laying about him right and left , brought the turbulent pilgrims to a condition more suited to their sacred character . At about nine olock I sent off my camels to go round the head of the gulf , intending to cross over in a boat and meet them . At the moment they left the roquel , two friends were holding up /z/ a quilt before the body of the dead Tartar , while ft third was within , washing and preparing it for burial . At twelve oclock I got on board my boat ; she was like the others , sharp built , with k high poop and tall latteen sails , and , for the firs time in all my travelling , I began to think a voyage better than a journey . In addition to the greater ease and pleasantness , there was something new and exciting in the passage of the Red Sea ; and vtre had hardly given our large latteen sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rais about carrying me down to Tor ; but he told me the boat was too small for such a voyage , and money would not induce him to attempt it . Late in the afternoon we landed on the opposite side , on the most sacred spot connected with the wanderings of the Israelites , where they rose from the dry bed of the sea , and , at the command of Moses , the divided waters rushed together , overwhelming Pharaoh and his chariots , and the whole host of Egypt . With the devotion of a pious pilgrim , I picked up a shell and put it in my pocket as a memorial of the place , and then Paul and I , mounting the dromedaries which my guide had brought down to the shore in readiness , rode to a grove of palm-trees , shading a fountain of bad water , called Ayoun Moussa , or the fountain of Moses . I was riding carelessly along , looking behind me towards the sea , and had almost reached the grove of palm-trees , when a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dromedary , frightened with their sodden whizzing , stirted back and threw me twenty feet over his head , completely clear of his long neck , and left me sprawling in the sand . It was a mercy I did not finish my wanderings where the children of Israel began theirs ; but I saved my head at the expense of my hands , which sank in the loose io3 up to the wrist , and bore the marks for more than two months afterward . I seated myself where I fell , and , as the sun was just dipping bdow the horizon , told Paul to pitch the tent , with the door towards the place of the miraculous passage . I shall never forget that sunset scene , and it is the lasit I shall inflict upon the reader . I was sitting on the very spot where the chosen people of God , after walking over the dry bed of the sea , stopped to behold the divided waters returning to their place and swallowing up the host rf the pursuers . The mountains on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eonscious witnesses of the mighty miracle , while the sun , descending slowly behind them , long after it had disappeared , left a reflected brightness , which illumined with an almost supernatural light the dark surface of the water . But to return to the fountain of Moses . I am aware that there is some dispute as to the precise spot where Moses crossed ; but , having no time for scepticism on such matters , I began by making up my mind that this was the place , and then /z/ looked round to see whether , according to the account given in the Bible , the face of the country and the natural landmarks did not sustain mj opinion . I remember I looked up to the bead of the gulf , where Suez or Kolsum now stands , and paw that almost to the very head of the gulf there was a high range of mountains which it would be necessary to cross , an undertaking which it would have been physically impossible for six hundred thousand people , men , women , and children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Suez , Moses could not have been hemmed in as he was ; he could go off into the Syrian Desert , or , unless the sea has greatly changed since that time , round the head of the gulf . But here , directly opposite where I sat , was an opening in the mountains , making a clear passage from the desert to the shore of the sea . It is admitted that , from the earliest history of the country , there was a caravan route from the Rameseh of the Pharaohs to this spot , and it was perfectly clear to my mind that , if the account be true at all , Moses had taken that route ; that it was directly opposite me , between the two mountains , where he had come down with his multitude to the shore , and that it was there he had found himself hemmed in , in the manner described in the Bible , with the sea before him , and the army of Pharaoh in his rear ; it was there he had stretched out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PR the very spot where I sat , th childrm of Israel had kneeled upon the sands to offer thanks to God for his miraculous interpodtxxi . The distance , too , was in confirmation of this opinion . It was about twenty miles across ; the distance which that immense multitude , with their necessary baggage , could have passed in the space of time ( a night ) mentioned in the Bible . Be iide3 my own judgment and conclusions , I had authority or the spot , in my Bedouin Toualeb , who talked of it with as much certainty as if he had seen it himself ; and , by the waning light of the moon , pointed out the metes and bounds according to the tradition received from his fathers . And even yet , said he , . on a still evening like this , or sometimes when the sea is raging , the ghosts pf the departed Egyptians are seen walking upon the waters ; and once , when , after a long day ' ' s journey , I lay down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost of Pharaoh himself , with the crown upon his head , flying with his chariot and horses over the face of the deep ; and even to this day the Arab , diving for coral , brings up fragments of swords , broken helmets , or chariot wheels , swallowed up with the host of Egypt. ** Early the next morning we resumed our journey , and travelled several hours along a sandy valley , diverging slowly from the sea and approaching the mountains on our left . The day 's 25t INCIDENTS OF TRAVEL . journey was barren of incident , though not/void of interest . We met only one small caravan of Bedouins , with their empty sacks , like the children of Jacob of old , journeying from a land of famine to a land of plenty . From time to time we passed the bones of a camel bleaching on the sand , and once the body of one just dead , his eyes already picked out , and their sockets hollow to the brain . A huge vulture was standing over him , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole head stained with blood . I drove the horrid bird away ; but , before I had got out of sight , he had again fastened on his prey . The third day we started at seven o'clock , and , after three hours of journeying , entered among the mountains of Sinai . The scene was now entirely changed in character ; the level expanse of the sandy desert for the wild and rugged mountain-pass . At eleven we came to the fountain of Marah , supposed to be that at which the Israelites rested after their three days ' journey from the Red Sea . There is some uncertainty as to the particulars of this journey ; the print of their foot steps did not long remain in the shifting sands ; their descendants have long been strangers in the land ; and tradition but imperfectly supplies the ' want of more accurate and enduring records . O the general fact there is no doubt ; no other road from the Red Sea to Mount Sinai has existed ! since the days of Moses , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature and the natural landmarks have remained so totally unchanged . Then , as now , it was a barren mountainous region , bare of verdure and destitute of streams of living water ; so that the Almighty was obliged to sustain his people with manna from heaven and water from the rocks . But travellers have questioned whether this is the fountain of Marah . The Bible account is rimple and brief : ** They went three days into the wilderness , and found no water ; and when they came to Marah , they could not drink of the waters of Marah , for they were bitter . ' ' Burck-* hardt objects that the distance is too short for three days ' journey , but this cavil is sufficiently answered by others ; that the movements of such an immense multitude , of all ages and both sexes , with flocks and cattle , which they must have had for the sacrifices , if for no other purpose , must necessarily have been slow . Besides , supposing the habits of the people to have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumption is rather that they would march slowly than push on with speed , after the danger of pursuit was over . Time is thought of little consequence by the Arabs ; and , as the Jews were Arabs , it is probable that the same was a feature of their character also . At all events , I was disposed to consider this the fountain , and would fain have performed the duty of a pious pilgrim by making /z/ my noonday meal at its brink ; but , as in the days of Moses , we could not drink of the waters of Marahy " for they were bitter . " I do not wonder that the people murmured , for even our camels would not drink of them . The ground around the fountain was white with salt . In about two hours more we came to the valley of Gherondel , a large valley with palm-trees ; away at the right , in the mountains , is another spring of water , which Shaw makes the bitter fountain of Moses , the water being also undrinkable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always liappened with him when he had a headache , he thought he was going to die* As soon as we pitched our tent I made him lie down ; and , not knowing how to deal with his real and fancied ailments , gave him some hot tea , and then piled upon him quilts , blankets , empty sacks , saddlecloths , and every other covering I could find , until he cried for quarter , I had no difficulty in cooking my own supper , and , I remember , tried the savage taste of my Bedouins with the China weed , which they liked exceedingly when so abundantly sweetened as utterly to destroy its flavour . /z/ e Aspect of the Mountains*  --  Arab Graves .  --  The Pacha and the Bedouins.  --  The Value of Water .  --  Perplexing Inscriptions .  - -  Habits of the Arabs .  --  Ethics of the Desert .  --  Breach of the Marriage Vow .  --  Arrival at the Convent .  --  An Excess of Welcome .  --  Greece and America .  --  Amor Patrise . In the morning Paul was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ; this , however , by no means agreed with his opinion , or Us appetite ; for , as he said , a man who rode a dromedary all day must eat or die . Late in the afternoon we passed a hill of stones , which Burckhardt calls the tomb of a saint ; but , according to Toualeb ' s account , and he spoke of it as a thing within his own knowledge , it was the tomb of a very different personage , namely , a woman who was surprised by her kindred with a paramour , and killed and buried on the spot ; on a little eminence above a few stones marked the place where a slave had been stationed to give the guilty pair a timely notice of approaching danger , but had neglected his important trust . Our road now lay between wild and rugged mountains , and the valley itself was stony , broken . /z/ and gullied by the washing of the winter torrents ; and a few straggling tbombushes were all that grew in that region of desolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment impressed it more and more forcibly upon my mind , that everything around me seemed old and in decay : the valley was barren and devastated by torrents ; the rocks were rent ; the mountains cracked , broken , and crumbling into thousands of pieces ; and we encamped at night between rocks which seemed to have been torn asunder by some violent convulsion , where the stones had washed down intp the valley , and the drifted sand almost choked the passage . It had been excessively hot during the day , and at night the wind was whistling around my tent as in mid-winter . Early in the morning we were again in motion , our route lying nearly all day in the same nar* row valley , bounded by the same lofty mountains . At every step the scene became more solemn and impressive ; all was still around us ; and not a sound broke the universal silence , except the soft tread of our camels , and now and then the voice of one of us ; but there was little iencouragement to garrulity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and interesting . Not a shrub or blade of grass grew on their naked sides , deformed with gaps and iSssures ; and they looked as if , by a slight jar or shake , they would crumble into millions of /q/ pieces . It is impossible to describe correctly the singularly interesting appearance of these mountains . Age , hoary and venerable , is the predominant character . They looked as if their great Creator had made them higher than they are , and their summits , worn and weakened by the action of the elements for thousands of years , had cracked and fallen . My days in the desert did not pass as quickly as I hurry through them here . They wore away , not slowly alone , but sometimes heavily ; and , to help them in their progress , I sometimes descended to very commonplace amusements . On one occasion I remember meeting a party of friendly Bedouins , and , sitting down with them to pipes and coffee , I noticed a fine lad of nineteen or twenty , about the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a wrestling-match . The old Bedouins took the precaution to remove their knives and swords , and it was well they did , for the two lads throttled each other like young furies ; and when mine received a pretty severe prostration on the sand , he first attempted to regain his sword , and , failing in that , sprang again upon his adversary with such ferocity that I was glad to have the young combatants taken apart , and still more glad to know that they were going to travel different roads . Several times we passed the rude buryinggrounds of the Bedouins , standing alone in the /z/ waste of sand , a few stones thrown together m. a heap marking the spot where an Arabs bones reposed ; but the wanderer of the desert looks forward to his final rest in this wild burying place of his tribe with the same feeling that animates the English peasant towards the churchyard of his native village , or the noble peer towards the honoured tomb of his ancestors . About noon we came to an irregular stone feice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly to the top of the adjacent mountainis , built as a wall by the Bedouins of Sinai during their war with the Pacha of Egypt . Among the strong and energetic measures of his government , Mohammed Aly had endeavoured to reduce these children of the desert under his iron rule ; to subject them to taxes , like his subjects of the Nile , and , worse , to establish his oppressive system of military conscription . But the free spirit of the untameable could not brook this invasion of their independence . They plundered his caravans , drank his best Mocha coffee , devoured his spices from Arabia and India , and clothed themselves and their wives in the rich silks intended for the harems of the wealthy Turks . Hassan Bey was sent against them with twenty-five hundred men ; four hundred Bedouins defended this pass for several days , when , craftily permitting him to force his way to the convent of Mount Sinai , the tribes gathered in /z/ force between him and the Red Sea , and held him there a prisoner until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which it was agreed that the Pacha should not invade tbdr territory , and that they would be his subjects , provided he would not call upon them for duties , or soldiers , or , indeed , for anything which should abridge their natural freedom ; or , in other words , that he might do as he pleased with them , provided he let them have their own way . It was , in fact , the schoolboy 's bargain , Let me alone and I will let you alone , and so it has been faithfully kept by both parties , and I have Ao doubt will continue to be kept , until one of them shall , have a strong probability of profit tod success in breaking it . Upon the whole , however , the Bedouins of Mount Sinai are ra  - -  tber afraid of Mohammed Aly , and he has a great rod over them in his power of excluding them from Cairo , where they come to exchange th dates and apricots for grain , clothing , weapons , and ammunition . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been great robbersy and now a robbery is seldom heard of imoDg them . For two days we had been suffering for want of water . The skins with which I had been provided by the consults janizary at Cairo were so new that they contaminated the water ; and it had at last become so bad , that , fearful /z/ of injurious effects from drinking it , and preferring the evil of thirst to that of sickness , I had poured it all out upon the sand . Toualeb had told me that some time during the day we should come to a fountain , but the evening was drawing nigh and we had not reached it . Fortunately , we had still a few oranges left , which served to moisten our parched mouths , and we were in the momentary expectation of coming to the water , when Toualeb discovered some marks , from which he told us that it was yet three hours distant We had no apprehension of being reduced to the extremity of thirst ; but , for men who had already been suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means pleasant During those three hours I thought of nothing but water . Rivers were floating through mj imagination , and , while moving slowly upon mj dromedary , with the hot sun beating upon mj head , I wiped the sweat from my face , anc thought upon the frosty Caucasus ; and when after travelling an hour aside from the mail track , through an opening in the mountains , wi saw a single palm-tree shading a fountain , ou progress was gradually accelerated , until , as wi approached , we broke into a run , and dashinj through the sand , and without much respect o persons , all threw ourselves upon the fountain . If any of my friends at home could have seei me then , they would have laughed to see mi /q/ flcrambling among a party of Arabs for a place around a fountain , all prostrate on the ground , with our heads together , for a moment raising them to look gravely at each other while we paused for breath , and then burying our noses again in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied , and I had time to look at it , I thought it lucky that I had not seen it before . It was not a fountain , but merely a depoiite of water in a hollow sandstone rock ; the surface was green , and the bottom muddy . Such as it was , however , we filled our skins and returned to the main track . We continued about an hour in the valley , rising gently until we found ourselves on the top of a little eminence , from which we saw before us another valley , bounded also by high rocky cliffs ; and directly in front , still more than a day 8 journey distant , standing directly across the road , and , as has been forcibly and truly said , looking like the end of the world , ** stood the towering mountains of Sinai . At the other end of the plain the mountains contracted , and on one side was an immense block of porphyry , which had fallen , probably , thousands of years ago . I could still see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trace its destructive course to the very spot where it now lay , itself almost a mountain , though a mere pebble when compared with the giant from which /z/ it came . I pitched my tent bj its side with the door open to the bolj mountain , as many a weary pilgrim had done before me . The rock was covered with inscriptions ; but I could not read them . I walked round and round it with Paol at my elbow looking eagerly for some small scrap , a single line , in a language we could read ; but all were strange , and at length we gave up the search . In several places in the wilderness of Sinai the rocks are filled with inscriptions , supposed to have been made by the Jews ; and finding those before me utterly beyond my comprehension , I resolved to carry them back to a respectable antiquity , and in many of the worn and faded characters to recognise the work of some wandering Israelite . I meditated , also , a desperate but noble deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ; but in this lonely desert they had left a record of themselves and of their language . I resolved to add one of my country 's also . Dwelling fondly in ima gination upon the absorbing interest with which some future traveller , perhaps from my own distant land , would stop to read on this lonely rock a greeting in his native tongue , I sought with great care a stone that would serve as a penciL It made a mark which did not suit me , and I laid it down to break it into a better shape , but unluckily smashed my fingers , and in one moment all my enthusiasm of sentiment was gone ; /q/ I crammed my fingers into my mouth , and danced about the rock in an agony of heroics ; and so my inscription remained unwritten . At seven o'clock of the tenth day from Cairo I was again on my dromedary , and during the whole thy the lofty top of Sinai was constantly before me . We were now in a country of friendly Arabs . The Bedouins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the escort of any child of that tribe was a sufficient protection . About nine o'clock Toualeb left me for his tent among the mountains . He was a little at a loss , having two wives living in separate tents , at some distance from each other , and he hesitated which to visit . I made it my business to pry into particulars , and found the substance of the Arabs nature not much difiPerent from other men 's . Old ties and a sense of duty called him to his old wife ; to her who had been his only wife when he was young and poor ; but something stronger than ( dd ties or the obligation of duty impelled him to his younger bride . Like the Prophet whom he Worshipped , he honoured and respected his old wife but his heart yearned to her younger and more lovely rival . The last was by far the most interesting day of my journey to Mount Sinai . We were moving dong a broad valley , bounded by ranges of lofty mud crumbling mountains , forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rocky and /z/ barren as these mountains seemed , on their were gardens which produced oranges , datei figs in great abundance . Here , on heights a inaccessible to any but the children of the d the Bedouin pitches his tent , pastures bis and goats , and gains the slender subsistence i sary for himself and family ; and often , looki the bare side of the mountain , we could see 6ummit ' *s edge the wild figure of a halfArab , with his long matchlock gun in his watching the movement of our little cai Sometimes , too , the eye rested upon the for woman stealing across the valley , not a tra or passer-by , but a dweller in the land whe smoke curled from the domestic hearth , ai sign of a habitation was perceptible . Ther something very interesting to me in the grei of my companions with the other young n their tribe . They were just returning from a ney to Cairo , an event in the life of a youn douin ; and they were bringing a stranger fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting had the coldness of frosty agi the reserve of strangers ; twice they would g touch the palms of each other ' s hands , mu few words , and in a moment the welcomers again climbing to their tents . One , I rem  - -  greeted us more warmly and stayed longer a us . He was by profession a beggar or robb occasion required , and wanted something from /q/ but it was not much ; merely some bread and a charge of powder . Not far from the track we saw , hanging on a thorn-bush , the black cloth of a Bedouin ' *s tent , with the pole ropes , pegs , and everything necessary to convert it into a habitation for a family . It had been there six months ; the owner had gone to a new pasture-ground , and there it had hung , and there it would hang , sacred and untouched , until he returned to claim it . ' It belongs to one of our tribe , and cursed be the band that touches it , ' * is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way ; and the poorest Bedouin , though a robber by birth and profession , would pass by and touch it not . On the very summit of the mountain , apparently ensconced behind it as a wall , his body not more than half visible , a Bedouin was looking down upon us ; and one of my party , who had long kept his face turned that way , told me that there was the tent of his father . I talked with him about his kindred and his mountain home , not expecting , however , to discover anything of extraordinary interest or novelty . The sons of Ishmael have ever been the same inhabitants of the desert , despising the dwellers under a roof , wanderers and wild men from their birth , with their hands against every man , and every man ' s hand against them . ** There is blood between us , ** says the Bedouin when he meets in the desert one of a /z/ tribe , by some individual of which an ancestor of his own was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they draw their swords , and a new account of blood is opened , to be handed down as a legacy to their children . ' Thy aunt wants thy purse , says the Bedouin when he meeU the stranger travelling through his wild domain* * The desert is ours , and every man who passes over it must pay us tribute . " These principal and distinguishing traits of the Bedouin character have long been known ; but as I had now been with them ten days , and expected to be with them a month longer , to see them in their tents , and be thrown among different tribes , claiming friendship from those who were enemies to each other , I was curious to know something of the lighter shades , the details of their lives and habits ; and I listened with exceeding interest while the young Bedouin , with his eyes constantly fixed upon it , told ne that for more than four hundred years the tent d his fathers had been in that mountain . Wild and unsettled , robbers and plunderers as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pur own ; and the tent , and the garden , and the little pastureground are transmitted from father to son for centuries . I have probably forgotten more than half of our conversation ; but I remember he told me that all the sons shared equally ; that the daughters took nothing ; that the children lived together ; that if any of the brothers got married , the /z/ property must be divided ; that if any difficulty arose on the division , the man who worked the place for a share of the profits must divide it ; and , lastly , that the sisters must remain with the brothers until they ( the sisters ) are married . I faked him , if the brothers did not choose to keep a dster with them , what became of her ; but he did not understand me . I repeated the question , but still he did not comprehend it , and looked to Us companions for an explanation . And when , at last , the meaning of my question became apparent to his mind , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible  --  she is his own blood. * I pressed my question again and again in various suggesting the possibility that the brother ' s wife might dislike the sister , and other very sup- posable cases ; but it was so strange an idea , that to the last he did not fully comprehend it , and his answer was still the same  --  " It is impossible  --  she is his own blood . ' ' Paul was in ecstasies at the noble answers of the young savage , and declared him the finest fellow he had ever met since he left Cairo . This was not very high praise , to be sure ; but Paul intended it as a compliment , and the young Bedouin was willing to believe him , though he could not exactly comprehend how Paul had found it out . I asked him who governed them ; he stretched himself up and answered in one word , GtMl. * " I adced him if they paid tribute to the Pacha ; m2 /z/ and his answer was , ** No ; we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We plunder his caravans . Desirous to understand my exact position with the sheik of Akaba , under his promise of protection , I asked him if they were governed by their sheik ; to which he answered , ** No ; we govern him . ' ' The sheik was their representative , their mouthpiece with the Pacha and with other tribes , and had a personal influence , but not more than any other member of the tribe . I asked him , if the sheik had promised a stranger to conduct him through his territory , whether the tribe would not consider themselves bound by his promise . He said no ; they would take the sheik apart , ask him what he was going to do with the stranger ; how much he was going to get ; and , if they were satisfied , would let him pass ; otherwise they would send him back ; but they would respect the promise of the sheik so far as not to do him any personal injury . In case of any quarrel or difference between members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adjust it ; but if one of them was wounded  --  - and he spoke as if this was the regular consequence of a quarrel  - -  upon his recovery he made out his account , charging a per diem price for the loss of his services , and the other must pay it . But what if he will not ? ** He must was the reply , given in the same tone with which he had before pronounced it ' impossible " for the brother to withhold protec- /z/ turn and shelter from his sister . If he does not , ke will be visited with the contempt of his tribe , and very soon he or one of his near relations will be killed . They have a law which is as powerful in its operations as any that we have , and it is a strange and not uninteresting feature in their social compact , that what we call public opinion should be as powerful among them as among civilized people , and that even the wild and lawless Bedouin , a man who may fight , rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contempt of his tribe . In regard to their yet more domestic habits , he told me that though the law of Mohammed allowed four wives , the Bedouin seldom took more than one , unless that one was barren or could not make good bread , or unless he fell in love with another girl , or could afford to keep more than one ; with these and some few other extraordinary exceptions , the Bedouin married but one wife ; and the chastity of women was protected by sanguinary laws , the guilty woman having her head cut off by her own relations , while her paramour , unless caught in the act , is allowed to escape ; the Arabs proceeding on the ground that the chastity of the woman is a pearl above all price ; that it is in her own keeping ; and that it is but part of the iniir-* mity of man 's nature to seek to rob her of it . The whole day we were moving between parallel ranges of mountains , receding in some places , and /z/ then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defile , boundi each side with precipitous granite rocks mate a thousand feet high . We entered at the bottom of this defile , moving for a time alon dry bed of a torrent , now obstructed with and stones , the rocks on every side shiverei torn , and the whole scene wild to sublimity , camels stumbled among the rocky fragmeu such a dree that we dismounted , and p through the wild defile on foot* At the othc we came suddenly upon a plain table of gr and before us towered in awful grandeur , so and dark that it seemed close to us and barrii farther progress , the end of my pilgrimage holy mountain of Sinai . On our left was a insulated stone , rudely resembling a chair , the chair of Moses , on which tradition says Moses rested himself when he came up wit people of his charge ; farther on , upon a eminence , are some rude stones , which are pc out as the ruins of the house of Aaron , whei great high-priest discoursed to the wand Israelites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden calf . But it was not i sary to draw upon false and frivolous legei give interest to this scene ; the majesty of n was enough . I felt that I was on holy gro and , dismounting from my dromedary . Id for more than an hour in the valley . It was /q/ I srat my shivering Bedouins forward , supposing myself to be at the foot of the mountain , and lingered there until after the sun had set . It was after dark as alone , and on foot , I entered the last defile leading to the holy mountain . The inoon had risen , but her light could not penetrate the deep defile through which I was toiling slowly on to the foot of Sinai . From about half way up it shone with a pale and solemn lustre , while below ill was in the deepest shade , and a dark spot on the due of the mountain , seeming perfectly black in contrast with the light above it , marked the situation of the convent . I passed a Bedouin tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large fire , and in a few moments stood at the foot of the convent wall . My camels were lying down eating their evening meal , and my Bedouins were asleep on the ground close under the walls . Knowing that they would not be admitted themselves , they had not demanded entrance ; and as I bad not told them to do so , they had not given notice of my coming . The convent was a very large building , and the high stone walls surrounding it , with turrets at the corners , gave it the appearance of a fortress . Exposed as they are to occasional attacks by the Bedouins , the holy fathers are sometimes obliged to have recourse to carnal weapons . The walls are accordipgly mounted with cannon , and there is no /z/ entrance except by a subterraneous passage under the garden , or by a small door in one of the walls , about thirty feet from the ground . My Bedouins had stopped under this door , and here we commenced shouting for admission , first singly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic ; but no one came to admit us . I was strongly reminded of the scene under the walls of the little convent in the desert , on my attempted expedition to the great Oasis . Then , as now , it was a moonlight night , and the scene was a convent , a lonely habitation of Christians , with its door closed against a tellow-Christian . I remember that then I had to force my way in and make my own welcome , and I resolved that no trifle should keep me from an entrance here . The convent belonged to the Greek church . I did not know how many monks were in it , or what was the sanctity of their lives , but I wished that some of them had slept with more troubled consciences , for we made almost noise enough to wake the dead ; and it was not until we had discharged two volleys of fire-arms that we succeeded in rousing any of the slumbering inmates . On one side were two or three little slits or portholes , and a monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand , cautiously thrust out his head at one of them , and demanded our business . This was soon told ; we were strangers and Christians , and wanted admission ; and had a letter from the /z/ AN EXCESS OF WELCOME . fttS Ofeek patriarch at Cairo . The head disappeared rom the loophole , and soon after I saw its owner dowlj open the little door , and let down a rope for the patriarchs letter . He read it by the feeble glimmer of his lamp , and then again ap* peared at the window , and bade us welcome . The fope was again let down ; I tied it around my anus ; and after dangling in the air for a brief Nu ; e , swinging to and fro against the walls , found myself clasped in the arms of a burly , longbearded monk , who hauled me in , kissed me on both cheeks , our long beards rubbing together in friendly union , and , untwisting the rope , set me upon my feet , and passed me over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks had assembled , and all pressed forward to welcome me . They shook my hand , took me in their arms , and kissed my face ; and if I had been their dearest friend just escaped from the jaws of death , they could not have received me with a more cordial greeting . Glad as I was , after a ten days journey , to . be received with such warmth by these recluses of the mountains , I could have spared the kissing . The custom is one of the detestable things of the East . It would not be so bad if it were universal , and the traveller might sometimes receive his welcome from rosy lips ; but , unhappily , the women hide their faces and run away from a stranger , while the men rub him with their bristly beards . At first I went at it with a stout n5 ST4 waBtasts or nATsu beftrt , iliteriiig mjmit that I could give as well aa tdce ; bat I soon ffincfaed and gave up . Their beafds were the fwth of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  --  and its downward aspirations must continue many a long day bre it would obtain the respectable longitude of theirs . During the Idsnng scene , a Bedouin servant came from the other end of the terrace with an armful of burning brush , and threw it in a Uuit upon the stony floor . The mcmks were gathered around , talking to me and uttering assurances of welcome , as I knew them to be , although I could not understand them ; and confused and almost stunned with their clamorous greeting , I threw mjuHf on the floor , thrust my feet in the fire , and called out for Paul , Twice the rope descended and brought up my tent , baggage , &c.; ; and the third time it brought up Paul , hung round with guns , pistols , and swords , like a travelling battery . The rope was wound up by a windlass , half a dozen monks , in long black frocks with white stripes , turning it with all their might . In the general eagerness to hdp , they kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and brought his neck up short under the beam , his feet struggling to hold on to the sill of the door . He roared out lustily in Greek and Arabic , and while they were helping to disencumber him o his multifarious armour , he was cursing and SUPERIOR OF THE CONVENT . f75 lierating them for a set of blundering workmen , who had almost broken the neck of as good a Christian as any among them . Probably since the last incursion of the Bedouins , the peaceful vails of the convent had not been disturbed by nich a deafening clatter . The monks had been roused from sleep , and - ome of them were hardly yet awake ; the supe* rior was the last who came , and his presence quicks ly restored order . He was a remarkably noble* looking old man , of more than sixty . He asked me my country , and called me his child , and told me that Ood would reward me for coming from so distant a land to do homage on the holy moun. tain ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or correct his mistake in supposing that the motive of my journey was purely religious ; and , looking upon me as a devout pilgrim , he led me through a long range of winding passages , which leemed like the streets of a city , into a small room spread with mats , having a pile of coverlets in one comer , and wearing an appearance of comfort that could be fully appreciated by one who had then qent ten nights in the desert . I threw myself on the mats with a feeling of gratitude , while the superior renewed his welcome , telling me that the convent was the pilgrim 's home , and that every-* thing it contained was mine for a week , a month , or the rest of my days . Nor did he neglect my immediate wants , but , with all the warmth and qwq Tbe superior was a Greek by birth , and though it was fioftr vears since be bad first come to the convent at Sinai , and twenty years since he entered it for the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with bis native land kept up by the occasional visits of pQgrims . He had heard of their bloody struge for liberty , and of what America had done for her in her hour of need , and he told me that , next to his own country , he loved mine ; and , by his kindness to me as an in  --  qwq I knew that this feeling existed in Greece , but I did not expect to find it thus glowing in the wilderness of Sinai . For myself , different in this respect from most other travellers , I liked the Greeks . Travellers and strangers condemn the whole people as dishonest , because they are cheated by their boatmen or muleteers , without ever thinking of their four centuries of bitter servitude ; but when I remembered their long oppression and galling chains , instead of wondering that they were so bad , I wondered that they were not worse . I liked the Greeks ; and when I talked of Greece and what I had seen there , of the Bavarians lord- /z/ ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the superior flushed and his eyes flashed fire ; and when I spoke of the deep interest their sufferings and their glorious struggle had created in America , the old man wept . Oh , who can measure the feeling that binds a man to his native land ! Though forty years an exile , buried in the wilderness , and neither expecting ; * nor wishing to revisit the world , he loved his country as if his foot now pressed her soil , and . under his monkish robe there owed a heart a ' patriotic as ever beat beneath a soldier 's corslet . The reader will excuse an unusual touch of sen  - -  sibility in me when he reflects upon my singulai position , sitting at the base of Mount Sinai , and hearing from the lips of a white-bearded Greek the praises of my beloved country . He sat with me till the ringing of the midnight bell for prayers , when I threw myself upon the mat , and , before the hollow sounds had died away in the cloisters , I was fast asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  The Grotto of Elias .  --  A Monkisli Legend .  --  The Pinnacle of Sinai .  --  Anchorites.  --  Mohammed and his Camel .  --  An Argument .  --  Legend of St. Catharine.  --  The Rock of the Tables .  --  The Stone struck by Moses .  --  Description of the Convent .  --  Habits and Character of its Inmates . The next day was one of the most interesting of my life . At eight o'clock I was breakfasting ; the superior was again at my side ; again offering me all the convent could give , and urging me to stay a month , a fortnight , a week , at least to 6pend that day with him , and repose myself after the fatigues of my journey ; but from the door of the little room in which I sat I saw the holy mountain , and I longed to stand on its lofty summit . Though feeble and far from weU , I felt the blood of health again coursing in my veins , and congratulated myself that I was not so hackneyed in feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was happy to find , for the prospective enjoyment of my farther journey , that the first tangible monument in the history of the Bible , the first spot that could be called holy ground , raised in me /z/ feelings that had not been awakened by the mosi classic ground of Italy and Greece , or the proud est monuments of the arts in Egypt . Immediately after breakfast I rose to ascend thi mountain . The superior conducted me throug the convent , which , even more than at nighty seemed like a small city , through long galleries built of stone , with iron doors , and finally throughm a long subterraneous passage to the outer garden a beautiful spot in the midst of the surround ing barrenness , now blooming with almonds and oranges , lemons , dates , and apricots , and shaded by arbours of grape-vines to the extreme end of the walls . At this moment I gave but a passing glance at the garden ; and hurrying on to the walls , where a trusty Arab was sitting as sentinel , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he is called , bidding me farewell , and telling me not to fatigue myself or be long away . At the foot of the wall I found Toualeb waiting orders for my final departure . He said that he must consult with his tribe before he could make any bargain ; and I told him to come to the convent in two days , prepared to start upon the third . Immediately behind the wall of the convent we began to ascend . A Bedouin dwarf , the first specimen of deformity I had seen among the Arabs , led the way , with a leathern bag of refreshments on his back . An old monk followed , with long white hair and beard , supporting himself by a /z/ to after him came a young novice from Corfuy ' lio spoke Italian , and then Paul and myself , or some time the ascent was easy . Ever since He establishment of the convent , it had been the *siness of the monks to improve the path to the p of the mountain ; and for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . half an hour we came to a beautiful fountain Vtnder an overhanging rock . Besides the hallowed localities in and around the mountain , consecrated Vfey scenes of Bible history , almost every spot has ome monkish legend , of which that connected " th the fountain is a specimen . Taking a long fJraught from its stony bed , our younger companion began the story somewhat in the usual Eastem form . " Once there was a poor shoemaker ' who , in making his pilgrimage to the holy mountain , on a hot day , sat down under the shade of the impending rock . He was an industrious man , and , while resting himself , took out his cobbling ma* terials , and began to cobble ; he was a good man , and while he sat there at his work , he thought of the wickedness of the world and its temptations , and how the devil was always roaming about after poor cobblers , and resolved to leave the world for ever , and live under that rock . There was no water near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this resolution , the water gushed forth , and s living fountain has remained there ever since . The same year there was a dispute between the /z/ Greek and Armenian patriarchs at Cairo , and to_the Pacha gave notice that he would decide in fiivomr* of him who should perform a miracle . This was more than either had power to do ; but the Gredk dreamed one night of the poor cobbler , and the next morning despatched a messenger to the mountain with a dromedary , and a request that the holy man should come and perform a miracle . The cobbler was a modest man , and said he would be glad to make a pair of shoes for the patriarch , but could not perform a miracle . The messenger , however , insisted upon taking him to Cairo where , roused into a belief of his own powers , he ordered a mountain to approach the city . The obedient mountain marched till it was told to stop , and there it stands to the present day . In half an hour more we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which , some two or three hundred years ago , certain holy men , who wished to separate themselves more completely from the world , had withdrawn from the convent , and here lived and died upon the mountain . The chapel had been fitted up several times , but the Bedouins had always entered and destroyed everything it contained . The situation was well suited for retirement ; quiet and isolated , but not dreary , and fitted for a calm and contemplative spirit . Paul was particularly struck with it ; and , in a moment of enthusiasm , said he would like to end his days there ; and , with his characteristic pruieacGf /q/ asked if he could get bis meals from the conTent . The monk did not approve his enthuliasm , and told him that his inspiration was of the vil and not of Ood , but suddenly said that there no hermits now ; that all men thought too Xich of eating and drinking , and indulging in Wuries ; sighed , . kissed the cross , asked Paul for cigar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitous rocks , we soon Cached a gate about three feet wide , where formerly , when pilgrimages to this place were more Sequent , a guard was stationed , to whom it was necessary to show a permission from the superior 4 ) f the convent . A little beyond this was another narrow passage secured by a door , where it was formerly necessary to show a pass from the keeper of the gate and where a dozen men could make a good defence against a thousand . Soon after we entered a large open space , forming a valley surrounded on all sides by mountains ; and on the left , high above the others , rose the lofty peak of Sinai . It is this part of the mountain which bears the sacred name of Horeb . In the centre , enclosed by a stone fence , is a tall cypress , the only tree on the mountain , planted by the monks more than t hundred years ago . Near it is a fountain , called the fountain of Elias , which the prophet dug with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brfore he was ordered by the Lord to Jerusalem . According to the monks , the prophet is still living /z/ somewhere in the world , wandering about ' Enoch , and preparing for the great final b with Antichrist . A little above is an old cbt with strong walls and iron doors , now falling dilapidated , and containing a grotto , called grotto of Elias , which , according to the leg formed the prophets sleeping-chamber . I era into the rocky cell , and , thanks to my trave experience , which had taught me not to be i dious in such matters , found the bedroom oi prophet by no means an uncomfortable pi often in the desert I would have been thankfu such a shelter . Here our dwarf left us , and , continuing ascent , the old monk still leading the way about a quarter of an hour came to a taU rock standing boldly out , and running down most perpendicularly an immense distance to valley . I was expecting another monkish 1 and my very heart thrilled when the monk me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses had sat during the battle of the Israi and the Amalekites , while Aaron and Hur ported his uplifted hands , until the sun went i upon the victorious arms of his people . Fron height I could see , clearly and distinctly , e part of the battle-ground , and the whole val Rephidim and the mountains beyond ; and Mi while on this spot , must have been visible to /q/ tending armies from every part of the field on hich they were engaged . Some distance farther on the old monk stopped , td , prostrating himself before a stone , kissed it devoutly , and then told me its history . He said hat the last time the monks in the convent were by the Arabs , when their communication " th Cairo was cut off , and death by the sword r famine staring them in the face , the superior proposed that they should put on their holiest Vestments , and , under the sacred banner of the cnross , ascend in a body , and for the last time sing their Te Deum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this stone they met a woman with a child , who told them that all their danger was over ; and , in accordance with her words , when they returned to the convent they found the Arabs gone , and forty camels from Cairo laden with provisions standing under the walls . Since that time they had never been molested by the Arabs , ** and there is no doubt , " continued the old monk , that the woman was the mother of God , and the child the Saviour of the world. ** But away with monkish superstition . I stand upon the very peak of Sinai , where Moses stood when he talked with the Almighty . Can it be , or is it a mere dream ? Can this naked rock have been the witness of that great interview betwe ; n man and his Maker ? where , amid thunder and /z/ lightning , and a fearful quaking of the mouni the Almighty gave to his chosen people the dous tables of his law , those rules of infinite dom and goodness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty towards his Gkd , his neighbour , himself ? The scenes of many of the incidents reoo in the Bible are extremely uncertain . Histo and geographers place the garden of Eden , paradise of our first parents , in different par Asia ; and they do not agree upon the site c &; tower of Babels the mountain of Ararat , and n of the most interesting places in the Holy Ia but of Sinai there is no doubt . This is the mountain ; and , among all the stupendous w of Nature , not a place can be selected more i for the exhibition of Almighty power . I ! stood upon the summit of the giant Etna , looked over the clouds floating beneath it , i the bold scenery of Sicily , and the distant m tains of Calabria ; upon the top of Vesu and looked down upon the waves of lava , anc ruined and half-recovered cities at its foot ; they are nothing compared with the terrific tudes and bleak majesty of Sinai . An obser traveller has well called it * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shrub , or blade of ( is to be seen upon the bare and rugged sid innumerable mountains , heaving their naked i mits to the skies , while the crumbling mass /z/ gfmte around , and the distant view of the Syrian iegert , with its boundless waste of sands , form he wildest and most dreary , the most terrific and desolate , picture that imagination can conceive . The level surface of the very top , or pinnacle , about sixty feet square . At one end is a single txxk about twity feet high , on which , as said he monk , the spirit of Ood descended , while in fae crevice beneath his favoured servant received the tables of the law . There , on the same spot here they were given , I opened the sacred book in which those laws are recorded , and read them with a deeper feeling of devotion , as if I were standing nearer and receiving them more directly from the Deity himself . The ruins of a church and convent are still to be seen upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built , monks and hermits used to retire , and , secluded from the world , sing the praises of God upon his chosen hill . Near this , also in ruins , stands a Mohammedan mosque ; for on this sacred spot the followers of Christ and Mohammed have united in worshipping the true and living Ood . Under the chapel is a herroits cell , where , in the iron age of fanaticism , the andiorite lingered out his days in fasting , meditaticm , and prayer . In the East , the fruitful parent of superstition , occurred the first instances of monastic life . A angle enthusiast withdrew himself from the society /z/ of his fellow-men , and wandered for years amon the rocks and sands of the desert , devoting self to the service of his Maker by the mistakeim homage of bodily mortification . The deep humi lity of the wanderer , his purity and sincerity , and the lashes and stripes he inflicted upon his worn and haggard body , excited the warm imaginations of the Christians of the East . Others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his example , emulating each other in self-punishment ; and he was accounted the most holy , and the most worthy to be received at the right hand of God , who showed himself most dead to all the natural feelings of humanity . The deserts of the Thebaid were soon covered with hermits ; and more than seventy thousand anchorites were wasting their lives in the gloomy wilds of Sinai , startling the solitude with the cries of their self-inflicted torture . The ruins of their convents are still to be seen upon the rudest mountain side , in the most savage chasm , or upon the craggiest top ; and , strange as the feeling may seem , my very soul cleaved to the scene around me . I too felt myself lifted above the world , and its petty cares and troubles , and almost hurried into the wild enthusiasm which had sent the tenants of these ruined convents to live and die among the mountains . Blame me not , reader , nor think me impious , that , on the top of the holy mountain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired at a partridge . The sound of my gun , ringing in frequent echoes Aom the broken and hollow rocks , startled and voused me ; and , chasing the bird down the mountain side , I again reached ' the place in f floreb , ** and threw myself on the ground under Ae palm-tree , near the fountain of Elias . I always endeavoured to make my noonday eal near some rock or ruin , some tree or fountain ; and I could not pass by the fountain of the lrophet . My Arab dwarf had anticipated my ants ; and now prepared some of the genuine Idocha , which every Arabian ( and an Arabian only ) knows how to prepare , exhaling an aroma hat refreshes and invigorates the wearied frame ; and , in the desert , a cordial more precious than the finest wines of France or Madeira . Seated under the palm-tree , monks . Bedouins , Paul , and myself , all together , eating , our frugal meal of bread and fruit , accompanied with long draughts from the fountain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consecrated in the eyes of all true Mussulmans by the legend of Mohammed and his camel . In one respect I was very unlucky in this journey . I had no guide-books . Having formed no definite plan in my wanderings , I never knew with what books to provide myself , and therefore carried none , trusting to chance for finding what I wanted . As might be supposed , when I needed VOL . L o /z/ them most it was utterly impossible to obtain any ; and from the borders of Egypt to the confines of the Holy Land I was in some measure groping in the dark ; the Bible was my only guide ; and though the best a man could have in his pilgrimage through life , and far better than any other in this particular journey , yet otheri would have been exceedingly valuable , as illustrating obscure passages in the sacred book ; and particularly as referring , besides , to circumstances and traditions other than scriptural , connected with the holy mountain . In the book of one of the modem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered to have seen a reference to a tradition among the Mussulmans , that Mohammed had ascended the mountain on the back of his camel , and from its lofty summit had taken his depar  - -  ture.to the seventh heaven , and that the prints of the beast 's footsteps were still to be seen on the surface of the rock . I questioned the Arab about this story . In the more engrossing interest of the scene , I had forgotten to look for the prints of the camel 's feet , and told him , with great truth , that I had examined everything carefully , but had not seen them . The old monk , who had sat quietly munching his bread and figs , scandalized at my inquiring into such a profane story , and considering the holy mountain in a manner his property , broke out /z/ reiDoniously , Imd dehouhoed it as a wicked in* ventkm of the Arabs , averring that everybody bew that , before Mohammed got half way up , the camel stumbled , fell , and broke the neck of the Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who swore that the legend was true , for it was written in the Koran , and that he himself hud often seen the print of the foot ; and he accounted for my not seeing it hj the very sensible and satisfactory explanation that it was visible only to the eyes of true befievers . The good father was completely roused by this obstinate persistence in the scandal ; and a reckless Bedouin and an old Bulgarian monk , sitting by a fountain among the deserts of Sinai , re soon disputing with as much clamour and bitterness as if they had been brought up in the ' dst of civilization , to harangue from opposing ) mlpits , the preachers of the promises and the denouncers of the curses of rival churches . One thing the pious father especially insisted on ; the strong point in his argument , and particularly ludicrous , as coming from such an old bundle of superstitions , was the impossibility of a camel 's foot making an impression on stone ; and , judging from this alone , one might have suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common sense ; but a few minutes after hc ) txdd me the legend of Mount St. Catharine* Mount St. Catharine is the great rival of Sinai o2 /z/ in - the range of mountains in the Arabian peninsula ; They rise like giant twin brothers , tower* ing above every other ; and the only thing which detracts in the slightest degree from the awful supremacy of Sinai , is the fact that Mount St. Catharine is somewhat the highest . The legend is , that in the early days of the Christian church , the daughter of a king of Alexandria became converted , while her father remained a Pagan . She tried to convert him ; but , indignant at the attempt , he cast her into prison , where she was visited by the Saviour , who entered through the keyhole , and married her with a ring which is now in the hands of the Empress of Russia . Her father cut her head off , and angels carried her body to the top of the mountain and laid it on the rock . For centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing that it had been carried up into heaven , until about two centuries ago , when a monk at the convent dreamed where it had been laid . The next morning he took his staff and climbed to the top of the mountain ; and there , on the naked rock , fresh and blooming as in youthful beauty , after a death of more than a thousand years , he found the body of the saint . The monks then went up in solemn procession , and , taking up the body , bore it in pious triumph to the convent below , where it now lies in a cofBn with a silver lid , near /z/ the great altar in the chapel , and receives the bomage of all pious pilgrims . . It was nearly dark when I returned to the convent ; and , in no small degree fatigued with the labours of the day , I again threw myself on the mat and welcomed rest . In the evening the superior came to my room , and again we mingled the names of Greece and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man when I would rather have been asleep ; but with his own hands he drew mats and cushions around me , and made me 10 comfortable , that I could not refuse to indulge him with the rare luxury of conversation on the subject of his native land , and of the world from which he was shut out for ever . He was single* hearted and simple , or , perhaps I should rather say , simple and ignorant ; I remember , for instance , when we had been embarrassed for a time by the absence of the younger monk who served as our interpreter , the old man told me very gravely , and as a new thing , which I could not be expected to know , but which he did not think the less of me for not knowing , that formerly , in the time of Adam , all mankind spoke but one tongue ; and that men became wicked , and built a tower to reach to heaven ( he had forgotten its name ) , and that God had destroyed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I expressed my astonishment , as in /z/ duty bound , and denounced , in good set terms , the wickedness of our fathers , which now prevented us from enjoying at our ease the sweets of friendly converse . Before breakfast the next morning he was with me again , with a striped abbas over his black gown , and a staff in his hand , prepared to accompany me outside the walls . I was surprised . He had told me that he had not left the convent for more than three years , when he had accompanied a great apostolic vicar , holding a distinguished situation in the church of France ; and this was the last and only time he had ever bestowed such attention on a stranger . The kind-hearted old man intended it as an act of extraordinary kindness ; I received it as such ; and , as such , he told me I could mention it to my friends in America . Humble and unimportant as was that old monk in the great drama of life , I felt proud of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception at a European court , or a greeting from royal lips , and my pride was the greater that I did not ascribe it to any merits of my own . My only claim was that possessed by all my countrymen  --  I was an American ; my country had heard the cry of his in her distress , and from her seat across the broad Atlantic had answered that cry . We passed , as before , through the subterraneous passages into the garden . The miserable /q/ Bedouins who were g$ithered around outside , muting for the bread which they received daily bom the convent , surprised at the unexpected but welcome appearance of the superior , gathered pjrpund him and kissed his hands and the hem of hb garment . He had provided himself with an mtra sack of ; bread9 which he distributed among AiOy and which they seemed to receive with petiliar pleasure from his hands . The monks of - Mount Sinai are now no longer obliged to have xneoure to carnal weapons for protection ; peace mgns between them and the Bedouins ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five hundred rolls of bread among the poor piound the mountain . I did not think so much joC. this price when I saw the bread , hard , black , and mouldy , and such as the meanest beggar in wr country would not accept from the hand of charity . But the Bedouins took it , and thanked God and the monks for it . Hurrying away from these grateful pensioners . Ire descended by the defile through which we jliad entered ; and again passing the ruins of the Jbouse of Aaron , and the spot from which he poreached to the assembled people , we came to l.long flat stone , with a few holes indented in iU surface , which the superior pointed out as tliat on which Moses threw down and broke the tablets of the law when he descended from to_the mountain and found the Israelites wor- /z/ shipping the golden calf . About half m hour farther on was another stone much holier than this ; at first I understood the interpreter that it was the petrifaction of the golden calf ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was the mould in which the head of the golden calf was run . He pointed out to me the prints of the head , ears , and horns , clear even to the eyes of a man of sixty ; and told me the story of the golden calf somewhat differently from the Bible account . He said that the people , wanting another god , came up with one accord and threw their golden ornaments upon that stone , and agreed by acclamation that when it was melted they would worship whatever should come out ; three times it came out the head of a calf ; and then they fell down and worshipped it . Some distance farther on we passed on our right a Hebrew burying-ground ; " The burialplace , ' said the superior , ' of the Israelites who died in their forty years wandering among the mountains of Sinai . The old man had heard these things so long , and had told them so often , and believed them so firmly , that it would have broken his heart  --  besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had intimated the slightest doubt . I asked whether the Jews ever came in pilgrimage to the mountain of their fathers ; and he told me that , four years ago , two Asiatic Jews had come disguised as Europeans , /z/ and attempted to pass themselves as Christians ; f but said the priest , with a vindictive spirit lighting his usually mild eye , * I detected them under their sheeps clothing , and they did not atay long in the convent . ' Yet I remember seeing on the wall of the convent , and with no small degree of interest , the name of an American Jew . Farther on , turning into a valley which opened between the mountains on the left , we came to a garden belonging to the convent , which presented a strange appearance in the midst of the surrounding desolation , producing all kinds of fruits ; where one might almost wonder to see a blade of grass put forth , the orange , the date , the fig , and the vine are growing in rich luxuriance . The soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains ; and , though too light for strong products , for fruit it is better than the rich valley of the Nile . Sitting under the shade of the fig-tree , the superior pointed out to me a rent in the mountain opposite , which , he said , was caused by an earthquake , that had swallowed up two friends and servants of Moses of whom I bad never heard ' before , and who were so swallowed up for disobeying the orders of their earthly master . The superior , unused to such a task as he had imposed upon himself , here completely gave out , and I left him panting under the shade of his figtree , while I went on to the valley of Rephidim ; o5 /z/ and , passing another garden , came to the rock of Horeb , the stone which Moses struck with his rod , and caused the waters to gush out . The stone is about twelve feet high , and on one side are eight or ten deep gashes from one to three feet long , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trickling with water . These gashes are singular in their appearance , though probably showing only the natural effect of time and exposure . They look something like the gashes in the bark of a growing tree , except that , instead of the lips of the gash swelling and growing over , they are worn and reduced to a polished smoothness . They are , no doubt , the work of men 's hands , a clumsy artifice of the early monks to touch the hearts of pious pilgrims ; but the monks of the convent , and the Greek pilgrims who go there now , believe in it with as much honesty and sincerity as in the crucifixion . Will the reader forgive me if I say that this rock had in my eyes an interest scarcely less than that which the rod of Moses gave it ? Three names were written on it : one of a German , the second of an Englishman , and the third of my early friend , the same which I had seen above the Cataracts of the Nile . When , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my native city , little did I think that I afterward should trace him beyond the borders of Egypt , and through /z/ the wilderness of Sinai , to his grave in JeruMlem . Again I wrote my name under his , and , returning by the way I came , found the superior still sitting under the fig-tree , and , moving on , we soon reached the convent . He hurried away to bis official duties , and I retired to my room . I stayed there three or four hours , poring over the scripturcd account of the scenes that hallowed the wilderness of Sinai with an attention that no sound disturbed . Indeed , the stillness of the convent was at all times most extraordinary ; day or night not a sound was to be heard but the tolling of the bell for prayers , or occasionally the soft step of a monk stealing through the cloisters . In the afternoon I lounged around the interior of the convent . The walls form an irregular quadrangle , of about one hundred and thirty paces on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of a small city . The building was erected by the Empress Helena , the mother of the first Christian emperor , and I might almost eall her the mother of the Holy Land . Her pious heart sent her , with the same spirit which afterWard animated the crusaders , to search out the holy places referred to in the Bible ; and when ahe found one , she erected a monument to mark it for the guidance of future Christians ; and the pilgrim may see the fruits of her pious labours /z/ from the mountain where God spake in thunder down to the place where the cock crew when Peter denied his master . The convent is capable of containing several hundred people . It was originally built as a place of defence ; but the necessity of keeping it fortified has passed away ; a parcel of rusty guns are lying in a sort of armory , and a few small cannon are frowning from the walls . The cells of the monks , compared with anything else I had seen in the East , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot from the floor , is a stone plform , on which the monk spreads his mat ami coverlet , and the furniture includes a table , chairs , sometimes two or three books , and the fragment of a lookingglass . There are twenty-four chapels erected to different saints , in which prayers are said regularly in rotation . I went through them , but saw nothing to interest me until I came to the church of the convent . Here I was surprised to find the handsomest Greek church I had seen , except in Russia ; the floor and steps were of marble ; and distributed around in various places were pillars and columns , the works of ancient artists , plundered from heathen temples , and sent to this lonely spot in the desert by the active piety of the early Christian emperors . The convent was raised in honour of the transfiguration , and the dome of the altar contains a coarse but antique painting of the holy scene . In front , near the great altar , in /q/ i coffiQ covered with rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catharine , the patroness of he convent . Among the chapels , one , I remember , is dedicated to Ck ) nstantine and Helena , and another to Justinian and his wife ; but the great object of interest is the holy of holies , the spot here God appeared to Moses in the burning Ush . A chapel is now erected over it , and the pilgrim , on entering , hears at this day almost the *Uie words which God addressed to Moses , Put thy shoes from off thy feet , for the ground hereon thou treadest is holy ground ; * I pulled ff my shoes and followed my conductor . The place is now bedizened with Grecian ornaments ; the rude simplicity of nature which beheld the interview between God and his servant is utterly gone , and the burning bush is the last thing one Would think of on the spot where it grew . There are but few objects of interest besides . In one of the chapels is a copy of the Evangelists , written in letters of gold by the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve apostles , and all the psalms of David , written in an inconceivably small space by a young virgin who came out and died in the desert . The condition and character of the monks formed a subject of no little interest for my speculating observation , and I investigated their habits and dispositions as closely as biens6ance and my inability for conversing with them , except through /z/ an interpreter , would permit . So far as I could judge , they seemed perfectly contented ; but they were , for the most part , mere drones and sluggards , doing little good for themselves or othen , and living idly upon the misapplied bounty of Christian pilgrims . I do not mean to say that they were bad men . Most of them were too simple to be bad ; and , if there was evil in their nature , they had no temptation to do evil ; and , after all , the mere negative goodness which does no harm is not to be lightly spoken of , in a world so full of restlessness and mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time in the coovent , some as much as twenty or thirty years , and one , who was now a hundred and five years old* had been seventy-five years worshipping the Lord after his fashion at the foot of Sinai . Amon them were a baker , shoemaker , and tailor ; thejf baked , cooked , made and mended for themselves and had but one other duty to perform , and that was four times daily to kneel down and pray Nothing could be more dull and monotonous than their lives , and none but the most sluggisfai or the most philosophic spirit could endure it They were philosophers without knowing it , and dozed away their existence in one unvarying round of prayer , and meals , and sleep . Their discipline was not rigid , save in one particular , and that a matter in regard to which there has been much discussion with us ; they never ate /z/ Mat ; no animal food of any kind is permitted to mer the walls of the convent . During all the liious periods of their abode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one more than seventy-five hits , not one of them had eaten a particle of aniMd food ; and yet I never saw more healthy-look Ig men . Hardier men I have seen , for they are Kiolent in their habits , take but little exercise , id . in most cases , show a strong disposition to ifpulency ; but I had some little opportunity I testing their ability to endure fatigue ; and , imgh the superior soon walked himself out of iMthy the monk who guided us up the mountain , li who was more than sixty years old , when he piibended , after a hard days labour , seemed less kI than either Paul or myself . I am aware mt : - climate may make a difference . ; but , from f own observation and experience , I am perfectsatisfied that , even in our climate , invalids and arsons of sedentary habits , and , indeed , all except bouring men , would be much benefited by a tel abstinence from animal food . I have tradUied for a week at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky of the East , but in the rough imate of Russia , and found myself perfectly ble to endure the fatigue upon bread and nlk diet ; and I have been told that the Tartars rbo ride post from Constantinople to Bagdad in n incredibly short time , never sleeping , except n horseback , during the whole of their immense /z/ journey rigidly abstain from anything more solid and nutritious than eggs . The night of my return from the top of Sinai , I was awake when the bell tolled for midnight prayers ; and , wrapping myself in my Arab cloak , took a small lamp in my hand , and groping my way along the passage , descended to the chapel , where the monks were all assembled . I leaned behind a protecting pillar and watched their proceedings ; and it was an event of no common interest , thus , at the dead hour of night , to be an unobserved witness of their sincerity , and earnest though erroneous devotion . There was not on &-; among them who did not believe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fin acceptance at the throne of Grace , and obtain fa him that blessed immortality which we are seeking . /q/ /z/ t of the Monks .  --  Advantages of Abstinence .  --  Scruples Oyercome.  --  A mysterious Brother .  --  The Convent Burialplace.  --  Strange Charnel-houses.  --  Death in a Mask .  --  FaHdiliarity breeds Contempt .  --  A man of two Centuries .  - -  oubt8 and Fears .  --  Parting Gifts .  --  The Farewell . Thb next day was Sunday , and early in the ' iloming the superior sent for me to come down iltid take my meal with the holy brotherhood . %he monks were all at the table , and it was the 8rst time I had had so good an opportunity of iieeing them together . They were about thirty in Klumber , mostly old men with long white beards , Greeks , and some with faces as noble as Grecian chisel ever traced . There was not a beard at %able less than eight inches long ; and my own , ough it would have been rather distingue at liome , blushed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table was a long naked board ; the vessels were all of metal , and before each man were a wooden spoon and a drinking-cup in the form of a porringer . It was Lent , the season of forty or fifty days ' fasting , during which even fish , eggs , and oil are prohibit- /z/ ed . A large basin of boiled beans was set before each of the monks ; and , besides this , there were black olives , beans in water , salad , vinegar , salt , dates , and bread . My companions had never been pampered with luxuries , and ate their bread and beans with as keen a relish as if they were feasting on turtle and venison , and drank their water as freely as though it was Tokay or Burgundy . The meal was eaten in silence , all appearing of opinion that they came simply to eat ; and the only unusual circumstance I remarked was the civility of my immediate neighbours in pushing the tempting viands before me . It was curious to see how they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard , and the spoon disappearing in a huge red opening , leaving the handle projecting from a bush of hair . The room in which we ate was perhaps sixty feel long , having at one end a chapel and altar , and reading desk close by , in which , during the whoh of the meal , a monk was reading aloud from th lives of the saints . After dinner the monks rose , and , wiping their mouths , walked in a body to the foot of the altar , and two of them com menced burning incense . One of my neighboured took me by the hand , and led me up with them There they kneeled , prayed , and chanted , and wentr through a long routine of ceremonies , in which , sc Sax as it was practicable , they carried me with them . . They could not get me up and down as fast as /z/ they moved themselves , but they flung the incense eas hard as at the worthiest of them all . I supposed this to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would end ; but , to my surprise and P'eat regret , I found that this was merely prepa ' ' ' tory to the administration of the sacrament . It te the second time I had been placed in the ' Hie situation ; and a second time , and even more tnestly than before , I wished for that state of *art , which , according to the notions of its lemnity in which I had been brought up , would bave permitted me to join in the sacred rite . I loused the consecrated bread , and the monk , tfter pausing some moments , apparently in astonishment , passed on to the next . After he had Completed the circle , the superior crossed and brought him back again to me ; I could not sround the feelings of the good old man , and ate the consecrated bread and drank the wine . May God forgive me if I did wrong ; but , though Hgid. censors may condemn , I can not believe that I incurred the sin of " the unworthy partaker** by yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After this we walked out on the terrace , under the shade of some venerable grape-vines , and , sitting down along the wall , took coffee . The reading-desk was brought out , and the same monk continued reading for more than two hours . . I had noticed that monk before ; for he was the /z/ tome who had conducted me through the churchy had visited me in my room , and I had seen him in his cell . He was not more than thirty-five , and his face was as perfect as art could make it ; and the sunbeams occasionally glancing through the thick foliage of the vines , and lighting up his pale and chiselled features and long black beard , made him one of those perfect figures for a sketch which I had often dreamed of , but had never seen . His face was thin , pale , and emaciated ; the excitement of reading gave it a hectic flush , and he looked like a man who , almost before the springtime of life was over , had drained the cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived , he had not always led so peaceful and innocent a life , and could unfold a tale of stirring incident , of wild and high excitement , and perhaps of crime . Hewas from the Island of Tenos , but spoke Italian and I had talked with him of the islands of Greece , and the ports in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea , with many of which he seemed familiar ; and then he spoke of the snares and temptations of the world , and his freedom from them in the convent-and , above all , of the perils to which men are ex- posed by the wiles and witcheries of the sex ; and I could not but imagine tha , t some beautiful Grecian girl , not less false than fair , had driven his &; to the wilderness . One of the other monks told me that it was about the time when the last of the pirates were swept from the Mediterranean that /q/ the young islander had buried himself in the - Us of the convent . They told ' me , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he had to the frater*ty . Poor fellow ! they will soon come into pos-sion . In the garden of the convent the cemetery of tHe monks . Though not of a particularly melanKoly humour , I am in a small way given to medication among the tombs ; and , in many of the Countries I have visited , the burial-places of the dead have been the most interesting objects of examination . The superior had promised to show %e his graves ; and something in the look of the deader reminding me of death and burial , I now told the old man of his promise , and he hobbled off to get the key ; for it appeared that the cemetery Was not to be visited without his special permission . At the end of a long arbour of grape-vines , a narrow staircase cut in the rock , which I had not seen before , led down to an excavated square of about twenty feet ; on the left of which was a small door opening into a vault , where formerly the bodies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there suffered to remain until all the corruptible part was gone , and only the dry bones remained . Now they are buried for about three years , or as long as may be necessary to effect the same object ; and , when the flesh and muscles have disappeared , the bones are deposited in the great cemetery , the door of which is directly op- /z/ posite . Within the door is a small antiihainber , containing a divan and a portrait of some saint who wandered eighteen years in the desert without meat or drink . From this the door opens into the cemetery , which was so different from any I had ever seen , that i started back on the threshold with surprise . Along the wall was an excavation about thirty feet in length , but of what depth I could not tell . It was enclosed by a fence , which was three or four feet above the ground , and filled with human skulls ; and in front , extending along the whole width of the chamber , was a pile of bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell how far . They were very regularly disposed in layers , the feet and shoulders being placed outward alternately , and by the side of the last skeleton was a vacant place for the next that should be ready . I had seen thousands of Egyptian mummies , , and the catacombs of Chioff , the holy city o : Russia , where the bodies of the saints are laid in rows , in open coffins , clothed in their best apparel , and adorned with gold and jewels ; and in that ' extraordinary burial-place I had seen , too , a ranger of small glasses in a dead stone wall , where wild , and desperate fanatics had made their own tombs , with their own hands building themselves in an upright position against the walls , leaving a small hole open in front by which to receive their bread and water ; and when they died , the small opening /q/ was closed with a piece of glass , and the body the saint was left thus buried . I had seen the catacombs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks are dried and laid in open coffins , or fixed in niches in the walls , with their names labelled on their breasts ; and in the vault of the convent at Palermo I had seen the bodies of nobles and ladies , the men arranged upright along the walls , dressed as in life , with canes in their hands and swords by their sides ; and the noble ladies of Palermo lying in state , their withered bodies clothed in silks and satins and adorned with gold and jewels ; and I remember one among them , who , if then living , would have been but twenty , who two years before had shone in the bright constellation of Sicilian beauty , and , lovely as a light from heaven , had led the dance in the royal palace ; I saw her in the same white dress which she had worn at the ball , com-* plete even to the white slippers , the belt around her waist , and the jewelled mockery of a watch hanging at her side , as if she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the skin dry , black , and shrivelled , like burnt paper ; the cheeks sunken ; the rosy lips a piece of discoloured parchment ; the teeth horribly projecting , the nose gone ; a wreath of roses around her head ; and a long tress of hair curling in each hollow eye . I had seen these things , and even these did not strike me so powerfully as the charnel-house at th ( /z/ convent of Mount Sinai . There was something peculiarly and terribly revolting in this promiscu : : ous heaping together of mortal relics ; bones upo bones ; the old and young ; wise men and fool good men and bad ; martyrs and murderers masters and servants ; bold , daring , and ambition men  --  men who would have plucked bright honou from the moon , lying pell-mell with cowards aiu knaves . The superior told me that there were more " than thirty thousand skeletons in the cemetery  - -  - literally an army of dead men 's bones . Besides the pile of skulls and bones , in a chamber adjoining were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their names and ages labelled on them , and those of two sons of a king of Persia , who came hither on pilgrimage and died in the convent ; their iron shirts , the only dress tbej wore on their long journey from their father 's court , are in the same box . Other skeletons were lying about , some in baskets , and some arranged on shelves , and others tied together and hangiog from the roof . In one corner were the bones of St. Stephen  --  not the martyr who was stoned to death at Jerusalem , but some pious anchorite of later and less authentic canonization . As to the effect upon the mind of such burialplaces as this , or the catacombs to which I have referred , I can say from my own experience that they destroy altogether the feeling of solemnity with which we look upon the grave . I remember /z/ ' ce , in walking through long rows of dead , ar- ' Hged like statues in niches of the wall , I re- ' arked to the friar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old acquaint- ices ; and he stopped and opened a box , and Hik out piecemeal the bones of one who , he said been his closest friend , and laughed as he piiUed them about , and told me of the fun and Jokes they two had together . Returning to the convent , and passing through be great chapel on the way to my room , I met One who , in the natural course of things , must xn be borne to the charnel-house I had just left . It was the aged monk of whom I have before Spoken ; he whose years exceeded by thirty-five the seventy allotted to man . I had desired an opportunity of speaking with him , and was curious to know the workings of his mind . The superior had told me that he had outlived every feeling and affection ; that he spent all his time in prayer , ' and had happily arrived at a new and perfect state of innocence ; and I remember , that after comparing him to the Iamb , and every other emblem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that showed his own wonderful ignorance of human nature , by declaring that the old monk was as innocent as a young girl . It occurred to me that this might be a dubious comparison ; but as I knew that the monsatic life of the old eulogist , and his lon seclusion from the world , had VOL . I. p /z/ prevented him from acquiring any very accurate knowledge of young girls , I understood him to mean the perfection of innocence . I looked upon the old monk with exceeding interest , as a venerable relic of the past . For more than seventy-five years he had wandered around the holy mountain , prostrating himself daily at the foot of the altar , and , with three generations of men , had sung the praises of God under the hallowed peak of Sinai . I approached him , and told him my pleasure in knowing so old and holy a man , and the wonder with whidi story would be heard in my own far-distant cOun try . But the old man listened with impatience . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he seemed anxiom to get away , and stood , as I supposed , with hii hand on his heart , as if pleading some religiow duty as an excuse for his haste ; but it turned out that he was merely complaining of the emptiness of his stomach , and was hungering for his evenin ( meal . I was sorry to have the interesting pii ture I had conceived of this monkish Methuselale : == marred and efiaced by so matter-of-fact an incident ; but I describe him as I found him , not as would have wished him to be . Ever since I had left Cairo I had been troubled ! with misgivings touching my ability to undertake* the journey by Petra . I had hoped to recruit during my few days residence at the convent , but /z/ /q/ ' Was obliged to acknowledge to myself that I s , to say the least , no better . The route through ' dumea was difficult and dangerous , requiring all he energy of mind and body that perfect health uld give ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place me in a posion in which the loudest cry of distress could aever be heard . It is not necessary to inflict upon ibe reader all my hesitations ; it is enough to say , *t with one of the strongest efforts of resolution * Vas ever called upon to make , I abandoned my Herished project of visiting Petra and the land of - 'ciumea ; and , with a heavy heart , wrote to Mr. liddon that I was a broken reed , and was bound ti the safe and direct road to Gaza . My kind ftiend the superior would not hear of my leaving the convent ; but I resisted his importunities , and laughingly told him I did not like that unchristian way of burial , cutting up and piling away a tkian 's bones like sticks of firewood to dry . Finding me resolved , he took me to his room , and gave me from his little store of treasures some shells mnd petrifactions ( which I threw away when out of his sight ) , engravings of Mount Sinai , and incidents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most uncouth conceptions that ever were imagined , and a small box of manna , the same , as he religiously believed , which fed the Israelites dur iog their sojourn in the wilderness . He gave me , too , a long letter , written in modem Greek , and /z/ directed to the governor of Gbiza , certifying that I was a pilgrim from America ; that I had performed all the duties of the pilgrimage , and was now travelling to the holy city of Jerusalem . The letter contained , also a warm and earnest recommendation to all the Oreek convents in the Holy Land to receive and comfort , feed and clothe , and help and succour me in case of need . Last of all ) he ' put on my finger a ring of the simplest form and substance , and worthy to ' accompany the pal* mer 's of an older age . Every pilgrim to Mount Sinai receives one of these rings ; and like the green turban of the Mussulman , which distinguishes the devout hadji who has been to Mecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honoured token of a complete and perfect pil gnmage . At eight oclock in the morning the whole con  - -  vent was in commotion , preparing for my depart ture . My old Bedouin guide had been out among his tribe , and arrived the night before with three times as many men and camels as I wanted , ready to conduct me to Akaba or Gaza . I took my leave of the holy brotherhood , who now sped me on my way as kindly and warmly as they had welcomed me on my arrival ; and , after a long and most affectionate parting with the good old superior , who told me that in all probability he should never see me again , but should always remember me , and begged me not to forget him  --  - assuring /q/ me that there in the desert I always had a home , and telling me that if , when I returned to my own country , misfortune should press upon me , and I should find my kindred gone and friends standing aloofy I must shake the dust from off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wilderness  --  I fiistened the rope around me , and was let down for the last time to the foot of the convent-wall . A roup of Bedouins , beggars , and dependants upon the charity of the convent , gathered around , and invoked blessings upon me as I started . Twice since my arrival there had been rain . In that dry and thirsty desert , every drop of water falls upon the earth like precious ointment , and " welcome , ** says the Arab , " is the stranger who brings us rain. ** I turned my back upon the rising sun , and felt by comparison on my homeward way ; but a long journey was still before me ; I had still to cross **the great and terrible desert** of the Bible , which spread before the wandering Israelites its dreary and eternal sands , from the base of Sinai to the Promised Land .
