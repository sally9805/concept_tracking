txt Lu a recent number of this Journal , we invited the attention of our reade ; s to the domestic politics of the Republic of Mexico . It was a subject full of peculiar interest , and one to which we felt great diffidence of our ability to do justice . We // 318 April , have no reason to retract any of the opinions we then advanced , whether relating to men or measures , or to believe , that in a very wide range of remarks we bestowed one word of unmerited praise or censure . The effect , however , of the scenes we endeavored to describe , on the opinions and affections of the rest of the world , involves questions wholly distinct from the judgment to be pronounced on the merits of party contests . In the narrative of the revolution , from its commencement to a period so recent as the elevation of Iturbide in 1821 , when active warfare ceased , there is much pleasing matter for contemplation . Heroism and self-devotion worthy of a more romantic age , distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful times have no such honorable distinction , and have of late recorded little beside the convulsions of anarchy and faction . Bitter political resentments , productive of political persecutions of the most repulsive character , have stained the fair fame of our republican sister . Varied as the scene has been , the citizens of this country have derived much substantial benefit from the results which have been presented to their view ; and now that the period of enthusiasm and fanciful sympathy is past , we may draw more than one salutary moral from the alternations of fortune which our fellow freemen have , experienced . We may realize our obligations to our national ancestry . We may justly estimate the benefit of the severity of discipline which the settlers of this continent underwent , and which has produced the vigor of constitution and purity of moral temperament that make us what we are . We may thank a kind Providence for our free infancy , and last of all , we may find in the contrast another source of unlimited gratitude , in the perpetuation amongst us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed us at that point on the scale of intellectual being , where devout humility and aspiring reason blend , and where we may adore the God of revelation , without discarding the use of the high faculties he has bestowed on us . Other more practical advantages have resulted from the observation of the irregularities and peculiarities of our fellow republicans ' course . It has , we hope , enabled our statesmen to know the suitable relations of the American communities , and the conduct which , in our diplomatic intercourse , it is proper for us to pursue . On the minds of those who have had commercial experience , a more severe process has produced // the same salutary effect . In all , there was perhaps equal enthusiasm , and the same joyous anticipation when the curtain was first drawn , and the magnificent scene of a world , enjoying all the freshness of new horn liherty , was presented to their view . The plain of Mexico , with its placid lakes reposing beneath the tranquillity of a tropical sky , its snowy hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smiling beauty of its peculiar scenery , was not a more exciting spectacle , when first viewed hy the soldiers of Cortez , than was the moral scene thus developed to admiring man . The exultation of unfettered earth ' was heard with unqualified delight , and awakened all the varied illusions of selfish enterprise and romance . The sphere of diplomacy and political influence was immeasurably enlarged . To the commercial speculator , there was opened a wide and unexplored wilderness for adventure . The perfect fabrics of the nineteenth century were to he as profitable , as were the glass beads , and tinsel of the first Spanish settlers . The regular channel of supply had been cut off by rebellion ; and by the increased wants of the emancipated colonists , and their limited internal means of subsistence , a market was opened for foreign produce , which , in extent and probable durability , had never been equalled in the history of commercial enterprise . The population of Spanish America at the period of the revolution may be safely estimated at twenty millions , all thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The history of what ensued would fill an instructive volume . Those nations which were most liable to the inducements , as well from their situation and resources as from their powerful commercial marine , were Great Britain and the United States . On both , though in different degrees , the same results were produced , and each has acquired an amount of experimental knowledge , which may be useful in seasons of similar temptation . In England , where the amount of available capital afforded the means of any investment , however insecure , a wildness of speculation ensued , to which we know of no parallel . It was not ordinary mercantile hazard , which in point of relative risk , is identical with the most regular of the doubtful pursuits of humanity . It was betting against the field on an untried horse ; it was gambling , for aught that was known to the contrary , with sharpers and false dice ; it was a lottery without a scheme , and of which nothing was known , but that on former // occasions rich prizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record had survived . The history of the English Joint Stock Mining Companies , is curious and perfectly characteristic of the adventurous and credulous times in which our lot is cast . it is not consistent with the specific objects we now have in view , to dwell particularly on the origin and event of these speculations , to which we only refer as illustrative of the painful experience which the world has recently acquired ; but as they form a prominent feature in the history of commercial intercourse with the Spanish American nations , we will bestow on them a hasty and passing remark . All the mines worked by foreign capital have not utterly failed . So far , the persevering enthusiasts on this subject are justified in their constancy . But when the immense amount of foreign investment is , as it easily may be , ascertained , it will be seen how slight a qualification of actual and extensive ruin this partial success affords . It is but a drop of water on the feverish tong* . To take a single instance . The capital of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds ; and if to this be added the premium of fourteen hundred pounds per share , which it attained in 1824 , we may form something like an estimate of the amount which this experiment alone has cost the British public , without any tangible equivalent in the product of the mines . We have not at this time the means of ascertaining the actual receipts ; but no safer guide is requisite than the fluctuation of the stock , and no more satisfactory proof of the failure of the scheme than the fact , that within two years the value of a share has sunk from the enormous advance to which we have referred , to a discount . An examination of such materials as recent publications on this subject have afforded , justifies the assertion that there is no substantial difference in the career and prospects of the foreign mining corporations in New Spain . Bonanzas , ' to use a technical phrase , there doubtless have been ; but specious as are the descriptions of them , they have been really ineffectual in enabling the shattered hulks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting against them . The study of a London price current and the quotations of mining shares would be essentially instructive to any one afflicted with speculating propensities . From the immense amount of British investment , in Mexico particularly , one consequence has resulted . To this hour and amid all circum // stances of despondency , there is a strong and natural reluctance to abandon the speculations . In 1828 , Mr. Ward estimated the English investment alone at twelve millions sterling ; a stake , it xviii be admitted , too large to be hastily and inconsiderately sacrificed ; and the manifest object of his elaborate work , is to induce a renewal of confidence on the part of the stockholders , and to persuade them to make further advances to save what has already been spent . Such an effort may be natural , but will , we suspect , be unsuccessful . Had the political tranquillity of Mexico been uninterrupted , and had her rulers evinced a disposition to act with justice in their intercourse with foreign residents , the actual failure of the experiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and panic , with or without cause , among capitalists and speculators , is contagious and fatal* To attempt to draw from men smarting under disappointment and confessed imposture , more supplies to arrive at a contingent result , or by any process of reasoning or array of facts to convince them , that the only real disappoii*tment has been in the period of success , and that by dropping the line a little deeper , all the sunken and all expected treasures will be obtained , is idle and irrational in the extreme . Those who have so severely suffered are apt to construe such kindness into insult . When , as at present , mining shares are consigned to the same pigeonholes as South Sea bonds , and like our continental certificates , have become only historically valuable , it is beneath the dignity of sober counsel to endeavor to induce a resumption of confidence . The more manly , and we can not but believe the more politic course , would be to advise the mining capitalists to wind up their ruinous schemes , to squander no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to leave the wrecks of their speculations for th' benefit of the Mexican proprietors , into whose hands by the terms of their contracts they must eventually fall , and to turn their experience to the best account , by deriving from it a stock of prudence , which will save them from future mischief . The unsettled state of the countries where their interests lie , the frequent revolution which the administration of the government has undergone , the want of security which the legislative tactics , especially of Mexico , have occasioned , are all additional indncements of strong efficacy . The policy of the Spanish rulers with regard to the mining interests was that of judicious liberality . While every other // branch of the colonial administration was directed by the spirit of narrow prejudice and false calculation , every facility which their peculiar system would permit , was afforded to those who were engaged in working the mines . It was the only relaxation which was allowed in a system of rigid monopoly and prohibition . On the organization of the new governmen. * a similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their operations under auspices , so far as the local authorities were concerned , as favorable as they could wish . Along with other propitious symptoms , this protecting policy has now ceased to afford encouragement . No one can pretend to say how long it will continue , nor to how slight an impulse of mistaken interest it may yield . A new duty on the import of quicksilver , or on the export of coined or uncoined silver , in the event of a sudden receij ) t from the mines , may , to the anxious mind of the disappointed and irritated adventurer , be not less improbable than an instantaneous change in the valuation of foreign manufactures on the arrival of a number of valuable cargoes . Let us not be misunderstood . It is not our wish to detract from the credit which the government of republican Mexico has so deservedly acquired by the policy it has pursued in the cultivation of its mineral resources . In an early number of our Journal , will be found a cordial expression of opinion on this very point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate on the minds of the British capitalists , and of which the certain consequence will and ought to be the utter abandonment , sooner or later , of all the mining experiments , at least by those with whom they originated . The individuals who have had the largest stake in these enterprises , and those public censors who have thought it their duty to trace the progress of the disease , to ascertain its cause , and to fix the mark of reprobation somewhere , have emptied the vials of their resentment indiscriminately on all who , from any impulse , however honorable and natural , have contributed to the delusion ; and , apparently unwilling to account for the wild aberrations of their countrymen , by attributing them to the influence of stock-jobbers and adventurers , have freely thrown the blame on travellers , whose motives are unimpeachable , and whose descriptions , though highly colored , have never been falsified . It has been a favorite theory with the leading journalists of Great Britain , to attribute the mania to unbounded reliance on the statements by Humboldt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always regarded this as eminently unjust . That illustrious man stands above the charge of wilful misrepresentation ; and if unqualified fait*h in such of his minute statements as were accidentally incorrect have occasioned injury , the fault is not his . Reject , if necessary , all allowance for the influence of favorable circumstances , and a sense of obligation in biassing his judgment , and put him on a level with other travellers in unexplored and interesting countries , and it is impossible to make his accidental inaccuracies the legitimate subject of complaint or censure . Vast changes too have occurred since the period when he wrote . When the traveller who now visits Mexico walks through the principal street of the capital , the Galle de Plateros , and contrasts the deserted and paltry workshops with the magnificent deposits of plate and jewelry described by Humboldt , he will doubtless be disappointed , as must he be , who , with the recollection of the glowing description of the flourishing condition of many of their mining establishments , sees their present dilapidation . But there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant descriptions , made under a grateful sense of the unwonted privilege conferred on him by the Spanish court , were substantially incorrect . For a long series of years prior to the Revolution , the annual product of the mines averaged twenty-four millions of dollars , and the circulating medium regularly increased . Private fortunes were immense , the display of wealth incredible , and we can not but think it unfair to join in denouncing a traveller as culpably unfaithful , because his descriptions , made in the midst of this season of prosperity , do not correspond with he realities of the present distress and embarrassment . Had Humboldt , however , never written a line upon the subject of the Mexican mines , the same state of things would have occurred . Enough was known to justify adventure , and had nothing been known , the very darkness and uncertainty would have been a sufficient incentive . Man has been called a gambling animal , and there are periods of national existence when the liability to this kind of hereditary disease seems to be materially increased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation would afford a worthy theme for the philosophical historian . When that record shall be made up , the mining mania of the nineteenth century will be the appropriate successor of the South Sea and Mississippi delusions ; and we may draw from all // one inference , that nations , like individuals , will , when tempted , prefer lottery risks to wholesome industry , and that ruin and disgrace are marked on the tickets which fall from the pernicious wheels of chance . But mining operations do not constitute the only mode of experience with regard to Mexico , which our transatlantic brethren have had . Loans to the new governments of America were equally abundant sources of speculation . In relation to the investmentsmade by the British public on the confessedly contingent security of the mines , we are disposed to speak more in the tone of pity than rebuke ; and while the feeling which the perception of such facility produces is almost that of contempt , it has no resemblance to that severe reprobation which every one ought to express at the deliberate swindling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two objects of injury ; the governments to whom the apparent favor was done , and the purchasers of the debt , on whom the bankruptcy of the debtors has been directly visited . The process was a simple one . The moment when the necessity of the new community was the greatest , was cautiously watched ; and when its agents were willing to accede to any terms to procure aliment to preserve its frail existence , a loan was offered at a heavy discount and with high interest . Any proposal , however exorbitant , was gladly received , and the usurious contract ratified . Here was the injury to the debtors . The bargain once cornpleted , and the money advanced , the domestic operation cornn*ienced . The enthusiasm of the public , already and by causes of natural influence excited , was dexterously promoted ; strained analogies , such , for instance , as the prosperity and financial fidelity of our government afforded , were resorted to ; sources of confidence were discovered by the acute vision of the original creditors , the existence of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantageous terms of the contracts were candidly exposed as in themselves authorizing the certainty of a vast eventual profit ; the probable abundance of the mines , as increasing the pecuniary resources of the government , was collaterally brought to bear ; in short , every inducement of possible efficacy was studiously developed , and the credulous and innocent were persuaded to become purchasers of the stock , and to regard the really worthless certificates as faithful symbols of substantial wealth . No casuistry can deny that this was actual fraud ,  --  fraud , not of one expert // rogue upon another , but of which the helpless and innocent were the victims . The two great Mexican loans were those negotiated in London with the houses of Goldschmidt and Barclay . They are fair samples of their brethren . The amount of the liability of the young republic to the former house was sixteen millions of dollars at five per cent. , for which , after deducting a discount of nearly sixty per cent. , and an allowance for commissions , and an advance of interest equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five million nine hundred thousand dollars . The terms of the second , negotiated in 1824 with the house of Barclay &amp; Co. , were apparently more favorable , though in fact equally disadvantageous to the debtors , the discount and allowances being more reasonable , while the proceeds amounted , in consequence of accident , to less . It was nominally a loan of sixteen millions , the avails , so far as they can be ascertained , being not more than five million three hundred thousand dollars . Such , then , was the bounty of the British monied community to the struggling republics of America . The process of ruin , as affecting the purchasers of the debt , may be traced in the fluctuations of the stock from its original and factitious elevation , to its present low level ; and the effect of republican bankruptcy has been visited with unmitigated and unmerited severity on the numerous holders of the transferred certificates . Every part of this operation seems to have been directed to one of two objects , extravagant profits on the original transaction , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be inferred , was never seriously contemplated ; and the regularity , or even the certainty of payment , either of principal or interest , seem to have been lightly considered . In 1823 , when the first loan was negotiated , who could pretend to calculate the chances of reimbursement , or ascertain results of any kind with even ordinary precision ? The Spanish power had been overthrown , but the prostrate tyrant , though sorely wounded , was not yet dead . The experiment of selfgovernment had not been made with perfect success . Iturbide 's rise and temporary ascendency had been an ominous sign . The convulsions of intestine war had not subsided , nor the factious spirit of a revolutionary contest been subdued . A constitutional government could not be said to exist . All was dim uncertainty ; and if the avowal of distrust might have been regarded as unkind , confidence , such as the English loan // jobbers professed , was eminently absurd . Rational confidence is not however requisite to ensure the success of speculation ; and all that is wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish American revolution was calculated to excite . By those who felt the impulse of honest sympathy , no calculation was made . By those who did make the calculation , the result of the investment was supposed to depend wholly on the ultimate success of the political experiment ; and the chances of wilful or involuntary abandonment of public faith , or of the accidental destruction of national credit by civil commotion , were never counted . Such is the painful experience of Great Britain ; and if we have omitted any notice of her direct commercial intercourse with New Spain and the other repuhlics , it is because even the great benefits which she has thence derived , scarcely afford an equivalent for the injury and disgrace which have resulted from her other connexions with them . The intercourse of this country with Mexico has been purely of a commercial character ; and if there be a qualification of the favor with which we once regarded our neighbor , it has been produced by no such discreditable causes as have operated on the British public . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception , no mining experiment originated in the United States ; and in that instance , the event has been in perfect keeping with the failures abroad . The humble attempt of the Baltimore company to work a few of the silver veins at Temascaltepec scarcely deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with the gigantic schemes of the foreign capitabsts . Yet humble as was the attempt , and complete as has been its failure , it is worthy of a passing remark , that from its progress , those who still have an interest in similar projects may derive a salutary lesson . In the English mining companies , an immense amount of money has been sunk by the profligate extravagance of the subordinate agents ; who , both in their personal and official disbursements , seem to have been influenced by a conviction of certain remuneration . If ever a mining company deserved success , the American one did . On the part of the company , there was judicious confidence in its agents ; on the part of the agents , conscientious and habitual economy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parsimonious would not have ventured to exact . It is with sincere pleasure that we pay this deserved tribute to the // disinterested and honorable conduct of the gentleman , who , for several years , was at the head of the only American mining company in New Spain ; and that we express the conviction , that , had success depended on the ability or fidelity of the individuals to whom the execution of the scheme was intrusted , it would in this instance have been attained . But in games like these , the most that economy and fidelity can do , is to diminish the loss in case of failure . Success is far beyond the control of such incidents . It is in no spirit of unkind exultation or offensive pity , that we unequivocally express the opinion , that the actual failure of this isolated experiment has been fortunate even for the individuals concerned , and certainly for the community at large . There is enough of the morbid principle of speculation in this country to operate most perniciously , and its activity might easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dividend , or made the slightest demonstration of even temporary success , the flame of mining adventure would have spread rapidly , and we might have seen , on a smaller stage and with less gorgeous apparatus , the same drama that was acted abroad . During the years 1826 and 1827 , travelling agents were actively engaged in propagating the preliminary doctrines , and exhibiting encouraging specimens in one hand and flattering certificates ( equally infallible testimonials ) in the other . In each of the large cities of the Union , schemes were quietly preparing , which only waited for a shadow of encouragement to spring forth and solicit the credulous patronage of the public . There is surely no excess of severity in the opinion , that the partial success of such hazardous investments would have been essentially injurious , and that the still-born death of this deformed project is a result on which we may reasonably congratulate our fellow citizens . There are legitimate modes of investment which are entitled to preference ; - experiments which , even in case of failure ; operate beneficially on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develope some practical advantage , in the form either of scientific discovery or local improvement , which ultimately compensates for public disappointment . While on the other hand , an outlay in foreign countries , if unsuccessful , carries with it no consolation , but is attended with an aggravation of disappointment proportionate to the distance of the scene of action , and the amount of the means employed . With this exception , the intercourse between the citizens of // this country and those of Spanish America , has generally been entirely of a commercial character . In the course of this association , many points of collision arising from difference of national character and education have been developed , and the opinions of individuals have varied with the variety of company , into which each one has been thrown . So far as the governments were concerned , there was originally on the part of our merchants little complaint of interference , there being too many sources of exclusive occupation to allow any time for commercial legislation . During the war , commerce was unrestrained adventure . So important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they had no inclination to devise obstructions ; and it was not until after the turmoil of actual conflict had in great measure subsided , that the suggestion seems to have occurred , that commerce was a legitimate object of taxation ; and that the foreign adventurers became aware of the existence in the government of a new party beside themselves , and those with whom they traded . Since that intervention , there has been a series of annoyances and embarrassments experienced by foreign merchants generally , and those of this country in particular , which would of itself be sufficient to account for the alteration of feeling to which we have referred . We do not mean to say , that the grievances of a few merchants are in themselves sufficient to stifle natural sympathy , or induce national antipathy . In most instances , merchants have their own successful mode of redress , and commercial embarrassment of this kind will often fail to light the fires of public resentment . But it is when the perception of wilful injustice on the part of a government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and when national character is painfully illustrated in the course of commercial intimacy , that disappointment ceases to be unreasonable ; and that we may so far forget our romance as to admit , that , although in theory , we ought to be enthusiastic friends , we have seen enough to put an end to the confidence of cordial association . The fact can not be disputed , that in relation to the Spanish American nations , there has been a universal and unfavorable change of feeling . That with regard to Mexico , our neighbor and most natural friend , the abatement of affection in this country has been most sensible , is equally true . The history of our relations , commercial and diplomatic , conclusively es // tablishes this position ; and it is with no diminution of kind feeling , so far as abstract principles are involved , but with an earnest wish , that a candid exposition of opinion on these points may have a decided and beneficial effect both at home and abroad , that we refer to this matter now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not our design to present to our readers a detailed exposition of the injuries of which this country and its citizens have a right to complain . We could not do the subject justice , within the limits which are assigned to us . The claims on republican Mexico , though inferior in amount and actual pecuniary importance , involve as much flagrant injustice as ever exasperated the victims of imperial decrees or orders in council . There are many , the narrative of which would be deemed unworthy of credit . They have all , we presume , been made the subject of complaint and intercession on the part of our diplomatic agents , and all , so far as we are informed , are to this hour unsatisfied . We shall not open the account , to call the attention of our readers to the items . It is enough for the specific object we have in view , to point out less selfish sources of disappointment and dislike , and to trace their progress through the domestic history of the republic , and its diplomatic intercourse with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is peculiar , and more resembles the sadness of wounded affection , than the irritation of wanton or jealous resentment . it has more of sorrow in it than of anger . Such a relation , however contradictory to theory and romance , may easily be accounted for ; and , by a reference to recent experience and the results of dispassionate observation , may be proved to be perfectly reasonable . It is with this view , that we refer to the foreign relations of our immediate neighbor , and to the extensive circumstances which have contributed to qualify the feelings of the rest of their fellow men . We do it , and we say this to silence the enthusiast who may cavil at our motives , with a sincere regret , that such a result should have been produced , and with perfect faith in the abstract and practical beauty of a system of distinctive Americanism , raised on the foundation of republican institutions , and cemented by national kindness and good will . The radical causes of this unfortunate state of feeling on our part , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new republic . Some of them are interwoven with the defec // tive principles of her political institutions ; some arise from the moral constitution of the people ; some , of a more tangible , though not more effective character , are to be discerned , as we have already intimated , in the occasional collision of the members of the two communities , in the injuries to commercial interests , and in perverse disregard of diplomatic courtesy and national friendliness . To the anomalies in the political institutions of Mexico we had occasion formerly to refer ; and slight as some of them apparently are , they constitute a fund of unpleasant objects for the contemplation of their fellow republicans , which has been of great efficacy in producing the change of feeling we have described . The sympathies of the mass of the people of the United States were awakened and kept in activity less by the positive and essential merits of the patriot cause , than by the analogy which was so easily traced between their revolutionary struggle and ours . It may now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in the theory of resemblance ; but in the season of enthusiasm , of natural and honorable enthusiasm , the accuracy of the likeness was not material . We saw an indignant people breaking the fetters of colonial tyranny , and it required no wonderful activity of imagination , and implied no extravagance of national vanity to believe , that the example which our ancestors had set was the exciting cause and guiding principle of our Spanish American brethren . Parvam Trojam , simulataque magnis Pergama , et arentem Xanthi cognomine rivum Agnosco , Sca*eque amplector limina port*e . In the delusion which the sight of this partial similitude produced , the points of difference were forgotten , and all the repulsive features of the drama were lost sight of . We did not recollect the accidental impulse given to the revolutionary spirit by events in Europe ; the horrors of the conflict , stained by excesses and barbarities unheard of in civilised warfare ; the comparative degradation of the patriot cause for a long series of years ; we put out of view the irregular character of the contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conducted generally without any indication of military ability ; we forgot that the scene was one exclusively of war and desolation , and that civil distinction , such as illumined the characters of our Morris and our Franklin , had no existence // in the dark atmosphere of this wild conflict . There was no one man , raised like the Father of our country , above reproach ; no object , like the beautiful peak of Orizava , of untainted and unvarying lustre , for elevated and unwearying contemplation . These were points of dissimilarity , which , though plain enough now , were not seen then , and the resemblance being once believed to be perfect , the sympathy was complete . When the war ceased and independence was acquired , we were further gratified by the avowed imitation of our example in the adoption of a federal form of government , and we all recollect the glow of pleasure and pride which every one felt and acknowledged , when it was ascertained that this course would be adopted by our neighbors . But here the resemblance ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to ebb . Among the incidents of the kind we have alluded to , the anomalous recognition of an exclusive ecclesiastical est*mblishment is unquestionably the most prominent . Of the iron net , with which the energies of this portion of humanity were enveloped , the surest thread was that which ecclesiastical tyranny had woven . It was *strengthened by obdurate prejudice , and had become by habit . and early education , matter of conscientious obligation . The Viceroy , the Intendant , or any subordinate member of the secular government might forfeit , by acts of folly or oppression , all deference and regard on the part of the colonist ; but the priest , as the minister of divine authority and its unquestioned agent to control and absolve , could not . Not only was the clerical domination sustained by the sanction of reward and punishment in a world to come , enforced by solemn pageantry and awful ceremonial , but by the more palpable efficacy of immediate retribution here . The fires of the Inquisition have not been long extinguished in our hemisphere . The ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotism was preserved by the concurrent and harmonious operation of secular and ecclesiastical control , so long did the structure of European power stand in unshaken security ; but the moment that the affection of the clergy for existing institutions was withdrawn , the gloomy fal*ric tottered to its fall . The erection of an independent ecclesiastical interest was the most ominous symptom in the revolutionary disease ; and as soon as the alliance of the clergy with the patriotic party was ascertained , the catastrophe was within the // scope of a limited foresight . Unnatural as was this connexion in point of principle , it was most beneficial in its immediate results . The sacred banner of the Virgin , which had led the soldiers of Cortez to conquest , and had floated over many a scene of slaughter and persecution , was for once displayed in a holy cause , and the principles of truth and liberty were proclaimed by intolerance itself . When the conquest was achieved , and the merits of the conquerors were to be graduated , the clergy were unwilling to resign their claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and their rights , extravagant and pernicious as they are now thought , were tacitly , perhaps willingly , recognised . The equally singular spectacle was then exhibited , of the promulgation of the vital principles of bigotry and conscientious despotism by the neophytes of freedom . The inconsistency gave a jar to the even course of our enthusiastic sympathy , from which it has never recovered . By the third article of the Federal Constitution , the Roman Catholic religion is to be the established religion of the State ; and by the hundred and seventy-first article , as if from the apprehension of an unpropitious change of sentiment , it is declared that the former provision is unalterable . The influence of this recognition of hierarchical authority on the condition of the citizens of the Republic , presents an object of most interesting speculation . We believe that it has tended more than any other circumstance , to degrade and to disgrace it ; and that religious innovation , had it been contemporaneous with political enfranchisement , would have produced the happiest results . Sound religious sentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from acceptable in these days of liberalism , operating through individuals on the conduct of government , is an element of national honor and prosperity . But it must be religion pure and undefiled . ' Our theory rests on the old fashioned doctrines , that humanity needs every mode of control to keep it in the path of moral rectitude , and that the government which is administered by those who acknowledge the obligation of religious duty , and are actuated by no other motives , is the best , and will eventually be the most successful . When the first pacific lawgiver of Rome feigned a heavenly origin for his laws , and divine sanction for their continuance , he manifested a spirit of pure and profound philosophy ; and history tells us , that the aspect of a community operated on by religious impulses , and devoted to the performance // of religious duty , impressed the surrounding barbarians with salutary awe . The classical student will recollect the passage of the most eloquent of Roman annalists , where this effect is described. * Feeble and uncertain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which has been developed by the genial influence of revealed truth , it depended on the same principle of human nature ,  --  the sense of dependence on a superintending power . It is a principle far beyond the sneer and sarcasm of infidelity . It is developed in the hymn of the Scottish soldiers on the eve of battle , and in the devotion of the Syrian warriors , who , in the heat of conflict , kneeled and adored the rising sun . Dogmatic theology and religious persecution were alike unknown to the ancient world ; and it has been reserved for modern and more enlightened times , to exhibit pure religion deformed by bigotry and intolerance . In republican Mexico , this unhallowed alliance has been attended with its natural consequences , and the essence of Christianity seems to have been sublimed and past away . It might he thought an excess of illiberality , and would unquestionably be unjust , were we to say without qualification , that no such thing as religion is to be found in our sister republic ; but we think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the new communities , to separate from the overwhelming masses of fanaticism and infidelity , inoic than a very minute portion of pure Christian sentiment . The outward signs are abundant . In 1826 , on the festival of San Felipe , the national saint , canonized by act of Congress , the President walked in solemn procession , in company with a gigantic effigy of the Devil ; and long since that time , the attention of a stranger was painfully attracted by a human hand exposed at the corner of one of the most crowded streets of Mexico , which had been cut off for sacrilege , and was festering in the public gaze . Religion , purifying and elevating public opinion , may emphatically be said not to exist . ** Ad ha*c consultanda procurandaque , multitudine omni a vi et armis conversa , et animi aliquid agendo occupati erant , et Deoruin assidua insidens cura , cum interesse rebus hurnanis ccAeste nurneim videretur , ca pietate omnium imbuerat , ut fides ac jusjuran*urn , proximo legum ac pnnarum metu , civitatem regerent : et cum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mores formarent , turn finitirni etiama populi , qui ante , castra , non urbern , positam in medjo ad sollicitandam omnium pacern , crediderant , in earn verecundiam adducti sunt , ut civitatern , totam in cultum versam Deorurn , violari ducerent nefas . ' Liv . I. 21. vor*. xxxll. - NO. 71. 43 // The direct influence of the clergy rests , however , on constitutional privilege ; and the period is yet remote , when that privilege is to be withdrawn . The absolute and relative condition of ecclesiastical authority , appears from a statement in one of the official papers , the title of which we have affixed to this article . In 1827 , according to the Report of Don Miguel Ramnos de Arispe , there were in orders about eight thousand one hundred and fifty individuals , including both the regular and secular clergy . In 1830 , the present Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs estimated the clergy at seven thousand four hundred , who , according to his classification , were divided as follows three thousand two hundred parish clergy , six hundred attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about one thousand nine hundred nuns . In the report the secretary says , that the number had been very much diminished during the preceding year , in consequence of the vacancy of nearly all the episcopal sees , and the difficulty of prbcuring regular investiture . The small difference between the numbers at the two periods to which we have referred , has bee** to us a matter of surprise ; as in the interval , the expatriation of the Spanish residents occurred , of whom a large portion were attached to some one or other of the orders of monks and parish priests . It never , however , has been asserted that the ascendency of the clergy is to be mainly attributed to their numerical stren * th ; for by a comparison with any one of the exclusively Catholic countries of Europe , and especially with Spain , it is evident that in this respect Mexico is in a far better condition than has been generally supposed . In 1820 , the population of Spain was estimated at twelve millions ; of whom about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Mexico , a vast influence is indirectly exercised by means of the great amount of landed property held in mortmain ; and it is that influence , sustained by gorgeous and imposing ceremonial and sacred pageants , daily and hourly exhibited , by the control of auricular confession and other assumed attributes of the church , operating on a great and unenlightened population , which degrades and dishonors it . By assuming the direction of conscience , it seems to have destroyed the moral tone of the community ; and by usurped powers of absolution and remission , has given a different and local direction to individual responsibility . By its continuance , dependent on the partial illumination of those over whom it is extended , intellectual // as well as moral improvement is retarded , and by its fatal tendency , it deadens the purest and holiest of human impulses , and covers with its pestilential waves , a soil destined for noble and beneficial culture . On the part of those who advocate as a point of expediency , this strict ecclesiastical control , the only practical suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education are promoted exclusively by the clergy in the seminaries under their superintendence ; and that public charity , and the encouragement and support of asylums and hospitals , depend wholly on them . That in the former particular , the exclusive interests of the clergy in Spanish America deserve consideration , we have already incidentally denied . We freely admit , that in the cause of charity and benevolence , and in ministering to the necessities of their fellow men , the Catholic monks and secular priests have been active laborers . In every city of the Republic , the traveller finds noble institutions , endowed by clerical munificence , for the reception of the sick and employment of the poor ; and he will see the aged and venerable friars performing the humble duties of hospital attendants , with anxious and honorable assiduity . But after all , the promotion of such objects is far from being an equivalent for the other incidents to hierarchical thraldom ; and the partial alleviation of the occasional sufferings of humanity , but slightly compensates for the general torpor of religious servitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerance , and in a measure , persecution , to take credit for charity and good will to their fellow men . They belong not to the same dispensation . Beautiful as is the theory of the ministration of the special agents of the Almighty , in the work of charity , and great as may have been the benefits secured in former times , in this particular , by the monasteries and convents in Mexico , the practical advantage is now , we believe , far from considerable . In the city of Puebla , the second in the Republic , ( we now speak from actual observation , ) in the year 18*7 , in two of the largest and most commodious of the public hospitals , under the care of the Franciscan Monks , where every convenience and comfort were gratuitously supplied by the directors , not a single inmate was to be found , while the streets of the city and suburbs were swarming with squalid wretches , deformed with every variety of loathsome disease , and depending for subsistence on the limosna , which their unceasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , to // pretend , that the sole remedy for pauperism and misery is to be supplied by the ecclesiastical institutions . Before leaving this topic , we will avail ourselves of the opportunity of paying a just tribute to the clergy of Mexico , for what in one particular they have done . During the horrors of the Revolution , whenever the storm of war , impelled by either party , approached the large cities of the Republic , and threatened them with pillage and desolation , and the noble institutions they contained with destruction , the powerful arm of the church was stretched forth , and its irresistible influence exerted to preserve them . No considerable city , except Guanajuato in 1810 , and then the assailants were led by one claiming clerical authority , was violated during twelve years of civil war . This honorable result is due , as we have intimated , to the exertions of the clergy ; and we cheerfully consent to allow all 1 ) ossible qualification of hostility to ecclesiastical supremacy which it can effect . Besides this isolated circumstance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the consequence we have deplored . It has always struck us as remarkable , that as a body of men , the regular clergy of New Spain should have had so little honorable distinction of any kind . Devoted to seclusion and solitary occupation , it would seem reasonable , that there should be found among them men of extensive and profound learning , and scholars , in the most elevated acceptation of the word . And yet we never remember to have heard or read of one . In walking through the beautiful gardens and dim corridors of the great Mexican convents , where the voice of the surrounding world is effectually excluded , where no sound is heard but the murmuring of the fountains , and where every object reposing in undisturbed serenity is consecrated to private and solemn meditation , the first and most natural suggestion is ,  --  how fit a place for study ! - how suitable a spot for profound and undisturbed reflection and yet of the thousands who have lived and died within these walls , there is no one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of useful labor for the benefit of the world . In one monastery , where , on crossing the threshold , the guide in a whisper informs the stranger , that within its limits the human voice is never heard , and the pious monks worship God in silence , as no sound arises but the echo of occasional footsteps , who can refrain from thinking how useless has all this seclusion proved , and how little consistent with christian usefulness and // christian piety is this unnatural solitude ; how much gloom must hang round the cell of the devout , and how much bitter disappointment and passion must agitate the bosom of him who from his solitude looks back wistfully on the world ? Fancy has hallowed the cell of the anchorite , but in sober truth no one will deny , that piety loses its fairest charms by seclusion . It is a principle intended for wide and extensive influence , to be seen , to be felt , to be loved , not like the beautiful orange groves of the convent gardens , to be planted remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its least repulsive form , where it is adorned by scholarship and intellectual accomplishments , is not an agreeable object of contemplation , but where , as in Mexico , it presents a wide field of utter desolation , it is sad and melancholy beyond expression . In religion so illustrated and so administered , the impartial world will never find that element of national prosperity and honor , which the framers of the Mexican constitution seem to have had in view . When a purer religious feeling will be generated , we will not pretend even to conjecture . A painful process must first be undergone . The work of spiritual emancipation has begun and is now going on , and is characterized by the usual gradations of feeling and opinion . Unmitigated superstition is yielding to general infidelity , and in the conflict between the bioot and the freethinker , morality is forgotten , b and the beneficent spirit of our religion is forced to suspend its sway . The change can not be sudden , and how gradual it will be , it is impossible to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clergy qualified , and at last we shall see the force of public opinion in the form of religious licentiousness , or in some less repulsive guise , operating on the legislation of the Republic , and compelling an alteration of the unalterable clause of her charter . We have occupied too much space with our cursory observations on this source of foreign disaffection , to say more than a passing word on the moral condition of the community , as illustrated by those who have had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with it . It is a subject on which we have no inclination to dilate . We do not believe there is a capital of equal size in the world , entitled to more ignominious distinction in point of general immorality , than the city of Mexico . Public opinion , so far from checking , encourages license . Domestic // virtue in high society is a flower which rarely blooms ; gallantry is systematized ; every lady of rank has her regular and avowed admirer , and conjugal infidelity finds excuse and provocation in libertinism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degrading passions of our nature , the highest in the scale is religion , the next is female influence . It was their combination which gave to chivalry its poetical , and which gives to true civilization its actual grace . As a chastener of the morbid propensities of humanity , the love of woman , using the word in its most exalted sense , is a moral agent of surpassing power ; and as it often exists without the other element of our constitution to which we have just referred , so it may often without its aid effect the most salutary restraint . The lover who invests his mistress , if not with the attributes of perfection , at least with the charms which approach nearest to them , and who looks to the forfeiture of her pure affection as the severest of misfortunes , has a motive to virtue which rarely fails . The husband who regards the wife of his bosom , not only with love but with pride , has the same impulse in a different , but not less persuasive form . Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged only as a minister of sensual appetite , and where the female character is divested of the romantic purity which belongs to it , and made like Don Juan* s successive heroines , only the object of licentious passion , we despair of witnessing moral beauty in any form . Domestic society has been beautifully described by a contemporary writer , * as the seminary of social affections , the cradle of sensibility , where the first elements are acquired of that tenderness and humanity which cement mankind together ; ' without female ascendency , this pure association can have no existence , and in its absence , we discern one of the darkest moral blemishes of the Mexican community . Besides this general tinge , there are various shades in the picture to which we can merely allude . Gambling is the peculiar and besetting sin , and is practised to an extent and with a refinement scarcely conceivable . From the humblest ranclio to the largest city of the Republic , the ruling passion is developed in one form or another . Mother Monte ' reigns a monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , England , whose eloquent works have recently , and for the first time , been collected and published at Andover , Massachusetts . // jects , and through every gradation , from the paltry quartillo lottery hawked about the squaies and portales of the capital to the magnificent gambling houses and cock-pits of San Augustin , we may trace this corroding poison , destroying the very elements of public virtue and happiness . Some idea of the extent of this mode of licentiousness may be formed , when we are told , that immediately before the great festival which is annually celebrated at San Augustin de las Cuevas , the price of doubloons is considerably enhanced ; and we are sustained in our assertion in regard to the misdirection of public opinion by the notorious fact , that the most distinguished men in the nation , some of them high in office , the prominent candidates for the most important offices , are to be seen participating in the brutal excitement of the Plaza de Gallos . ' It is a question which we will leave to the enthusiast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propensities and addicted to such pursuits can be the safe depositaries of public trusts ; whether the failure of the political experiment , made with such instruments is to be wondered at ; and whether disgust or disappointment on the part of the rest of the world , is matter of reasonable complaint . It is a trite but instructive truth , sanctioned by all experience , that private and public virtue are inseparable , and the question long since asked hy the poet has been fully answered ; When was public virtue to be found , Where private was not ? Can he love the whole , Who loves not part ? lie be the nation 's friend , Who is , in truth , the friend of no man there ? Can he be strenuous in his country 's cause , Who slights the charities , for whose dear sake That country , if at all , must be beloved ? ' For ourselves , we trust no morality that is not founded on a stern sense of religious obligation ; and we deny the possibility of permanent political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private as well as public , familiar as well as general . That there are in Mexico many individuals of high moral worth and unblemished domestic character , it is not our wish nor intention to deny . Our remarks are of course general in their application , and our theory , founded on an attentive consideration of the whole subject , is , that , with the numerous examples of virtue that may be pointed out , and with all the qualification which they may afford , there is a radical // defect in the moral constitution of the community , which we most cordially lament . It is their supposed superiority in this respect , that has occasioned our earnest wishes for the perma-. nent success of the present dominant party in Mexico . We believe the moral strength of the party which have administered the government since the revolution of Jalapa in 1829 , to be unquestionably greater than that of their opponents , and we rely on that powerful agent to secure their ultimate triumph . It is to the concurrent operation of all these causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diminution of good will to our sister republic on the part of the great body of our fellow citizens . In the dark blemishes of religious intolerance and moral debasement , the one necessarily blending with the other , our neighbors may find the secret of that estrangement , of which they sometimes so bitterly- complain . We hope that in each particular the hour of change is at hand , and , though the dawn but glimmers , we indulge the pleasure of tracing in these the faint streaks of light , the approaching day of genuine religion and morality . Our business , however , is rather to dwell on the present and the past than to speculate on the possibility and probable period of future improvement ; and we hope we have sustained our assertion , that the unfavorable judgment which the world generally , and our countrymen especially , have been compelled to form , is neither unkind nor unjust . We have time to say but a word on the diplomatic relations of this country with Mexico . It is a subject of great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion we may call the attention of our readers in all its detail . We refer to it now , having already transgressed our limits , merely with a view to remove a false impression , which has been generally made . Our diplomatic intercourse with Spanish America has unquestionably been unfortunate ; and the facts are strongly contradictory of theory , that with but one , and that a second rate republic , which has since been awfully convulsed by intestine feuds , have the agents of our government been able easily to negotiate treaties ; and that the great project of promoting harmony of feeling and action on points of common interest , proved utterly abortive through the enmity of some , and the lukewarmness of all the Spanish American authorities . It is , we are aware , a common opinion that this estrangement is to be attributed to the intrigues and machinations of European // Foreign Relations of . Miexico. 341 and especially British agents ; and that there is a certain ill-defined foreign influence unceasingly working to our injury , which affords a convenient explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theory is founded . On the minds of inexperienced men , like those who have directed the administration of affairs in the new republics , the influence of a great community like Great Britain necessarily and naturally operates , and we have no doubt , that its agents for obvious reasons have endeavored to maintain it ; but we have yet to be convinced , that the diplomatic representatives of our great rival carry general instructions to foment discord and foster jealousy , and that the first and great object of their missions is to make the new governments believe , that their prosperity depends on their persevering hatred to their elder republican sister . XVe say this in no excess of favor towards British tactics , hut in the absence of all evidenc* to support the opposite theory . If the British government have acquired great or even unbounded influence on the affairs of Spanish America , it is a result so natural , that we are not disposed to complain of it ; and it by no means follows , that it is an exclusive , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are informed , it has been the means of gaining no important preference in negotiation . It has effected no exclusion ; it has wrought no exemption on one side , or imposition on the other ; it has secured no substantial benefit to a Briton , which an American has lost . When our late Minister to Columbia was involved in difilculty at the capital of that Republic , the British Cltarg6 d ' *ffaires fell under an equal weight of suspicion and displeasure ; and with less apparent provocation , was the object of as much aggravated and deliberate insult . When Mr. Poinsett , in the early part of his negotiations at Mexico , urged th esignature of a commercial treaty on principles of reciprocity between the contracting parties , and equality of privilege with regard to the rest of the world , the only obstacle was a preference , which it was desired to give , not to Great Britain , but to the republics of Spanish origin . In the treaty signed previously by the British Ministers , a provision to this effect had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our part was the reluctance expressed by the Mexican negotiators to give us a preference over England , whom they naturally regarded as a useful ally , and from whom they had received substantial favors . When in the year 1826 , the executive // authority of Mexico , by an act of as high-handed tyranny as the annals of commercial grievance record , sudcfenly raised the valuation of mantas , or coarse cotton goods , so as to impose an additional duty of fifty per cent. , the injury affected with equal severity the European and American merchants , and the remonstrances of the British diplomatic agent were more than moderately indignant . In short , we have never been able to define to oUr minds this unbounded transatlantic control , which has been supposed to exist , or to trace it in any substantive benefit or privilege , that it has secured . When we read in the journals of the day , that on the occasion of the death of the late Duke of York , the Mexican public authorities clad themselves in mourning and commemorated the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurdity and bad taste of the exhibition , but we do not see in it an omen of pernicious foreign ascendency . Those who for want of more appropriate subjects of speculation , harass themselves by turning such mole-hills into mountains , might be reminded , that in one of our own commercial cities , on the death of the King of England , a number of newspaper printers and ship-masters paid a public tribt*ite of respect to the consular representative of the British government in that place , and incidentally , of regret for the loss he was bound to deplore . We presume an inference of baneful foreign influence would be as fair in one case as in the other . Let us not be misunderstood . We do not mean to say that Great Britain has no decided influence in Mexican affairs . We are ready to concede , that she has mere than any other nation , and that were the allies of the new republic to be graduated , England would stand higher on the scale than we do . We are even willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , on account of circumstances with which our readers are well acquainted , such as the loans and mining investments , it is natural , therefore , it ought to be so . But we do not believe that all or any of our difficulties with the new States of America , are to be attributed to the machinations of European agents , and are disposed to give some credit to the friendly expressions more than once used in Parliament , by distm. * guished members of the late British ministry. * // We have thus endeavored to define our feelings towards our sister republic , and to indicate the causes which have produced them . Points of essential dissimilarity resulting from peculiarities of education and discipline , dark blemishes on their political charters , subjects of accidental collision , have all cornbined to produce the abatement of affection on our part which we now deplore . Much as we regret the state of feeling we have described , and widely as it differs from the cordial sympathy we once hoped to feel , it is highly important that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize it . Let our agents to the Spanish American governments be directed to attend exclusively to the legitimate objects of their missions , and to act upon the safe principles of ordinary and honest negotiation , without reliance upon sympathies and affections which , as they will discover , have no existence . What they have a right to claim , let them demand with the decision and dignity suited to the country they represent , and to the justice of the cause they advocate . Let there be no diplomatic affectation of maneuvre and intrigue . We are inclined to think that technical diplomacy , with all its tricks and subtleties , has gone out of fashion all over the world . We are certain , that it will disgracefully fail if it should be attempted in our intercourse with the American communities . If our influence in Mexico , for instance , be small , it is little worth the sacrifice to attempt to increase it by associations with partisans of any class , or by useless meddling in the turmoils of local politics . We may hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when prejudice and error will be removed , genuine national friendship appreciated , and proper national associations formed ; - when our neighbors of Mexico will cease to view the equipment of an additional frigate with alarm , and a military movement on our Indian frontier with jealousy . They may be assured , that there is yet much latent good-will which can easily be developed . Let their moral and intellectual improvement be such as in times of permanent tranquillity we hope it will be , let the odious features of their constitution he obliterated , and let their statesmen evince a disposition to act on the principles of ordinary justice and national comity , and they will find in their northern neighbors sincere and zealous friends . The despised and rejected theory of republican co-operation may then he realized . We may not see that consummation , but we hope that the belief is not unreasonable , that it will be seen by those who are to come after us.                    @
