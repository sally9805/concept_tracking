txt THOUGHTS ON POLITENESS . THE common notion about politeness is , that it is a thing of the body and not of the mind , and that he is a polite man who makes certain motions in a graceful manner and at proper times and places . We expect the dancing master to teach our children " manners " as well as the art of cutting awkward capers to music , and we pay him on the same compound principle , by which the sage McGrawler was compensated , for his instructions to Paul Clifford ,  --  " two bobs for the Latin , and a sice for the vartue . " But the truth is , that we degrade politeness by making it any thing less than a cardinal virtue . The happiness of life is made up of an infinite number of little things and not of startling events and great emotions ; and he who daily and hourly diffuses pleasure around him by kind offices , frank salutations and cheerful looks , deserves as well of his species , as he , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by occasional acts of generosity , justice or benevolence . Besides , the opportunity of doing great things , but rarely occurs , while a man has some dozens of chances , every day of his life , to show whether he be poltte or not . The value of a thing , too , is great in proportion to its rarity , and true politeness is a very rare thing , gentle reader , stare though you may . I have seen many graceful men , many agreeable , many who were even fascinating , but very few who were polite , as the word is defluedin my dictionary . Sometimes there is a deficiency in certain things , sometimes the quality extends to a certain point , after which you enter into that " kingdom of me , " spoken of in one of Dryden 's plays , and a large kingdom it is too . Sometimes there is a fault of omission and sometimes of commission ; so that , on the whole , the quality is about as rare as greatness , and , indeed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , in the first place , have the gift of good sense , for without that foundation , it is idle to think of rearing any , even the smallest superstructure . He must know when to violate that code of conventional forms , which common consent has established , and when not to ; for it is equally a mark of weakness to be a slave to these forms or to despise them . He must have penetration and tact enough to adapt his conversation and manner to circumstances and individuals ; for that which is politeness in the drawing-room , may be downright rudeness in the bar-room or the stagecoach , as well as the converse . Above all , he must have that enlarged and catholic spirit of humility , which is the child of self-knowledge , and the parent of benevolence , ( indeed , politeness itself is merely benevolence , seen through the little end of a spy-glass ) which , not content with bowing low to this rich man or that fine lady , respects the rights and does justice to the claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fastidious and exclusive persd ' *s , who look down upon a man created and upheld by the same power as themselves and heir to the same immortal destinies , because he does not dress in a particular style or visit in certain houses , they are out of the question . If they are too weak to perceive the grotesque absurdity of their // own conduct , they have not capacity enough to master the alphabet of good manners . If angelic natures be susceptible of ludicrous emotions , we know of nothing more likely to call them forth , than the sight of an insect inhabitant of this great ant-hill , assuming airs of superiority over his brother emmet , because he has a few more grains of barley in his granary , or some other equally cogent reason . Of the gentlemen , young and old , whiskered and unwhiskered , that may be seen in Washington-street , any sunshiny day , there is not one who does not think himself a polite man , and who would not very much resent any insinuation to the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following . When they go to a party , they make a low bow to the mistress of the house , and then look round after somebody that is young and pretty to make themselves agreeable to . At a ball , they will do their utmost to entertain their partner , unless the fates have given them to some one who is ugly and awkward , and they will listen to her remarks with their most bland expression . If they are invited to a dinner-party , they go in their best coats , praise their entertainer 's wine , and tell the lady they hope her children are all well . If they tread on the toes of a well dressed person , they will beg his pardon . They never spit on a carpet , and in walking with a lady they always give her the inside ; and , if the practice be allowable , they offer her their arm . So far , very good ; but I must always see a man in certain situations , before I decide whether he be polite or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if placed at dinner between an ancient maiden lady and a country clergyman with a small salary and a rusty coat , and with some distinguished person opposite to him . I want to sse him on a hot and dusty day , sitting on the back seat of a stagecoach , when the driver takes in some poor lone woman , with may-be a child in her arms , and tells the gentlemen that one of them must ride outside and make room for her . I want to be near him when his washerwoman makes some very good excuse to him for not bringing home his clothes at the usual time , or not doing up an article in exactly the style he wished . I want to hear the tone and emphasis with which he gives orders to servants in steamboats and taverns . I mark his conduct , when he is walking with an umbrella on a rainy day , and overtakes an old man , or an invalid , or a decent looking woman , who are exposed without protection , to the violence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he thinks his inferiors , I listen to hear if his conversation be entirely about himself . If some of the number be very distinguished , and some quite unknown , I observe whether he acts as if he were utterly unconscious of the presence of these last . These are a few and but a few , of the tests by which I try a man , and I am sorry to say there are very few who can stand them all . There is many a one who passes in the world for a very well-bred man , because he knows when to bow and smile , that is down in my tablets for a selfish , vulgar , unpolite monster , that loves the parings of his own nails better than his neighbor 's whole body . Put any man in a situation where he is called upon to make a sacrifice of his own comfort and ease , without any equivalent in return , and you will Learn the difference between true politeness , that sterling ore of the heart , and the counterfeit imitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an idiot not to be polite in society , so called , for how else would he get his oysters and Champagne ? Politeness is a national as well as an individual characteristic , and it would be a curious subject of speculation to inquire what degree of cultivation and refinement is most favorable to it , for the extremes both of civilization and savageness do not seem to be propitious . I am inclined to think the Greeks were a more polite people than any of modern times , when we take into consideration the advantage we have in the greater respect which women now both deserve and receive , and the favorable influence exerted upon our manners in consequence . There is something extremely touching in the respect they paid to old age . If I were inclined to display a little learning , I might illustrate my position , by examples drawn from their history ; but there are many that every school-boy is familiar with , and they need not be repeated here for the ten thousandth time . The Jews were a polite people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) contains many striking instances of it . Indeed , it is a striking peculiarity of the Scriptures , that all the graces and embellishments of life may be learned from them , as well as its most solemn duties and highest obligations , and that they contain every thing requisite to form a perfect man . How delicate and feeling is the conduct of Jacob , at his first meeting with Rachel , at the well of Haran , and how unlike what would be expected in our refined times . The self-denial of David , recorded in the eleventh chapter of the first book of Chronicles , in refusing to drink of the water which his " three mightiest " captains had procured with the peril of their lives , is an instance of politeness sublimed into magnanimity . And , to mention but one example more , how beautiful and touching is the behavior of the three friends of Job , who " sat down with him upon the ground , seven days and seven nights , and none spake a word unto him , for they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves a polite people , and , comparatively speaking , perhaps we are so . It is allowed , I believe , that Americans , both at home and abroad , are remarkably attentive to women , though Capt . Hall thinks otherwise . Still we commit some offences against good breeding . ' We have a bad trick of staring at strangers , as any one must have noticed , who has been in a country church when any one entered . And then we ask a great many idle and not a few impertinent questions . The habit we have of cutting and defacing every fixture that is penetrable to steel , is so universal and so abominable , that it deserves to be scourged out of us by a pestilence or a famine . The manners too , of our common people towards each other , are marked by great roughness and an entire inattention to all the little courtesies of life . Perhaps we owe this to our English descent ; for John Bull thinks that if a man is polite to him , he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little offences committed against good manners , which people are hardly aware of at the time . It is not polite , for instance , to tease a person to do what he has once declined , and it is equally impolite to refuse a request or an invitation in order to be urged , and accept afterwards . Comply at once ; if your friend be sincere , you will gratify him ; if not , you will punish him , as he deserves to be . It is not polite , when asked what part of a dish you will // have , to say " any part , it is quite indifferent to me ; " it is hard enough to carve for one 's friends , without choosing for them . It is not polite to entertain our visiters with our own family history , and the events of our own household . It is not polite for married ladies , to talk in the presence of gentlemen , of the difficulty they have in procuring domestics , and how good-for-nothing they are when they are procured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate of your guest , without asking his leave , nor to press him to eat more than he wants . It is not polite to stare under ladies ' bonnets , as if you suspected they had stolen the linings from you . It is  --  but let me remember it is not polite to be a bore , especially in print . It does not seem to me that the world has gained much in politeness during the last two or three hundred years . It is all surplusage to the Utilitarian philosophy . There is a lofty and chivalrous spirit of courtesy that hangs over the age of Queen Elizabeth , like a rose-colored atmosphere . What a contrast there is between the warriors , the courtiers and the statesmen , the Sydneys , the Raleighs and the Essexes , of the court of the Virgin Queen , and the modern fine gentlemen , the disciples of Brummel , and the admirers of Pelham ! It reminds us of the difference between our rectangular habits and round black beavers , and the silks , velvets and plumes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffle . What a beautiful and touching instance of genuine politeness , is that well known anecdote recorded of Sir Philip Sydney , in the last moments of his life , and how few of the preux chevaliers of the nineteenth century are there , capable , I will not say , of imitating it , but even of admiring it as it ought to be admired . A sublime indifference to all sublunary things , except himself seems to be the distinguishing characteristic of the fine gentleman , now-a-days . But perhaps the progress of society has had the same effect here as in other things ; it has made the generality of men more polite , though there are not such splendid individual instances of the quality . But to come nearer home , our own generation does not seem to have the advantage , in this respect , of that which preceded it . 1 am an admirer of the old school of manners , as it is commonly called . I like the minute attentions , the uniform , though formal courtesy , and the mingled dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens of it that are left among us , appear like Corinthian columns , to which time has lent a touching grace , independent of their intrinsic beauty . They connect us with an age , in which far more stress was laid upon dress and manner , and all external things , than now , to an age of wigs and knee-buckles , of flowered waistcoats and hooped petticoats , of low bows and stately courtesies ; and I shall be sorry when they are all gone . Let no man imagine that his rank , or station , or talents , excuse him from an attention to those rules of good breeding , which cost nothing but a little care , and which make a great deal of difference in the sum total of human happiness . They are as imperative as the rules of morality , and there is no one , however great or high , that does not owe to society a liberal recompense for what he receives from it . There is now and then a man so weak as to affect to be rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his deficiencies in these little things will be ascribed to the largeness of the objects with which he is habitually conversant , and that his mind will be supposed unable to come down // from the airy regions of contemplation , to such low matters . But such a one should be put into the same state-room of the great Ship of Fools , with those who twisted their necks to look like Alexander , or spoke thick to resemble Hotspur . A man that can do great things and not little ones , is an imperfect man ; and there is no more inconsistency between the two , than there is in a great poet 's being able to write a promissory note , or a great orator 's having the power to talk about the weather . I will only remark , in conclusion , that good-breeding should form a part of every system of education . Not that children should be made to barter their native simplicity for a set of artificial airs and graces , but that they should be early impressed with the deformity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as themselves . Care should be taken that their intercourse with each other be in a spirit of courtesy and mildness . He , who has been reared in a brawling and ill-mannered nursery , can hardly be expected to ripen into a polite man . The elder members of a family should bear in mind that the influ ' *nce of their own conduct will icircle the children like an atmosphere . There can be little happiness in that household , in which the minutest offices are not dictated by a spirit of thoughtful courtesy and delicate consideration for others . How many marriages are made wretched by a neglect of those little mutual attentions , so scrupulously paid in the days of courtship . Let it be borne in mind , that the cords of love , which bind hearts so closely together , that neither Life , nor Death , nor Time , nor Eternity can sever them , are woven of threads no bigger than a spider 's web.                  @ @ @
