txt AMONG the various expressions by- which the predominating spirit of the times , especially as developed in this country , has been described , one of the happiest is that which denominates it " the age of commemoration . " For some time past a disposition has been manifested , in almost every section of the Union , to recover and to record every thing , which might be regarded // as illustrative of the men and events connected with the history of the country . This historical spirit may justly he considered as one of the main-springs of that remarkable advancement of the national literature , which has occurred within the last twenty years . It will be regarded by our posterity , in all coming ages , as most fortunate for them that this commemorative propensity began to he so actively and effectually exhibited by a generation , standing so near , as we do , to the very commencement of the existence of the country itself , as the abode of civilization . Although two centuries have necessarily thrown some shadows over the incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and indeed almost all of them of any importance , may still be recovered from obscurity , and secured from oblivion ; and if we are faithful to our trust , and make a proper use of our opportunities , it will he entirely in our power to preserve , for coming ages , all that is worth preservation of the history of our own times . In a literary point of view it is impossible to estimate too highly , the importance of cultivating the spirit of which we are speaking . The most natural and useful basis of a national literature is found in historical incidents , persons , and associations . They will supply the best , - and in the absence of mythology and superstition , the only materials for poetry and romance , the most authentic illustrations of political philosophy and moral science , and the most stirring and affecting topics of eloquence . No people can possibly be barbarous , or unintellectual , who receive from their ancestors , as a continually accumulating inheritance , a knowledge of the men and events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with local and territorial objects , enjoying the notice , awakening the reflections , and expanding the minds of the people , a high moral influence will , at the same time , he brought to hear upon their characters . They will spend their daily lives in scenes which will speak to them , even with more powerful persuasion than from living lips , the language of encouragement and of admonition , inspiring them with enthusiasm for virtue , with horror for crime , and with a true love of glory . He , whose fancy delights to call up the images of his ancestors , feels that he is not merely living in the presence of his contemporaries , but that he is surrounded , at every step , by a continually thickening cloud of witnesses , gathered from every generation of his honored forefathers . // But this is not all . He is constantly reminded that the same embalming genius , which thus preserves the memory of his ancestors , may also bear down his own name , either in honor or in shame , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity . It is obvious that a regard for posthumous fame , that noble principle of conduct , which , whatever may he said of it by cold and heartless logicians , is sanctioned and vindicated by nature , and nature 's author , and in point of fact , has presented the most grand and beneficial achievements of human virtue and power , must perish , for want of aliment , in a community where the living generation is ignorant of the past , and takes no measures to he remembered by the future . Happily for us , and for our descendants , as we have already remarked , the spirit of emulation is fairly awakened , and actively at work among us . Our literature is already prematurely rich , and is daily becoming more so , in the historical department . In our last number , we conaratulated the American public , and the friends of learning generally , upon the appear ance , in Mr Bancroft 's History of the United States , of a work which promises , if continued as commenced , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which may , in one sense , he considered the humhler , but can not justly he regarded the less important , branch of historical literature designated as Annals , we have long been particularly favored . In the elaborately arid carefully executed work of Rev. Dr. Holmes , we have a hook which may he relied upon with the utmost confidence , and which , for accuracy of statement , clearness of arrangement , and neatness of diction , is generally regarded as a standard in the class to which it belongs . Under the head of biography we refer with satisfaction to the labors of Belkuap , Eliot , and Allen . In this class we possess some works which would adorn the literature of any country , such as Marshall 's Life of Washington , President Kirkland 's Life of Fisher Ames , Tudor 's Life of Otis , Presidcnt Quincy 's and Mr. Jay 's lives of their illustrious fathers , Wirt 's Life of Patrick Henry , and , riot to mention others , Mr. Sparks 's invaluable publications of this description . The abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and approbation with which they have been received by the reading community , bad almost led us to form the conclusion that they were destined to supplant , and prevent the appearance in future , of any works aiming to occupy the // higher department already alluded to . Our minds had almost settled down in the conviction , that we were never to expect any general , classical , and philosophical history of the United States , but that instead of it , our history would be written in parts , and piecemeal , as it were ; that , for instance , the annals of our revolutionary war would be recorded in such publications , as Washingtoti 's Letters , and the pages and biographies of him and his various associates in the military and civil service might supply ; and that the public taste would be better gratified by exploring severally such personal memoirs , and particular narratives , than by any comprehensive and general history that might be written . As this belief gradually forced itself upon our minds , we had endeavored to become reconciled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first volume , and the universal applause with which it was greeted , satisfied us that our conclusion was premature , and our regrets uncalled for . We may now rest assured that our historical literature will not be defective in any of its important departments , but that , while the publication of private memoirs , and personal narratives promises to afford us the delightful satisfaction of becoming directly acquainted with the characters and events of previous generations in their minutest particulars , we shall also be conducted to that lofty point of observation , where individuals and particulars cease to be discernible ; and where the great drama of our country 's progress is seen only in the operation of the mighty causes that have determitied its action , and the development of the more important events which have successively occupied its scenes . In addition to comprehensive histories , annals , biographies , and memoirs , there are the important , and in some instances already voluminous publications of Historical Societies ; and also , what perhaps is contributing more than any other cause to enrich this branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the recurrence of centennial and other anniversary occasions . In these productions , the exaciness of the annalist , the minuteness and poignancy of the biographer , arid the broad speculations of the philosophical historian , are all united under the charms of rhetorical diction , and made to bear upon the heart by the powers of eloquence , gathering neverfailing and inexhaustible strength from the sources of local associations and national pride . As specimens of this class of productions , which , by the way , seem to be peculiar to our own country , it is hardly necessary to remind the reader of the // splendid and noble orations which have been pronounced , by our most eminent scholars , jurists and statesmen , at Plymouth , Faneuil Hall , Salem , Charlestown , Concord , Bunker Hill , Cambridge and Ipswich . Such bccasions have drawn out the highest abilities of the country in every quarter . The value and excellence of the productions , that have thus been added to the national literature , will be sufficiently indicated by mentioning Verplanek 's Discourse before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Philosophical Society , the Eulogies on Adams and Jefferson , pronounced by John Sergeant and William Wirt , at Philadelphia and Washington , and Mr. Binney 's admirable Eulogiuin on Chief Justice Tilghman . The work before us belongs to a still different form of historical literature . This form , although of recent origin , has already been employed to a considerable extent , both in England and America ; and is fully entitled to the credit of being one of the most useful and elegant in which the materials of history can be collected and preserved , and the taste for such studies gratified . The design is to present , in the most chaste and classical style of composition , and with all possible beauty of mechanical execution , an accurate and authentic account of the lives and characters of those persons who have distinguished themselves in the public service , or in any way contributed to promote the national glory . The biographical sketches are brief and condensed , and each is accompanied by the most exact and best executed portrait that can be procured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great and good of this and previous generations , and perpetuates their living images , at the same time it exhibits a specimen of the highest point of excellence to which the arts of painting , engraving , typography , and paper-making are carried in the country . But the finished elegance of the Portrait Gallery does not constitute its only , nor its highest claim to public patronage . In an historical point of view , it deserves to be regarded as a work of very great value . A general history of a large country must always , as has been before intimated , cover so wide a surface as to forbid such a degree of particularity , as is necessary in order to give to it one of the principal charms that belong to that department of writing , individual characters , and single incidents must be passed over in silence , or but slightly noticed . The course of occurrences must be related only in their most promi // nent stages , and can be explained no farther than by referring to their leading causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is necessary in order to give to a work , which aims to occupy the highest department of history , its peculiar excellence , it deprives it , at the same time , of much of the interest and value that would attach to a more particular and detailed narrative . Every general history , considered as a relation of the actual course of events , from the nature of the case , must be defective and meagre . This is an inevitable result ; for if it attempted to narrate minutely all the facts that belonged to the topics of which it treated , there would be no room left for those reflections , and philosophical inductions , which constitute the highest attributes of historical composition . If any one wish to ascertain and estimate the correctness of these remarks , let him take , as an experiment , Hume 's History of England , and examine attentively the account which that elegant and much admired historian gives of any particular period in English annals , - that of the civil wars at the time of the commonwealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more particular study of the period , scrutinize the characters , and trace the career of the men who figured in it , review the whole course of events , as they connected themselves , as cause and effect , before and after , on the right hand and on the left , and explore them thoroughly and patiently in those original sources , from which ultimately all writers must derive their information . When this shall have been done , it will be seen bow much that is interesting , affecting , instructive , and romantic is necessarily omitted by the historian , whose plan embraces an entire nation , over its whole surface , and throughout all its periods and ages . These omissions and deficiencies must be supplied by works of a different description . Brief biographies of particular characters are well adapted to answer this end . They constitute the complement of history . When the great events and revolutions , which are the prominent points in the career of a nation , have been suitably represented and commemorated , the memoirs of individuals who acted conspicuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remains , worthy of notice , from oblivion , and the whole work will be adequately accomplished . But besides this view of the importance of such works as the Portrait Gallery , in gathering up all that remains , so that nothing be lost , the publication of the personal memoirs of distinguished men , now on the stage of life , or who have recently // left it , is of immense value , as preparing the materials for the future historian . If the passing generation is faithful to its trust in this respect , there will he no di*culty at any future day in tracing the course of events while it occupied the scene , or in describing the agents whose influence controlled and directed its progress . It is because we attach such a very high value to every thing that tends to promote the prevalence of historical literature in this country , that we have indulged in these remarks . If adequate encouragement is now extended to those whose talent and inclination lead them to such investigations , it is not too late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetfulness , all that is worthy of record . Our whole history may be clearly illustrated . All fable , and mystery , and doubt may be dispelled from our annals , and it may thus be our privile*e , to do what no other nation has yet been able to do , to trace our course from the point where we now stand , without confusion or difficulty , back to the very first day of our history . The importance of that history stimulates and exhorts us to accomplish this object , if we can . From some of its chapters the world has already received such instructions , as have enabled the nations of Europe to discover the path that leads to their own social and political improvement . And if we would guide them to the highest attainment of the blessings of liberty and virtue , we must display before them our whole history , from this our present period of freedom , power , and independence , down to the moment when the Mayflower cast anchor in the harbor of Plymouth . But we must bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what in reality was the sole object of this article , to recommend to the public patronage the splendid and valuable work now before us . The National Portrait Gallery is conducted by Messrs . Herring of New York , and Longacre of Philadelphia , under the superintendence of the American Academy of Fine Arts . It is published in monthly parts , each of which contains two or more memoirs of distinguished persons , accompanied in all cases by the most admirable engraved portraits . Its execution , as has before been remarked , is in every particular the best and most finished which the state of the arts in America will permnit . It is a work which would equally adorn the library or embellish the parlor ; and considering the elegance of its form , can be obtained on very reasonable terms . But the fairest way to convey an idea // of its value , without reference to any other point than the character of its contents , is to repeat the names of the subjects of the first volume . They are the following , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generals Green , Wayne , Moultrie and Putnam , Timothy Pickering , Governors Shirley and Ogden , Chief Justice Marshall , Chief Justice Shippen , Brigadier General Jonathan Williams , Vice President Tompkins , Henry Clay , President Jackson , Daniel Webster , William Wirt , Lewis Cass , Commodore Macdonough , Major General Macomb , Joel R. Poinsett , Josiah S. Johnston , Edward Livings ton , Louis MeLane , Bishop White , Timothy Dwight , Joel Barlow , Colonel John Trumbull , Gilbert Charles Stuart , Samuel Latham Mitchell , Theodoric Romeyn Beck , Washington Irving , Catharine M. Sedgwick , and James Fennimore Cooper . We understand that the enterprising conductors of this work are resolved to render it truly , as well as nominally , a National Portrait Gallery . It is their purpose to include every distinguished name , without reference to the section of the country which it adorns , the political or religious denominations under which it is classed , or the period during which it shone . As yet , most of the memoirs have been derived from the Middle States , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductors are making arrangements to procure the best executed portraits and bio*raphies of distinguished men from the East , and South , and West . Mr. Herring has himself copied the paintings of Hancock , Samuel Adams , Josiah Quincy , Jr. , and the other eminent New England revolutionary patriots , having visited Boston and Cambridge for that purpose , and it is of national importance that every facility he afforded him , and his cdoperators , in procuring the requisite materials for rendering the work complete , according to its design , so tl1at by passing through it , the American patriot and scholar may behold in succession , as in one extended gallery , the images and the history of all who have contributed to shed light or glory on his country . It is with lively satisfaction that we hear from the conductors , as they have expressed themselves in the address attached to their twelfth number , that their enterprise has received " a cordial and cheering support from their countrymen , " and that their own experience proves , that " the American people now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own glory . " We rejoice that so much success has attended them , // in their praiseworthy exertions to enlarge the materials of our historical literature , to stimulate the progress of the most elegant and useful arts , and to secure the national honor from oblivion , and can only say , in conclusion , that we sincerely hope that their success may be continued and increased , - and that their labors may be rewarded by a generous , enlightened , and effectual patronage in every quarter of the country , and by all classes of their countrymen.
