txt THE Birthday of MR . PAINE falling this year on a Sunday , it was thought advisable to postpone the DINNER and BALL in commemoration of that event , to the following day , and to have the Oration delivered on the preceding evening . Although that evening was , perhaps , as stormy as any other during this remarkably severe winter , Tammany Hall was crowded by as respectable an audience of ladies and gentlemen as New York could produce , to listen to the following ORATION , delivered by Mr. JOHN MORRISON. /z/ WE are now assembled together to render a tribute to the memory of one of the greatest men that ever existed ; yet , paradoxical as it may appear , the man on whom the most virulent and unrelenting abuse has been poured , for declaring his honest opinions as to what constitutes the happiness of the human race . Fearlessly , and in despite of what his base calumniators may say , we are now met in this place for the avowed purpose of proclaiming to the world our unqualified approbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of all that was dear to existence , by the ever to be venerated and truly philanthropic THOMAS PAINE . Although we were not prompted to render this tribute to the memory of the deceased by the force of established custom , no one , I trust , will deny that meetings to commemorate the natal day of those who have been conspicuous laborers in the great work of human happiness , are calculated to stimulate the living to emulate their virtues , and to communicate to the bosoms of their descendants the just and noble sentiments that animated their own . In undertaking the arduous , though pleasing task , of endeavoring to do justice to the character of this amiable man , I am deeply impressed with the truth of what has been more than once remarked , that the present age is incapable of sufficiently appreciating the imperishable labors of his mighty mind . I have likewise felt , that my talents were too feeble to depict , in its true colors , the bitter animosity with which his character and writings have been assailed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these writings , have defended the fair fame of their author . But as my object has been to state facts , rather than indulge in idle declamation ; and as I am persuaded the greater part of those who now hear me would prefer this course to a florid harangue , in which sense was sacrificed to sound , I throw myself entirely on your in- diligence , while 1 proceed to do no more than what I consider an act of justice , and what , as rational beings , we owe to all our species , the vindication of an injured man from the vituperations of bigotry and fanaticism . THOMAS PAINE , although a native of Great Britain , * was , in the strict sense of the word , a citizen of the world . Long before the American " Declaration of Independence " announced the important , arid , to tyrants , the appalling truth , that " all men are born free and equal , " he had cherished this sentiment in his bosom ; and the first proof that he gave of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the aid of his brethren in this country , ! who were struggling to free themselves from a cruel and foreign despotism . He could not , it is true , be of much service in a military point of view , to those he came to assist . But what he lacked in this respect , he more than supplied by his powerful pen . When the army of the brave Washington was reduced to nearly the last extremity , and the opinion was almost universal that the cause of American liberty was hopeless , Paine , confident in the correctness of his principles , and determined to avow them at all hazards , stepped forward , and in his admirable treatise entitled " Common Sense , " and in the " Crisis , " urged the necessity of a virtual separation from the oppressors , and the formation of a government congenial with the true principles of liberty . This fearless attempt , in which he stood alone , had the desired effect . The project was almost unanimously hailed with rapture . The slumbering energies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by conforming to those principles which the mighty mind of Paine was alone capable of conceiving , that political fabric was reared of which we now so justly boast , because it is calculated to secure to all the uninterrupted enjoyment of their natural rights . Having aided , in so essential a manner , in establishing the liberties of this country , and perceiving in the political horizon indications of better days for enslaved Europe , he hastened to his native country , ! which he reached at the moment the breaking out of the French Revolution threatened the overthrow of all the existing thrones in that quarter of the globe . Here he associated with those great men , whose memory will be ever held dear by the friends of liberty , for the sacrifices they made in the common cause of humanity ; and from whom emanated that impressive " Address and Declaration , " written by Paine , in which they " congratulate the French nation for having laid the axe to the root of tyranny , and for erecting a government on the sacred hereditary rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any one more than another ; " and fearlessly declared , that they " know of no human * Mr. Paine was born at Thetford , in Norfolk , England , on the 29th Jan. 1737. t He arrived in the United States in the month of April , 1775. t 1787 . Home Tooke , Thomas Hardy , and others . authority superior to that of a whole nation , which has at all time* an inherent , indefeasible right to constitute and establish such government for itself , as best accords with its disposition , interest , and happiness . " This appeal , containing an avowal of principles so subversive of established systems , roused the indignation of the aristocracy in Great Britain to such a degree , that the most oppressive measures were resorted to , in order to prevent their promulgation , and to punish those who had had the hardihood to avow them . By the suspension of the habeas corpus act , hundreds were imprisoned without knowing for what . Some of these were brought to trial accused of high treason , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted , and transported to inhospitable climes , for a long series of years , and from , whence , with only one exception , * none of them ever returned to their native land . Paine , not Imping been suspected at this time by the English ministry as having been any ray active in exciting the public mind , escaped unnoticed . But when the writings of the apostate Burke , f who was hired for the purpose of assailing the principles of the French Revolution , induced Paine to give to the world the ' * Rights of M:in , " he then became particularly obnoxious to the government , who immediately marked him out for destruction . Before , however , the schemes for his ruin could be completed , he was elected a member of the National Assembly of France , by several electorates ; and having made choice of Calais , a deputation of his constituents waited upon him in England , to escort him to Paris , where he was received with that attention which must ever prove gratifying to a noble-minded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talents of Paine were remarkably conspicuous in repelling every attack on the new Constitution ; arid when the unfortunate Louis was on his trial at the bar of that House , he evinced his great humanity by voting in opposition to the sentence which sent that monarch to the scaffold . For this intrepid act Robespierre never forgave Paine . During the reign of terror , this sanguinary despot caused him to be imprisoned ; but he fortunately escaped the decapitation which this scourge of the human race intended to inflict . Hitherto the attention of Paine had been chiefly directed to a revolution in politics ; and although it must have gratified him much to witness the beneficial effect of his writings in Europe , as well as in America , his penetrating genius could not fail to discover that no nation could be considered frtt while the mind was twimelled with opinions subversive of the first principles of liberty . He had , doubtless , taught mankind that they were best qualified to govern by representatives chosen from among themselves , without the aid of kings or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact , that besides kings and nobles , there existed another power in * Maurice Margarott. t Vide Appendix No . I. alliance with these a power continually opposed to the civil power consisting of a body of priests , who , in virtue of their pretended divine mission and sacred office , arrogated the right of giving laws to the universe . Puffed up with the titles they had given themselves , he saw these men every where laboring to exact obedience , and claiming dangerous prerogatives , which none were suffered to question without incurring the displeasure of the Almighty . And so well had the priesthood managed this matter , that , in many countries , the people were to be seen inclined more to the authority of the church than to that ofth*e government . Indebted to the priesthood for what they styled the " right divine " to govern , the rulers of the earth were , on their part , necessarily compelled to concede to this order an undue influence , and to confer on its members dignity , titles , and revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to dispose of their crowns at pleasure . Thus invested , the people were subjected to the will of the priesthood , whose principal aim was to deprive the mind of its vigor , by instilling into it a senseless superstition . Vice thus became encouraged ; and largesses to the church supplied the place of morals , and atoned for the most atrocious crimes . Such , indeed , was the ascendancy that the priesthood had acquired , and still hold in many countries , that they hesitated at no crimes , however enormous , or however much they violated the principles of humanity . The bonds of justice were too weak to restrain their vicious propensities ; and when they found it necessary , which they frequently did , to raise the cry , " the church is in danger our religion is assailed the cause of heaven must be defended " men became irrational beings ; they imbibed the ferocity of the tiger , and , like beasts of prey , thirsted for the blood of their fellow men , whom the artful priest had marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many instances of the atrocities of this order of men , that volumes mighl be written on the subject . Can it be a matter of surprise , then , that Paine , with this history lying before him , stained with so many crimes of the priesthood , and having himself witnessed , on many occasions , the pernicious effect of their influence and example can it , I say , surprise any one who reflects for a moment , that he whose whole mind was fully bent , at all hazards , on ameliorating the condition of man , should employ his great talents in exposing this monstrous evil ? The surprise would rather have been , that he should have refrained from endeavoring to prostrate a power fraught with so much danger to human happiness ; because he must have foreseen , and his writings show he did foresee it , that so long as the human mind is entirely submitted to the control of an interested priesthood , who say and do as they please , so long will mankind remain in a state of abject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically free while mentally enslaved ? Of what use is it to be acquainted with the " rights of man , " if our " reason " is not at perfect liberty to make a proper application of these rights ? Viewing matters , therefore , in this light the light in which Paine evidently contemplated them , convinced that the man who sways the mind of another , has as great a power over his actions as if he actually held him in fetters , he engaged in the task of mental emancipation with the same ardor , and pursued it with the same steady perseverance , that had marked his former career . As when assailing political corruption he felt unawed by the sacred character with which they had invested royalty , so when he commenced the " Age of Reason , " he was regardless of the trickery of the priesthood , who have fenced their dogmas round with " holiness , " and , for the purpose of preventing the too inquisitive from prying into their mysteries , and exposing their frauds , have inculcated the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " reverential awe , " and humble prostration of intellect . Disdaining a doctrine so infamous a doctrine by which kings as well as priests have too long contrived to perpetuate their despotic sway , Paine entered on the investigation of " theology " with a mind entirely free from prejudice , and with a determination to exercise the noble faculty of Reason , which the priests had so much decried , but without which even they , with all their boasted learning , would be worse than the brute species . However much this band of conspirators against the exaltation of human nature declaimed against free , unrestrained discussion , Paine was not to be intimidated . Where Truth was the object contemplated , it appeared to him the greatest absurdity to suppose that any one could go too far in their investigations ; and ridiculous to expect that the enemies of Truth could be silenced by soft and honied words . Nor could he conceive how the eyes of others could be opened to imposture , by drawing a veil over its deeds . To rid the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fearlessly , and depicting it in its true colors ; for if it was not represented as it really was ; if mankind were not put on their guard in a language which all could understand , against those who traffic in deception , how could the cause of mental emancipation be pro moted ; how the reign of error and of priestcraft be terminated ? To justify the encroachments the priests had made on public liberty , they pretended that they were " Ambassadors from heaven . " " Where , then , " asked Paine , " are your credentials 1 If , as you say , you are * sent from God , 5 show us these credentials . By these and these only can we judge of the reality of your mission . " They point to the Bible , which they dignify by the name of the " Word of God ; " and Paine , taking his stand at once on this pretended revelation of the divine will , enters without hesitation on the investigation . The result of this inquiry is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that work we find the most incontrovertible reasons for rejecting the assertions of the priesthood , that it was written by the inspiration of God . Even the existence of Moses , who is said to have been the author of the first five books , is shown to be problematical ; and that the account of the Jews who are represent- ed in these writings aa having been a great nation , as having had a Jong genealogy of kings , a city built on the most improved style of architecture , and a temple in which to worship their god , far surpassing any thing belonging to Grecian or Roman mythology could be nothing but fictions , as the Jews , as a nation , were never heard of till long after the Babylonish captivity , and were even then regarded as a horde of wild Arabs as the " most barbarous of all the barbarians . " This , at once rendered the authenticity of these books more than questionable , and struck an effectual blow at the credentials of the priesthood . But this is not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reason , " that the person or persons who wrote the Bible were entirely ignorant of the most obvious principles of natural philosophy , which could not be the case if divine wisdom had any thing to do in the formation of these writings . Even of the being who is said to have inspired this book , the most ridiculous and disgusting narratives are shown to disgrace its pages . He is there represented as altogether made up of human qualities having eyes to see* hands and arms to deal vengeance on his foesf ears to hearj a mouth to speak feet to walk , and a head covered with hair.ft In one part of these books , he is represented as a savage bear. ** In another as a voracious leopard. ft Sometimes he is made to appear in the chaacter of a warrior . J At other times like a drunkard in a state of beastly intoxication . He is also represented ( as Paine has shown ) in the pages of this inspired volume , as a cruel , vindictive , revengeful , imbecile , changeable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with propriety towards his subjects ; who amused himself by laying snares to entrap them ; and who imposed trials on them , and laid temptations before them , that he might have thepleasure of inflicting punishment for yielding to these trials and to these temptations . " Whenever ( to use the emphatic words of Paine himself ) we read the obscene stories , the voluptuous debaucheries , the cruel , torturous executions , and the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled , it would be more consistent that it be called the word of a demon than the word of God . It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind . Did this book excel in purity of ideas and expression all the books that are now extant in the world , I would not take it for my rule of faith as being the " word of God , " because the possibility would nevertheless exist of my being imposed upon . But when I see , throughout the greatest part of this book , scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a collection of the most paltry and contemptible tales , I can not dishonor my creator by calling it by his name . " * Prov. xv . 3. t Jer. xxi. 5 . J Paa. xxxiv. 15 . Isa . Iv . 11 , Ezek. xliii. 7 . IT Dan . vii . 9. ** Lam. iii . 10 ft Hosea xiiu 7 . U Exod. xv . 3 . M Psa . Ixxviii. 65. /z/ Such is'the character given by Paine , after a careful examination , of writings which have so long been regarded sacred by the multitude , and on which the priesthood have established an empire more powerful , and more degrading to the human mind , than the most despotic empire of the East . In discussing the merits of the New Testament books , Paine expresses himself in the same undaunted and candid manner . " I have now ( lie says ) gone through the examination of the four books of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John ; and when it is considered that the whole space of time from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days , and that all the circumstances are said to have happened nearly about the same spot , Jerusalem ; it is , I believe , impossible to find in any story upon record so many and such glaring absurdities , contradictions , and falsehoods , as are in these books . " If the nature of this address did not preclude a labored criticism on Paine 's writings , how easily could it be shown , by citations from these writings , that the whole fabric of Christianity was reared on a baseless foundation . We are told that the reputed founder of that system , whose existence is more than questionable , was the eternal and immutable God . Paine hesitated to acknowledge a position so startling . He could not entertain the idea that the God of Nature could appear on the earth in the form of man ; that , as the New Testament represents , he should be born of a woman the son of a carpenter delivered in a stable nursed in a manger hang as an infant on the breast of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to lay his head scourged tried and condemned to death for disturbing the public tranquillity expiring on a cross , and entombed in a sepulchre . No , no Paine , as a rational man , did not believe , and no other rational man who will allow himself to reflect on the subject , could not for a moment believe that the God of Nature was subjected to such indignities . Common sense revolts at the belief of such absurd and ridiculous nonsense . Yet it was for exposing these absurdities for daring to avow his disbelief of these idle tales that Paine was accused of blasphemy ; his memory , even to this day , held in abhorrence by the unreflecting , and almost every crime attributed to him of which man is supposed capable of being guilty . It is no less true than it is deplorable , that the person who has the hardihood to break through the trammels of mental error who has the courage to proclaim the falsehood of delusive and petrifying systems who has the honesty , like the immortal Paine , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nil the rancorous and inhuman treatment that can be inflicted by a bewildered , maddened , and fanatical multitude . Such was the case on the appearance of the " Age of Reason . " The efforts of the priests to counteract the influence of the truths which it proclaimed were so successful , that their stupid votaries became insane . They imagined that it would be pleasing to deity to exterminate every one /z/ whose ideas did not correspond with their own blind and stupid fancies . They , therefore , regarded Paine as a monster , whose destruction would be the most acceptable service they could perform to secure the approbation of their idol . It might have been expected , if the " Age of Reason " was that disgraceful production which the priesthood are in the practice of representing it , that of the seventy thousand of that order in Great Britain alone , some hundreds at least would have been found capable of refuting the bold assertions of its author , and which militated so powerfully against the stability of the system by which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Bishop Watson ) ventured to enter the lists with Paine ; but as his sole object was prefermtntf it is easy to perceive from his writings that even the bishop , with all his learning , despaired of controverting the facts and lucid arguments of so powerful an antagonist . The rest of the testy herd of reverends , right reverends , and fathers in god , thought it the best policy to shrink from the contest , and to endeavor , in their pulpit harangues , to divert the/ attention of their credulous followers from the merits of the case , by insinuations prejudicial to the character of Paine , or by affixing a stigma on his opinions , which they knew would render them unpopular with an ignorant and superstitious multitude . Unable to meet him in the fair field of argument , they resorted to abuse . Reason was too powerful for them , and therefore they decried Reason . The only means of defence to which they resorted was foul language . Paine was denounced an Atheist and a blasphemer , and his writings pronounced " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of morality . When the enemies of Paine substitute abuse for argument , they do not seem to be aware that this is tantamount to an acknowledgment of the correctness of his principles , and of their awn inability to combat his incontrovertible reasoning . When they call him an Atheist , they evince their total ignorance of what he has written ; for it is impossible to peruse the " Age of Reason , " without discovering that its author believed in the being of a God , and consoled himself with the hope of enjoying the reward of a virtuous life in a future state of existence . As to the charge of blasphemy , the word has no meaning when applied to religion . It is a word , doubtless , that operates most powerfully on the generality of minds . But all that can be said of it is , a speaking evil of a system of words . To vilify or blaspheme the character of our neighbor , would be injurious , because it would bring him into discredit among his equals . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes , injure the character of deity , who is acknowledged to have no equal ? If one man speaks evil of another man 's religion , he does no more than question the truth or correctness of certain opinions ; and if he convinces him that he is in error , he performs a moral act , for which he ought to be applauded . Paine ha been charged with " unsettling the faith of thotiiandi " /z/ by his writings . But he could not have done this , if the faith which he unsettled had been well founded . So far , therefore , from being justly stigmatized for giving his opinions to the world on the subject of religion , those who defame him on that account not only do injustice to his character and motives , but virtually pass a censure on themselves whenever they advance opinions the correctness of which may be disputed by other ? . No small portion of abuse has been heaped on the memory of Paine , on account of the alleged scurrility of his writings . " He should , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he has shown for the prejudices " of others . He should not have been so sarcastic . He should have shown more deference for " holy things " than to have " held them up to ridicule . " Now if Paine had believed in the contents of the " Holy Bible , " as it is called , he never would have attempted to impeach its character , or have pronounced it an imposition . If he had even entertained an idea that any one could prove it to be true , he would have been extremely cautious as to his mode of treating it . But when he found in that book a mere system of notions , without proofs or realities , he saw no reason for regarding it in a more favorable light than he would have done any other book which might have been the subject of free discussion . If he had not found tilings in themselves ridiculous pervading the greater part of the Bible , he would not have employed ridicule to render it contemptible . Indeed , unless there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the satire in the world would have been vainly directed against it . Criticism , even although severe , gives a lustre to truth ; it belongs to error alone to dread its influence . If Paine had flattr.rtd , instead of ridiculed the prejudices of others , it micht. perhaps , have been better for him . He might have escaped the many persecutions which he suffered while alive , and those who admire his character and principles would not now have found it necessary to rebut the numerous falsehoods which have been circulated respecting him by a fanatical and relentless foe . But did Paine flatter the political prejudices of the enemies of liberty in his " Rights of Man ? " No . Why then should he have flattered their religious prejudices in his " Age of Reason ? " Was it more his duty as a philanthropist to flatter than to remove these prejudices ? And if the mass of mankind were so wedded to antiquated system ? , founded on a volume of ridiculous and puerile narratives diametrically opposed to each other , and subversive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect nothing else than to have their favorite dogmas exhibited in their true colors . The doctrine , that " it is best to chime in with public prejudices that this is the safest course to follow the most generally respected that it would be dangerous to alter it , and , therefore , it ought not to be abused , " received no countenance from Paine . It is a doctrine which he was well aware might suit the taste of tyrants and slavish formalists , but it could never meet the approbation of impartial reason , nor accord with the interests of society . If a /z/ principle like this were to be sanctioned , there would be an end to all improvement . Every invention or discovery for the benefit of mankind would be discouraged ; and the intellectual faculty , the most glorious ornament with which Nature has endowed man , would be of little use , if priests and despots were to accomplish their desire in thus attempting to cramp its exertions . It has been offered as an apology for the style of writing adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own language , and possessing but a smattering of French . This apology I consider altogether inadmissible . The sole object of Paine was to convey instruction to the mind . He was a child of Nature , and his language Nature 's Eloquence . He considered knowledge as " consisiing no longer in a given quantity of words , but in making words the real signs of the real qualities of real bodies , and in using no one word that was not a sign of a real body , or its quality . ' * lie disdained , therefore , all artificial embellishments all those tropes and figures so much resorted to by what are called " fine writers , " but which , o far from conveying any useful knowledge , seldom fail to darken the understanding . It is ridiculous to suppose that a knowledge of Latin , Greek , Hebrew , and the other oriental languages which are thought necessary to " form the scholar and accomplished gentleman , " ever made a wise man . To the statesman who has to conduct the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this course of study might be useful and even desirable . But I have almost uniformly found the man whose head is filled " with classic lore , " very deficient in the true meaning and application of his native language , and , in general , very ignorant of the principles of philosophy . " True glory ( says Pliny ) consists in having done something worth the writing having written something worth the reading , and having made the world better and'happier for having lived in it . " This was the only glory which Paine was ambitious of attaining ; and however much his enemies may exert themselves to rob him of his well earned fame , his writings will remain an imperishable monument of his talents and virtues so long as the race of man endures . Had Paine 's writings been of that " immoral " tendency which has been alleged , his enemies would , long ere this , have pointed out the passages which they pretend warrant this charge . But they have not done so , and that for the best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , the whole of his writings , hitherto published , inculcate the most correct and benevolent principles . Even his political writings , besides conveying important instruction , are full of moral sentences , which may he read with pleasure by every votary of truth and justice . It is only such as have never perused his works , and who form an opinion of them merely from the denunciations of the priesthood , who declaim against them . I appeal to those who have read them with attention , particulary the " Age of Reason , " if the principles ther /z/ inculcated are not every way calculated to improve the condition of man . No one can say that any thing is to be found in the pages of the latter work unfit for the perusal of females or of children . There you have no obscene tales to pollute the ears , or raise a blush on the cheek of innocence . Can this be said of the Bible , so much vaunted of for its moral precepts , and which is alleged to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great object of Paine to teach only what was useful . Benevolence breathes through the whole of his writings , and the importance and utility of those virtues , the practice of which he so forcibly recommended , he strikingly illustrated by the actions of his life . I have already alluded to his humane efforts in endeavoring to save the life of the king of France . However much he detested royalty , * ' his benevolent heart ( as has been justly remarked could feel for , and plead the cause of suffering humanity even in the person of a king . Cruelty and revenge were passions too base and ignoble to reside in his expansive bosom . He delighted in seeing all men happy ; and he considered no sacrifice too great which tended to promote the general good . " But this is not the only instance recorded of the humanity and generous feelings displayed by Paine at the period alluded to . While a member of the National Assembly of France , he received a blow from an 1n temper ate Knglishman ; an offence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed for the special protection of the persons of the Deputies . But instead of giving up the violator of this law to be punished , Paine assisted him to escape from Paris , and actually gave him money to convey him to England , which the fugitive reached in safety . All who have had the pleasure of being intimately acquainted with Paine confirm , by their united testimony , the truth which these facts so clearly establish , that he was a man of the most benevolent feelings , and that his whole energies were devoted to the amelioration of the condition of the human race . If time would premit , many of thfse testimonies might now be cited . But as this is not the case , I shall merely occupy your attention with a short extract of a letter from the much and deservedly lamented Lord Edward Fitzgerald , who fell a victim to British tyranny. * He was at Paris in 1 792 , and in writing to his mother , he says , " I lodge with my friend Paine . We breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his interior , the more I like and respect him . I can not express how kind he is to me there is a simplicity of manner , a goodness of heart , and a strength of mind in him , that I never knew any man before possess . " Who is there among the pious calumniators of this great man that would not be proud to merit so high an encomium ? Who among them that would not prize above all things the amiable disposition which could spontaneously elicit from a person of such superior * Vide Appendix No. . u rank an tlilogy so well deserved by the object for which it trai intended 1 ? Yet have these wholesale slanderers never ceased since the amiable Paine was consigned to the silent tomb , to fabricate , and put in circulation , the most barefaced and malignant falsehoods respecting him ; and even after these falsehoods have been again and again refuted , they persist in reiterating them in their pious journals , the contents of which they well know are implicity credited by their deluded followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels because it ever has been the policy of the conductors of these vehicles of slander , to exclude every thing from their pages which has a tendency to do justice to the reputation of Paine. * Instances could even be mentioned where the editors of papers , professing to advocate liberal principles , have studiously avoided mentioning even the name of Paine ; while they have extolled that of Washington , of Jefferson , and of Franklin , as the prominent leaders in that revolution , which their great co-patriot had done so much by his pen to consolidate . Far be it from me to withhold one atom of praise from the individuals hose names I have just mentioned . They will ever be honored for the services they performed by a grateful and admiring country . But if the exertions of Paine , at that eventful period which " tried men 's souls , " are fairly appreciated , I arn persuaded it will be acknowledged that although there may have been minds in activity as great as his , yet none of them were so " wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his contemporaries ; for who among them would have had the daring , like him , to unveil the frauds and deceptions practised by the ministers of a mysterious theology who assail , as did Paine , this " bulwark of religion , founded on the rock of nges , " and which claimed to be under the immediate protection of a terrible and an avenging deity ? Even Franklin , after having nearly disarmed the thunder of its terrors , shrunk with dismay at the apprehension of being assailed by the malignant shafts of superstition , on account of the doubts he entertained as to the divinity of Jesus . Although it is scarcely to4e questioned that Washington was a liberal , it is in vain to deny the fact , that he cautiously concealed his principles , and , in some respects , acted a double part , lest he should render himself obnoxious to the priesthood . If Jefferson had published his sentiments on theology , as Paine did , is it not probable lie would have been excluded from the presidental chair , and denounced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After what has been said , can it for a moment be doubted , that the treatment which Paine has met with , and the odium which has been attached to his name , has been occasioned solely by the influence of the priesthood ? In Great Britain , such was the animosity which these men entertained towards him , that if he had not been beyond the reach of their jurisdiction , they never would have been /z/ satisfied until they had glutted their demonaical feelings with th blood of their victim . Although the soil of the United States has , in a great measure , escaped the pollution consequent on the sanguinary inflictions of these spiritual tyrants , there have heen periods , even in this free country , when the persons of our citizens were not always safe from the effects of a blind and furious fanaticism when men , pretending to be influenced by maxims of kindness and peace , evinced themselves to be inexorable persecutors. * It can not but be gratifying to every liberal mind , that the principles advocated by Paine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's minds , and in staying the iron hand of persecution , are every day making fresh inroads on the strong holds of ignorance and superstition . Notwithstanding all the efforts of the priesthood , who , it must be acknowledged , are untiring in their endeavors to plunge the human mind into a state of darkness the light which the writings of Paine has shed over a bewildered world , affords a rational and well founded expectation , that tyranny , whatever shape it may assume , is doomed to be swept from the face of the earth . To adopt the emphatic language of Ensor , " Philosophy , that much injured name , to which all that is kind , comprehensive , and wise , is to be attributed which assuages the passions of the soul like oil poured on the stormy ocean ; philosophy , the medicine of the unfortunate , the glory and ornament of the happy that pure principle which performs good , not from fear of punishment , nor hopes of reward , but from spontaneous love ; philosophy , which pronounces the labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and causes inveterate foes sacredly to respect the ships and missionaries of science ; philosophy , which , overleaping the boundaries of nations , surveys all mankind as one common family which has done so much , and still pursues intrepidly its illustrious enterprize error and interest , and malice and ambition may impede , but shall never stay its course . The opposing wind frets the surface of the coming tide ; but , if moved from its foundations by a more powerful influence , it rolls securely forward to the shores of its destination . " f /z/ All the misrepresentations all the falsehoods that have been , and are at this moment in circulation respecting the causes of the anarchy and bloodshed that prevailed during the French revolution , are to be traced to Edmund Burke an apostate from liberty- the hired tool of an unprincipled government , whose only hopes of success depended on corruption and bribery . Of this man this advocate of religion this vilifier of the French revolution history records the following facts : During our revolutionary war , he was introduced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the then leader of which , Earl Fitzwilliam , not only patronized , but supplied Burke with the means of subsistence . At first , he violently opposed the government ; applauded the resistance offered by this country to the tyranny of England ; and openly exulted in our success . When Thomas Paine left America for England , he no sooner landed there , than Burke solicited his acquaintance , and became his intimate friend . Sir Richard Phillips , well known as the editor of the London Monthly Magazine , is in possession of a letter of Burke 's , in which he expressed the highest gratification at having , the day previous , been " introduced to , and sat down to dinner with the celebrated Thomas Paine , the author of Common Sense . " In the writings of Mr. Paine it is stated , and never has been denied , that his intimacy with Burke continued as long as he remained in England . When the French revolution broke out , Burke espoused the republican cause with the same ardor that he had advocated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , to assist in the councils of the revolutionists , he was solicited by this same Burke to furnish him with authentic and early intelligence of what was passing , or about to pass , in France assigning as a reason for this solicitation , his attachment to the cause of liberty , and his determination , as a public man , to become the apologist of the revolutionists , even in the British parliament . Mr. Paine , relying on the sincerity of his professions , furnished Burke for several months with the information he required . Nor did the former even doubt the fidelity of the latter , until Burke commenced writing against France , and was actually in the pay of Pitt , the British Prime Minister . Such , in a few words , is the character of Edmund Burke , on whose statements the priesthood rely , when they ascribe the disgraceful occurrences of the French revolution to the influence of liberal principles . /z/ Lord Edward Fitzgerald , a man pecaliarly dear to Irishmen , was the fifth son of the Duke of Leinster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in 1763 , and at the age of 17 he entered the army . After serving as a Lieutenant in the British army under Lord Rawdon , in the beginning of our revolution , and for some time in the West Indies , in the staff of General O'Hara , Lord Edward returned to Ireland , where he was chosen a member of the parliament of that country . He afterwards made the tour of Spain , and with his regiment proceeded to Nova Scotia , where he had for some time the chief command . On his return to England , he was offered the command of an expedition to Cadiz ; but he declined on hearing that it was expected he should no longer vote with the opposition in parliament . Attracted by the great political drama then acting in France , he proceeded to Paris in 1792 ; from whence he returned to his native land , completely imbued with republicanism . He was one of the very small majority that Irish patriotism at that time afforded ; and having , in voting against a congratulatory address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he incurred the displeasure of the government ; but this , so far from discouraging , led him , as a sense of duty , into the ranks of the United Irishmen , of which he became the military head . In this character he went to France , where he arranged the invasion of Ireland with General Hoche . On the failure of that expedition , treason crept into the ranks of the United Irishmen , which led to the apprehension of some of the leaders ; Lord Edward only escaping at that time from having concealed himself in the houses of his friends . He was traced at last , and when found was reclining in his bed . lie started up , and inflicted a fatal wound with a pistol on one of his assailants , and another he wounded . with a dagger . He was then shot , and secured . But his death in prison , from the wounds he had received , disappointed the wishes of his enemies , who expected to see him expire on the scaffold , as a murderer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in prison , although his brother was allowed that indulgence when this great patriot was on the eve of expiring . Lord Edward Fitzgerald , the intimate friend of Paine , died as he had lived the same kind and affectionate being . His death was lamented long and deeply by his relations , and his memory will ever be revered by the friend 's of freedom in every country . /z/ Of all the calumnies promulgated against Mr. Paine , that of his having been a " confirmed drunkard , " is still most tenaciously adhered to , although the fact of his having , when upwards of 70 /z/ years of age , written , " The third part of the Age of Reason ; " his ' * Examination of the Prophecies ; " and , almost every week , contributed largely to newspapers and other periodicals , is sufficient to convince any unprejudiced mind of the utter falsehood of the accusation . But as there are some men who are either too malignant ever to do justice to a man whom they have once abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who " sotted , " must be incapable of conveying by his pen correct ideas to others , we publish the following documents for their special information . If , however , they still feel a gratification in persuading themselves , in despite of these documents , that Mr. Paine was other than he is there represented , it is to be hoped they will have the prudence in future to refrain from obtruding their obnoxious and gratuitous assertions on the notice of the public . The first document to which we refer , is a letter of James Cheetharn , the author of the infamous string of libels , published by him as " the Life of Thomas Paine ; " which Cheetharn addressed to Joel Barlow , at one time Ambassador from this country to France : /z/ u SIR Not having the honor of a personal acquaintance with you , the trouble this note will occasion , will require some apology , and the only one I can offer regards the subject of it , arid the readiness with which your character persuades me you will furnish me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . " I am preparing to write the life of Thomas Paine , author of Common Sense , &c.; As you were acquainted with him in Paris , and he mentioned you in his * Age of Reason , 1 your opinion of his manners and habits , the company he kept , &c.; would be very acceptable . " He was a great drunkard hero , and Mr. M***** , a merchant of this city , who lived with him when he was arrested by order of Robespierre , tells me he was intoxicated when that event happened . " Did Paine ever take an oath of allegiance to France In his letter to the French people in 1792 , he thanks them for electing him a member of the convention , and for the additional honor of making him a French citizen . In his speech on the trial of the king , he speaks , he says , as a citizen of France . There is some difference between being a member of a convention to make a constitution , and a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . I should imagine that in the latter capacities , an oath of allegiance would be necessary . " Any other information you would be pleased to communicate , which in your judgment would be useful in illustrating his character , will be gratefully received , and used as you may direct . " I am , &c.; JAMES CHEETHAM , New For* , July 21 , 1809. " /z/ The following is the answer : /z/ " SiR I have received your letter , calling for information relative to the life of Thomas Paine . It appears to me , that this is not the moment to publish the life of that man in this country . His own writings are his best life , and these are not read at present . " The greatest part of the readers in the United States will not be persuaded , as long as their present feelings last , to consider him in any other light than as a drunkard and a deist . The writer of his Jife who should dwell on these topics , to the exclusion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed please the rabble of the age , who do not know him ; the book might sell ; but it would only tend to render the truth more obscure for the future biographer , than it was before . " But if the present writer should give us Thomas Paine complete in all his character , as one of the most benevolent and disinterested of mankind , endowed with the clearest perception , an uncommon share of original genius , and the greatest breadth of thought ; if this piece of biography should analyze his literary labors , and raik him , as he ought to be ranked , among the brightest and most undev iating luminaries of the age in which he has lived yet with a mind assailable by flattery , and receiving through that weak side a tincture of vanity which he was too proud to conceal ; with a mind , though strong enough to bear him up , and to rise elastic under the heaviest hand of oppression , yet unable to endure the contempt of his former friends and fellow laborers , ihe rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services a mind incapable of looking down with serene compassion , as it ought , on the rude scoffs of their imitators , a new generation that knows him not ; a mind that shrinks from their society , and unhappily seeks refuge in low company , or looks for consolation in the sordid , solitary bottle ; till it sinks at last so far below its native elevation , as to lose all respect for itself , and to forfeit that of his best friends , disposing these friends almost to join with his enemies , and wish , though from different motives , that he would hasten to hide himself in the grave if you are disposed and prepared to write his life entire , to fill up the picture to which these hasty strokes of outline give but a rude sketch with great vacuities , your book may be a useful one for another age , but it will not be relished , nor scarcely tolerated in this . " The biographer of Thomas Paine should not forget his mathematical acquirements , and his mechanical genius . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe in the year 1787 , has procured him a great reputation in that branch of science in France and England , in both which countries his bridge has been adopted in many instances , and is now much in use . " You ask whether he took an oath of allegiance to France . Doubtless the qualification to be a member of the convention , required an oath of fidelity to that country , but involved in it no /z/ abjuration of his fidelity to this . He was made a French Citizen by the same decree with Washington , Hamilton , Priestly , and sir James Mackintosh . " What Mr. M***** has told you relative to the circumstances of his arrestatiorj hy order of Robespierre , is erroneous , nt least in one point . Paine did not lodge at the house where he was arrested , hut had been dining there with some Americans , of whom Mr. M***** may have been one . I never heard before that Paine was intoxicated that night . Indeed , the officers brought him directly to my house , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much from tho place where he had been dining . He was not intoxicated when they came to me . Their object was to get me to go and assist them to examine Paine 's papers . It employed us the rest of that night , and the whole of the next day , at Paine 's lodgings ; and he was not committed to prison till the next evening . " You ask.what company he kept he always frequented the best , Loth in England and France , till he became the object of calumny in certain American papers , ( echoes of the English court papers ) for his adherence to what he thought the cause of liberty in France till he conceived himself neglected and despised by his former friends in the United States . JFrom that moment he gave himself very much to drink , and consequently to companions less worthy of his better days. * ** It is said he was always a peevish inmate this is possible . So was Laurence Sterne , so was Torqunto Tasso , so was J. J. Rousseau but Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary friend , the only points of view in which I knew him , was one of the most instructive men I have ever known . He had a surprising memory and brilliant fancy ; his mind was a storehouse of facts arid useful observations ; he was full of lively anecdote , and ingenious original pertinent remark , upon almost every subject . " He was always charitable to the poor beyond his means , a sure protector and friend to all Americans in distress that he found in foreign countries ; and he had frequent occasions to exert his influence in protecting them during the revolution in France . His writings will answer for his patriotism , and his entire devotion to what he conceived to be the best interests and happiness of mankind . ** This , sir , is all I have to remark on the subject you mention now I have only one request to make , and that would doubtless seem impertinent , were you not the editor of a newspaper ; it is , that you will not publish my letter , nor permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , &c.; JOEL BARLOW . " Kalorama , August n , 1809. " * It is probable that even Mr. Barlow had been led , by the slanders of Paine 's enemies , to believe him more addicted to drinking than he really was ; for the expression " gave himself very much to drink " is not reconcilable with the indisputable testimony which follows . /z/ The other document to which we have alluded , is extracted from the Correspondent , Vol . I. p. 60 . It was printed from the original MS. , in the hand writing of Mr. Morton . * ' A short narrative of the later period of the life of THOMAS PAINE , written by Walter Morton , Esq . of New York , one of his executors . " On Mr. Value 's return to New York , in 1802 , a public dinner was given him at the City Hotel . I being one of the committee of arrangements , who prepared toasts for the occasion , it led me to an acquaintance with that justly celebrated man , which continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited Mr. Paine several times at his farm at New Rochelle , twenty-one miles from New York , where he resided in pare of 1804 and 1805 ; after he returned to reside in the city , 1 was in the constant habit of spending tvo or three evenings with him every week ; these visits were generally from seven to eight o'clock in the evening , and 1 usually remained with him till about ten , at which hour he went to bed . We generally drank two small tumblers of rum and water , each containing less than half a gill of rum , reduced to what is commonly called glass proof . We rarely exceeded this ; and sometimes for weeks , and even months , almost in succession , I saw him in bed before my departure , and put out his candle . While in health , he generally rose about seven o'clock in the morning ; he always took a nap for about two hours after dinner . And while at the farm , I ascertained from those who lived in the house , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the weekly allowance was limited to a quart , whatever visiters might be called to partake . " In the 73d year of his age , and but a few months before his death , * his mental faculties continued strong , firm and vigorous , arid his memory so retentive as to repeat verbatim whole sentences either in prose or verse , of any thing which had previously struck his mind : this he always did with great ease and grace . About six ; months before his death , his limbs became so feeble that he could scarcely move through the room : he told me , when alone , that he felt the decay of nature fast increasing , that he might possibly live six or even twelve months , but it could not exceed much beyond that time ; and feared nothing but being reduced to a bedridden state , so as to lie incapable of helping himself . " In his religious opinions he continued to the last as steadfast and tenacious as any sectarian to the definition of his own creed . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisitive visiters who came to try him on that point , his general answer was to this effect : * My opinions are before the world , and all have had an opportunity to refute them if they can ; I believe them unanswerable truths , and that I have done great service to mankind by boldly putting them forth ; I do not wish to argue upon the subject ; I have labored disinterestedly in the cause of truth . ' I shook his hand after the use of speech was gone , but while the other organs told me /z/ sufficiently that he knew me and appreciated my affection , his eyes glistened with genius under the pangs of death . " /z/ I , David I. Burger , of the city of New York , being fully satisfied of the nefarious attempts to injure the cause and spread of free enquiry , by the base practice of vilifying and traducing the characters of its leaders : and being particularly aware of the gross slanders everywhere propagated in relation to the moral character of Thomas Paine , author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I became personally acquainted with said Paine in the year 1803 , who was then residing at New Rochelle , about 20 miles from New York ; that I was then in the employ of Capt .

Pelton by rne , according to the best of my recollection , I am confident it could not have exceeded one quart per week . In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-one . Signed in the presence of D 1V1D I. BURGER . GARDNER JONES , f /z/ The following passage formed part of the " Oration , " as originally written : " Thanks to the framers of the general constitution ; but , in a more especial manner , thanks to the influence of the writings of Paine sufficient protection is now guaranteed to all , not only in the enjoyment , but in the open expression of opinions , whether they relate to religion or politics . It is in virtue of that guarantee that we now assemble in this place , to utter and to hear sentiments delivered , which if attempted to be uttered little more than half a century ago , would have consigned the daring individual to a dungeon , or , probably , to the gallows . " An opinion having been expressed by some of the Committee of Arrangements , that the general constitution did not afford the " guarantee " above stated , the passage was omitted in the delivery ; and is only here quoted that something further may be elicited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights , " which led to the framing of the general constitution , ( Art . 12 , ) it is stated , that " the people have a right to freedom of speech , and of writing and publishing their sentiments ; therefore the freedom of the press ought not to be restrained . " In the " Amendments to the General Constitution , " ( Art . 1 , ) it /z/ is enacted , that " Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press . " The writer of this is of opinion that those two articles are sufficient to support the affirmative , of the question . And he is confirmed in this opinion , when he finds that Jefierson , who drew upthe " Declaration of Rights , " entertained the same enlarged view of the subject . " The legitimate powers of government , " says Jefferson , " reach actions only , and not opinions . I contemplate with sovereign reverence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legislature should ' make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof : ' thus building a wall of separation between church and state . " But I am further borne out in the opinion for which I am contending , by the unanimous concurrence which the Senate of the United States gave to the invaluable " Report " of Colonel Johnson on the transportation of the Mail on Sunday , and which has been correctly designated a clear exposition of , or commentary on , the " Declaration of Rights , " in as far as regards the rights of conscience . In that " Report " it is stated " Our government is a civil ) and not a religious institution . Our constitution recognises in every person the right to choose his own religion , and to enjoy it freely i without molestation Among all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of modern history is stained , no victim ever suffered but for the violation of what government denominated the laws of God .

Recitation What is Love ? by Mr , Morton. /z/ ' T is that delightsome transport we can feel Which painters can not paint , nor words reveal , Nor any art we know of , can conceal . Can'stthou describe the sunbeams to the blind ? Or make him feel a shadow with his mind ? So neither can we by description show This first of all felicities below ; When happy love pours magic o'er the soul , And all our thoughts in sweet delirium roll , When contemplation spreads her rainbow wings , And every flutter some new rapture brings , How sweetly then our moments glide away , And dreams renew the transports of the day . We live in extacy to all things kind , For love can teach a moral to the mind . /z/ 6ut are there not some other things that prore What is the wonder of the soul called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different kind , The dreadful horrors of a tortured mind , Some jealous fiend throws his poisoned dart , And rends in pieces the distracted heart . When love 's a tyrant , and the soul a slave , No hope remains for thought , but in the grave ; In that dark den , it sees an end to grief , And what was once its dread , becomes relief . What are the iron chains that hands have wrought ? The hardest chain to break is made of thought . Think well on this , ye lovers , and be kind , Nor play with torture on a tortured mind .
