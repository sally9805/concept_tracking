txt THE general intention of this work has been already stated . The author divides it into fifteen lectures , and the space of time it embraces , into four periods , of fifty years each . Of this arrangement as to time , he gives the following explanation I shall divide our history into four periods , of half a century each , for the sake of more easily managing my subject . These periods are , indeed , arbitrary , it may be said , and will not correspond with any remarkable events in politics or literature . This is very true ; but still the division may aid my labors . The skilful painter of a panorama divides his canvass into portions , before he takes up the pencil ; but these mechanical arrangements are not seen , when the whole canvass glows with life . A writer may profit by such an example . " LECTURE I. This lecture abounds in matter of great interest to the philologist and scholar . It treats of language in general , as affected by various causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the state of advancement in knowledge . A warm climate gives a softness and delicacy of tone and manner to the speech of the inhabitants . It is also a source of words expressive of softness , mildness , and enjoyment . Is knowledge far advanced ? language is copious and the reverse , of the English language , its origin and improvement-enriched from various sources-its copiousness and strength , its beauty , sweetness , and majesty-all which properties are illustrated by well selected examples ; the invention of the Cherokee alphabet . Of this fact in Indian history , which has attracted of late its full share of attention and commendation , and been made the subject of no little speculation , our author gives the following interesting account " In the winter of 1828 , a delegation of the Cherokees visited the city of Washington , in order to make a treaty with the United States , and among them was See-quah-yah , the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet . His English name was George Guess ; he was a half-blood ; but had never , from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the time of his invention , nor since . Prompted by my own curiosity , and urged by several literary friends , I applied to See-quah-yah , through the medium of two interpreters , one a half-blood , Captain Rogers , and the other a full-blood chief , whose assumed English name was John Man , to relate to me , as minutely as possible , the mental operations , and all the facts of his discovery . He cheerfully complied with my request , and gave very deliberate and satisfactory answers to every question ; and was all the time careful to know from the interpreters if I distinctly understood his answers . No stoic could have been more grave in his demeanor than was See-quah-yah ; he pondered , according to Indian custom , for a considerable time after each question was put , before he made his reply , and often took a whiff of his calumet , while reflecting for an answer . rhe details of the examination are too long for the closing paragraph of this lecture ; but the substance of it was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , but could not precisely say ; that in early life he was gay and talkative ; and although he never attempted to speak in council but once , yet he was often , from the strength of his memory , his easy colloquial powers , and ready command of his vernacular , story-teller of the convivial party . His reputation for talents of every kind gave him some distinction when he was quite young , so long ago as St. Clair 's defeat . In this campaign , or some one that soon followed it , a letter was found on the person of a prisoner , which was wrongly 59 * Lectures on American Literature , with remarks on some passages of American History , by Samuel L. Knapp . Sketches of Public Characters , drawn from the liviug aud the dead , with notices of other matters , by Ignatius Loyola Robertson , LL . D. a resident of the United States . // Literary and Intellectual Statistics . read by him to the Indians . In some of their deliberations on the subject , the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking lea was the gift of the Great Spirit to the white man , or a discovery of the white man himself ? Most of his companions were of the former opinion , while he as strenuously maintained the latter . This frequently became a subject of contemplation with him afterwards , as well as many other things which he knew , or had heard that the white man could do ; but he never sat down seriously to reflect on the subject , until a swelling on his knee confined him to his cabin , and which , at length , made him a cripple for life by shortening the diseased leg . Deprived of the excitements of war , and the pleasures of the chase , in the long nights of his confinement , his mind was again directed to the mystery of the power of speaking by letters  --  the very name of which , of course , was not to be found in his language . From the cries of wild beasts , from the talents of the mocking bird , from the voices of his children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were conveyed , by different sounds , from one intelligent being to another . The thought struck him to try to ascertain all the sounds in the Cherokee language . His own ear was not remarkably discriminating , and he called to his aid the more acute ears of his wife and children . He found great assistance from them . When he thought that he had distinguished all the different sounds in their language , he attempted to use pictorial signs , images of beasts or birds , to convey these sounds to others , or to mark them in his own mind . He soon dropped this method , as difficult or impossible , tried arbitrary signs , without any regard to appearances , except such as might assist him in recollecting them , and distinguishing them from each other . At first these signs were very numerous ; and when he got so far as to think that his invention was nearly accomplished , he had about two hundred characters in his alphabet . By the aid of his daughter , who seemed to enter into the genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to eighty-six , the number he now uses . He then set to work to make these characters more comely to the eye , and succeeded . " Here closed the invention of the alphabet of this Cadmus of the forest . His next step was to learn to read with it himself , and to teach others to do the same . In this he was also successful , to the astonishment and awe of the people of his nation , who began to consider him peculiarly favored by the Great Spirit  --  or aided , perhaps , by the spirit of evil . Such is the way in which the ignorant and superstitious , whether savage or civilized , Christian or Pagan , account for things they can not understand . When the wind suddenly changes or abates in violence , and obvious benefit to some portion of the human race is the issue , although another portion may be injured by it , or when a shower descends opportunely on the parched earth and withering herbage , instead of deriving the events from the laws that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interposition of a special Providence . The Deity has been kind or angry ; and , influenced by his passions , like any other mutable beiiig , has deviated from his eternal and inviolable l*poses , to do good or evil to the tiny mite of existence called man Thus does superstition , by perpetuating error , prepare sustenance for itself and maintain not only its existence , but its dominion over man . And thus is the ignorance of the many still employed by the designing few , in forging fetters for the human mind . Certaiii individuals , who do not appear to have studied the matter very profoundly , have seized on this invention of an alphabet , with a view to prove by it , that the intellect of the Indian is equal to that of the white man . But the attempt is unavailing . The testimony , as used , is fallacious , and proves no such thing . See-quah-yah is not a full Indian , but a " half-blood , " his father being a Scotchman . The invention , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be deemed an // innention at all . That term imports something strictly original . But here is nothing such . The whole is derivative . The first conception of See-quah-yah was the fruit of the " speaking lea ; " not of his own unaided reflection . Had he been a full-blood Indian , and had he formed his alphabet in the depth of the forest , without any intercourse with the white man , the facts would have been important in the solution of the question referred to . They would have constituted evidence highly flattering to the genius of the Indian . But as matters now stand , they furnish no evidence to that effect . They show what a half-blood can do , with assistance , not what a full-blood can do without it . Under similar circumstances , white men , of moderate abilities , would do as much . LECTURE II . This lecture treats of Greek , Roman , and Arabic literature-of the state of learning , when our ancestors first came to America-of the character of those virtuous and heroic emigrants-of Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most extraordinary men of their age , or of any age-of the pilgrims , and other matters connected with those times . LECTURE III . Here we find sketches of some of the pilgrims , showing them to be men of talent and learning-notices of the hooks they wrote , as samples of intellect and attainment , and of their peculiar mode of thinking . Harvard College founded . This alone testifies to the high and enterprising character of the colonists , and to their unconquerable devotion to letters . Situated as they were , surrounded by danger , oppressed by labor , and familiar with suffering of every description , they were , probably , the only people on earth , who , under circumstances so adverse and discouraging , would have thought of erecting a literary institution , to rival those of the mother country . The progress of the colonists , in other respects , is here referred to-the celebrated Roger Williams  --  the high and heroical character of the females of the time traced to the excellence of their education-general remarks on the early settlers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . LECTURE IV . In this lecture our author delineates the characters of the two Mathers , Increase , the father , and Cotton , his sons All things considered , these were wonderful men ; the latter ; perhaps , most so . Their lives were a romance . Although they stood related as father and son , they were , notwithstanding , contemporaries . They died within five years of each other , the one at eighty-five , the other at sixty-five . The amount and variety of their knowledge were surprising . " The concerns of religion and literature , the duties of political and domestic life , the subjects of the passing day , and the most abstruse questions of science , all fell within their grasp , and were honored with their attention . " * * * " Thegr felt every thing , and received every measure of attention , from adoration to hatre from individuals of the same community , at the same time . " * * * " They were born on the same soil , and educated at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great degree , alike . Both were indefatigable students , and devoted to the same pursuits in letters and religion . The father wrote more than an hundred works , which issued from the press in this country or in England . Nothing escaped them , from cometographia to witchcraft . They shot off am arrow at profane dancing , and threw off a pamphlet in favor of inoculation for the smallpox . " * * * " Happy in other respects , the father was thrice blessed ' in his son Cotton , who arose from the swaddling-clothes of the cradle a prodigy . In his father 's mind , the Arabian tale of the birth of Solomon was no longer a fable , of whom it // was said that , the first word he spoke was the awful name of the MOST HIGH , and the first sentence was a confession of faith . Cotton Mather , when an infant , checked the wandering and reproved the vicious . At fifteen years of age he had finished his collegiate course , and was before the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents and learning ; for he read fifteen chapters a day in the bible , and reading , with him , was nearly committing to memory ; and multiplied his fastings and vigils , with the zeal and perseverance of an hermit , destined to grace the calendar of saints . He preached sermons of great length every Sunday , wrote treatises with almost iucrtdible celerity , and scattered them profusely , in the hope of doing good . One of his biographers says , that the number of his works was three hund red and eighty-three . Franklin ascribes to one of Mather 's essays " all his usefulness in life . " Others have bestowed on him still higher praise . If any thing could exceed his industry , it was his wish to be useful ; and if any thing could exceed that , it was his credulity . " In this lecture many other topics of interest are discussed-William Penn , and the literature of Pennsylvania  --  the origin of Yale College  --  the literature of South-Carolina-William and Mary College , in Virginia-General Summary of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population , difficulties , changes , and state of the colonies at the commencement of the second century  --  the character of Benjamin Franklin-David Mason-Mathe* maticians and Astronomers of the time-Metaphysicians ... presi**11* Edwards and his son-Origin of Columbia College , in New-YorkBrown University , in Rhode-Island , and Dartmouth , in New-Hampshire  --  the Mathematicians who distinguished themselves by their observations on the transit of Venus-Rittenhouse and others-American observations on that event , the most accurate that were made . LECTURE VI . This lecture is replete with matters of deep interest , partly literary , and in part political . It depicts the state of public feeling , and recites *some of the events previous and preparatory to the revolution  --  the prominent characters of the day-Otis , Gridley , Samuel Adams-Dr . Cooper , his taste , eloquence , and fine writing-the massacre in Boston , and the proceedings held on the occasion-Orators and their orations on the anniversary of that event  --  the intrepidity and firmness of Dr. Warren , in the character of orator-John Adams , his conduct , writings , and declaration that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath of life " - attention to Oriental literature . Passing in silence over Lectures VII and VIII , we say of LECTURE IX . that it is a beautiful discourse . In refinement and interest it is rarely surpassed . It treats of poetry in general , its origin and nature-shows that it springs instinctively from the constitution of man-of English poetry from its dawn , in the twelfth century , to the time of Shakspeare  --  the period of the first colonization of our country - American poetry and poets  --  the celebrated John Smith . Of this chivalrous and truly singular man , who has no parallel in romance or reality , our author gives the following spirited account " Our first quotation shall be from the muse of John Smith , who was the Eneas of the New World . One would think , from the character of the man , that his poetry would be of the first order . He was fitted , by nature and education , for a poet ; generous , noble , and full of genius , he saw every thing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteoric light of a perturbed mind , which is so often found to mistake the agitations of feebleness for the workings of the divinity within ; but one who saw things in the blaze of intellectual day . He had been a philosopher , a hero , and a lover in every clime ; and a favorite of the fair in every path of the sun . The veiled beauties of Asia , whose hearts melt with // 469 romantic tenderness within the haram walls  --  the refined and accomplished women of his own country , and the simple , honest , and noble daughters of the forest , were enamoured with the blaze of his fame , and charmed with the martial elegance of his person . His whole life was an epic . " On Lectures X. XL . XII . and XIII . we can not dwell , although they are well written , and contain matter respecting American orators , and other points of much value , and no common interest . In Lecture XIV . Washington is thus referred to and described " On the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took command of the American army . He was not , at this time , much known to the officers of the army ; but , in addition to his having been selected by the Continental Congress , a body which had the confidence of all the people , his personal appearance , his military air , his sage demeanor , his attention to every minutin of the camp , and his punctilious regard to religious observances , at once commanded respect and admiration . This soon ripened into that enthusiastic veneration , which had before been rather the creature of the imagination than the belief of the understanding . This adoration , for it came as near it as any thing a mortal could inspire , was never , for a moment , lessened by accident or reverse of fortune . Washington had the undiminished affections of New-England from that hour to the last moment of his existence . " LEcTURE XV . treats of the naval character of our country . The navy , its exploits and glory , from its commencement to the present period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from portraying , in fine touches and vivid colors , the workings and products of American mind , is replete with interest . Such is the fullest brief , the limits of this article permit us to prepare of the contents of the " Lectures on American Literature . " Imperfect as it is , we trust it will be suflicien* to induce the reader to look into the work itself , which will richly revfard him for the attention he may bestow on it . When we consic ? ' er the in*irtance of its end , and the abundant means it employs for accomplishing*t , we are justified in ranking it among the most valuable productions of our country . To the specimens of our author 's style and manner already given , hundreds of other fine ones might be added . Without any particular care in selecting , we subjoin the following . Or if it be selected , it is not so much on account of its eloquence and beauty , as of the affecting incident it so fitly records . " We are a generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of the unfortunate Andre , who fell a victim to the laws of nations , in the prime of his life , for the very reason that his case has been presented to us in every form of prose and verse , by those of his own country , and we read all they write ; while one of our own kindred and brethren , as young , as accomplished , and as unfortunate as Andre , has hardly been mentioned by an obituarist or historian . Nathan Hale , a martyr in the cause of liberty , is a name almost unknown to his countrymen ; but it is time that we should be familiar with his reputation . He was born in Connecticut , and was graduated in Yale College , in 1773 , with exalted reputation as a scholar , and a lofty , high-minded man . He was cotemporary with Dwight , Barlow , and Humphreys , who often mourned his untimely fate , and cherished his memory by toasts and eulogies . Some of the lines of Dwight , on the melancholy occasion of Hale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection of a friend , and are almost too true , solemn , and pathetic , to be poetical . It was a dark and gloomy period in the history of our country ; and he , with many other young men , caught the spark from their fathers-in fact , anticipated them in preparing for the great struggle that was to come . At the moment the war broke out , he obtained a commission in the Connecticut line , and took the command of a company in Colonel Knowlton 's regiment , and was with the army in their memorable retreat from Long Island , in 1776 . After Washington had succeeded in an enterprise so much favored by Providence , he was for a // Literary and Intellectual Statistics . while ignorant of the movements , numbers , or disposition of the British army ; and anxious to get all possible information of their movements or intentions , he applied to Colonel Knowlton for a discreet , intelligent , enterprising and bold officer , to penetrate the enemy 's camp , and bring him the desired information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hale , who was the charm of every polished circle , and the delight of the army , the soul of honor , and the " bravest among the brave . " At the first moment it was named to him , he shrunk from the thought of becoming a spy ; but reflecting that it was Washington who required his services , and his country that was to be benefited , p erhaps preserved , by his accepting the arduous and perilous appointment , he gave up all scruples , and instantly prepared for the adventure . He passed in disguise to Long Island , examined the British camp , and having satisfied himself on this point of his mission , he was apprehended on attempting to return ; and being carried before Sir William Howe , and finding that every thing was known to the enemy , he boldly declared himself , and his object in visiting the British camp . Howe , without a trial , or even the forms of a court martial , ordered him for execution the next morning . He was confined for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a few lines to his mother and sister . As he bad led a religious life , he asked for a clergyman to attend him in his dying moments , but his request was denied , and he was not permitted to have even a Bible for a moment 's consolation . A guard of pitying soldiers , with the provost-martial , attended him to the fatal tree . The provost-martial , the common abhorrence of the camp , excited a more than ordinary share of disgust , by the brutal manner in which the wretch executed his victim . The firmness and composure of Hale did not for a moment desert him , and he died regrettino* that he bad but one life to lose in the sacred cause of his country  --  the cause o ? freedom and the rights of man . The veteran soldiers wept like children at his untimely fate , wondering that a rebel could die so much like a bero . The letters he had written were destroyed ; for they were so full of fortitude , resignation , and conscientiousness of duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought dangerous to let the Americans know that they had ever had such a man . When the news of his execution reached the American camp , every one , from the commander in chief to the humblest soldier , looked as if some general calamity had overtaken the army . If his death was just , the manner of it was execrable ; and a deep and settled resentment was mingled with their grief , which was not forgotten in the future events of the *var. " * * - * " It is valiant to fight bravely when our fire-sides and altars are invaded . He , who falls in such a conflict , sleeps with all his country 's honors blest . Monuments and epitaphs are given him , and his children find a rich inheritance in his fame . But what is this to staking one 's life and reputation together  --  and staking them for love of country ; to throw off the garb of distinction , which is , and should be , a soldier 's pride , and covering one 's self in disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy 's camp , to discover his nakedness or strength , not for one 's own fame or emolument , but for the general good ? It is above the common martyr 's fame ; above his glory . It is , if it can be justified at all  --  and all nations , polished , wise , and noble , do justify it  --  the highest of all mortal resolves . To die is nothing ; to sleep in the bed of glory is a common lot , often an enviable one , and should never be contemplated with horror by a brave man who draws his sword in agoodcause ; but to think of the chances of an ignominious death , a dishonored grave , closed without funeral knell , or muffled drum , or " volley of solemn soldiery ; " Oh it is too much to think on ; and can never be endured without dismay , unless the living fire of patriotism is burnincr wit ness and unquenchable intensity . " h all its fierce- Having occupied so much of our space with our remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Sketches of Public Characters " must be brief . As already stated , the work is but a part of the enginery which our author has constructed and brought into action , in defence of the intellectual reputation of our country . And it is well contrived , composed of substantial materials , finished in excellent style , and must operate powerfully . We are not sure that it will not be deemed , by the public at large , the most beautiful and attractive portion of the machinery . To drop the metaphor . // The imputations of foreigners , as heretofore stated , have been against the entire intellect of the United States , especially in its fitness for the more refined and elevated branches of knowledge . The intellectual character of a nation is but the aggregate of that of its individual inhabitants . It is a reservoir , therefore , fed from many fountains , and manifests itself in a variety of ways . Those modes of mental exhibition which minister most certainly and abundantly to brilliant and lasting renown , are writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public affairs ,  --  eloquence in its several departments ,  --  and the fine arts , especially painting , architecture , and sculpture . To establish the claim of our country , therefore , to intellectual fame , and put to shame her wanton traducers , our author had only to show , that many of her native inhabitants are distinguished in those forms of mental achievement . And this he has further done , in the volume before us , out of new materials , and in a manner different from that of the publication we have just taken leave og with a clearness , which prevents misapprehension or doubt , a force which every one must feel , and in a style of elegance which can not fail to delight . He has given to his book the form of letters , of which there are in all , twenty-two . In the first eight he has sketched with a dextrous hand , and in colors sufficiently vivid , about a dozen of our prominent public speakers , some of them belonging only to the bar , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures are all graphical and striking , and , as far as our acquaintance with the originals qualifies us to judge , correct in likeness . Mr. Webster 's stands first , and , like the great statesman and orator himself , is Ajax among the Greeks , or Saul in the midst of the people of Israel . In dimensions and power , it is , as it ought to be , gigantic . In portraying the manner and force of that debater 's oratory , our author ob-serves Nor , like him ( Fisher Ames ) could Mr. Webster , by the magic wand of the enchanter , make a paradise , and people it with ethereal beings ; no ; all the subject of this notice did or could do , was to work in a straight forward course , with mortal engines and show himself mighty in earth , air , and water ; but in these . his sway was Herculean ; he had all the elements at his command , and used them as one of earth-born mould , but of gigantic proportions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but goes on to convince and to conquer by legitimate means . When he goes out to battle , it is without squire , aid , or armor-bearer . In his conflict he trusts to no arm but his own-he rests only on the staff of his own spear . " * * 5 " Some of his admirers talk of his wit in debate . There is often a piquancy and girding retort in his arguments , that by some may be called wit ; but it is not the wit on Sheridan , or any professed wit ; nor that which sparkles out and illuminates the subject under discussion , and seems to be the offspring of the moment ; but it is a matter of long and previous deliberation , perhaps of frequent rehearsal . Instead of those pyrotechnics of the war of words , Webster 's speeches abound in the burning intensity of that heat which sheds a flash of light around , such as we see proceeding from a glowing mass of iron , when drawn by a powerful arm across the anvil . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , men of some one or more qualifications superior to any single trait in Mr. Webster 's mind . Some have more learning , others more wit , some have a sweeter voice , others a more refined taste ; and not a few more imagination ; but in the combination of all these powers , he has no equal . " The Letters which follow present spirited sketches of Calhoun , Everett , Livingston , Wirt , Randolph , Johnson , Dwight , Berrien , McDuffie , and Davis . Those who delight to linger in a gallery of intellectual // portraits , will experience nothing but gratification in looking into this . The subjects are of a high order , and the artist has done his duty . Nor can we say less of his portrait of General Walter Jones , of th' city of Washington . It is one of the best in his book . It brings the distinguished subject of it before you , personally , as well as intellectual ly . You see the man , and almost fancy that you hear the counsellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already quoted , perhaps , too liberally , we should be much pleased in presenting it to the reader , because we should thus give pleasure to him . But we must forbear . Letter IX . consists chiefly of brief views of the seven distinguished men , who have occupied the chair of the chief magistracy of the Union . The characters of these high officers have been long before the public , in every imaginable degree of light and shadow . We shall make no extract , therefore , from that portion of the letter which treats of them . Nor is comment on it necessary , except to say that it harmonizes with the other portions of the book . But we doubt not the reader will be gratified by the following strong-lined sketch of Aaron Burr . " He had been a soldier of the revolution , and was with Arnold in his expedition to Canada by way of the Kennebec . He had left the halls of learning at the age of nineteen , to join this hazardous enterprise ; had been selected by Arnold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pushed his way by the lakes . For this adventure , he was made the aid of Montgomery , and was at his side when the lamented warrior fell . He rose still higher in the army during the course of the war , and had left his name high on the list of those hrave and gallant youths who had given a spirit of chivalry to the American army . When the revolutionary conflict was over , he entered professional life , and at once took a decided part ; was soon known as a most promising man . His legal attainments were great ; and as an advocate he had no superior . B land , smooth , and eloquent , he guided the populace ; sagacious , penetrating , insinuating and learned , he influenced those in high places in the courts or deliberative assemblies . He was equal to any task , for he had a constitution that knew no fatigue , and a spirit of perseverance that nothing could break down . His tongue was never silent from any dread of dignity or power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Open , bold , and daring , he sought political distinction , and was determined to have it . " For our author 's picture of the city of Washington , containing his remarks on the Capitol and the President 's House , with many other matters both interesting and useful , and accurately descriptive of our national metropolis , we are compelled to refer the reader to the Sketches . " The poets of New-York receive next a very respectful notice ; and they are worthy of it . That great state and its splendid capital have produced many ardent votaries of the Muses , several of whom have drunk deeply of the waters of Helicon , and received from the Sisters chaplets which time shall neither despoil nor wither . They have already done not a little to build up and sustain the literary reputation of our country , and some of them promise to do yet much more . For precocity of talent and attainment , under circumstances peculiarly unpropitious , James Nack , the deaf and dumb poet of New-York , is an intellectual wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . All things considered , Chatterton did not equal him . He has not yet attained his twentieth year . lie has known none of the advantages of a liberal education , has never had , // until recently , free access to books , and has felt , through life , the unsparing hand of poverty and misfortune ; and yet he has written much , and many of his productions are of a high order ; all of them are marked with the rich and fervid out-pourings of genius . For intensity , and all that gives to poetry its highest character , they are not surpassed , we think not equalled , by any of the early productions of Lord Byron and those juvenile offerings of the noble bard have never received the commendation they merit . It is not too much to say of this gifted young American , that , when matured by time , and finished by labor , some of his future efforts in song may equal the happiest of those that have immortalized the author of Childe Harold . Of this phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . Another poetic wonder , not noticed in the " Sketches , " was also a native of the state of New-York . It is Lucretia Davidson , who died a few years ago , at the age of about sixteen . Like Nack , she received no early education , and had also pined in the shade of poverty , and under the grinding hand of adversity . Disease was moreover so constantly the inmate of her frame , that it seemed to make a part of it . But nothing could blight the spring of her genius . The blossoms would blow , and the fruit , rich and beautiful , cluster on the stem , though the heavens lowered on the tender plant , and the cold winds and sleety showers combined to chill its branches and scatter its leaves . Under circumstances thus painful , disheartening and distracting , did this inspired being breathe in song ; at times so exquisitely , we had almost said divinely , that her lays , scarcely partaking of earth , might have been fitly chanted by a voice from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published comparatively but little . Her taste was as fastidious as her genius was fine . Her productions , therefore , which fascinated others , dissatisfied herself , and she often destroyed them . Many pieces of considerable length , which she was known to have written , never met any eye but her own , and that of HIM who touched her mind with so bright and glowing a spark from his own altar , that it seemed a thing of heaven . Had our country produced but these two specimens of poetic talent , they ought to have been sufficient to protect her from the unwarranted calumnies she has sustained . How secure , then , does she stand , surrounded by numbers of her gifted children Nor have the writings of her poets been yet duly appreciated . Early impression and confirmed habit have been hostile and injurious to them . From pride and unfriendly feelings , without consulting either reason or taste , the British literary public formed a habit of condemning American poetry in mass ; and , from imitation , and a dependent spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , but of humbly concurring in it . They haughtily demanded , " Can any thing good come out of Nazareth ? " and we virtually replied in the net*ative . Hence our poetry was doubly condemned ; by our revilers and ourselves . Nor are we yet entirely disenthralled from this perverting influence . We do not as yet set the proper estimate on our own poets . They have written much that is excellent ; much that will not only bear the judgement of years , but improve under it . " Time shall admire , his mellowing touch employ , And mend the immortal fabric , not destroy . " And this truth Britain herself will yet acknowledge-perhaps as soon 60 // as many of ourselves . For , to their shame be it recorded , there are hundreds of Americans by birth , but foreigners in spirit , who affect to sneer at our own productions , merely because they are our own ; and who are as destitute of sound judgement and taste , as they are of patriotism . And yet these things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be chastised into good manners and out of bad feelings , before this rage for exotics and distaste of home productions will give way to true self-respect and love of country . But the national spirit , which is beginning at length to prevail among us , is a sure guaranty that the issue so desirable will yet be attained . We shall not always humble ourselves , on the score of intellect , in presence of those who affect to despise us . No . We shall ultimately learn to know ourselves as well as others ; and that will be to know that we are equal to others-in some things superior to them . Many American poems , and other forms of literary production , have fallen lifeless from the press , which , had they been published in London , and scattered among us , under the sanction of some popular Eiiglish name , would have been received with applause , read with eagerness and delight , and added , as choice performances , to our increasing stock of popular literature . But this spirit , we repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the time approaching , when the fruits of the intellect will be judged of by their merit , not their birth-place . Then will the works of American genius , past and present , occupy , what they have never yet done , the place that belongs to them . Jt will not be necessary then to trace the genealogy of a poem to an English goose-quill , to render it saleable , nor to sprinkle it with sea-water to preserve it from the book-worm . This will be true independence , such as Americans have never yet enjoyed , but such as they ought as resolutely to aspire to as to that , for the attainment of which they pledged to each other their " lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor . " This is a species of " internal improvement , " on which no hampering interdict will be laid . In its steady promotion all parties will heartily unite , and compose , we trust , in support of it , a political millennium . In relation to it , all " feuds " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ancient reign ; the eagle and the dove nestle together on the same branch , and the lamb and the lion repose in amity under its shadow . American painters have received in the " Sketches " the commendation they deserve . They are represented as numerous , able , and accomplished ; and the representation is but justice . Our country has been peculiarly fruitful in the pictorial talent ; scarcely less so than the sunny climates of Italy and Greece . This truth even Englishmen have rarely denied . They have indeed " paltered " about it " in a double sense , " alleging that , although painters were born in the United States , they had to go to Europe to be educated . True ; and English painters go to Italy for the same purpose . We contend only for the genius ; and that can not be denied us . Our academies and regular schools of painting are yet to be instituted . But in maturity of time they will as certainly spring up , as the plant will appear , when the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faiiorable . Respecting Boston and New-England , our author has said much in a small compass ; but , without violating truth , or speaking extravagantly , he might have extended his letter , and said much more . New-England // is rich in real worth and honorable doings . She contains much of the bone and muscle of our country , and her full share of its glorious spirit . All things , moreover , guaranty that she will not degenerate . To be able to live at all , her sons must live economically , practise industry , and exercise the intellect that Heaven has bestowed on them . Besides transmitting to them the hardihood of their forefathers , this course will render also their own intelligence , virtue , and other high qualities hereditary , and keep them , through ages , what they now are , a great , enlightened , and independent people . The most curious , and one of the most amusing letters in the volume , is that which gives the character of Bartlett , who , for profligacy , wit , versatility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost denominated the Zimri of his day . But we can dwell on the work no longer . We take leave of both productions , by again earnestly recommending them to the attention of our fellow-citizens . They are repositories of much valuable matter , and abound in specimens of fine writing . If , in a few instances , the style borders on oriental pomp , it is never meretriciously gaudy . Taste in its decorations , and judgement in suiting it to the occasion , always predominate . A few remarks on the general subject of the works shall close our review . Were it not for the well known effects of prejudice , jealousy , and mortified pride , united to resentmeut and long cherished dislike , the charge of a want of talents , and of corporeal degeneracy , preferred by English writers against the natives of the United States , would be mat*. ter of astonishment . On no ground of human error , except the grossest ignorance , or the wilful violation of truth , arising from the causes just enumerated , can the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the range of observation or history , a single instance , in which there would be less of justice in such an accusation . Few , if any , can be referred to , where there would be so little . On abstract principles there is much reason why the Americans should have an ample stock of both intellectual and corporeal excellence , and none why they should be deficient in either . Our country was originally colonized by many of the choicest sons and daughters of the British empire-her dite in talent as well as in spirit . They were not banished for profligacy , or transported for crime . Impatient of the ignorance and bigotry around them , and indignant at the exercise of arbitrary power , which arrogated a control over mind as well as body , they went into voluntary exile , and sought , in a foreign land , that free exercise of person , intellect , and conscience , which was denied them at home . When they took leave of the shores of England , to encounter their long and perilous voyage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursion of pleasure , and to confront the more appalling dangers of an untried climate and a savage foe , they left behind them but few equal , and none superior to them , in all that commands admiration and esteem . The cavaliers of the south and the pilgrims of the north were alike celebrated and worthy of celebration , each in their own way . The Brewsters , and Brad*rds , and Standishes , and their comrades , had been long distinguished among the pious and enlightened ; and Smith and Raleigh were the glory of chivalry . It is a provision of nature but rarely departed from , that children inherit the qualities of their parents . This // is as true of mental as of corporeal qualities . What then could fasten on the descendants of such a race the curse of degeneracy ? The mode in which they were reared , under a necessity to contend with difficulties , and be forever on the alert , was calculated for the full development of all their faculties , and to improve rather than deteriorate them ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the history of the time be consulted , and it will testify conclusively to all these truths . During the greatest part of the first century after the commencement of the colonies , the emigrants from the mother country belonged to the most enterprising , bold , and efficient class of her population . None others were calculated for the experiment of emigration , and residence in the New World , or had the hardihood to attempt it . But that such ancestors , in a healthy region , where the means of sustenance were ample , where strict temperance was the settled usage , and full exercise of body and mind was common to all , should give birth to a race of degenerates , could never happen , except through a change in the laws of nature . We assert that a phenomenon of this kind has never occurred ; and we challenge our slanderers to show the contrary . Nothing but ignorance of nature , or inattention to her economy , could have led them to the adoption of a belief so preposterous . Their charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their philosophy as their civility . But let us descend from principle to fact ; from abstract reasoning to observation and history , and there we shall find our theory confirmed . I'he highest encomium that can be passed on the intellect of a people is to say of it , that it always directs its possessors to the fittest objects of pursuit , and suggests the means best calculated for their attainment . And this , to say the least , is as true of American intellect , as it is of the English . Were we to pronounce it much more so , the frightful spectacle of want and misery , and we may add of crime , which Great-Britain now presents , contrasted with our unexampled prosperity , and comparative virtue , would confirm our assertion . For the distresses of nations as well as of individuals arise from the want or misapplication of mind . National wisdom has never yet led to national calamity ; nor can such an event occur , while cause and effect retain their relation . As soon shall the stream run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Britain , we say is miserable , and the United States abundantly happy . This is a comment alike significant and instructive on her intellect and mode of employing it , as well as on ours . While we are enjoying the choicest fruits of talent and wisdom , and she draining the bitter cup of error and folly , it would be becoming in her , at least , should she even refuse to applaud us , to cease from defaming us . Shall we be told , that the monarchical government and semi-feudal institutions of Great-Britain act as fetters on her intellect , and prevent her from employing it according to the dictates of wisdom and judgement ? and that her calamities arise from that source , and not from any intellectual deficiency ? We reply , that , until 1775 , Americans were subject to the same government , which proclaimed its ri* and manifested a disposition to " bind them in all cases wj*t*r , " by laws and resolutions which they had no agency in fraining&lt; But their clear perception of right and fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be borne by men professing to be free ; their manly spirit and love of justice prompted them to throw it off , and their genius and valor crowned their glorious effort with success . If Britons are equally gifted in all that belongs to enlightened freemen , why do they groan on , and submit to their chains ? Why do they not , like Americans , break them asunder , and establish a wiser system of government , act in all things agreeably to reason , and enjoy their reward ? Wherefore , we say , do they thus submit to calamities , which wisdom , enterprise , and valor might so easily remedy ? Under such circumstances why do they content themselves with empty complaints ? The answer is plain . They want the high qualities of the sages and heroes who achieved our revolution . And it is the decree of nature that it should be so . Perfect freedom of action strengthens and improves every faculty of man , mental as well as corporeal . But freedom of every kind is in greater perfection in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Its effects are seen , therefore , in the improvement of the whole man . Hence , instead of being deteriorated , the intellect of America is strengthened and ameliorated . We hazard nothing in asserting , that the Americans surpass the British in all things on which they have bestowed an equal share of attention and labor . If their literature is inferior , it is because it has been much less cultivated as a pursuit . Respecting other matters in which they are inferior the same is true . For we repeat , and challenge refutation , that , all other things being equal , the freer the people , the higher and more efficient is their intellectual character . The late glorious struggle in Paris proves this . Frenchmen enjoyed more freedom in 1830 , than they did in 1790 . Hence their efforts were of a higher and nobler order . It is uttering but a truism to observe , that , at different periods of their existence and progress , from a weak and humble to a powerful and exalted standing , nations must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the means of accomplishing them are well selected and applied , will their success be certain and their condition prosperous . And , as already intimated , the fortunate issue of their schemes for the promotion of public good and individual happiness , amounts to the highest and fairest commendation that the wisdom and talent which directed them can receive . Let Americans be judged of by this rule , and never has the intellect of any people appeared to such advantage . For never has any other advanced with half as much rapidity and steadiness , or in a career of such brilliancy , to greatness and glory . We , like other nations , have had our heroic age , during which the business of man was to encounter peril and hardship , and to perform daring and wondrous deeds ; and our ancestors , who were real men , composed of bone , and brain , and muscle , and nerves that could feel every thing but fear , acquitted themselves in it with a boldness and chivalry never surpassed by knights of fiction . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations was infinite . Theirs was fabulous , ours real . While their poetic knights and champions met and overthrew imaginary monsters and giants of fable , our positive ones fought and vanquished wild beasts and savages no less formidable , made up of true flesh and blood . And while the clang of their battles existed only in the songs of bards and the lays of mmstrels , // ours had a dismal reality in the stunning crack of the rifle , the twang of the bow , the whizzing of the hatchet as it hurtled through the air , the deafening *var-whoop , and the groans of the dying . The fabled combat of St. George and the dragon , with all the ghre of poetry around it , may be pronounced inferior , in daring and chivalry , to many conflicts that have actually occurred in the American forest . The real exploits , moreover , of Boone are almost comparable to the fictitious ones of Hercules In fine , were all the darings , deeds , and sufferings of our ancestors and frontier men recorded in simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any romance that fancy has formed . But these were the product of American mind , adapted to the period in which they occurred . The same minds which directed them were competent , under a change of circumstances , to provide for any other emergency . XVhen we were colonists , we acted , as related both to ourselves and the mother country , in a manner strictly becoming our condition ; but we looked ahead and prepared for independence . While achieving that blessing , the fitness of our measures is proved by the issue , and excited at the time , the admiration of the world . Iii intelligence and talent , eloquence and firmness , to which may be added public virtue and personal rectitude , no body of men ever surpassed the American Congress of 1776 . We know of none that ever equalled it . In her whole parliamentary career , extending through several centuries of her brightest era , Great-Britain presents nothing comparable to it . She has had , at different times , her great and good men ; but such a constellation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For proof of their superiority , we refer to their acts . Of the governments subsequently established , to secure what had been gained in the revolutionary struggle , we might speak in terms of equal commendation . They were monuments of wisdom to instruct the world , not excepting Great-Britain herself , inwhat it did not know before . The truth of this also is proved by the result . The world is both instructed and improved by them . had not our governments been surpassingly wise and well administered , our prosperity under them could not have been so great . In the management of public affairs , then , the American mind has always shown itself equal to the emergency . In no instance , however intricate and arduous , has it been found wanting . It comprehended every thing , dared every thing , and vanquished every difficulty . Our calumimiators themselves , when pressed on the subject , will not deny this , because history has recorded it , and many well known facts sustain it . They will not even deny that as often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GreatBritain , on national affairs , they have , in almost every instance , proved themselves the ablest and most successful negotiators . Some of the British presses have even murmured at this , and charged their own ministers with incompetency ; yet , in perhaps their next paper , they have charged the Americans with a similar defect . Such is the consistency of men , when engaged in defending what their own observation proclaims erroneous ! Nor , as relates to trade , commerce , and the general business of life , can less be said of us . In these particulars no people have ever surpassed the Americans in intelligence , enterprise and skill . To this // the whole aspect of our country , our numerous seaports , and almost every noted mart on earth bear witness . Indeed our adroitness in these respects is proverbial . Nor , in several branches of clerant and costly manufactures , are we any where surpassed ; and if we have not yet succeeded to the same extent in others , it is because we have not labored in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not suit our present condition , and would not furnish a profitable employment . Change our conditiou , and render them suitable and profitable , and we shall soon become masters in them . Conclusive evidence oi the clearness and sagacity of the American intellect is , that it does not waste time in unfitting pursuits . It has a keen perception of aptitude , and attempts nothing in violation of it . To act otherwise would be a mark of *veakness or want of reflection . had British tourists the good sense to know this , they would not look , in the wilds of the interior of America , for the customs , nanners , elegancies , and luxuries that are found now in the vicinity of Paris and London , but which were not even there a century ago . Nor , had they good breeding , would they rail at the country in consequence of their disappointment when searching for them . Things are as well suited to their condition in the United States as they are in England or any other part of Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . The good sense of the people is the guaranty of this . A more strictly practical people never existed . The American intellect , then , possessing great compass , strength , arid flexibility , united to a clear perception of fitness , is equal to any exigency in human affairs , and can adapt its pursuits to every change that may occur , and its measures to every new demand that may be made on it . This is attested by the great improvements it has made in every branch of knowledge that is called for in the country , and by which an honorable independence can be gained . Our position to this effect might be confirmed by a reference to the elevated condition of the liberal professions among us , and the multitude of inventions in the mechanical arts . Knowledge on these subjects , being needed in the present state of society , can be rendered profitable to its possessors , by an immediate application of it to practical purposes . It is therefore eagerly sought after , and rapidly attained . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as it shall be called for , under the certainty of a suitable reward . No matter whether it belongs to science , arts , or letters ; let a market for it be opened , and American genius will soon supply it . As already intimated , but little has been hitherto done by the public to encourage American literature . It has been eveii discountenanced , by an unreasonable preference of that from abroad . We call the preference unreasonable , because the foreign articles preferred have been often inferior to the domestic ones that were undervalued . The consequence has been what every one who reflected on the sui ) ject anticipated . Polite literature has been comparatively but little cultivated among us , except as a matter of individual taste and amusement . We have had hut few writers by profession , because neither honor nor riches awaited the pursuit . Our mechanics became wealthy by laborincr in their vocations , while our scholars might have starved in the midst a of the most exquisite productions of their pens . The reason is obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture and some of the arts , but a very limited one for poetry , or any other kind of fine writing . The former was adapted to the state of society , while the latter was out of time . Necessaries and comforts , not luxuries or mere delicacies , were first to be provided . But polite literature is a luxury and will not therefore be encouraged , because it can not be indulged in , except as a concomitant of wealth and leisure . During this condition of things , but few literary productions appeared ; and even those that did appear were not of the highest order , or in the most finished style , because they had not been sufficiently elaborated ; and to become a good writer is the work of years , under close industry , and the strictest attention to style and manner . Such was the disheartening state of things . Yet it has already appeared , that , notwithstanding its power to blight and wither , it did not render American genius unproductive . Beneath gloom and winter , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became mature and excellent , far beyond what there was ground to expect . Such was the vigor of the soil from which they sprung . But of late , the sentiments of society have changed , public taste and judgement are improved , and a new era is evidently opening on American literature . Foreign productions are not , as formerly , almost indiscriminately approved , nor those of our own writers rejected , merely because they are not the growth of a distant hemisphere . Readers examine and reflect before they feel themselves authorized to decide . Their decision , therefore , is founded on principle , and is usually correct . As the consequence of this change in public feeling , American works are sought for and purchased , to a much greater extent than in former years . Let this state of things continue ; or rather let it improve in the requisite degree ; let fine specimens of American composition be rewarded with honor and profit , and they will soon be abundantly produced . Let prompt and liberal purchasers be found , and the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Souvenirs , Tokens , and novels of the day , with many other productions of taste give proof of this . We do not say that Byrons , arid Sir Walters , and Moores will immediately spring up among us . Authors of that class appear but seldom . But we do say that we shall soon have writers equal to any Europe contains , except , perhaps , such prodigies as we have named ; and in time we shall equal them . The same genius that gave renown to our fathers , through all the eventful periods of our history , is still the cherished inheritance of their descendants . And it is susceptible of any direction , and capable of any exertion , that may be called for by the condition and wants of the community . It is frilly competent to gratify the taste , and answer to the varying desires of the times . Let it be turned to letters , with the enthusiasm and energy that have always marked it , and it will kindle up , in another and more enduring form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on canvass , as xv elI as in the forum , the cabinet , and the halls of legislation . The literature of America will then vie with her other productions ; and Englishmen , abstaining from further calumnies , will blush for those they have already so culpably invented and propagated.
