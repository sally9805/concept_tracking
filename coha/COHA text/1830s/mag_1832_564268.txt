txt OUR village is the very place where the muse of lyric poetry should take up her abode ; - it is so quiet and green . The natives believe there is not so lonely a spot under the blue heavens ; but strangers say , there is nothing particularly beautiful in the town , excepting , always , the graceful rounding of the hills , and the easy meandering of its little river . The poetry , inspired by our verdant scenery , is full of a serene and affectionate spirit . We have no rushing cataracts , skywrapped mountains , gloomy caverns , and sea-beaten cliffs , to awaken bold and startling thoughts . Byron 's muse would have died of inanition if she had been exiled to our village . Most of our school-girls were scribblers . Our very best poet was Donald McAllister , one of our school-boys , who perished among the " coral rocks in Madagascar seas . " There was one remarkably dull boy in our parish . His parents died when he was about fourteen years old , leaving him nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy lived there all alone , gathering for fuel the decayed leaves and branches which were profusely scattered in the forest where his hut was situated , going every day to labor for his bread at Doctor Johnson 's farm , and , at his leisure hours , poring over those ancient books . Sometimes a wealthy , generous-minded lady would bestow on him a worn-out coat , after heedfully cutting off the buttons and depositing them in her own work-box , or a hat and shoes , from which parts of the rim and soles had been abstracted . Sometimes he carried about coarse willow baskets which he had made in the long winter evenings by the light of a pitch-pine knot . He was considered dull , because be never played at ball , or hide-and-seek , with other boys . He could not understand a jest , even *f he was himself the object of it , and , if it was more bluntly repeated , he did not return it , but the tear would glisten in his eyes , which some said , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If a school-mate struck him , instead of resenting the affront , he would treat the offender with kindness . A few supposed he was a coward , but a greater number believed it was because the Bible , his chosen book , commanded us " not to avenge ourselves , but to return good for evil . " He could not have been a coward , for he used to walk through the burying-ground to visit the graves of his parents , every moonlight evening . If he was ever questioned upon any subject , he only replied , " No , " " Yes , " or " I ca n't tell ; " this was the most he was ever heard to say . But , although he was called stupid , he was very amiable , respectful to his superiors , and obliging to all . No one could accuse him of a wicked action , or of neglecting to attend church . So he lived until he was eighteen years old , when an event occurred which tended to bring him greatly into notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived about a mile from his cottage , to whom he had been accustomed to carry the first blown roses , and the finest peaches from his little garden . That was all . He never saw her more than twice a year , . excepting at church // and singing-meetings in the school-house , and never said ten words to her in his life , perhaps . One day she was merrily skipping across the frozen mill-pond , when the ice suddenly gave way , and she sunk under the water . The miller saw her fall in , and came to her assistance , but she was entirely lifeless before he succeeded in getting her out . Many sad lamentations were sent up by old and young , and they were mingled with heart-felt gratitude , for many of the school-children had passed over the pond that very morning in perfect safety . Harry Brown attended her funeral , as all the parish did , and when he came to look at the corpse , he burst into tears , and sobbed aloud . From this time there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so steady at his work as usual . He visited the burying-ground , morning and night , and planted a willow over Sarah 's grave , where he used to sit reading his old books . He was always moving his lips as if whispering , besides which he purchased , at the store , quill after quill , and sheet after sheet of paper , until all were in the fidgets to know what he could find to do with it . At last it came out . He was turning poet . The first poem he wrote was a lament for Sarah Cross , a most heartmelting thing . The next was an elegy for Tim Jeremy 's little girl . It also contained a notice of the kindness of Eleanor Wakefield , now Mrs. George Graves , who used to watch by its sick cradle . It was very much admired by Eleanor , to whom it was first shown . She handed it about to every body , and every body praised it and begged a copy . The third was on the death of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her benevolence and piety . And , as Ensign Jewett observed , " now he had once set a-going , there was no stopping him . " He expatiated in rhyme upon the stars , the pretty girls , the trees and birds , night and morning , the meeting-house , and all nature besides-generously enriching his poems with apposite quotations from Milton , Shakspeare , Homer and Virgil . A spirit of humble devotion to God , and sincere love to man , were diffused in all his writings . The lines were usually a little irregular , and the style sometimes rough . He had never conversed , and was only beginning to write , consequently he found himself greatly in want of words . He applied to his dictionary , which , indeed , furnished him with an abundance , but unfortunately he often selected those which were obsolete or unusual . Oar minister , however , took occasion to hand him some well-written modern works , the style of which he seemed greatly to admire and endeavored to imitate . What a change had taken place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lonely , retiring boy , he had suddenly shot up into a man  --  a poet-all in a moment . He bethought himself that his costume was not quite befitting his new character , and forthwith he diligently went to work for Deacon Haskell until his means were sufficient to procure himself a complete suit of iron-gray , with a scarlet-and-green plaid cloak . When he " came out , " he was quite a noticeable figure in our singing-seats . He was elegantly tall and slender . His head was covered with heavy , brightyellow natural curls . His light gray eyes were rather dull , unless he was in a revery , or animated by music , when the pupil of the eye would so dilate , that you would fancy the whole eye was black , and so sparkling one could hardly look at him . T was a pity he could // not converse . The language of the pen , and the unspeakable eloquence of the eye , were all he could boast . When Squire Newell 's eldest daughter , Fanny , died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that her father gave him a flute , and her brother John offered to teach him to play it . It thrills my heart at this distance of time to remember how meltingly in The summer evening came the notes of Bonnie Doon and Auld Robin Gray across the little river , from the thick forest in which the poet 's cot was hidden-Oh , it was the soul of melody  --  and the deep quiet of our green valley was in perfect unison with its sweet pensiveness . One Monday morning , Harry , as usual , hung out his iron-grays , and his green-and-scarlet cloak to air , while he was reading his chapter in the Bible . Very few mischievous and light-fingered people are there in our village , but there is no place entirely without them , and when the poet had replaced his Bible upon the shelf , covered his fire , swept the hearth , and gone out to look to his Sunday garment , he discovered that the green-and-scarlet cloak had mysteriously disappeared . He went back in great consternation to his arm-chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomily the abduction of his raiment . " It can not have gone away without help , and therefore somebody must have helped it away , " reasoned he ; but who ' ? There was no trace of the thief , and the poet would not allow himself to suspect any one of the larceny . " One thing I can do , " thought he , and after pacing the room awhile , he sat down to write an advertisement directed " to the person who took away a green-and-red cloak belonging to Harry Brown . " In this document he meekly set forth that " the person had injured him without a cause , but he freely forgave him , and would use no means to bring him to justice . He , however , besought him to remember that he had been guilty of a great sin  --  a sin that would shut him out of heaven if he did not repent of it-that he might suddenly die , and find no space for repentance . At any rate , if he should persist in the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gallows . He was willing to allow him the use of the cloak until Saturday night , when he begged him to return it , as he could not otherwise attend church . " It was winter , and we had then no stoves in our church . One copy of this advertisement , he nailed up on the door of the church , another on the store , and another on the central school-house . All that week , groups of men , or girls , or school-children , might be seen clustered around the notices , and one young man who had been reading them , was seen to retire in evident and irrepressible agitation . On Friday evening , the poet heard an inexplicable rustling among the bushes at his door , and , on opening it , he discovered his cloak upon the door-stone . He examined the pocket to see if the hymn-book was gone . It was there , in company with some silver pieces , which the penitent offender had offered as an atonement for his theft . Harry deposited them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cloak . This short-lived affliction served , on the whole , to do him good . It reminded him of the necessity of providing for a time of want or of losses , and he became more industrious , and began to lay up a portion f his small earnings . // How our L*oet , in spite of his rhyming propensities , could fall in love with , and marry plump Patty Gale , and how he managed to court her , with the aid of monosyllables only , was a marvel , passing the ability of our wisest heads to explain . But I had the story in co*jldence from Nancy , Patty 's sister , and there was nothing so very remarkable in it , after all . He merely addressed a sonnet to her , as he did to several of us village girls , and we , indeed , thought nothing of it , only that he remembered us kindly ; but she ( and she was a saucy girl ) taking advantage of the affectionate style of the poem , and her own good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceded , extremely " pretty-looking , " only she was so plump ) returned him an equally kind answer . There were some sentiments like these at the close of the sonnetThus , day and night , I sigh and languish , Oh will you not regard my anguish ? For you can save me if you will , And make me very happy still . My joy would never , never fail , If I could marry Patty Gale . Patty was quite unable to resist this affecting appeal . The tears rolled down her rosy cheeks while she perused it . She immediately returned him an answer , telling him " she would be his wife and he might call and see her the next evening . She was sorry he had suffered so much on her account ; but she could not blame herself , as she did not know of it before . " It is a matter of some doubt whether Harry expected or even desired any reply , least of all such a reply as this ; but he visited her , and although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was fully settled , with the consent of her parents , that they should marry next autumn . But in the autumn , her father was very ill , and therefore the wedding was deferred to winter , when the sleigh-bells rang a loud and merry peal as the long procession moved rapidly by in its way to Harry Brown 's cottage in the wood . You would hardly have recognized that old cottage-it was so nicely painted and whitewashed ; for though Henry was poor , Capt . Gale was rich , and generous , too , and it gave him sincere pleasure to contribute to his children 's comfort . Henry Brown has learned to talk and laugh , but he has forgotten his muse , his reveries , and his moonlight wanderings in the churchyard . With his marriage commenced the decline of poetry in our village , and we have not at present a solitary scribbler of rhyme among us . The river winds as calmly as ever . The green hills slope as gracefully , and the wild-birds carol as sweetly , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any stranger should have the curiosity to visit the poet 's birthplace , let him ride up the Shanobie road , ( it is a very smooth , shady road , and not much out of the way ) until he comes to the walnut wood , and , closely embowered by those heavy old trees , he may discover a little one-sided yellow cottage , with plenty of red and white rosebushes and tall sun-flowers in front with glittering rows of tin milkpans under the windows . It would afford him but little pleasure to // look into the dwelling . He would only find a merry yellow-haired man and a plump black-eyed woman , and some half a dozen rosy romps of children . Abundance of good-nature is there , and health and industry , but the genius of romance and the spirit of poetry , long since unfolded their bright wings and flew away together . EVERALLIN.
