txt HAVING taken occasion , at two different times , within two years , to repeat the expression of our admiration for Miss Sedgwick 's genius , and what is more , the noble use to which it is devoted , * nothing remains for us , at present , but to show that we are not unobservant of the claims , which she has been further establishing on the public gratitude . When we spoke of her " Home , " we ventured to hint at the probability that its brilliant success , and unquestionably great moral influence , would encourage her to the production of other works upon the same general model ; and we suggested , that " if her attention should henceforward be exclusively applied to them , she would only enhance her pure and exalted fame . " In that exquisite picture of middle life , as it exists , or may exist , in this country , - and as it can not , in all respects , exist in any other , with different political institutions from ours , - we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been conferring a common benefit of the first importance , she had at the same time found out her own peculiar vein , - that best good fortune which can befall an author . Holding her powers in the high estimation that we do , we may be permitted to say , that we do not think her forte lies in that artificial complication of plot , which is necessary to sustain the interest of a long story . Besides , it is to be said to her great praise , that her mind , in order to put forth its frill strength , needs to be excited by the sense of having undertaken to impress some weighty doctrine of practical philanthropy ; and all experience spaks against the attempt to enforce a single moral of any kind by a fiction extended to any great length . Miss Sedgwick knows perfectly well what she is about , in what she has now undertaken . She surveys her whole ground ; // she is full of resource ; she understands the place and the power of every spring that she touches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , as these are determined and modified by our peculiar social institutions . She knows their wants , their dangers , their mutual misapprehensions , their powers for mutual service , their deficiencies in mutual duty , their distinctive capacities for being useful and happy , and for advancing the common welfare while each advances his own , and so realizing the aim of our political theory . And she uses her power in the spirit of a generous humanity . She has found out the secret of levelling upwards . In " Home " her business is with those who are not called rich , and in the two later works , it is with the poor . But she no more encourages either in a morose , discontented , suspicious pride , because they want what others have , than she allows them to regard themselves as , on that account , subject to assumption and injury on the part of those others . To all , rich , moderately circumstanced , and poor , she teaches selfrespect and mutual respect . She teaches these sentiments effectually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and situations , their possibility , their reasonahleness , their dignity ; and exposing the delusions which may 1 ) ave interfered with them , till the reader wonders at the stupidity of a mind , - though an hour ago it may have been his own , - which can regard any thing as greatly respectable or desirable hut worth , or fail to reverence worth , or be content with it , in any station . We have no idea of making a single extract from these volumes . Whoever does not purchase and read them , - he and all his , - deserves not such a pleasure as that of seeing one of their pages . If any American , - in one station or another , - of this sex or age , or of that , - wishes to know something new ahout the way to be upright and happy , and yet something not so new , but that , once learned , he will say he ought always to have known it , let him send for these hooks ; he , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be always something the better off , for his having read them . If any jaded romance-reader would have an honest natural laugh and cry , such as perchance he only remembers among his young experiences , hut such as always mends the mind , the manners , and the heart , let him ptlt by Cadurcis till tomorrow , and pass to-day with Uncle Philip or the Barclays . // We would be the last to disparage Cumnor Place or the Castle of Udolpho ; but , for the true scene of the pathetic , commend us , at present , to the back room on the second floor in Church Street , New York , where a noble woman nurses her worthless husband , and keeps up the credit and courage of the children , whom her feeble labor scarcely saves from starving . We do not love Ivanhoe , the crusader , less ; but just now we find ourselves caring for Harry Aikin , the carman , more . May Dacre is a vision , of a certain gorgeousness , to haunt the thoughts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loveliest creation , the little servant girl , Lucy Lee . Lucy Lee , the sot 's patient child , the cripple 's tender sister , the abused infant 's watching angel ; - . Charles Lovett , the brave baker 's boy ; - Harry , giving up his winter 's schooling to earn fifty dollars , by peddling books , to enable a sick neighbour to make a journey to a physician ; - match us a set of bond fide heroes and heroines , like these , from Ainadis de Gaul down to Ida of Athens . The first of the books named above , showing how to be very rich with very little , - how to be entirely respectable and happy , and abundant in resources for serving others , with only such means as day-labor can supply , and of course such as every man in this country can command , - we presume is well known to most of our readers . " Live and Let Live , " the more recent tale , seeks out a class on whom far too little attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must have a different kind of consideration from what will be given to them anywhere* else . We are learning more and more , every year , how little fit the literature of England is for some of our uses . Never does it serve us less well , than when it brings into view the relation between the employer and the employed , living under the same roof ; for that is all the real distinction ( as far as the mere abstract relation of service is concerned ) between master and domestic servant , as we call them , and employer and employed under some other name . With an Englishman , a domestic servant is , by mutual acknowledgment , an altogether inferior person ; naturally enough , for the relation has been transmitted from a time when domestic attendants were vassals . Accordingly , servility is looked for , and is not grudged ; and even kind advice takes the tone of dictation , without any consciousness of impertinence on the one side , or sense of injury on the other . This idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as often as the relation itself is brought to view . Take , for example , some of Mrs. More 's Cheap Repository Tracts ; admirable works , for the use intended , in England , but of very limited a ) pl ! cability to the same use among us , for the reason which we have named . There was an excellent little series of books , published by the English Christian rJlact Society , " entitled " Tracts designed to inculcate Moral Conduct . ' ' They were republished in this country many years ago , but failed of coming into extensive use , from the same cause . A tone pervaded them , which was out of harmony with the habits of our society ; so that cases might well occur , in which a present of them would be regarded much rather as an affront than as a kindness . The English travellers and reviewers have had their laugh at our word " help , " which they have imagined , however , to be in much more general use , than it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to furnishing them more of the same kind . The word is a good word . We would far rather revive than lose it . It recognises employer and employed in the same family , in the relation , in which , by whatever name denominated , they both ought to be sensible that they stand . It points us back to the simplicity of those times ( times , in which most of our few peculiarities of expression originated ) when a householder , finding that there was more to be done than the united strength of himself , hi* wife , and his children was equal to , hired the son or daughter of a neighbour , - as independent as himself , but less tasked , - to come and make a part of his family circle , and do what in the west they would call " the balance " of the work . If more artificial manners have to some extent superseded the siraplicity of those times , and changed , in some degree , the form and habits of the connexion , still no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , or the relinquishment of a perfect self-respect on the other . Our domestic , in the eye of the law , is on a level with ourselves ; entitled , as much as we , to any social influence and standing which his worth of character will win for him . It is matter of mutual , equal contract , that he undertakes to do for us a certain kind of labor , and we to make him a certain amount of compensation . For mutual convenience , his home is in one part of the house , and ours in another ; but this is no important distinction between him , and the lawyer or the blacksmith , the governor or the // drayman , who serves us , or whom we serve , for money , on the other side of the street . The young men and women , who come into our families from the country to*vns , to earn something wherewith to make a parent 's home comfortable , or provide for the future comfort of one of their own , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredit to the more prosperous circumstances , into which they are very likely to be finally brought . Having accomplished what they came for , they leave us , to be responsible and respectable members of society in the places of their origin , or wherever they go to push their fortune ; in after life , they become occasional guests to us , whom it is our l ) lace and our pleasure to honor , or they offer to us the hospitality of their own homes ; nor are instances wanting , in which , making their way to wealth , they become known among the most liberal and public spirited of our citizens , enrolling their names among the eminent patrons of humane objects , of religion , and of learning . Their service , too , happily , is compensated in a way , which , as far as that circumstance can go , gives them a right to independence of character . It is little to say , that there is many a domestic servant richer than his spendthrift employer . We know of those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they too clergymen above want . Nothing can possibly be clearer , than that employer and employed , in this relation , meet upon perfectly equal terms , to make an honest contract , equally binding upon both . We have no right to exact from a domestic servant , any thing , in kind or degree , different from what , expressly or virtually , he engaged to do , and we engaged to pay him for . He may submit to the imposition , sooner than put himself to present inconvenience , and lose other advantages . But this is no justification to us ; and the possibility that he may do so , should only make us the more scrupulous how we use our power . It was no part of the contract , that he should be overworked , insulted , or otherwise ill-treated . He did not agree that he would go without proper food , or sufficient sleep , or some opportunity to read , and see his friends , and worship God . He did not agree , that he would serve us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so much as lie for us . He did not agree to be the subject of our caprice , and the butt of our ill-temper . He did not consent to come under our roof to be corrupted by our conversation , or our example , or that of any whom we should there make his associates . - But all such matters , // however well-considered , belong to only one side of the duty . We have come into a relation to him , which admits of being used greatly to his present and his permanent advantage . We can further his proper objects ; we can improve his character ; we can help him to the knowledge of many useful things ; we can put him in the way to see what a becoming treatment of others is , how mutually satisfactory it is , and how easy habit , with a little thought and arrangement , makes it ; we can endeavour to exhibit to him a specimen of what he ought to desire to be , when his turn comes to have others look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ourselves to the benefit , excellently well worth having , which is contemplated in Miss Sedgwick 's motto ; " Whereas the Turkish spy says he kept no servant because he would not have an enemy in his house , I hired mine because I would have a friend . " But we did not mean to preach a sermon about this thing . We should only be doing very tamely what Miss Sedgwick has done very effectively , in a story full of life and power , in recounting the adventures of Lucy Lee , a gentle , patient , bright , heroic creature , who , teaching and learning good wherever she goes , passes successively under the power of the exacting , rule-worshipping Mrs. Broadson , the well-disposed , but inconsiderate , incompetent , and always afflicted Mrs. Ardley , the notable , managing , and trickish Mrs. Simson , the loving and upright , but too easy Mrs. Lovett , the lofty , fashion-enslaved and fashion-hardened Mrs. Hartell , and the pattern Mrs. Hyde , - till at last she settles down as the deserving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fair friends , the young housekeepers , that here , in the form of an hour 's delightful reading , they have a directory for the rule of that world of infinite interests , their home , which will effectually help them to become the blessings they intend to be to their husbands , their children , and their humbler friends ; and which , well-followed , will keep the wrinkles from their sunny brows for many a year , after what is falsely called the course of nature has ploughed them deep down into other foreheads . What a power is that of an intellectual woman over the condition of a people , if she does but understand the sphere of her strength ; moving as she does everywhere in the recesses of society ; privileged to observe the operations of thought and passion , in the scenes where thought and feeling are educated for more public action ; necessarily disconnected from // those parties , which make men distrust and refuse instruction from one another . Who would venture to say , that there is a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , who is doing a patriot 's work more effectively , than the lady on whose writings we have been commentincr And what a wretched 6 folly , in any one endowed with any portion of her gifts , instead of using them with similar good judgment and to similar good account , to unsex herself for the gladiatorship of men 's party strifes , or play the she-bully for the Rights of Women . In speaking of the great worth of Miss Sedgwick 's writings , in a moral and political point of view , as inculcating and exciting the self-respect and mutual respect , which make the distinctive nobility of the republican character , - that is , of the character of man , in a condition of society where he may fully act out the man ,  --  we have implied our sense of their high literary excellence ; since if her pictures were not radiantly true and vivid , they would not charm and move readers as they do . We remarked that , in this series of tales , she was working the true vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , fallen upon the vein , from which the treasures of our future literature are to be wrought . A literature , to have real freshness and power , must be moulded by the influences of the society , where it had its origin . Letters thrive , when they are at home in the soil . Miss Sedgwick 's imaginations have such vigor and bloom , because they are no exotics . She paints scenes , as she has looked upon them ; characters , as she has known them ; the energy of passion and principle , as they have impelled or crossed each other under her own view ; the pressure and the encouragement of circumstance , as American life exhibits it . She writes of minds and hearts , as they muse and beat , not in ancient Rome , nor modern Cumberland , but in the streets of our marts , and the retirement of our villages . So her own mind obtains the excitement , which nothing gives , like the sense of dealing with realities , and the consciousness of absolute possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm interest by seeing themselves reflected , as in a glass ,  --  by recognising exposures , duties , calamities , internal and external conflicts of whatever sort , which are or may presently be , their own or their neighbours ' . When there is extensively a literary ambition among us , true as hers to its American office , a great step will have been taken towards the assertion of a place in the literary Panachceis of the nations.
