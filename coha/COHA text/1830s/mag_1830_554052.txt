txt Iv we may believe certain high authorities , it was once thought that poetry required peculiar natural powers ; such as are not given to all men , at least in the same measure . Tbe poet , in order to pass muster , was required to possess the highest attributes of mind and the best affections of the heart ; to have an eye wide and searching , quick to discern the magnificence and glory of nature , and able to look down into the depths of the soul . Beside the delicate sensibility which voluntary retirement could give him , he was expected to have an acquaintance with all the principles of human action , from the power which lifted and swayed the stormy passions of // the multitude , to the hair-spring which set in motion the wayward ambition of kings . But not to dwell on these easy generalities , it is enough to say , that the poet was the favorite creation of the imagination of the ancients . Their deities were hardly respectable in their character and pretensions ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dignity of evil spirits ; with more capacity of doing evil , and even less disposition to do good . The poet made the hero ; so that he had no rival in the admiration of men ; and this may account for the number and greatness of the qualifications required in those who aspired to the sacred name . For many years this imaginary heing has ceased to he found , and grave men have doubted , whether any such ever existed . Certainly , the impression that any peculiar powers are required for the production of poetry is completely done away . The time which Johnson prophesied , in no good humor , is conic in this country , if not in his own , when the cook warbles lyrics in the kitchen , and the thresher vociferates his dithyrambics in the barn . ' One of the first efforts of our forefathers was to destroy the monopoly of genius , and to impress upon their children the valuable truth , that man could do again whatever man had done . They entered the sacred ground of poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success beforehand , by establishing the principle , that praise was due to well-meant exertion . If an epitaph , an elegy , or even a hymn-book was called for , they considered it not a matter of choice , hut of duty , to supply the demand . Even the great epics of our country , in more modern times , were written with the same intrepidity . The writers saw that all other great nations had their distinguished poetical works , and they resolved that their own land should not be without them ; if no one else would write them , they would ; though they had little leisure for the labor , and for the art itself neither propensity nor vocation . From their time to the present , Mr Kettell will bear us witness , vast quantities of good merchantable poetry , of which his three volumes are only specimens , have been thrown into the market every year ; or rather , we should say , have been produced ; for some of the worthies of that collection little dreamed of being translated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern stars . The result of // making this business so common has been a great develope-. ment of mechanical skill . Very tolerable verse may now be made with very little expense of time and labor ; though there is reason to fear , that , in many cases , the workmanship covers the want of material . It is not long since an individual in one of our cities offered to supply the public with good verse , suited to any occasion , and at low prices ; but the domestic manufacture had become so common , that be found no encouragement in his profession . We are evidently approaching a state of independence , even beyond that con-. templated by the American system ; when not only our nation shall cease to be indebted to others , but every individual shall furnish his own supply ; and as all are pretty well satisfied with their exploits in verse , we rejoice in believing that every one will be supplied to his mind with poetry , which , if none of the best , is good enough for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are inclined to look upon the dark side , represent this as a sign of the temporary decline of the art . For they say , and , it must be confessed , with some show of reason , that the gods have made excellence the prize of labor ; and if the public are disposed to favor productions of the lighter kind , the fact , that excellence is no longer required , proves that the public taste is also declining . Neither is the success of the great poets of the present day any objection to this statement , because the labor spoken of is not required for single efforts , but in the preparation for great exertions . Thus it was by slow degrees , that Scott prepared himself for those works , which are now the wonder of the world ; it was not at once , that Moore became master of his miraculous versification and imagery ; and it was long before Mrs Hemans acquired that beautifnl power , which now appears , however lightly her hand passes over the strings . With all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction , that labor was essential to excellence and permanent success . Such is the opinion of sundry poetical skeptics ; and whether it is a sound and sensible doctrine , or only an antiquated prejudice , time will show , when the momentary fashion is passed away . One thing , however , is clear ; that those , who believe that no industry is required , fall into direct and servile imitation , and that not of the best models . For even to become sensible of the excellences of the great masters of the art , re // quires thought and study ; no man is struck , at the first glance , with the greatness of the Paradise Lost , any more than the power of one of Raffaelle 's pictures ; we do not choose such works for the entertainment of our leisure hours , till we have become familiar with their beauties ; and as such works are not so popular as those which are less admired , the judicious race of imitators choose a nearer way to applause , and copy the marvels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing in original writers , will not hear imitation by the ablest hand , and such are not the hands which usually engage in this employment ; so that the imitation , like Gothic architecture in our country , is more desperately Gothic than its original , and at last model and imitation are brought alike into contempt ; a fate , of which we have abundant illustration . We must not judge of excellence in this way . No man chooses the noblest sciences , the sublimest scenes , nor the greatest men , for the companions of leisure hours ; and it is but a mistaken gratitude to pronounce those who have best entertained us the greatest masters of the lyre . A great proportion of the poetry in our country is of this imitative kind . There is evidence enough , that it is not owing to want of genius , and we are inclined to ascribe it to a want of correct and strong ambition . No man here makes poetry a serious and engrossing pursuit ; and those who treat it merely as a graceful accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most familiar with ; and as , for the reason just given , the writers most admired are not always most read , it has come to pass , as once in Israel , that they go in by-paths , ' and the highways are deserted . Still we are confident , that the way of Milton and Pope , by which we mean the way of thoughtfulness , care , and labor , will triumph at last ; for we are convinced that there is a large body of cultivated men in our country , who , though no lovers of what bears the name of poetry at present , do yet take pleasure in reading our older writers and the truly excellent of the day ; who know that genius is as much a matter of cultivation as of nature ; who know that a taste for the beauty and grandeur of the visible world is formed by meditation , that acquaintance with the heart is not intuitive , and that power over hearts and souls is not to be acquired in an hour ; who therefore have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration , and will neither read // nor hear without first having some assurance , that the writer , who invites their attention , instead of relying on charms and spells , has deliberately prepared himself for one of the highest and most difficult , and , when successful , most glorious enterprises of the mind . Mr Sprague has secured the verdict of such men in his favor , and this is no light testimony to his merit . The occasion for which his longest poem was written , is one that assembles many persons who have no particular taste for poetry , but are disposed to listen and criticize it like any other intellectual exertion . Doubtless they are disposed to he pleased with what they hear , for want of candor is not the fault of our audiences ; but we think that the poet would hazard much , who should attempt to interest them hy the prevailing prettiness of the day . He is obliged to address himself to a manly good sense , and to that degree of cultivation in his own department , which men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful art . It was evidently with such impressions of his audience , that Mr Sprague prepared the poem before us ; and , as might he expected from his ability , he ensured perfect success . Many of those , who looked for no pleasure from verse , except its lulling sonnds , were amazed to hear from a poet so manly and business-like a production . We can not help thinking , that it would be well for our poets to have some such tribunal , from whose decisions they might learn the public taste , which is generally merciful in its judgments , and almost always just . If the poet writes for himself , it is hardly worth while to publish his works , and he may choose what style he will ; hut if he intends to amuse or instruct the public , he must conform to their taste , unless he can prove it widely distant from truth and nature . This , we apprehend , no one could do . Our audiences are at least as enlightened as those of ancient Greece ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell 's Gertrude , ' Moore 's iLVlelodies , ' Southey 's Roderick , ' Byron 's Corsair , ' and Mrs Hernans 's England 's Dead , ' would be listened to with enthusiastic delight . We have often thought , that , in all the fine arts , as well as fine writing , the object should be to gain the favor of refined minds , which have no intimate acquaintance with the particular art ; in other words , to aim at that simplicity which is universally and always pleasing . We do not believe that one of Allston 's pictures could pass unnoticed // by any educated man , who had the least attachment for the art , however unversed in the mysteries of light , shade , and proportions . And when we have seen the exquisite weariness of andiences , listening to music which was understood by none but the performers , not to speak of the contortions of such as were lashing themselves np to rapture , common humanity has tempted us to wish , that some means could be devised to check this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wailing of neglected poets , more in anger than in sorrow , over the perversion of public taste , would rejoice if a way was discovered to spare them that torture . We take the liberty to recommend to them to consult the public taste in one or two efforts ; and if they deserve success , we believe they will have no reason to regret the trial . Nothing can exceed the favor shown to poets in this country . Bryant , Halleck , and others have been read and praised with enthusiasm ; and if Percival had hut followed their judicious example , his fine imagination and remarkable power of language xvould have given him a place second to no other in the public regard . Mr Sprague has shown great good sense in this respect , and has accordingly met with uncommon favor . Though he has succeeded so well in theatrical addresses ,  --  and where Byron failed , it is no small praise to have succeeded ,  --  we can not wish to see any more of them . Such a stiff and ungainly service is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be so partial to his Shakspeare Ode , ' brilliant although it is , as to some other pieces of less pretension . WTe prefer the following lines on Art , ' which , we believe , were written for some public occasion . The circumstances are well selected and happily combined , and would give any reader the impression of true poetical power . When , from the sacred garden driven , Man fled before his Maker 's wrath , An angel left her place in heaven , And cross 'd the wanderer 's sunless path . T was Art ! sweet Art ! new radiance broke , Where her light foot flew o'er the ground ; And thus with seraph voice she spoke , " The curse a blessing shall be found . " She led him through the trackless wild , Where noontide sunbeam never blazed ; - // The thistle shrunk ,  --  the harvest smiled , And nature gladden 'd as she gazed . Earth 's thousand tribes of living things , At Art 's command to him are given ; The village grows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heaven . lIe rends the oak ,  --  and bids it ride , To guard the shores its beauty graced ; He smites the rock ,  --  upheaved in pride , See towers of strength , and domes of taste . Earth 's teeming caves their wealth reveal , Fire hears his banner on the wave , He bids the mortal poison heal , And leaps triumphant o'er the grave . He plucks the pearls that stud the deep , Admiring Beauty 's lap to fill ; lie breaks the stubborn marble 's sleep , And mocks his own Creator 's skill . With thoughts that swell his glowing soul , He bids the ore illume the page , And proudly scorning time 's control , Commerces with an unborn age . In fields of air he writes his name , And treads the chambers of the sky ; He reads the stars , and grasps the flame That quivers round the Throne on high . In war renown d , in peace sublime , He moves in greatness and in grace ; His power subduing space and time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The next quotation is part of an address to two swallows , which flew into a church window during divine service . It reminds us of the mild and thoughtful beauty of Bryant 's Lines to a Waterfowl , ' perhaps the finest of that popular po-. et 's writings . No subjects better display the talent of a mart of genius ; to give such interest to a trifle , and use it to suggest high and important instruction , though often attempted , is seldom so successfully done . Gay , guiltless pair , What seek ye from the fields of heaven * Ye have no need of prayer , Ye have no sins to be forgiven . // Why perch ye here , Where mortals to their Maker bend ? Can your pure spirits fear The God ye never could offend ? Ye never knew The crimes for which we come to weep ; Penance is not for you , Bless 'd wanderers of the upper deep . ' Mr Sprague is best known by his Poem delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Cambridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , labors under some disadvantages . He succeeds an orator , who has already engaged the attention of the audience with some high intellectual subject , for a time limited only by his own discretion ; and who , whether dull or able , may b* supposed to leave his hearers little disposed to listen to and other . Beside ) by an absurd and unexplained arrangement , those , who would secure places for these performances , are compelled to endure an hour or two of previous declamation , of the unmeaning kind in vogue in our public institutions . All these things are certainly against him ; and it is not easy to select a subject which will afford sufficient interest for the variety of hearers . Mr Sprague , however , not only added to the high reputation which he put at stake , but made himself known as the author of a poem , the high classical merit of which has established his poetical character . His subject is Curiosity , and we think it happily chosen ; if the subject is a matter of importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and various illustration . The beginning of the poem is well imagined to awaken curiosity ; but it was a bold experiment to hold the minds of his hearers so long in suspense , and but for the excellence of what succeeds , would hardly have been forgiven . The effect of this principle , in childhood , is thus beautifully described . In the pleased infant see its power expand , When first the coral fills his little hand ; Throned in his mother 's lap , it dries each tear , As her sweet legend falls upon his ear ; Next it assails him in his top 's strange hum , Breathes in his whistle , echoes in his drum ; Each gilded toy , that doting love bestows , He longs to break and every spring expose . // Placed by your hearth , with what delight he pores O'er the bright pages of his pictured stores ; How oft he steals upon your graver task , Of this to tell you and of that to ask ; And , when the waning hour to-bedward bids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winningly he pleads to gain you o'er , That he may read one little story more . ' p. 5 . Mr Sprague has taken advantage of this occasion , to lash many of the vices and follies of the times . His censure on the press is timely and powerful . We may endure to hear the prints of half the country praising The Course of Time , ' but their eulogies of the licentious and disgusting Pelham , ' deserve his severest sarcasm . The fierce and brutal violence of this mighty element , for a few years past , is enough to fill a thoughtful mind with dismay , when we reflect , that millions are daily drinking from these poisonous and polluted streams ; and we are glad that Mr Sprague has given us a bright side to this dark and hopeless picture , colored with his usual power . All are not such ? 0 no , there are , thank Heaven , A nobler troop to whom this trust is given ; Who , all unbribed , on freedom 's ramparts stand , Faithful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lifts the Press its arm abroad , To guide all-curious man along life 's road ; To cheer young genius , pity 's tear to start , In truth 's bold cause to rouse each fearless heart ; O'er male and female quacks to shake the rod , And scourge the unsexed thing that scorns her God . ' p. 12 . We give next the character of the miser , which reminds us of the characters of Pope . It would be well if such portraits were oftener held up to detestation in this country , where the power of gain being universal as the passion , and balanced by no other restraints than conscience and religion , which have hut little influence with the worshippers of Mammon , we are in some danger of mistaking avarice for a virtue , and the miser for a benefactor of mankind . Go , seek him out on yon dear Gotham 's walk , Where traffic 's venturers meet to trade and talk ; Where Mammon 's votaries bend , of each degree , The hard-eyed lender , and the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And shove the dupes who trusted them aside . How through the buzzing crowd he threads his way , To catch the flying rumors of the day ; To learn of changing stocks , of bargains crossed , Of breaking merchants , arid of cargoes lost ; The thousand ills that traffic 's walks invade , And give the heart-ach to the sons of trade . How cold he hearkens to some bankrupt 's wo , Nods his wise head , and cries ,  --  " I told you so ; The thriftless fellow lived beyond his means , He must buy brants ,  --  J make my folks eat beans ; " What cares he for the knave , the knave 's sad wife , The blighted prospects of an anxious life ? The kindly throbs that other men control , Ne'er melt the iron of the miser 's soul ; Through life 's dark road his sordid way he wends , An incarnation of fat dividends ; But when to death he sinks , ungrieved , unsung , Buoyed by the blessing of no mortal tongue ; No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round his place of rest , What shall that hallowed epitaph supplyThe universal wo when good men die ? Cold Curiosity shall linger there , To guess the wealth he leaves his tearless heir ; Perchance to wonder what must be his doom , in the far land that lies beyond the tomb ; Alas ! for him , if , in its awful plan , Heaven deal with him as he bath dealt with man . ' pp. 17 , 18 . There is one of the finest pictures we remember ever to have seen , of a family , the father of which is led by curiosity ' to visit foreign lands . The gloom of his mansion , the regrets of his wife and children , and the thoughtfulness with which he leans over the cradle , with his purpose nlmost shaken , are described with truth and feeling ; and powerfully wound up with a view of him , lying in the cabin of the homeward vessel , with the seal of death on his brow , till the short preparation is made for that most forlorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only room for the close . Cold in his cabin now , Death 's finger-mark is on his pallid brow ; No wife stood by , her patient watch to keep , To smile on him , then turn away to weep ; // Kind woman 's place rough mariners supplied , And shared the wanderer 's blessing when he died . Wrapped in the raiment that it lougmust wear , His body to the decl* they slowly hear ; Even there the spirit that I sing is true , The crew look on with sad , but curious view ; The setting sun flings round his farewell rays , O'er the broad ocean not a ripple plays ; How eloquent , how awful in its power , The silent lecture of death 's sabbath hour ; One voice that silence breaks ,  --  the prayer is said , And the last rite man pays to man is paid The l ) lashing waters mark his resting-place , And fold him round in one long , cold embrace ; Bright bubbles for a monient sparkle o'er , Then break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , countless fathoms down , he sinks to sleep , With all the nameless shapes that haunt the deep . ' pp. 24 , 25 . Mr Sprague 's language is simple and nervous , and his imagery brilliant and striking . Thor e is a spirit of pervading good sense in this poem , which shows that he gives poetry its right place in bis mind . Above all there is a lofty tone of thought , which indicates superiority to the affectations of the day . Notwithstandin0 the intimations conveyed in the close of this work , that the duties of his life are of no poetical character , we venture to hope , that some moral subject will again inspire him , and hazard nothing in predicting , that , in such an event , he will do honor to himself and the country.
