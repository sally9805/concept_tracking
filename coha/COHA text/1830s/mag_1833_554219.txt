txt The seventeenth century in English Literature is a period we love to dwell upon . There is nothing in any other nation to be compared with it . It is an age to study ; a vast Peruvian mine ; its riches are inexhaustible , because it is the Empire of THOUGHT . Gold became like iron , and silver like stones in the street . The whole aspect of the age is one of massy , ctimbrous , intellectual magnificence . Their intellectual enterprises , like their scale of architecture , were gigantic . Imrrlense buttresses propped the battlernented walls of their castles ; great oaken beams roofed their halls ; so , the very frame-work of their mental edifices , it would take the libraries of Europe to supply , and the giants of old to put together . The power of the English tongue was tried in every way . It blazes with magnificence ; subdues by its strength ; and charms by its surpassing simplicity . The native energies and original traits of the nation were tried and displayed in like manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good men . It was like the soil beneath a North American forest , when its bosom has been opened to the light in a clearing , and its accumulated mould of a thousand years upturned to the sun , and laid in rich furrows by the plough . The influence of Luther 's intellect abroad was acconipanied in England by peculiar commotions , both religious and civil , which dispelled the lethargy of the national mind , heaving it into surges from its most silent depths . Then arose men , whose names will be watchwords of glory to the human race . Among the host of venerated names that adorn the history of this period , if we should select five , as indicating perhaps the most original and powerful minds that England ever nourished , they would be these : - Dr . Henry More , John Milton , Shakspeare , Bacon , and John Bunyan . Of these , for origi* // nality of genius , Bunyan stands in the foremost rank . Compare his intellectual discipline with that of Shakspeare , and it will be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boast on the score of education , Shakspeare 's was immeasurably superior . Almost the only books Bunyan ever read ( at least before he wrote the Pilgrim 's Progress ) were the Bible , the Book of Martyrs , and two volumes , The Plain Man 's Pathway to Heaven , and The Practice of Piety , which formed the marriage portion of his wife . Of this latter book , composed by Bayley , Bishop of Bangor , more than fifty editions are said to have been published in the course of a hundred years . Bunyan , more than others , was a mind from the people . He worked his way out of the ignorance and vice by which he was surrounded , against much opposition , and with scarcely the slightest aid from any of his fellow creatures . His genius pursued a path dictated by his piety , and one that no other being in the world ever pursued before him . The light that first broke through his darkness was from Heaven . It found him , even that being who wrote the Pilgrim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost brutal . It shone before him , and with a single eye he followed it , till his native City of Destruction could no longer be seen in the distance , till his moral deformities fell from him , and his garments became purity and light . The Spirit of God was his teacher ; the very discipline of his intellect was a spiritual discipline ; the conflicts that his soul sustained with the Powers of Darkness were the very sources of his intellectual strength . Southey calls the experience of this man , in one stage of it , a burning and feverish enthusiasm . Cowper , in one of his letters to Lady Hesketh , after describing his own feelings , remarks , What I have written would appear like enthusiasm to many , for we are apt to give that name*to every warm affection of the mind in others , which we have not experienced in ourselves . ' We incline to think that Southey , with all his talent , is incapable of fully appreciating a character of such directness and originality as that of Bunyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . It would have been the truth , as well as the better philosophy , if he had said that the Spirit of God was preparing Bunyan , by that severe discipline , to send forth into the world the Pilgrim 's Progress . And when he was at length prepared for the task , then an overruling // Providence placed him , through the instrumentality of his own enemies ) in the prison of Bedford to accomplish it . Bunyan has given a powerful relation of his own religious experience , in a little work entitled Grace abounding to the Chief of Sinners . ' He says of it himself , I could have stepped into a style much higher than this , in which I have here dis. * coursed , and could have adorned all things more than here I have seemed to do : but I dare not . ' The Very extreme plainness of this work adds to its power . Never was the inward life of any being depicted with more vehement and burning language : it is an intensely vivid description of th' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervid imagination , convinced of guilt , and fully awake to all the dread realities of Eternity . In this work we behold not only the general discipline by which Bunyan attained that spiritual wisdom and experience exhibited in the Pilgrim 's Progress , but there are particular passages of it , in which we see the evident germs of that work of genius4 While Bunyan was in this state , ' says Mr. Southey , a translation of Luther 's Commentary on the Epistle to the GalaM tians fell into his hands , an old book , so tattered and thumb-worn , " that it was ready to fall piece from piece , if he did but turn it over . " Here , in the work of that passionate and mighty mind , he saw his own soul refiecte*Vlis in a glass . " I had but a little way perused it , " he says , " when I found my condition in his experience so largely and profoundly handled , as if his book had been written out of my heart . " And in later life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred this book of Martin Luther before all the books he had ever seen , ( the Bible alone excepted ) as fittest for a wounded conscience . Southey quotes a passage from one of Bunyan 's works , which he says is worthy of notice , because it is in Bishop Latimer 's vein . ' Those of our readers , who are familiar with the writings of Luther , will recognise in it a strong resem* blance to the manner of the great reformer . Of the work from which it is extracted , Southey says , No doubt it contains the substance of some of his sermons ; and to sermons in such a strain , however hearers might differ in taste and in opinions , there are none who would not listen . ' - They that will have Heaven must run for it , because the Devil , the Law , Sin , Death and Hell follow them . There is never a // poor soul that is going to Heaven , but the Devil , the Law , Sin , Death and Hell make after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roaring Lion , goeth about , seeking whom he may de* your . ' And I will assure you , the Devil is nimble ; he can run apace ; he is light of foot ; he hath overtaken many ; he hath turned up their heels , and hath given them an everlasting fall . Also the Law ! that can shoot a great way : have a care thou keep out of the reach of those great guns the Ten Commandments ! Hell also hath a wide mouth ; and can stretch itself farther than you a ; e aware of ! And as the Angel said to Lot , take heed , look not behind thee , neither tarry thou in all this plain , ( that is , any where between thi* and Heaven , ) lest thou be consumed , ' so say I to thee , take heed , tarry not , lest either the Devil , Hell , Death , or the fearful curses of the Law of God do overtake thee , and throw thee down in the midst of thy sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this were well considered , then thou , as well as I , wouldst say , they that will have Heaven must run for it . Bunyan always preached what he saw and felt , ' and so the character of his preaching varied with the aspect which Divine Truth , in the coloring of his personal hopes and fears , wore to his own soul . How he preached , when himself amidst the terrors of his own Pilgritn in the Valley of the Shadow of Death , may be gathered from his own mouth . This part of my work , ' says he , I fulfilled with great sense : for the terrors of the Law , and Guilt for my transgressions , lay heavy upon my conscience . I preached what I felt ,  --  what smartingly I did feel ,  --  even that under which my poor soul did groan and tremble to astonishment . Indeed I have been as one sent to them from the dead . I went myself in chains , to preach to them in chains ; and carried that fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware of . I can truly say , that when I have been to preach , I have gone full of Guilt and Terror even to the Pulpit door ; and there it hath been taken off , and I have been at liberty in my mind until I have done my work ; and then immediately , even before I could get down the Pulpit stairs , I have been as bad as I was before . Yet God carried me on ; but surely with a strong hand , for neither Guilt nor Hell could take me off my work . ' Bunyan 's features of character were naturally strong , and good , so far as unperverted . Yet if he had not been turned towards Heaven , he was likely to make a man of great wickedness . // Had he been pursuing his humble occupation when Matthew ) Peter , and John were upon earth , his was a character of such native elements , that he might perhaps have been chosen as one of their associates in the work of the primitive Gospel ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignorant men ; and Bunyan , though illiterate , was not ignorant ; no man is so who , believing with the heart in Him who is the Light of the world , beholds Spiritual Realities ' , and acts with reference to them . The fears , ' says Mr. Coleridge , in the Aids to Reflection , the hopes , the reniembrances , the anticipations , the inward and outward experience , the belief and the faith of a Christian , form of themselves a philosophy , and a sum of knowledge , which a life spent in the grove of Academus , or the painted porch , could not have attained or collected . ' Bunyan 's imagination was powerful enough , in connexion with his belief in God 's superintending Providence , to array his inward trials with a sensible shape , and external events with a light reflected from his own experience ; hopes and fears were friends and enemies ; acting in concert with these , all things he met with in the world were friends or enemies likewise , according as they aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one character , the Christian Soldier , realizing , in his own conflicts and conquests , the Progress of his own Pilgrim . Therefore his book is a perfect Reality in oneness as a whole , and in every page a book not of imagina ' tions and shadows , but of Realities experienced . To those who have never set out on this pilgrimage , nor encountered its dangers , it is interesting , as xvould be a book powerfully written of travels in an unknown , romantic land : Regarded as a work of original genius simply , without taking into view its spiritual meaning , it is a wonder to all , and can not cease to be . Though a book of personification and allegory , it enchants the simplest child , as powerfully , almost , as the story of Aladdin and his Lamp , or the adventures of Sindbad the Sailor , or the history of Robinson Crusoe himself . It is interesting to all , who have any taste for poetical beauty , in the same manner as Spenser 's Fairy Queen , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest we take in all that happens to the hero , Homer 's Odyssey . Yet its interest for the imagination is in reality the smallest part of its power ; and it will be pleasing to the imagination , // just *n proportion as the mind of the reader has been accus* tomed to interpret the things of this life by their connexion with another , and by the light that comes from that world to this . A reader who has not formed this habit , nor ever felt that he is a stranger and pilgrim in a world of temptations and snares , can see but half the beauty of such poetry as fills this work , because it can not make its appeal to his own experience ; for him there is nothing within ) that tells more certainly than any process of judg5ent or criticism , the truth and sweetness of the picture ; there is no reflection of its *images , nor interpretation of its meaning , in his own soul . The Christian , the actual Pilgrim , reads it with another eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to be exhibited by firelight the common reader sees it by day . To the Christian , it is a glorious transparency ; and the light that shines through it , and gives its incidents such life , its colors such depth , and the whole scene such a surpassing glory , is light from Eternity , the meaning of Heaven . We repeat it , therefore , as a truth which to us seems very evident , that the true beauty of the allegory in the Pilgrim 's Progress can only be felt by a religious mind . No one , indeed , can avoid admiring it The honest nature in the characters , their homely truth , the simplicity and good sense of the conversations , the beauty of the incidents , the sweetness of the scenery through which the reader is conducted , the purity of the language , The humorous vein , strong sense , *and simple style , To teach the gayest , make the gravest smile , all these things to the eye of the merest critic are beautiful , and he who loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . But such a reader , in respect to the veiled beauty of the allegory , is like a deaf man , to whom you speak of the sweetness of musical sounds . Of the faithfulness with which Bunyan has depicted the inward trials of the Christian conflict , of the depth and power of the appeal which that book makes to the Christian 's heart , of the accuracy and beauty of the map therein drawn of the dealings of the Spirit of God in leading the sinner from the City of Destruction to Mount Zion above , he knows and can conceive nothing . It is like Milton 's daughters reading aloud from his Hebrew Bible to the blind poet , while they could only pro* // nounce the words , but were ignorant of the sacred meaning , nor could divine the nature of the inspiration it excited in his soul . Little can such a reader see Of all that power Of prospect , whereof many thousands tell . And we might go on to express , in Wordsworth 's delightful poetry , what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian perusal of the Pilgrim 's Progress . The western sky did recompense us well With Grecian temple , minaret and bower ; And in one part , a minster with its tower Substantially expressed .  - -  Many a glorious pile Did we behold , fair sights , that might repay All disappointment ! and , as such , the eye Delighted in them ; but we felt , the while , We should forget them . The grove , the skybuilt temple , and the dome , Though clad in colors beautiful and pure , Find in the heart of man no natural home . The immortal mind craves objects that endure . Yes ! it is perfectly true , that no critical admiration of this work , overlooking its immortal meaning , sees any thing of its enduring beauty ; to look at it aright , we need a portion of the same spiritual faith by which it was inspired , by which only it can he explained . Who scoffs these sympathies , Makes mock of the Divinity within . In the light of eternity this book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of man 's temporal being and affections , as the soul of man is superior to the clod it inhabits . Whatever connects itself with man 's spiritual being , turns his attention to spiritual interests and realities , and rouses his ima*ination to take hold on eternity , for whose infinitude this divine faculty , whose range no power but the Being that created it can circumscribe , is so well adapted , possesses , the mere philosopher would say , a dignity and power , with which nothing else can be invested . Religion does this . In her range of contemplation there is truer and deeper poetry , than in the whole // world and all man 's being else . Dr. Johnson , in the Life of Wailer , advances the strange opinion , that devotion is not a fit subject for poetry , and , in his dogmatical way , dedicates some space to an enquiry why it is. so . Contemplative poetry , ' he says , or the intercourse between God and the human soul , can not be poetical . Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already in a higher state than poetry can confer . The essence of poetry is invention ; such invention as , by producing something unexpected , surprises and delights . The topics of devotion are few , and being few , are universally known ; but few as they are , they can be made no more ; they can receive no grace from novelty of sentiment , and very little from novelty of expression . ' In this sweeping style he proceeds with criticism that , notwithstanding our deference for his great intellect and name , might be shown on philosophical grounds to be as poor , as the assertions are authoritative . The very definition of poetry is a most degrading one ; and it is the only one to which the reasoning will at all apply ; the whole passage shows what a low estimation and false views the wits ' of the Augustan age ' of English literature possessed of the greatest of all intellectual subjects . It would not have been thought , that a being who could admire the Pilgrim 's Progress , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That book itself is a refutation of the sentiment quoted ; so is Cowper 's Task ; so is Blair 's Grave ; so is even George Herbert 's little volume of devotional poetry . And how can it be otherwise ? If man is not a mere creature of this world , if his vision is not restricted to the shadows that have closed around him , if he is connected with another , an eternal world , a world of higher intelligences , of angels , and archangels , and beings pure from sin ;  --  a world , where the Creator of this and of all worlds manifests his immediate presence , where the veil of flesh will no longer be held before the eye of the soul :  --  and if , by the revelation which God has made , and by communion with his Maker through Him who is the Way , the Truth , and the Life , man becomes acquainted by inward experience , and that faith , which is the soul 's spiritual vision , with the powers of that world to c6me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects of this world on which light from that world falls , and all man 's thoughts , affections , and movements in regard to that world , possess an interest and wear a glory , that makes them more appropriately // 457 the province of the poetical imagination , than any other subjects in the Universe . And the poetry of this world will rise in magnificence , in proportion as it borrows or reflects the light from that . From worlds not quickened by the sun , A portion of the gift is won ; An intermingling of Heaven 's pomp is spread On ground which British shepherds tread ! All truth , to the humble mind , is poetry ; spiritual truth is eminently so . We long to witness a better understanding of its sublime laws , an acknowledgrnen t of its great fountain , and a more worthy appreciation of its nature ;  --  to have it felt and acknowledged that there is poetry in this world , only because light from Heaven shines upon it , because it is full of hieroglyphics whose meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this world is only the habitation of his infancy , and possesses power to rouse his imagination only in proportion as it is invested with moral grandeur by his own wonderful destiny , and by the light reflected down upon it from the habitation of angels . All on earth is shadow ; all in Heaven is substance . Truly , as well as feelingly , did Burke exclaim , What shadows we are , and what shadows we pursue ! ' We are encompassed by shadows and flitting apparitions and semi-t*ansparencies , that wear the similitude of greatness , only because they are near us and interposed between our vision and the world of eternal reality and light . Man of the world , you know not what poetry is , till you know GOD , and can hail in every created thing the manifestation of omnipresent Deity ! Look at the highest creations of the art , and behold how they owe their power over the human soul to the presence of the idea of that Being , the thought of whom transfigures the movements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What is it that gives to Coleridge 's Hymn before Sunrise in the Vale of Chamouny ' the deep , unutterable sublimity , that awes the soul into worship , and suffuses the eye with swelling tears ? What , but the thought of Him , to whose praise that stupendous mountain with its sky-pointing peaks , and robe of silent cataracts , rises like a cloud of incense from the earth ? ' Motionless torrents ! silent cataracts ! Who made you glorious as the gates of Heaven VOL xxxvL-No. 79. 58 // Beneath the keen full moon ? Who bade , the sun Clothe you with rainbows ? Who , with living flowers Of loveliest blue , spread garlands at your feet ? God ! let the torrents , like a shout of nations , Answer ! and let the ice-plains echo God !

Lie can no more command attention to the sublimity of his situation , than Lot , hurried by the hand of the angel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could have stood to admire burning Sodom and Gomorrah . It was not amidst his distressing conflicts with the enemy , when it seemed as if his soul would be wrested from his body , that a thought of the Pilgrim 's Progress came in upon the author 's mind . It was when the Fiend had spread his dragon wings and fled forever , and the band came to him with leaves of the Tree of Life , and the presence of God gladdened him , and on the mountain summit light shone around him , and a blessed prospect stretched before him , with the Celestial City at its close , that that sweet vision rose upon his view . To the Pilgrim , looking back from a safe resting-place , all the way is fraught with poetical recollections and associations . His imagination now sees a spiritual life full of beauty . In the new light that shines upon him , he loves to retrace it again and again , and to lift his hands in grateful , speechless // wonder , at the unutterable goodness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleeping in the open air at Padan-Aram , and dreaming of Heaven : angels of God are ascending and descending continually before his sight . His are no longer the Blank misgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not realized , but the rejoicings of a weary Pilgrim , on whose forehead the mark of Heaven has been placed , and who sees close at hand his everlasting rest . Once within the Strait Gate , and in the holy confidence of being a Pilgrim hound from the City of De .. struction to the City of Immanuel , and all past circumstances of trial and danger , or of unexpected relief and security , wear a charmed aspect . Light from a better world shines upon them . Distance softens and lends enchantment to the view . Proof from experience as wells as warnings from above , shows how many dangerous places he has passed , how many concealed and malignant enemies were here and there lying in ambush around him , and in how many instances there were hair-breadth escapes from ruin . There were the Slough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wicket Gate , the Hill Difficulty , that pleasant Arbour , where he lost his roll of assurance , the Lions that so terrified him , when in the darkness of evening he could not see that they were chained ; there was that dark V*lley of the Shadow of Death , and that dread conflict with Apollyon before it . There were those fearful days and nights passed in the dungeon of the Castle of Giant Despair , and the joyful escape from his territories . There were the land Beulah , and the Delectable Mountains , and the Enchanted Ground , and all the glimpses of the Holy City , not dreamlike , but distinct and full of glory , breaking in upon the vision , to last , in the savor of them , ' for many days and nights of the blessed Pilgrimage ! Ingenious Dreamer , who could invest a life of such realities with a coloring so full of Heaven ? Who can wonder at the affectionate sympathy with which a heart like Cowper 's was wont to turn to thee ? And e'en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brown with sober gray , Revere the man , whose PILGRIM marks the road , And guides the PROGRESS of the soul of God . // D ' Israeli has well designated Bunyan as the Spenser of the people ; every one familiar with the Fairy Queen must acknowledge the truth of the description . If it were not apparently incongruous , we would call him , on another score , the spiritual Shakspeare of the world : for the accuracy and charm with which he has delineated the changes and progress of the spiritual life are not less exquisite , than that of Shakspeare in the Seven Ages and innumerable scenes of the human life . He is not less to be praised than Shakspeare , for the purity of his language and the natural simplicity of his style . It comes even nearer to the common diction of good conversation . Its idioms are genuine English in their most original state , unmingled with any external ornament , and of a beauty unborrowed from any foreign shades of expression . We know of but one word that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is one , the humorous appropriateness of which our readers , who remember the character of By-ends , who was for Religion in her silver slippers , will recognise in the following extract . Now I saw in my dream , that Christian and Hopeful forsook him , and kept their distance before him ; but one of them looking back , saw three men following Mr. By-ends ; and behold , as they came up with him , he made them a very low cong6e , and they also gave him a compliment . The men 's names were , Mr. Holdthe-world , Mr. Money-love , and Mr. Save-all ; men that Mr. By-ends had formerly been acquainted with ; for , in their minority they were school-fellows , and were taught by one Mr. Gripeman , a school-master in Love-gain , which is a market-town in the country of Coveting in the north . This school-master taught them the art of getting , either by violence , cozenage , flattery , lying , or by putting on a guise of religion ; and these four gentlemen had attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could each of them have kept such a school themselves . ' Of the best part of our language , Bunyan was a master : he became so in the study of the Bible . It was his book of all learning ; for years he studied it as for his life . No bewildered mariner , in a crazy bark , on an unknown sea , amidst sunken reefs and dangerous shallows , ever pondered his chart with half the earnestness . It was as if life or death depended on every time he opened it , and every line he read . The Scriptures were wonderful things ' to him . The fear of ' those sentences that stood against me , as sometimes I thought they // every one did ,  --  made me with careful heart and watchful eye , with great fearfulness , to turn over every leaf , and with much diligence , mixed with trembling , to consider every sentence with its natural force and latitude . ' Now would he leap into the bosom of that promise , that yet he feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would labor to take the word as God hath laid it down , without restraining the natural force of one syllable thereof . Oh ! what did I now see in that blessed sixth of John , " and him that comes to me , I will in no wise cast out . " - Oh , many a pull bath my heart had with Satan for that blessed sixth of John ! -A word ! a word ! to lean a weary soul upon , that it might not sink forevtE*r t was that I hunted for ! Yea , often , when I have been making to the promise , I have seen as if the Lord would refuse my soul forever : I was often as if I had run upon the pikes , and as if the Lord had thrust at me , to keep me from him , as with a flaming sword ! ' Here is the secret of his knowledge of the Bible ; and his intense study of the Bible is the secret of the purity of his English style . The fervor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a language as he learned from our common translation of the Scriptures , has produced some of the most admirable specimens in existence of the homely power and familiar beauty of the English tongue . There are passages even in the Grace Abounding , ' which , for homely fervidness and power of expression , might be placed side by side with any thing in the most admired authors , and not suffer in the comparison . As long as the Bible , in its present translation , is the property of all who read English , while the Pilgrim 's Progress is the book of the people , and the merit of Shakspeare rightly appreciated , we need not fear any great corruption in the English tongue . The allegorical image of a pilgrimage is beautifully adapted to express the dangers and hardships of the Christian life ; a pilgrimage , with a glorious city at its end , into which the weary hut faithful pilgrim shall be received to repose forever from his toils . Every thing connected with the idea is pleasant to b many beautiful the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of our readers will call to mind the one , beginning Jerusalem , my happy home ! ' The glories of the Celestial City , and the employments of its inhabitants , are the sources of many images in the Bible , and constitute much of // rApril , the poetry in the Apocalypse . And these images always had a powerful effect upon the inmost soul of Bunyan . Spenser remembered them not a little . The following beautiful stanzas from the Fairy Queen are a picture in miniature of the Pilgrim 's Progress . From thence far off he unto him did show A little path , that was both steep and long , Which to a goodly city led his view , Whose walls and towers were builded high and strong Of pearl and precious stone , that earthly tongue Can not describe , nor wit of man can tell ; Too high a ditty for my simple song ! The city of the great King hight it well , Wherein eternal peace and happiness doth dwell . As he thereon stood gazing , he might see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in gladsome company , And with great joy into that city wend , As commonly as friend does with his friend ; Whereat he wondered much , and gan enquire , What stately building durst so high exteild Her lofty towers into the starry sphere , And what unknowen nation there empeopled were . The poetry of the Bible was not less the source of Bunyan 's poetical power , than the study of the whole Scriptures was the source of his simplicity and purity of style . His heart was not only made new by the spirit of the Bible , but his whole intellectual being was penetrated and transfigured by its influence . He brought the spirit and power , gathered from so long and exclusive a communion with the prophets and apostles , to the composition of every page of the Pilgrim 's Progress . To the habit of mind thus induced , and the workings of an imagination thus disciplined , may be traced the simplicity of all his imagery , and the power of his personifications . The spirit of his work is Hebrew ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaiah in the character of his genius ; and as to the images in the sacred poets , he is lavish in the use of them in the most natural and unconscious manner possible ; his mind was imbued with them . He is indeed the only poet , whose genius was nourished entirely by the Bible . The following short extract would be enough without any // thing else to vindicate to him this title , and to show how he thought in Scripture imagery . Now I saw in my dream that by this time the Pilgrims were got over the Enchanted Ground , and entering into the country of Beulab , whose air was very sweet and pleasant , the way lying directly through it , they solaced themselves there for a season yea , here they heard continually the singing of birds , and saw every day the flowers appear in the earth , and heard the voice of the turtle in the land . In this country the sun shineth night and day ; wherefore , this was beyond the Valley of the Shadow of Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither could they from this place so much as see Doubting Castle . Here they were within sight of the City they were going to ; also here met them some of the inhabitants thereof for in this land the Shining Ones commonly walked , because it was upon the borders of Heaven . In this land also the contract between the bride and the bridegroom was renewed ; yea , here , " as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride , so doth their God rejoice over them . " ' A great characteristic of original genius , perhaps its greatest proof , and one which Bunyan possessed in common with Shakspeare , is its spontaneous exertion ; the evidence of having written without labor , and without the consciousness of doing any thing remarkable , or the ambitious aim of performing a great work . The thought how will this please ? ' has no power as a motive , nor is it ever suggested to such minds : the greatest efforts of genius seem as natural to it , as it is for common men to breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poetry of the Hebrews in its character , that any other human composition . He wrote from the impulse of his genius , sanctified and illuminated by a heavenly influence ; and its movements were as artless , as the movements of a little child left to play upon the green by itself ; ' as if , indeed , he had exerted no voluntary supervision whatever over its exercise . Every thing is as natural and unconstrained , as if there had been no other breather in this world but himself , no being to whose inspection the work he was producing could ever possibly be exhibited , and no rule or model with which it could ever be coin pared . We can imagine this suffering Christian and unconscious poet , in the gloom of his prison , solacing his mind with its own visions as they came in one after another , like heavenly // pictures to his imagination . They were so pleasant , that he could not but give them reality , and when he found how they accumulated , then first did the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then did he , with the pervading , informing , and transfusing power of genius , melt the materials and mould them into shape . He put the pictures into one grand allegory , with the meaning of Heaven shining over the whole , and a separate interest and beauty in every separate part . It is an allegory conducted with such symmetry and faithfulness , that it never tires in its examination , but discloses continually new meaning to the mind , and speaks to the heart of the Pilgrim volumes of mingled encouragement , warning and instruction . We know of no other work , in which we take a deeper sympathetic interest in all the circumstances of danger , trial , or happiness , befalling the hero . The honesty , integrity , open-heartedness , humor , simplicity , and deep sensibility of Christian 's character , make us love him : nor is there a character depicted in all English literature , that stands out to the mind in bolder truth and originality . There is a wonderful charm and truth to nature , in Christian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being is Christian on the Delectable Mountains , or in the land Beuiah , and Christian when he first set out on his Pilgrimage ! And yet , he is always the same being ; we recognise him at once . The change is not of the original features of his character , but a change into the character of the Lord of the Way , ' a gradual imbuing with his spirit , a change , in Paul 's expressive language , from glory to glory into the same image . ' In proportion as he arrives nearer the Celestial City , he shines brighter , his character unfolds in greater richness , he commands more veneration from us , without losing any of our affection . As we witness his steadily increasing lustre , we think of that beautiful Scripture image , the path of the just is as a shining light , that shineth brighter and brighter unto the Perfect Day . ' From being an unwary Pilgrim , just setting out , with all the rags of the City of Destruction about him , and the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , an experienced Christian ; with the robe given him by the Shining Ones shining brighter and brighter , and the roll of assurance becoming clearer , and faith growing stronger , and courage more confirmed and steady , and in broader and broader light Heaven reflec*ed // from his countenance . We go with him in his Pilgrimage all the way . We enter the Interpreter 's House ; we see all the rarities which the Lord of the Way keeps there for the entertaininent of the Pilgrims ; we turn aside from the rough path to go in the soft meadow ; we are overtaken by the storm ; we fall into Giant Despair 's Castle , we are there from Wednesday noon till Saturday night ; - there never was a poem , into which we entered so wholly , and with all the heart , and in such fervent love and believing assurance . All this admirable accuracy and beauty Bunyan wrought seemingly without design . It was not so much an exertion , a labor of his mind , as the promptings and wanderings at will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , but he did it . He was a child under the power and guidance of his genius , and with a child 's admiration he would look upon the creations , which his own imagination presented to his mind . Thus Bunyan went on , painting that narrow way , and the exquisite scenery each side of it , and the many characters crossing , appearing , and passing at a distance , and Christian and Hopeful on their way , and making every part of the picture , as he proceeded , harmonize with the whole , and yet add anew to its meaning , and all with as much quiet unconscious ease and simplicity , as an infant would put together its baby-house of cards , or as the frost on a winter 's night would draw a picture on the window . The minute passages of beauty in this work from beginning to end are so many , that we can scarcely make a selection . Of the rarities ' we saw at the house of the Interpreter , besides that terrible picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dream of the Judgment that one told to Christian affected our youthful imagination , and how the description of that venturous man that cut his way through the armed men , and won eternal glory , did ravish our heart . ' It is not a less stirring passage to us now . I saw also that the Interpreter took him again by the hand , and led him into a pleasant place , where was built a stately palace , beautiful to behold , at the sight of which Christian was greatly delighted ; he saw also , upon the top thereog certain persons walking , who were clothed all in gold . Then said Christian , may we go in thither ? Then the Interpreter took him , and led him up toward the door of the palace ; and behold , at the door stood a great compa // ny of men , as desirous to go in , but durst not . There also sat a man at a little distance from the door , at a table-side , with a book and his ink-horn before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter therein : he saw also that in the door-way stood many men in armor to keep it , being resolved to do to the men that would enter what hurt and mischief they could . Now was Christian somewhat in amaze ; at last , when every man started back for fear of the armed men , Christian saw a man of a very stout countenance come up to the man that sat there to write , saying , Set down my name , Sir ; the which when he had done , he saw the man draw his sword , and put a helmet upon his head , and rush toward the door upon the armed men , who laid upon him with deadly force ; but the man , not at all discouraged , fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely . So after he had received and given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out , he cut his way through them all , and pressed forward into the palace ; at which there was a pleasant voice heard from those that were within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palace , saying , , Come in , come in : Eternal Glory thou shalt win So he went in , and was clothed with such garments as they . Then Christian smiled , and said , I think verily I know the ' meaning of this . ' The comparison of Christian 's and Faithful 's experience is beautiful ; so is Faithful 's description of a bold fellow he met in the Valley of llumiliation ,  --  Shame . The character of Talkative , and the way they took to prove him , are excellent . Their passage through Vanity Fair , and the whole trial in that town , with the names of the jurors and judges , and the characteristic speeches of each , are admirably described . Tbe character of By-ends , and the humor and keen satire in the dialogue between By-ends , Money-love , Save-all , and Hold-the-world , are equally admirable . Then we may remember that pleasant River , . and the roughness of the road where it parted from that River , so that it made them not scrupulous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where that tempestuous night came on ; and though amidst the darkness they heard a voice sounding , Let thy feet be to the King 's highway , yet with all the effort they made , they could not that night regain it , but trespassed on Giant Despair 's grounds , and fell into his castle . It was a pleasant // thing to see the Pilgrims , when they had escaped the Giant , and got again to the King 's Highway , and so were safe , devising an inscription , to keep those that should come after from falling , as they did , into the hands of Giant Despair . Over this stile is the way to Doubting-Castle , which is kept by Giant Despair , who despiseth the King of the Celestial Country , and seeks to destroy his holy Pilgrims . ' On the Delectable Mountains , they saw some pleasant and admonitory sights . When the Shepherds unconsciously were telling Hopeful and Christian of Doubting-Castle and Giant Despair , Christian and Hopeful looked mneaningly on one another , and the tears gushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful incident , when , though they were hidden to look through the telescope at the Celestial City , in the distance , their hands so trembled at the remembrance of the dangers they had seen , that they could not hold the glass so as to discern it with any clearness . The dialogue between Hopeful and Christian on Little-Faith 's misfortunes is exceedingly characteristic and full of humor . The scenery , and the countries all the way that lie on both sides the path , are in perfect keeping with the whole allegory . So are the paths , that butt down , ' on the King 's highway , by which many enter , because the right way is too far round , not entering at the Wicket Gate , through which Christian , Faithful and Hopeful entered , after sore difficulLies encountered . The characters we meet here and there on the road , that have entered by such lanes and cross-paths , are equally in keepmg , and as they come successively under Christian 's observation , it is amusing to see the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed in his honest , plain dealing , rugged and humorous way . The conversation of Hopeful and Christian all along is truly delightful . It is as becometh saints ; grave , sincere , full of goodness and discrimination , with much cheerful pleasantry ; exhibiting Hopeful 's youthful inexperience and ardor , and Christian 's superior experience , richness of thought , frankness and kindness . They walk together so lovingly , so sympathizing , so faithful to each other , that all must acknowledge they are a perfect example of the brotherly kindness , be*oming the fellow-pilgrims of that Way . Between the first and second parts of the Pilgrim 's Pro*gress there is a diversity , that may be compared to that h8- // 468 April , tween the Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained . Milton 's genius , in his second effort , appeared not less than The excess of glory obscured . ' In the second part of Bunyan 's Work , we readily recognise , and are pleased to follow , the footsteps of that original genius , which has so delighted us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior ; there is more familiarity and humor , hut less poetry , and though there is the same vigorous delineation of character , the allegory is imperfect . We doubt if our readers ever happened on a more amusing account of a courtship than the following , which took place while the parties were at the House of the Interpreter . Now , by that these Pilgrims had been at this place a week , Mercy had a visiter , that pretended some good will unto her , and his name was Mr. Brisk , a man of some breeding , but a man that stuck very close to the world . So he came once or twice , or more , to Mercy , and offered love unto her . Now Mercy was of a fair countenance , and therefore the more alluring . Her mind also was to be always busying of herself in doing ; for when she had nothing to do for herseig she would be making of hose and garments for others , and would bestow them upon them that had need . And Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she made , seemed to be greatJy taken , for that he found her never idle . I will warrant her a good housewife , quoth he to himself . Mercy then revealed the business to the maidens that were of the house , and inquired of them concerning him , for they did know him better than she . So they told her that he was a very busy young man , and one that pretended to religion ; but was , as they feared , a stranger to the power of that which is good . Nay , then , said Mercy , I will look no more on him ; for I pur* pose never to have a clog to my soul . Prudence then replied that there needed no great matter of discouragement to be given him ; her continuing so as she had begun to do for the poor , would quickly cool his courage . So the next time he comes , he finds her at her old work , amaking of things for the poor . Then said he , What ! always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself or others . And what canst thee earn a-day ? quoth he . I do these things , said she , that I may be rich in good works , laying a good foundation for the time to come , that I may lay hold on eternal life . ' Why , pr'ythee , what doest thou with them ? said he . Clothe the naked , said she . // With that his countenance fell . So he forbore to come at her again ; and when he was asked the reason why , he said " that Mercy was a pretty lass , but troubled with ill conditions . " ' Southey has scarcely done justice to Bunyan 's rhymes , in quoting the doggerel which he wrote beneath the plates in the Book of Martyrs . Some snatches of melody in the second part of the Pilgrimage show the true poet . Christiana thought she heard , in*a grove a little way off on the right hand , a most curious melodious note , with words much like these : Through all my life thy favor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forevermore My dwelling place shall be . And , listening still , she thought she heard another answer it , say ing , For why ? the Lord our God is good ; His mercy is forever sure ; His truth at all times firmly stood , And shall from age to age endure . Prudence told her they were the country birds ; ' also they make the woods , and groves , and solitary places , places desirous to be in . ' Now as they were going along and talking , they espied a boy ibeding his father 's sheep . The boy was in very mean clothes , but of a fresh and well-favored countenance , and as he sat by himself he sung . Hark ! said Mr. Great-heart , to what the *shepherd 's boy saith . So they hearkened , and he said , He that is down needs fear no fall ; He that is low no pride ; He that is humble ever shall Have God to be his guide . I am content with what I have , Little be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crave , Because thou savest such . Fullness to such a burden is That go on Pilgrimage : here bitter , and hereafter bliss , Is best from age to age . Then said their guide , do you hear him ? I will dare to say , this boy lives a merrier life , and wears more of that herb called heart's-ease in his bosom , than he that is clad in silk and vel. * vet ! ' // Perhaps no other work could be named , which , admired by cultivated minds , has had at the same time such an ameliora-. ting effect on the lower classes in society , as the Pilgrim 's Pro-. congress . It is a book so full of native good sense , that no mind can read it without gaining in wisdom and vigor of judgment . What an amazing effect it must have produced in this way , on the mass of common minds brought under its power ! We can not compute the good it has thus accomplished on earth . it is one of the books , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always retains its hold on the heart , and exerts a double influence , when , at a graver age , and less under the despotism given to imagination in childhood , we read it with a serene and thoughtful perception of its meaning . how many children have become better citizens of the world through life , from the perusal of this book , almost in infancy ! And how many , through its instrumentality , may have been fitted after life to live forever ! The Christian Warfare is here arrayed in the glow of imagination to make it attractive . How many Pilgrims , in hours when perseverance was almost exhausted , and patience was yielding , and clouds and darkness were gathering , have felt a sudden return of animation and courage , from the remembrance of Christian* s severe conflicts , and his glorious entrance at last through the gates into the city ! As the work draws to its conclusion , the Poet 's soul seems to expand with the glory of the subject . The description of Christian 's and Hopeful 's entrance up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preceded by the touching account of their passing the River of Death , though composed of the simplest materials , and depicted in the simplest language , with Scripture imagery almost exclusively , constitutes one of the finest passages in English literature . The Shining Ones , and the beauty and glory of their conversation ; the Angels and their melodious notes ; the Pilgrims among them , in Heaven as it were before they came at it ; ' the city itself in view , and all the bells ringing for joy of their welcome ; the warm and joyful thoughts they had about their own dwelling there with such company , and that forever and ever ; * the letters of gold written over the gate ; the transfiguration of the men as they entered , and the raiment put on them , that shone like gold ; the harps and crowns given them , the harps to praise withal , and the crowns in token of honor ; * the bells in the city ringing again for joy ; the shout of welcome , ENTER YE // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves singing with a loud voice , BLESSING AND HONOR AND GLORY AND POWER BE UNTO HIM THAT SITTETH UPON THE THRONE , AND UNTO THE LAMB , FOREVER AND EVER ! Now just as the gates were opened to let in the men , I looked in after them , and behold , the city shone like the sun ; the streets also were paved with gold , and in them walked many men , with crowns upon their heads , palms in their hands , and golden harps to sing praises withal . There were also of them that had wings ; and they answered one another without intermission , saying , Holy , holy , holy is the Lord ! ' And after that they shut up the gates ; which , when I had seen , I wished myself among them . ' That CITY ! The genius of Martin fails to delineate its architectural splendors . Yet his is a magnificent engraving . Those mighty domes , piles far-stretching into dimness , city after city sinking at length into indistinguishable splendor , and lost in light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Heavenward raise Their practicable way . Come forth , ye drooping old men , look abroad , And see to what fair countries ye are bound ! In thinking of the Pilgrim 's Progress , and of Bunyan its author ; of his labors and sufferings , his sins , repentance , and forgiveness ; of the wave of happiness he has set in motion to roll on through time , and not be lost , but grow deeper and broader as it swells into the Ocean of Eternity ; and of the overruling Providence so remarkably exhibited in his life , we wish our readers to apply the remark of one , whose writings are a treasure of philosophical and spiritual wisdom , Henry More . The whole plot of the world being contrived by Infinite wisdom and goodness , we can not but surmise that the most sad representations are but a show , but the delight real to such as are not wicked and impious ; and that what the ignorant call evil in this Universe , is but as a shadowy stroke in a fair picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty of the one is more lively and express , and the melody of the other more pleasing and melting . In the Pilgrim 's Progress , there is a charming passage , // descriptive of the Pilgrim 's entertainment in the Palace Beautiful , which was thus : The Pilgrim they laid in a large upper chamber , whose window opened towards the sun-rising ; the name of the chamber was Peace ; where he slept till break of day , and then he awoke and sang . ' -A great and thoughtful Poet , who loves the flower as his own child , and sees a beauty in the ragged bur , ' has written a poem , with this sentence as its motto , which he has entitled Daybreak , ' and which closes with the following stanza. * How suddenly that straight and glittering shaft Shot thwart the Earth ! - In crown of living fire Up comes the Day ! - As if they , conscious , quaffed The sunny flood , hill , forest , city , spire , Laugh in the wakening light. - Go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou thy way ! And , pining Discontent , like them , expire ! Be called my chamber , PEACE , when ends the day ; And let me with the dawn , like PILGRIM , sing and pray !
