txt THE vast extent of our country has , in every point of view , been looked upon as a source of danger and alarm . It brings about , we are told , diversity of interests , and plants deep-rooted prejudices in the minds of the people . It prevents that intercourse which alone can establish kindness and esteem between the different States of the Union . It is unfavorable to literature , since there can be no mart of learning where men of letters and of leisure may meet and live together ; and it teaches the people to pay their allegiance to the State , rather than to the federal government . Without doubt , the boundless extent of our territory is the occasion of much inconvenience , and perhaps real injury . But it often happens that what is dreaded as a source of evil , proves , when probed to the bottom , to be the fountain of good ; and what is lamented as a certain element of national ruin , is really a mainspring of national greatness . We are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and sometimes throw ourselves into the arms of fear when we ought to recline in the lap of hope . Bad men never fail to seek , in interest , an apology for what their sense of duty revolts at , and to make their love of country a veil for their still greater love of self . It is thus that mighty revolutions have in all ages been built upon imaginary wrongs ; and what professes to be for the good of the people is really for the benefit of a few individuals . Restless spirits , who are fired with an ambition which they are unable to gratify , and soured with disappointments , of which they themselves have been the cause , are willing to convulse a whole people , so that they may have a chance of acting on the stage ; or despairing of being first in the councils of the nation , burn to break the bands that unite the people , if they can only be at the head of a single , a sovereign , and an independent State . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age or this country . As soon as the Constitution was proposed , and before it was adopted , they shot forth , rank and luxuriant , like weeds in a newly-ploughed garden . They have increased in numbers , and have distorted the Constitution into the most various shapes ; but , with all their zeal , they have touched no doctrine that was not already old , and propagated no principle that was not already condemned . They have left no means untried , no passion untouched or prejudice uninfluenced , to excite faction and discontent among the people . They have dwelt , especially , upon the extent of our country , and the rival interests of which it is the immediate cause . They have portrayed the sleepless avarice of one part , and the too patient suffering of another . // Whatever their motive may be , however high their object , or honorable their intentions , every word which they have uttered , and every step which they have taken , tend directly to one point - the severance of the Union . Strange that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gods , a dwelling-place , And every charm and grace hath mixed , Within the paradise she fixed , - There , man , enamored of distress , Shoeld mar it into wilderness , And trample , brute like , on each flower , That tasks not one laborious hour , Nor claims the culture of his hand , To bloom along the fairy land , But springs as to preclude his care , And sweetly woos him - but to spare ! Most of the republics that we read of in history , were small in population and limited in territory . When their bounds were stretched too far , they fell either into the hands of one man , or under the still more lawless sway of the rabble ; so that , from the misrule of the few and the tyranny of the many , they passed through all the ills of usurpation and anarchy . The notion has hence become common , that republics can flourish only in small tracts of country , and that the powers , with which it clothes the people , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and thinly peopled continent . But the example of the ancient republics did not serve as beacons to the framers of our Constitution , and can throw but little light on our course . It can not be too often observed , that they teach us what paths we should avoid , and do not point out those which we ought to pursue . The time was , when men feared that the federal government would be swallowed up by the daily increasing power of the States ; and that a doctrine , which most people declared to he unsound in theory , would soon be put extensively into practice . No one , however , can have been so deaf to what he hears , or so blind to what he sees , as to indulge at present in such antiquated notions . No one need be reminded that the tide of power has taken exactly an opposite direction . Is the federal government at the mercy of the States ? Is Congress at the foot of the people ? Is the executive a mere pageant , a shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame a system upon general reasoning , that will not prove different from what is expected ; - and so much mistaken are those who hope to reduce politics to a science , and who believe that time and experience will prove their notions of government as successful in practice as they have already fancied them beautiful in theory . Neither , on the other hand , is a large continent favorable to the schemes of selfish ambition or the establishment of individual // power . The people are scattered over a vast surface and can never be collected into one mass . They are not therefore so apt to be carried away by any single passion or sudden impulse , or so prone to fall under the sway of man . They view both men and things in various aspects ; what one State admires another condemns ; what one struggles to put up , another strives to pull down ; and thus a healthful difference of opinion is kept alive throughout the land . What would be , or rather what would not be the fate of this nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , were crowded into the walls of a large capital or even in the limits of a small republic ? Could any one bring himself to foresee the danger , the bloodshed and the tyranny that would ensue ? Would any one be so idle as to say then , that the French Revolution and the civil wars of Rome would never have a parallel in the history of America ? What would not he the force of power and patronage , the corruption of magistrates , the slavery of the people and the ruin of the state Large Capitals , though frequently the scene of anarchy have never been sound and constant friends of good order and true liberty . They have indeed usually been foremost to set up resistance to arbitrary power , but they are always hurried away by a whirlwind of passion ; and while they escape the evils of capricious misrule , run through the still more dreadful terrors of anarchy . They are for the most part stirred up by the artful intrigues , the pretended patriotism and vulgar eloquence of dangerous and designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left better than they found them . To pass by the slaughter with which the streets of Rome was daily drenched , I am not prepared to say that the Roman empire was less happy and prosperous under the dynasty of the Cresars , than was the republic , before it was torn to pieces by the wars of Marius and Sylla . Perhaps the English nation did not gain much by exchanging the exaggerated tyranny of Charles I. for the boasted liberty of the Commonwealth and the popular reign of Charles II . A.nd while every one knows that France was not made happy by passing through the orgies of a revolution and the arbitrary reign of the great Emperor , the impartial historian perhaps will say she was not freer under the rule of Louis Philippe , than she was under that of the Bourbons . Besides , it is well known that capitals , gathering as they do within their walls all the talents and corruption of the land , control the opinions and direct the movements of whole nations . Paris and London have only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow in their track . Men are too much disposed to take their opinions on trust and nothing can be more hurtful to the freedom of a people than that a country should be taught to look up to any particular individuals or even any particular // city for its sentiments , either in morals , politics or religion Fortunately for us , we have no overgrown metropolis that can hold such boundless sway , either for good er for evil , over the minds of the people . I do not mean to say that the people of the United States are free from influence . But while I can not deny that some men - taking advantage of their own popularity and the many defects in our otherwise perfect constitution - have estab lished an authority dangerous in its kind and still more so as regards the use which they have made of it , still II say that there is a large portion of the American people who think and act for themselves . A majority of them , I hope , follow the light of reason and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , there is yet freedom of opinion and freedom of speech to those who choose to exercise them , and if these precious privile*es have in any man ner or to any degree heen curtailed , that curtailment has sprung from other causes than the extent of our country . Indeed , this extent is a great barrier to the further progress of the evil , and we can only say that if the disease prevails so sensibly over so large a surface , how destructive would it not be , if narrowed down within the limits of a city or a small republic As the grandeur and permanence of our government must depend upon the intelligence of the people , it has been feared that this country is too wide spread and thinly peopled to stand the test of time and the rude shocks of party and of prejudice* But this , to use the cant language of the times -- language , however , which is not the less true because it is trite - is the age of im** provement ; and the spirit of enterprize is a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of any other . States and cities , that are apparently at a great distance from each other , are really very close together . Prejudices , that would oth. * erwise be deep rooted , are now almost eradicated by the great facility of intercourse . It is not too much to say that the communication between the different portions of the Union is as great and as easy as was that between the different parts of the Roman republic , during the da* n of its greatness , and before it had burst into the mid-day of its magnificence . There , is besides , in the very extent and situation of our country and in the value of its commerce , many causes that will bring this facility of communication to a still greater height of perfection and make the American people , in an emphatic sense of the word , a traveling people . Most of the rnerchandize that is brought into the United States is imported by the cities on the Atlantic seaboard . From these it is purchased in large quantities arid retailed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant then , in the whole valley of the Mississippi , and indeed in the whole of the inland , has to perform , periodically , his trip of business to the cities of the East . On the other hand , also , large supplies of the // staple produce of the most distant sections of the Union , find their way to the Atlantic markets , and indeed can find a vent only in them . This trade is not confined to any one city or State , but extends along the sea-board from New-York to New-Orleans . In the East , every gentleman is expected to know something of the lakes , the rivers , the mountains and the people of the West . On this side of the Alleghanies , there are few that are not acquainted , either from early recollections of the place of their birth , from recent visits , or from the information of others , with the opinions , the feelings and the manners of the people in the NewEngland and Atlantic States . A great deal of knowledge ( sometimes indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower classes by means of the press . At any rate , men of the most influence , those who guide the movements of the people and who hold in their hands the destinies of the nation , are not entirely ignorant of each other , and if they sometimes profess to labor under the vulgar prejudices that were formerly so much in vogue , it is not because they really entertain them , but because they desire to attain some end by means which , to say the least , are neither liberal nor reputable . The many works of internal improvement which are already completed , have sensibly diminished the jealousy and heart-burnings between the States , that so long and so unfortunately prevailed . The people are beginning to perceive virtues where they had only fancied the lowest meanness , and to afford another proof how quick are the gradations between acquaintance , kindness and esteem . And we may now , I think , safely affirm that neighboring States of the Union know more of each other than adjoining provinces of France or contiguous Counties in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with infinite contempt , those little men , who take a pride in keeping alive these petty prejudices . Such men have either a low ambition or narrow minds . Strange indeed is it that their patriotism is so intense that it can compass only the surface of a single State . And stranger still , that such narrow views should be regarded by anybody , as allied with the noble feelings of love of liberty and of country . It would be very easy to shew that there is no ground for any such prejudices . The interests of most of the States are different rather than rival interests . To prove the dependence of the various sections of the country upon one another , for their commerce and prosperity , I will take a very familiar instance , which perhaps will suggest itself to the mind of every one . If the mouth of the Mississippi were closed , or occupied by a foreign power , there would be no outlet for the produce of the western soil . Produce would fall in price , credit would be broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we should see revived that noble excite*nent and just indignation , which swelled every bosom // in Kentucky , and her younger sisters of the valley , when NewOrleans - contrary to the solemn faith of a public treaty - was closed in open day against them . The merchants of the east would suffer great loss in the sale of their goods and recovery of their debts . And thus , as if the nation were one regular and well-devised system , the malady that taints a particular part would infect and prostrate the whole body . Without denying that intelligence always goes hand in hand with commerce , I may he allowed to say that those employed in agriculture are usually more fixed in their abode and firm in their opinions . A large majority of the people either are or shortly will he engaged in this noblest of pursuits . The grandeur of the Roman republic was owing in a great degree to the respect in which agriculture was held for , from the tilling of the soil , spring the virtues of honesty , hospitality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they own land , than when they merely own money in it ; not only their interests , but their feelings also - which are sometimes more powerful even than interest - are closely linked with its welfare and prosperity . Our boundless domain , and the cheap prices at which the public lands are sold , put it into the power of every man to become a landholder ; and it is among the landholders that we must look , if not for the intelligence of the country , at least for honest intentions and sterling patriotism . But these advantages of extensive territory are trifling when compared with the real power which it gives us at home , and the respect which it inspires for us abroad . An attack may be made on one State , and it will be resisted , although not felt by another . It is true , that foreign prints and foreign travelers decry our government and our manners . But we are a great people , and they know it . Else , whence this torrent of abuse ? - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shewn that , although our right may for a time be disregarded , our power is yet dreaded on the other side of the great waters . W.
