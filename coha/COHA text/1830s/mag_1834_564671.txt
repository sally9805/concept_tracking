txt We regard this work as a valuable accession to our colonial history . It exhibits marks of laborious resiarch , and is written in a style of unaffected simplicity and clearness . It is not an ephemeral production , but , as we venture to assert , will long be regarded as an authority upon the historical points of which it treats . It conveys to us a lively and interesting picture of the pursuits and character of our ancestors ; it seems to take us back to the period , when the country was first settled , and to place before our eyes the men , who were at that time acting their brief part upon this remote stage of human affairs . Their great virtues , and their faults which were hardly less great , are set forth with a bold , but evidently with an impartial hand . Still , we have closed the book with a feeling that something is wanting . We are not satisfied . The minuteness of circumstantial detail , which is so delightful in the Memoirs of Oberlin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purify the heart , is here sought in vain . An Italian writer has said , that the biographers of great men should treat only of those points in which the great differ from common niortals . " Every man , " says he , " eats and drinks ; every man walks or rides . Every man too may have the duties of domestic life to perform . These things therefore may be omitted in the lives of distinguished men . " With this doctrine we can by no means agree . Indeed , we carry our dissent so far , as to believe that the most interesting and instructive memoirs , are those which dwell most upon common every-day incidents . We wish to know how great men act when called upon to perform duties , in which we every day see common men engaged . We wish to know their appearance , not only when amid the glare of public life , but also when shut tip in the privacy of domestic retirement . We wish to see how they acted on ordinary occasions , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence upon ourselves . It is for this reason , that the following letter is to us more interesting than almost any other in the work now before us . " For his worshipful , and his much honored , kind friend , Mr. John Winthrop , at Nameaug , these .

" If , however , the work is generally deficient in details , it is not the author 's fault . He has done all , that the scanty materials , which are yet in existence , allow . Instead of lamenting over what is wanting and what must be wanting , till time shall consent to restore the treasures which he has hoarded up in the inaccessible store.house of oblivion , we should receive with thankfulness the little which remains , and which our author has presented in so engaging a form . It may be interesting to our readers , to know that " Dr. Belknap designed to give to the life of Roger Williams a place in his American Biography , and he made application to several persons in Rhode-Island for materials , but without success . It was announced , a few years since , that Robert Southey , Esq . intended to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , for the same reason . The Rev. Mr. Greenwood , of Boston , form.d the design of preparing a memoir , at the suggestion , I believe , of Mr. Southey . Mr. Greenwood collected many valuable materials , but the failure of his health , and other causes , induced him to abandon the undertaking . " My attention was directed to the subject , in 1829 , by hearing the Rev. Dr. Sharp , of Boston , pronounce , with his usual eloquence and true love of freedon , a eulogiurn on the character of Roger Williams . I soon afterwards suggested to him , that the life of Mr. Williams ought to be better known . He urged me to undertake the office of biographer , and many other friends cbncurred in the request . I consented , having learned that Mr. Greenwood had resolved to relinquish the design . I made an application to him , however , to be informed of his real purposes . With the most generous politeness , he placed at my disposal all the materials which he had collected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copied from the originals , which were kindly lent to him by the Hon. Thomas L. Winthrop . These letters form a valuable part of this volume . " In my further search for information , I soon discovered , that many persons , well acquainted with our early history , knew very little of Roger Williams . In the hooks , I found almost every important fact , concerning him , stated differently . I was obliged to gather hints from disconnected documents , and to reconcile contradictory assertions ; and in fine , my labor often resembled that of the miner , who sifts large masses of sand , to obtain a few particles of gold . I have spared neither toil nor expense to obtain materials . I have endeavored to make the book as complete and accurate as possible . It has cost me much time , and a degree of labor , which no one can estimate , who has not been engaged in similar inves tigations . " Pref p. x . Besides containing all that can now be known of Roger Williams , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important events in Massachusetts and Rhode-Island , from the settlement of the Plymouth colony till the death of Williams , in 1683 . These accounts were perhaps necessary to the completeness of the work ; but they have much of the dry and uninteresting character , which belongs to all compends of history , and to none perhaps more than to those which relate the early incidents of our country . Still Roger Williams is an interesting man , even in the imperfect accounts which we have of him . Every letter which remains gives unerring indications of a re // markable mind . " They relate , " in the beautiful language of Prof. Knowles , " to politics , literature , agriculture , and various other topics , while religion is diffused , like a grateful fragrance , through them all . " He is never prosaical ; and the love of peace and liberty every-where shines out with a clear lustre . As an instance , take the following extract from a letter to the town of Providence , in 164S . " Worthy friends , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is no new thing . In all former ages , in all parts of the world , in these parts , and in our dear native country and mournful state of England , that either part or party is most right in his own eyes , his cause right , his carriage right , his arguments right , answers right , is as wofully and constantly true as the former . And experience tells us , that when the God of peace hath taken peace from the earth , one spark of action , word or carriage is too powerful to kindle such a fire as burns up towns , cities , armies , navies , nations and kingdoms . And since , dear friends , it is an honor for men to cease from strife ; since the life of love is sweet , and union is as strong as sweet ; and since you have been lately pleased to call me to some public service , and my soul hath been long musing how I might bring water to quench , and not oil or fuel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , by all those comforts of earth and heaven which a placable and peaceable spirit will bring to you , and by all those dreadful ilarms and warnings , either amongst ourselves , in deaths and sicknesses , or abroad in the raging calamities of the sword , death and pestilence ; I say humbly and earnestly beseech you to be willing to be pacifiable , willing to be reconcilable , willing to be sociable , and listen to the ( I hope not unreasonable ) motion following : To try out matters by disputes and writings , is sometimes endless ; to try out arguments by arms and swords , is cruel and merciless ; to trouble the state and Lords of England , is most unreasonable , most chargeable ; to trouble our neighbors of other colonies , seems neither safe nor honorable . Methinks , dear friends , the colony now looks with the torn face of two parties , and that the greater number of Portsmouth , with other loving friends adhering to them , appear as one grieved party ; the other three towns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This reminds one of the highly poetical and brilliant passages in the works of Jeremy Taylor . Nothing in the life of Roger Williams strikes us. more pleasantly , than the readiness with which he improved every opportunity of conferring benefits upon the people of Massachusetts . Notwithstanding that he had been most cruelly and unjustly persecuted by them , driven from their territories , and , in his own expressive language , " sorely tossed for one fourteen weeks , in a bitter winter season , not knowing what bread or bed did mean ; " -notwithstanding that the sentence of banishment was still upon him , and they would on no condition consent to receive him among them ; these aggravated injuries could not induce him to refuse to exercise his really great influence over the Indians in order to save his persecuting brethren from their hostility . In this point of view the history of his life holds him up as worthy of all commendation . His whole conduct towards them seems to have been dictated by the spirit of these words , which are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet the earth is the Lord 's and the fulness thereof . His infinite wisdom and pity be pleased to help you all , and all that desire to fear his name and tremble at his word in this country , to remember that we are all rejected of our native soil , and more to mind the many strong bands , with which we are all tied , than any particular distastes each against the other , and to remember that excellent precept , Prov. 25 , If thine enemy hunger , feed him , &amp;c. for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his bead , and Jehovah shall reward thee ; unto whose mercy and tender compassions I daily commend you , &amp;c. " // Literary Notices . Those who admire , as much as ourselves , the great epic poet of our father land will be pleased to see his name in the following letter ; and we are sure that they will be pleased by the manly style of Prof. Knowles 's remarks upon the subject . " It pleased the Lord to call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practise the Hebrew , the Greek , Latin , French and Dutch . The Secretary of the Council , ( Mr. Milton , ) for my Dutch I read him , read me many more languages . Grammar rules begin to be esteemed a tyranny . I taught two young gentlemen , a Parliament man 's sons , as we teach our children English , by phrases and constant talk , &amp;c . I have begun with mine own three boys , who labor besides ; others are coming to me . " Sir , I shall rejoice to receive a word of your healths , of the Indian wars , and to be ever yours , R. W. " Sir , I pray you seal and send the enclosed . " " Among other remarkable passages , in the foregoing letter , the allusion to Milton is not the least interesting . He was then the Secretary of the government , and in that office he honored the English name , by his eloquent writings in defenee of liberty . Mr. Williams was naturally attracted to a communion with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imbued with the same love of liberty , and alike free from selfish ends . Both encountered persecution , and endured poverty for their principles . They both acted in the same spirit of self-sacrifice for the good of others ; and Mr. Williams might have used , with equal truth and propriety , the magnanimous and almost triumphant language of Milton , in his sonnet on the loss of his sight , which was hastened by his intense application to his noble Defensio pro Populo Anglicano . I argue not Against Ifeaven 's hand or xviii , nor bate a jot Of heart or hope , but still bear up , and steer Right onward . ' " p. 264 . But we must be more sparing of our extracts . We can not , however , omit the titles of a series of books by Roger Williams and John Cotton . The former published a book on freedom of conscience , called " The Bloody Tenet ; " which was answered by the latter , in a book entitled " The Bloody Tenet washed , and made white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Williams again took up his pen and published a rejoinder , entitled , " The Bloody Tenet yet more Bloody , by Mr. Cotton 's endeavor to wash it white in the Blood of the Lamb , " &amp;c . We are particularly pleased with the clear and sensible manner in which Prof. Knowles has discussed the subject of these books . " Roger Williams , " he says , and we are proud to admit the truth , " is entitled to the honor of being the first writer , in modern times , who clearly maintained the absolute right of every m* n , to a full liberty in religious concernments. ' " his perseverance in the great cause of religious freedom is a prominent trait in his character . All that is known of the last days of this truly great and good man , is , " that he died , at some time between January 16 , 1682-3 , and May 10 , 1683 , " in the 84th year of his age . We can not better close this article than in the concluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his principles survive , and are destined to spread over the earth . The State which he founded is his monument . Her sons , when asked for a record of Roger Williams , may point to her history , unstained by a single act of persecution ; to her prosperity , her perfect freedom , her tranquil happiness , and may reply , in the spirit of the epitaph on the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren , in St. Paul 's Cathedral , tool around !
