txt I pray thee , let me bring thee where crabs grow . CALIBAN . A PAMPHLET of eighty octavo pages , bearing tIle above title , has lately fallen into our hands . Its author would have done well to have prefixed the motto of this article to his work , for in truth , crabs are not the worst fruit he invites the world to taste . We learn in the preface that a society exists in Boston , entitled the Oregon Colonization Society . What the numbers , the government , and the pecuniary means of its members are , the work does not inform us ; itis more explicit touching its object . The author honestly avows that the projectors of what he calls his plan , aim first at their own advantage , and secondly at the civilization and conversion of the Indians of Columbia river . He also candidly avows an ignorance , of which we were aware before , both of the matter in hand , and of the ordinary rules of English grammar . In a word , be acknowledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearsay . The other part of his confession was needless , unless as an apology for the manifest murders of the English language , which every page of the book records . In a former number of this Magazine , we gave some account of the difficulties and dangers which must attend a journey to Oregon by land . We were not then in possession of the pamphlet now before us , and were not , therefore , able to refute the El Dorada statements with which Mr. Kelly cheats himself and others , severally . Having at last learned the precise nature of the said statements , we propose to expose // their fallacy , in regular order ; not with a view to injure Mr. Kelley , or to disappoint his hopes , but because we conscientiously believe , nay , are certain , that his project is calculated to do our fellow citizens irreparable injury . Passing over an account of the extent , position , and boundaries of Oregon , we come to Mr. Kelley 's view of the Indian title . It seems that a Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of the Columbia river , in 1791 . This claim out of the question , the right of possession and occupancy belongs exclusively to the natives ; the rights of jurisdiction and pre-emption are assumed by the United States . Mr. Kelley clearly and explicitly avows his opinion that the Indian right can only be extinguished by fair purchase . Then follows a dissertation on the supposed right of sovereignty , which is defined in the following vague terms : " A supreme independent power , joined with wisdom and benevolence . It is directed and animated by the two latter , and ordained by the Author of all happiness , for the advantage and welfare of human ' society . Its principal object is to enforce the observance of the laws of nature . " Did Mr. Kelley take this definition from Vattel or Burlamaqui ? We have not been able to find it in either . From these premises Mr. Kelley infers 1st . " That nations shall live ( as required by the laws of nations ) in a friendly and mutually advantageous intercourse. 2d . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form ( or in ' other words , dictate to ) uncivilized nations , in matters of taste , inclination and habit . " Either of these doctrines seems to us a non seqvtitur . We do not see how Japan ( where Mr. Kelley proposes to sell grain ) is obliged to change her laws a ( ld open her ports to him . We do not see how the law of nature prescribes to the good men of Massachusetts a journey to Oregon , even for the philanthropic objects above mentioned . We next learn that John Jacob Astor , known as a fur trader , established a trading settlement on the Columbia in 1810 , and built two or three towns . This act Mr. Kelley assumes to have been an acquisition of the right of possession and occupancy . He is wrong altogether . What he calls towns were two or three clusters of log huts , much inferior to the pig-styes of Massachusetts in architectural pretension . They were , in short , designed and used for the purposes of the fur trade . Each settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the fur trade of that district could or can maintain . There are hundreds such in the Indian country , but the occupants do not consider the act of building them an acquisition of any new right . Mr. Astor never so considered it ; if he did , he would , also , now think his right perfect to alL the unoccupied territory in the United States , for his agents have built log huts all over it . We speak advisedly . So much for the flourishing towns of Oregon , which never existed , save in Mr. Kelley 's imagination . Mr. Kelley admits that the country through which the Columbia runs , is uneven . Lewis and Clark were not given to generalizing , but they make incessant mention of the high and rugged mountains they crossed on their way to and from the ocean . They do not speak of the " gentle ascents of the hills within two hundred miles of the sea // coast , " but say that the mountains are " high and rugged . " If it is doubted whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit , let the reader refer to the journal , from which Mr. Kelley professes to have taken his materials . To settle the point , Lewis and Clark say , that Wappatoo Island , and its valley , are " the only desirable situations for a settlement on the western side of the Rocky Mountains . " Here , on this very island , Mr. Kelley has fixed the site of his intended city , and here , also , are fixed seven distinct tribes of Multnomah Indians , amounting in all , according to Lewis and Clark , to three thousand six hundred and thirty persons , not to speak of five times as many more in the immediate vicinity . This valley is described , by the same authority , as being peculiarly valuable to these Indians on account of its vegetable productions , especially the Wappatoo root , which is not abundant in any other part of the country . It is , in fact , the staple of Indian subsistence during half the year , and all the other natives flock to Wappatoo Island to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are unfriendly to the whites . The consent of these savages must be obtained before Mr. Kelley can put his spade into the soil . We would ask those who confide in his promises , if it is likely that they , or the Oregon Colonization Society , or Mr. Kelley himself ; can command , or persuade , or bribe , the Multnomabs , who are the most numerous , the most warlike , and the most powerful , individually and collectively , of all the natives of Oregon , to leave their ancient home , and the only valuable part of their possessions . All these particulars Mr. Kelley very unjustifiably conceals from his flock ; at least , he says nothing of them in his pamphlet . How he can reconcile such conduct to his conscience , and what name it deserves , we leave to him and others to decide . The best construction we can put on his behavior is , to suppose his hallucination so strong as totally to obnubilate his faculties . The author proceeds to divide Oregon into four districts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken partly from the journal of Lewis and Clark , and partly from the boundless resources of his own invention . We will not say that he points out rivers , mountains , valleys , &amp;c. which do not exist , but we do say that he diminishes the height of those , and exaggerates the fertility of these , so that we scarcely know the old acquaintances to whom we were introduced by the original explorers of Oregon . We do not recognize the country so often described to us by those who have actually seen it . On the contrary , the new empire of Mr. Kelley only wants the trees of life and knowledge to equal the garden of Eden . The whole is illustrated by a map , drawn by the same able hand . We have said that the author has no authority for his statements , save the journal of Lewis and Clark . It is true that he speaks in several places of " concurrent testimonies , " but as he does not name them , it is likely that they are not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter the mouth of the Columbia ; and these , it is certain , are correct . They might have been copied from the log-book of any northwest-coast vessel . That the soil of some valleys of Oregon is good , and that the climate is not cold , we are sure ; Lewis and Clark say so , and we have other authority for the facts , which we can adduce , if required . At // the same time we affirm that the rapids of the river and its branches are more in number and more dangerous than Mr. Kelley is willing to admit . We affirm that the arable land is in small proportion to the sterile . We affirm that game was not over abundant in the year 1800 , and is much less so now . We say that Mr. Kelley knows nothing of the Columbia , or any other Indians . We affirm that he has perverted every fact he has touched , and in some instances has been guilty of downright misrepresentation . For example , he has suppressed the names of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at forty thousand ; less than half the reality . He has given them all a character which only belongs to a part . Let those who are interested read-read-read . Lewis and Clark have given the world an excellent text-book , and if they had not the invention of Mr. Kelley , they had , in recompense , a quality of which his pamphlet can not boasttruth . They described what they saw only . They said nothing ' upon hearsay , and never took the vagaries of imagination for realities . Hence it is that Mr. Kelley 's work differs from their journal in almost every point . We have said that Lewis and Clark state the number of Oregon Indians at eighty thousand . It is true that all these do not live on the Columbia , but they are all within striking distance of it . Lewis and Clark describe a part of them as unfriendly . Common report describes all the Indians of that coast as treacherous and hostile . The very name of a Northwest Indian is proverbial for cruelty . How many massacres have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Columbia ? Nay , it is but a few years since the crew of an American ship ( we believe it was the O'Cain ) were besieged a whole winter in Columbia river , and came off with some loss at last . And supposing that all the natives of Oregon should at first prove friendly , how long will they patiently endure the oppression which , we grieve to say It , the whites are sure to put in operation ? And if the natives should rise in arms , how will the whites recruit their failing numbers ? It is a long journey across the continent . Mr. Kelley holds out to his followers the prospect of a gainful fur trade , and says , that it is " vastly lucrative to those who pursue it . " This round assertion has no foundation in fact . Such men as Mr. Astor , and others , who supply the traders with goods and receive their furs in exchange , setting their own prices both ways , do , indeed , find the fur tra*1e lucrative . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , do . We affirm-contradict us who can-that Indian traders do not average the gains of industrious mechanics . We say that there is scarce one of them who will not give up his private trade for a clerkship in the service of the North-American Fur Company , with a salary of five hundred a year . The fur trade has been over-done , done to death , for twenty years ; especially in Oregon . Moreover , the Columbia river can not furnish fur enough to support five hundred persons , supposing one in every five to be the actual trader , and the rest his engag*s . Yea , more ; the business grows worse and worse every year . This is no dream , but the result of actual experience . As to what Mr. Kelley says of the affairs of the trade of the Hudson 's Bay Company , in Oregon , we reply that he speaks he knows not what . Our trade is , indeed , " on the wane , " in that quarter , not on account // of ' English opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will not inflict a dissertation on a subject so dry on our readers , but assure them , on the word of a bonafide Indian trader , that Mr. Kelley 's discourse on this topic is totally destitute of reason and knowledge . What he says of the fisheries of Oregon , may , for aught we know , be true ; every citizen of Massachusetts can see as far into the matter as our author , for the simple reason , that one knows as much as the other of the data . We are quite charmed with our author 's sentiments respecting the Indians , and recommend them to the attention of the Executive , and of Georgia . " Government , " he says , " ought to hold no sovereignty over the Indians , without doing them good . The settlers ought to consider them as their children . Indians may be made to acquire habits of industry and practise labor ! and even to seek intellectual improvement ! ! Let them be assisted in cultivating ground-let their children be educated in the common schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this is very fine* and shows that Mr. Kelley has a thorough knowledge of the Indian character . Pity he can not carry his philanthropy a little farther , and leave them a while  --  a little while longer , in the quiet enjoyment of their own . There is one way , indeed , and only one , to civilize Indians . It has been practised on the Cherokees . The rest of Mr. Kelley 's pamphlet , being mere speculation on the good that might arise from the execution of his project , we shall treat according to its merits , and turn to a second pamphlet by the same author , entitled Manual of the Oregon Expedition . " Price twelve and a half cents . In the fourth page of this brochure we are informed , that horses grow fat in the winter on Oregon prairie grass . What then ? So they will on Missouri grass , or St. Peter 's grass , or any other prairie grass . We have *vitnessed this phenomenon , this proof of the nutritive qualities of wild grass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superiority of Oregon soil , or the mildness of Oregon *vinters . A little lower , Mr. Kelley assures us. , that he is not mad , as has generally been supposed , and that he speaks what he believes to be truth . Our opinion of him is hereby improved in two particulars , though we can only reconcile them by two suppositions ,  --  that a man may repeat a tale of his own invention till he believes it to be true ,  --  and that what is not truth to one man , may be truth to another . Mr. Kelley next describes the resources of the country . Corn will grow there , he says ; and we do not doubt it . This he proposes to sell in Japan , and the ports of the East , forgetting that Japan is closed against him , and that grain is not merchantable in the East-Indies . He would sell the lumber of Oregon , too , in some ports where it is prohibited , and in others , where the market is already supplied ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former occasion . We are next treated to an address of the Oregon Colonization Society to Congress , which the petitioners had leave to withdraw ,  --  a fate which has attended several memorials of the same nature . We are then told how the proposed settlement will be effected , as soon as " it has consummated their title to the Indian lands . " The city is to occupy " five miles square , " and the valley of the Multnomah is " to be occupied for agricultural and manufacturing operations . " // " All the business of science and art " is to he introduced here . The lands are to be divided . We are happy to learn that the government will maintain peace with the parent country , though Mr. Kelley seems to doubt whether it will be subject to Congress or not . Encouragement is to be given to pious young men , and schools are to be established , into which red children will be admitted as well as white . No person will be allowed to join this hopeful undertaking , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may join is to pay twenty dollars beforehand . Then we have a fresh proof of Mr. Kelley 's benevolence for the Indians . He does not intend to oppress them , or take their lands without remunerating them ; 0 no ,  --  he intends to give each native family a back lot , of its own land , in the new town ! How liberal ! It appears , that the Society before mentioned are to raise a stock of two hundred thousand dollars , by loans and otherwise . Whoever will contribute a hundred dollars is to be entitled to one hundred and sixty acres of land in Oregon , &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c . We suppose tWat Mr. Kelley is to be governor of the new territory , or one of the head chiefs and beloved men , or at least , that he will be allowed to pocket as much of the before-mentioned stock as will remunerate him for his disinterested efforts in favor of the good people of New-England , and natives of Oregon . He ought , at least , to receive as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scheme , and which was , perhaps , once in his possession . On the strength of these wild , visionary prospects , we are told , that a great many respectable persons propose to start for Oregon , this Spring . If we are not misinformed , there is a body of men now on Long-Island , practising on gulls , in order to qualify themselves to shoot hereafter at buffaloes and beavers . These intend to follow the avocations of hunters . We can assure them , that the death of a gull , or even of a seal , will not enable them to load and fire at full speed , still less to trap beaver , which is a trade that requires as long an apprenticeship as mathematical instrument making . There is also a party at Cambridge , or Cambridgeport , who propose to follow the Missouri , strike across to the head waters of the Columbia , and descend the latter river . They are provided with a boat , which goes on wheels at the end of navigation , and with various other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other parties ; they may escape starvation , and the Indians . As for those who are to make the whole journey across the continent by land , with bag and baggage , we have before shown that they have undertaken an impossibility . We have reserved our most weighty reasons against the expedition till the last , and here they are . The right of pre-emption , or , of buying Indian lands , rests exclusively in the General Government . Even a sovereign and independent state can not buy a foot of land from the Indians . A bargain for lands , between Indians and individual whites , is expressly forbidden by a law of the United States . Our friends can not , therefore , acquire a legal title to lands in Oregon . If , in despite of the law , they , or their Magnus Apollo , Mr. Kelley , should make a purchase there , it will be null and void , in its very nature , and their lands will be at the // mercy of the first United States commissioner who shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have no intention to defraud the natives . Let them ask themselves , if any sum they or Mr. Kelley can raise , is a fair equivalent for the valley of the Multnomah ? We ask them , if the twelve or eighteen thousand inhabitants of that valley will be likely to think so ? Will what remains of two hundred thousand dollars , after the expenses of the expedition shall have been paid , suffice to furnish each native of that great valley with a single two-and-a-half-point blanket , not to say a gun ? If those natives should not be inclined to receive what they may offer , will they be willing or able to use compulsion ? If not , will they not have made their journey in vain ? Are they not , now , about to quit a certainty for an uncertainty ,  --  quitting a substance , to grasp at a shadow ? Let them read Lewis and Clark , and see how far they agree with Mr. Kelley . Do they go as hunters ? We will pass over the plain fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell them , that hunting and trapping on Indian lands are prohibited , in direct terms , by a law of the United States . It is , indeed , violated every day ,  --  the more shame on those whose bounden duty it is to put the laws in execution , and protect the savages . On the upper Mississippi , and the great lakes , no such iniquity is allowed ; but large armed bands of hunters leave St. Louis every year , and ravage the Missouri , and the country beyond the Rocky Mountains . It is a manifest wrong and injustice . It takes from the savages their means of subsistence . Yet it is done , before the eyes of the officers of government , on the Missouri , for which we hope to see them punished one day . However , these very hunters do not , at least not many of them , go so far as Oregon . Oregon is not a profitable hunting ground . Vide Lewis and Clark . Do our friends believe , that the officers of the Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do they not know , that Congress has repeatedly refused to aid or sanction their scheme , and that unless they obtain the sanction of Congress , they will become law-breakers , and amenable to the penalties in such cases made and provided ? Have they no reason to fear that the time will come , when Indians will be protected ? " Falsehood flies half round the globe , while Truth is putting on her sandals . " The fallacies of Mr. Kelley have been received as truth , by the whole country , and there is reason to fear that interference may come too late . We assure those of our fello*v-countrymen , who have thrown twenty dollars into this unlawful gambling speculation , that we have n6 lands to sell , either in Maine , or any where else ,  --  no , not a foot . We have no acquaintance with any of the persons in whom they trust ; we have no personal interest in detaining them . As we would call to those we might see approaching the verge of a precipice unwittingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis and Clark , and the intercourse laws.1 ' W. J. S.@@183068202.txt A NEWSPAPER should contain , first , the news of ' the day ; secondly , selected matter ; thirdly , original matter ; and lastly , advertisements . There are three ways in which a newspaper may attain popularity . The first of these is the most difficult and the most honorable . If you are conscious of superior talent and learning , and if you are not straitened for funds , you may try it ; not otherwise . Act with consistency , if not with principle , and admit nothing ordinary or common place into your columns . Employ none but able writers , and make it worth their while to put forth their strength . So shall you , in the long run , obtain many subscriptions and deserved celebrity . Few have succeeded in this course . The second way is to copy your news , verbatim , from other papers , as well as your tales , items , poetry , &amp;c . This is called the Saving Plan , because it saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear and tear of brains . I would recommend to most editors to adopt the Saving Plan . If you have killed a character , and the aggrieved person demands satisfaction , you may refer him to the editor who has deceived you . If you have given currency to some outrageous lie , you may throw the odium on its author , and join in the clamor against him . If a brother editor should offend in any sort , you may lend him a kick to help him down hill , declaim against abuses , and pronounce him " deserving the censure of the public , " without fear of a retort . The advantages of the Saving Plan are countless . No editor who adhered to it was ever caned , or taken by the nose , or convicted of bad grammar , or a libel , or ignorance , or a falsehood . The worst a Saving editor has to fear is the imputation of bad taste ; and if the charge be true , he can plead ,  --  and with justice ,  --  that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers . If he possess the least judgement , he will assuredly gain a reputation . s Advertiser , " said one of the editor 's admiring friends , " has been established fifty years , and has never had a bad line in it . " " True , " said a voi . iv 47 // bystander- " he has never written a line in it . " The text reached the pul ) lic ear ; the commentary never did . The third plan I shall call the Natural , because it has been adopted by nineteen editors out of twenty ; because it meets with almost universal acceptance ; and because , in most cases , it is really natural to editor and subscriber . A Natural editor has an excellent taste , a proof of which is , that literary young gentlemen write for him , gratis ; and his poetry and tales are always found in ladies ' scrap books . His opinions are always sound , because he adopts those of his subscribers . Aspiring apprentices and other self-taught geniuses speak of him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even to slips in grammar . No man is so open to conviction as your Natural editor , nor so ready to make amends when he has done amiss . If a correspondent has abused his neighbor in his columns , they are always open to a reply . No matter how clear a case may be ; he is willing to hear all that can be said about it . Every editor belongs to one of these classes , or is compounded of them . The Upright editor rarely remains long such ; it is next to an impossibility that he should succeed ; a Saving editor may ; a Natural editor must . The sympathies of the multitude are on his side . Ninetynine in a hundred think and feel as he does . The Upright editor needs no advice . The following remarks are for the benefit of the Savers and Naturals . Never have an opinion of your own . If you intend to criticise a book , wait till the North-American ,  --  or , what is better , one of the English reviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then venture to express your candid sentiments . Now that the Supreme Court has decided upon the Cherokee case , you may hazard the assumption that the laws of Georgia are unconstit*itional ; but not too positively , for there is no knowing what may turn up . If you have been publicly horsewhipped , tell the public that the liberty of the press has been invaded ; spare no clamor , especially if your enemy be unpopular . Let your paper be filled , mostly , with tales , legends , &amp;c . Their subjects should be love and war . Any literary young lady , or merchant 's clerk , can write them . If you can not get such assistance , you must write them yourself , for they must by no means be omitted . The matter is of little consequence ; the style is all . Let it be as inflated and verbose as possible . Take Hervey 's Meditations , or Maffit 's Pulpit Sketches , for your model ; or , what will be as much to the purpose , follow your natural bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they will compel their husbands to subscribe . Interlard your matter with Latin and Greek . A quotation has the same effect on a truism that a wig has on a British judge . If you are totally ignorant , as I take it for granted you are , the Dictionary of Quotations will answer your purpose . Latin gives great weight to a lie . Never be severe on an American author . With English ones you may be as severe , or , more properly , as abusive , as you please . Get connected with some line of stage-coaches , if possible . The drivers will distribute your paper gratis , and it will be on file in every // bar room . If you have any extra copies , I would advise you to drop them at tavern doors . It will give the appearance of a great circulation , and men can not so well detect your deficiencies when warmed with liquor . Judge of a work by the name of the author , rather than by its intrinsic merit . You need not scruple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other such enormous absurdity . But if Dr. M'Henry should ,  --  though even the supposition is scarcely admissible ,  --  . write a good novel , you must declare that it has no invention , plot , nor moral . Puff " the dear transplanted daffodil " on all occasions . If you are a Natural , it will be no more than brotherly love requires ; if you are upon the Saving principle , it will be an act of Christian charity . Besides , it will please the ladies and get your paper a reciprocal puff from all papers devoted to them . Never fail to praise the appearance of a volunteer company . There are many common places that will save the wear and tear of invention , such as , " The precision of their evolutions and the unanimity with which they handled their canteens would have done honor to veteran troops . " " Captain Guzzle proved , by the manner in which he did honor to the hospitality of his fellow citizens , that he was as much at home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will make friends of the whole corps , and get one or two subscribers . lf by any strange chance , you should feel some spasms of conscience , you may express your admiration in ambiguous terms ; as , " Europe never saw such troops . " " Had General Packenham displayed such tactics at New-Orleans , the result would have been more disastrous . " The persons thus noticed will not fail to interpret such oracular sayings in their own favor . To be considered somewhat of a gourmand will give you the air of a man of fashion , and excite the admiration of some people . Therefore , speak ofpattcsfracass6cs , coclion au lait and velours en bouteille , as if you had really grown fat on such delicacies . Take , for your example , the editor of the , who is a master in this line of humbug . Speak of great men in such terms as may be construed by them into expressions of respect , and by others into claims of intimacy . Thus , " Our old and esteemed friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known and loved from childhood , " &amp;c. &amp;c . If you are going round with a subscription list in a country town , cajole the clods by telling them that the established paper is ill-conducted , or that it is not exactly the thing wanted in the country . This will probably be true . You are not obliged to tell them , however , that you are no better than the person you wish to supplant , though you may be conscious of it . Let them find that out themselves ; there is nothing like experience . If you have received a blow that makes your heart ache , and which you can not return , stand upon your dignity and be silent . You may call this treating your enemy with the contempt he deserves . Naturals often injure themselves by doing otherwise . If people will not advertise in your columns , copy their advertisements from other papers , and send in your bill . It is ten to one they will pay it rather than quarrel with you ; and , if they dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you by a clerk or some other person . Many Naturals practise this with great success . Treat all great rogues respectfully . Speak of their villanies as " extreme measures to which they have been compelled by necessity . " Add thereto some wise saw , such as " Guilt lies principally in intention , " and " There is no estimating the strength of temptation till we are exposed to it . " In this way you will gain the reputation of a good feeling man . As for poor rogues , you may treat them as you please , provided it be not with too much lenity . The best of them , unquestionably , deserves the gallows . If the political iniquity you are endeavoring to promote be frustrated by a union of good men , cry " Corruption ! bargain ! ! coalition ! ! ! " Pet phrases are of very extensive utility , and make a deep impression on those who do not understand their meaning . If a military officer would be a common-council-man , you may defeat his object by calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned thanks to his fellowcitizens for a public demonstration of respect , call him a " dinner. - table orator , " and speak mysteriously of " barbacues . " Have as much original matter in your paper as you can . Put over each article , " Written for the - , " &amp;c . This will give a general idea of the estimation in which you are held . It is no matter what the quality , of the articles may be ; for no one , whose opinion is worth having , will ever read them . Take care bow you abuse any private individual . Public characters , provided you have nothing to expect from them or their parties , are fair game . You need not care what the quality of your censure or praise be , but let there be a sufficient quantity . Lay it on thick ; some of it will stick . There are several kinds of persons who may be abused , but it is most safe to abuse a truly good and great man . It is ten to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , he will suffer your insignificance to be your protection . Whatever you say of bim , repeat it often . Repetition makes many a fable pass for truth . Speak respectfully of poets . They are veritably an irritable race . The truly good ones care little for criticism ; but the bad ones feel it to the quick , because they are conscious of deserving it . Then , they all make common cause . Their own enmity would be of little consequence , but they have friends and admirers ; so true it is , that let a man be never so foolish , he will still find greater fools than himself . I need not tell you , that , among these will be some of your subscribers . It is a pleasure , indeed , to demolish a poet , but it is a dear pleasure at ten or twenty dollars . You may laugh at honor , scoff at honesty , and revile religion , but never call any native author a dunce . It may be that he is so ; and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dunces in the country , each of whom feels your remark as a personal reflection . Publish an exaggerated account of your subscription list , monthly . Mankind are prone to imitation . If you can make men believe that you have a thousand subscribers , you will soon get a thousand more . Instruct your carriers to drop your papers at the doors of those who are none of your subscribers , If they take it in , they will probably // continue to receive it from habit . Few will refuse it when it is thus left ; gratuitously , as they suppose . If they order it to be stopped , you can compel them to pay for what they have received ; for such is the law , and law is only another word for justice . Fail not to insert in your columns all the bloody murders and executions you can find . Sympathy with the criminals and sufferers will increase the length of your subscription list . The gallows is what all may , and some must , come to . Never spare a critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to the benefit of courtesy . Besides , they can not complain of being treated as they treat others . What is more to your purpose , they have no friends , and they are not quite so impudent as poets . They seldom defend themselves . Therefore , show them no mercy . Copy largely from the editorial departments of your brethren . It will please them , because it looks as if you respected their opinions , and they will reciprocate the compliment . They will take your part if you get yourself into trouble , and speak of you as a worthy citizen and a man of sound judgement . Their compliments may not be worth a straw , singly , but the aggregate will establish your reputation . I have seen many a Natural thus complimented , till the public thought him somebody ; nay , till he thought himself somebody . Naturals are commonly indifferent in their class . Savers can not heip being so ; it is the essence of their principle . In either case , a respectable subscription list may be got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a Natural may go far beyond this . Mr. Bourgeois , the editor of the - - - , can not write an English paragraph , if it would save his life . He never had the presumption even to think of any other language as of a thing within his reach . He knows poetry from prose only by the capitals , with which the lines begin . One of his devils dictates to him in politics , and another in criticism . Two ideas he has , and only two ; one of insolence , and the other of self-preservation by flight or apology . Some think that this last is mere instinct . However that may be , whenever his two ideas cross each other in his brain , he complains of the headache . Meeting a mule the other day , he pulled off his hat and bade him good morning ; and he did right , for it is written that brothers should dwell together in unity , and why not half-brothers * In short , Mr. Bourgeois 's stupidity is so gloriously unique that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , his paper has a large , a very large circulation , and he is , consequently . rich . The reason of his success is , simply , that he is unique . He has , accidentally , ( no one ever suspected him of design ) struck the key-note of success . Experience has shown him that there is a class who can relish such of his writings as may be on a level with their understandings , and who will take what is below it ( for his editorial matter mystifies them not a little ) on trust . Any thing out of the common way takes now-a-days . Go , my dear Naturals , and follow the road I have pointed out . I have no doubt that you will find it easy . If you have any original ideas , husband them with the strictest economy . It is truly astonishing how soon such a stock may be exhausted . Many a man is a very agreeable companion for half an hour , and // very much the reverse all the rest of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strength that might have made him tolerable , if it had been properly managed , for three or four hours . Shun such a man as you would a pestilence . If you have as many thoughts as will last a year , you xviii do well enough . By the end of it , the ideas first hung out will have been sufficieiitly aired , and may be used again without much risk of recognition . I once took a paper , conducted on the natural plan , for three years ; solely for the sake of three or four new ideas in each number . A t last , the reservoir gave out , and my old friends appeared again in new dresses . One of them was cuffed and banged with the cloth of Lord Bolingbroke , and another was skirted with stuff of a color different from that of the rest of the coat . Their disguises amused me for a while , and I believe they passed with most folks for as good as new . If you can , by any means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talent resort , you will need no capital of your own . Listen to them attentively , and pick up the crumbs of conversation . If you have a bad memory , you can note them down . You can bring out what you have heard , in a few days , as your own , and after the ideas have passed through your hands , it is not likely that their parents will know them again . If they should , they will probably be ashamed to claim them . I have known several Naturals to get the name of very pretty scholars and wits in this way . If a brother editor should copy any of your paragraphs without giving you credit , s&amp;ize on the circumstance as a godsend . Complain bitterly of the loss you have suffered , and accuse your brother roundly 4 theft . Swear , with old Sir John , that you have lost " two or three bonds of forty pound apiece and a seal ring of your grandfather 's . " The more noise you make the better . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value your goods , and , consequently , you . This piece of art is often practised with great success . You will sometimes find yourself under the necessity of stealing . In such cases , never steal from a brother Natural . Every Natural is on the look-out for literary larceners , and you will certainly be detected . Steal from an Upright editor . He can afford you an alms . Moreover , it is likely that he will never discover your depredation ; and , if he should , he will not notice it . Guard those ideas , which are truly your own , carefully . If , in copying a piece of intelligence , you find it expedient to affix an editorial paragraph of thrce lines , subscribe it with an abbreviation of the name of your paper . If your paper be called " The Rushlight , " for example , subscribe your editorials thus , Rush. * ' This will identify your property , and at the same time figuratively express its value . Too much can not be said touching the renovation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would earnestly recommend to you an extensive course of stall reading . The old , forgotten English authors will furnish you with thoughts ad libiturn ; nay , with whole paragraphs . Six years ago Burton 's Anatomy of Melancholy was the comforter of distressed editors , but it is now too hackneyed to venture upon . St. Evremond , however , and Davenant remain almost entire . Beaumont and Fletcher and Ben Johnson will supply all your poetry . // Old sermons will serve you better than learning and genius could . Nobody reads them , and you may extract their pith without the least scruple . Beware , however , of Tillotson and Blair . If any poetical youth or miss should send you a contribution , publish it by all means . If it be wretchedly bad , you can say that " Notwithstanding its manifold faults , it is evident that the writer can do better if he will . " Thus you will not commit yourself* for it is your duty to encourage native talent . If a foreigner should publish his travels in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of our laws , manners , customs , &amp;c. abuse him beyond measure . If you can not get over his statements , say , it is clear that he does not understand our social principles . Basil Hall was a mine of wealth to our Naturals , because they could say whatever they pleased of him , without violating the truth . So excellent a but is not to be found every day . Speaking of a popular orator , say that he reminds you of the best days of Rome and Athens . Though you may never have read a line of Cicero or Demosthenes , it will appear , by implication , that you have . Insert deaths , and especially marriages . Publish an abstract of the latest fashions in every number . You can get it from La Belle Assembke . Strive to please the women , and you need not care about the men . If you wish to get a character for independence , attack some work on a subject that interests nobody but its author . You may demolish such a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , our duty to the public compels us to say that we think Mr.-wrong in his premises , discursive in his logic , and hasty in his conclusion . " You will thus prove yourself one who does not fear to express his opinion . Last , but not least-remember that the sole end of your creation is to eat , drink , and make money . In order to fulfil it , you must forget that you are an individual , and consider yourself as the representative of your subscribers , and those who are likely to be your subscribers , in every thing . You must have no thought , no feeling , no apparent interest but theirs ; at least you must make them think you have no other . If you observe the directions here laid down , they will probably send you to the General Court , and your ghost will laugh when it reads the lie on your grave-stone.
