txt THE Prince of Benevento , who is more commonly called Talleyrand , has said that an American village is a practical analysis of the origin of states and empires . Men meet there in perfect independence , and , entering into the social compact , reserve all their natural rights , with the slight deduction that is necessary to cement the social fabric . Talleyrand 's figure has , however , a better application in Illinois than in Massachusetts , v*ihere the social system has been long established . A New-England village ( thus a township may be called , as a village is its head ) is a more perfect democracy than ever existed at Athens ; no member has greater privileges than another , and if he has more estimation or influence than another , it comes from superior prudence , knowledge , or usefulness , which things have weight even in the savage state . In all communities that were ever known , there is this sort of aristocracy , not defined or acknowledged by law , but yet certain and inevitable in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that denote the body of the people as well as the persons of the magistrates ; for what are the Selectmen , those grave , conscript fathers , but individuals chosen , as their title indicates , from their equals , the mass of the inhabitants ? Their tenure of office is but slender , and even if they do well , the electing sovereigns will not uphold them long in their high places , lest honors and power should inflate them , and raise them in their own estimation above their peers . There is , indeed , only one dignitary in a village whom men will call master , ( though custom has sanctioned greater abuses ; ) this is the learned man who administers the birch , and presides over the school . In some sort he is a master ; and one of his class has said that he is ruler in the parish . " I rule the // boys , " said he ; " they lead the mothers , and these govern their husbands . " Qui regit per alium regit per Se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Dyonisius of the school-house to inflict punishment on his temporary subjects ; the Magister must do more by flattery than flogging ; it is a free country , and stripes are for slaves . If little TQinmy is gently scourged for lying , he has the satisfaction of seeing the torment retorted in another and a less tolerable shape upon the pedagogue . The mothers make common cause , for the darling of each one is liable to this tyranny ; and the schoolmaster now finds that the wives may persuade , if they do not govern the husbands . It clamor , a clamor arises , the cause is investigated , the testimony of the flogged is trusted , and the master dismissed as an unfeeling and barbarous savage , who knocks his scholars down , or flays them alive . If the master is so gentle or so shrewd , that he will find some substitute for punishment , he may get along well , as the phrase is , though his scholars do not ; he has only to say to all parents , that their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need no proof , and he will want no friends . But confinement of a boy in school is worse than imprisonment for debt ; it is a bad system , that ha* come down from the dark ages ; it is a remnant of monastic discipline , that unhappily survived the reformation . Who , when he becomes a man , can endure Horace , and Virgil , till he has forgotten where and how he made their acquaintance ' ? It is inhuman , and it should be felonious , to inflict upon a joyous boy this direful impressment ; to compel the reluctant urchin to leave the sun and sky , the rustling leaf and nodding flower , the waving wood and the babbling brook , for the dungeon of a school-room ; the Bastile , the Black Hole of letters , where he must fix his eyes upon strange characters that dance before them , while his thoughts are wandering where the winds are blowing and the birds are singing . It is a pleasure for a hypochondriac to see the dismissal of a school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy . Whence arises it ? There is no actual good before the poor children , that they should exult-there is only the negative , or the relief from the depression of soul and spirits which comes from confinement and tasks , that may , indeed , be tolerable , but is always irksome . The very curs of a neighborhood sympathize in joy with the prisoners released ; and Burns 's Caesar was but a representative of his race , when he rejoiced so much in the gambols of the children . My heart has been so fain to see them , That I for joy has barkit wi ' em . It is a thousand pities that knowledge is not inherent in us like instinct , and that a boy should not have as much appetite for his lesson , as for his supper . Some philosophers , indeed , have blended the two principles , as in Scriblerus ; and a few boys , like bookworms , have eaten their way to science ; but these are favored beings-pauci quos equns amavit Jupiter . This is traveling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . But to study , before we can comprehend knowledge , to commit things to the memory , that can not be held by the understanding , to struggle in the hedge , before we can // see the garden on the other side , this is so great a price to pay for knowledge , that boys have but ' too much excuse for preferring ignorance . Yet , after a lapse of time , there is pleasure in the remembrance ; we forget the struggles of reason against grammar , and the reluctance of the imagination to associate with the mathematics . We forget the lesson , the recitation , and the rod , and remember only our comrades . Of a few , as Johnson says , " thus presented to my mind , let me indulge the remembrance . " The master , that tall and lank young man , that bent forward like a bow , is , after the lapse of twenty years , no less than Judge of Probate , and he has flocks enough to stock the pastures of a patriarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his honors and his mutton have made him so capacious in front , that he must of necessity throw his head and shoulders back , to balance the ponderous weight before . Doubtless Falstaff was as straight as a wand , if not so slender . He was so upright that be bent backwards , and c*ild not see his own knee . Even so it is with Judge Gobbleton : he tears a queue ; and , though it hangs down as straight as a mason 's plumb , it touches neither back nor shoulder . Of the scholars , few " have grown so great " as the master , in person , honors or estate . The prettiest girl in the school , and she was truly a gentle spirit , is in that worst abode of misery , , the poor-house . Four years have of an angel made a demon . Her husband fell beneath the subtle enemy , which it is the end of Temperance Societies to resist ; but this is a common occurrence ; were it not , society would rise as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be introduced , as the Banque from the east , that would debase and extinguish the mind before it destroys the body , no penalty would be thought too severe for vending it ; no precautions too great for obstructing the course of its ravages . But familiarity reduces our estimate of moral evils , as well as of personal dangers . So did it with the poor girl . There is none but one from the dead , who could describe the wrestling of her husband with his demon , before he lay down a quiet and unresisting victim . But both fell ; though for a while she was a picture of care , and no means that tenderness could devise were omitted by the wife to reclaim the husband . By degrees she began to reconcile herself to necessity , and , perhaps , to believe that what she so constantly saw in one well beloved , was less evil than it appeared before it had invaded the sanctuary of her home . Perhaps she was so shamed by the fall of him who should have protected her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own eyes from Hubert 's irons , that desperation led her to the same precipice ; but however it was , she is at this moment , ( for this is no idle tale , or uncommon thing , ) as much degraded as intemperance and vice can make her . Another " pride of the village " has had better fortunes ; she has not , indeed , escaped care , but she has avoided stain . It was the first time that I was fully sensible how much time had changed my own features , when I saw in her 's , how the dimples were converted to wrinkles . But the eye was bright , and the spirit unchanged . If , as Dante supposes , our form and features shall be moulded , in the higher world , from our affections here , and that the good will be beautiful , she will be of surpassing beauty . // Of the boys , there were two who were cronies inseparable . They were seldom found over a book from choice , nor was it ever needful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always sufficiently inclined . When an unlawful act was committed , it was seldom unfair to impute it to one of these . Learning was not , of course , their favorite pursuit , and when the choice was presented to them between the rod and the book , they have sometimes manifested a preference for the rod . The art of printing was to them the most annoying of all arts , and to read was less tolerable than to work . Of these two comrades , one is in the Penitentiary for life , and the other commands as good a ship as ever passed the Cape of Good Hope . Love never made in Cimon such a transformation as resolution and labor have made in Captain F**** . It was in his thirtieth year , that he determined to expend the hard earnings of several years of toil , at one of those schools with sounding names and small advantages , called academies . His utter ignorance made him the butt of the mere children of the school ; but derision is a greater stimulus than praise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the progress of Gifford , when he left the school for the adventurous life of a sailor , which he commenced , as the phrase is , " before the mast . " In two years he was the commander of the good ship in which he first sailed , and there is no better seaman , and there are few more intelligent men . But he is entitled to higher commendation ; his brothers , who were the vagabonds of the village , and of whom it was once unsafe to predict a good life or a natural death , he has animated with his own spirit , and of a family of seven , there is not one that has not become a new and respectable man  --  or boy , for several are yet young . Few men know how much of good they can do in their own little circle ; for there it must be done , or nowhere . Merit , as Johnson says of life , " consists not in a series of illustrious actions and elegant enjoyments ; " but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little glory . It is easier to die like a hero , than to live like a Christian ; and when honor shall be inseparable from merit , the hero will be the least esteemed . Men who have lived in a village , ( as well as those who have not , but who look into their own hearts ) well know that in a small community the same passions exist , which disturb the peace of nations . Perhaps the flame is more intense , because it is more concentrated , and because it has often no outlet . There is no passion that agitates the men who agitate the world , that hath not its throes also in a village . Plots , *inductions dangerous , " combinations and amalgamations , ( according to the chemico-political phrase ) are the usual means of gratifying the two predominant passions , ambition and envy . Perhaps , however , there is but one passion ; and ambition , when it can not exalt itself fastens up the skirts of others , that they , too , may not rise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , and in the operations of these small statesmen , private calumny *upplies the want of a public press . It succeeds for a brief time , as far as to raise a cry and defeat an election , but the people of a village are too well acquainted with each other , and with themselves , to have their judgement swayed for any length of time , by so common a matter as a tale of slander . Popularity is , indeed , a fleeting thing ; but so is its reverse , and a man may be often much praised or abused at different // times in a year , according to the state of ' parties . He may be a favorite because he is a freemason , or he may be denounced for the same reason ; or his report among his peers may depend upon any similar and passing distinctions . It sometimes surprises a stranger , to hear two respectable villagers give a diametrically opposite account of a citizen ; one will praise him , as it is safe to praise but few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are consequences of the personal considerations that are , in small com#nunities , mixed up with all general principles , or , at least , with all political , religious or other parties . This is the pest of a village ; - another is an attempt at gentility , which is generally as awkward as a dancing cow . There is an aristocracy in a small village , but the plebeians have , generally , the better polish . They make no pretensions , and their easy civility is better than a stiff attempt at politeness . The daughters of the Clergyman , the Doctor , and the Merchant , ( to give every man his title , ) are not so graceful , so pretty , or so polite as the lasses of the farm . Their attractions are in the inverse ratio of their pretensions . It is a great want in a village , and it is the cause of many evils , that there are few social meetings that bring the people frequently together . It is evident , that when twenty or thirty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social supper at the tavern , that those who are slight friends , become familiar , and that the glow of good feeling thus raised , does not subside in a month . Why not have some meetings of the kind , so often that the feeling would never subside ? It is hard to legislate upon social intercourse ; yet if the villagers were compelled to meet each other once a week , they would be better satisfied both with themselves and their neighbors . One man with the tooth-ache , or with unquiet thoughts or depressed spirits , passes a neighbor , and he has a cloud upon his brow , which the other remarks , and a gloom comes over his own . Men who live without much intercourse , become suspicious ; they will , indeed , forgive readily when they are certain that the forriveness is recip*cal but few love another , whom they believe treasures aught of malice against themselves . If men could search each other 's hearts , there would be many feuds reconciled ; for it is the belief that others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is in a village no common place of meeting , but at the public fire-side of the inn . The high discourse held there includes all that is difficult in morals , religion , law and government . Much talking creates thirst , and thirst at an inn perpetuates itself . Men , therefore , who seek society at the taverns , sometimes give that in exchange for it , which is too precious to be considered an euivalent.
