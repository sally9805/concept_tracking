txt LnT us go out to Mount Auburn , " says some one of a gay party just stepping into their vehicles or mounting their horses ; and away they dash , full of life , and health , and beauty , to visit the mansions of Death , where he seems to reign in his most elaborate and yet solemn magnificence , reminding us , as they sweep by , to make a sober jest with the line of the poet " The paths of glory lead but to the grave . " " Let us ride to Mount Auburn , " says the ennuy6e , rising from dinner , with the prospect of a long afternoon before him ; and forth they go , to rid themselves of Time , among the final homes of those who have exchanged it for Eternity . " Let us go out to the Cemetery , " whispers the wife to the husband , as some lingering sunset is softening into twilight , half doubting lest he should check the wish , which he knows to spring from a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they visit the grave of their child , to strew a few flowers upon its new en closure . " You must go out to Mount Auburn with us , this after noon , " says the citizen to the stranger ; and thither they go , too , to talk learnedly of obelisks and monuments , national taste , Westminster Abbey and Pere La Chaise . Reader , let us go , too ; but let us walk , nor drive up in dusty splendor to the crowded gate-way , tossing our reins to the keeper as we would to the ostler of a tavern . And yet , notwithstanding all that sometimes offends the taste before you enter , in spite of the incongruity of ideas , which the crowd of vehicles and the looks of the riders will excite , when you are once within the enclosure , Fashion arid the World , and Gaiety and Splen* dor , are soon forgotten . Standing in the dark groves , where the broken light falls down through the openings of the trees , and singu* larly possessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guished air and the most fashionable tournure will pass you unnoticed , when you would have turned to gaze , had you met them in the street . The visiters , too , one and all , no matter what their mood when they reached the gate-way , are at once sobered and subdued , as soon as they have passed under those gathering shades . You shall see a young lady leap from the carriage , laughing in all the luxury of youth and health , and reveling in some jest which has been started ; and when you pass her in an avenue , or meet her on the hill , she will be lost in contemplation , and forget to return your civilities , if you should not yourself be too abstracted to offer them . Still , the influence of the place is not a melancholy or a saddening influence ; it is better-it is expansive and soothing , filling the mind with the beauties of nature , and thus breaking the force of any passionafe expressions of affliction , which may be ready to burst forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with images and objects which are not shadowy and hard to grasp , but before us , around us , and familiar . We never go in there , without feeling the deep philosophy of the sentiment , which Shakspeare has put into the mouth of Timon , when he makes him say , that he will make his everlasting mansion Upon the beeched verge of the salt flood ; // Which once a day with his embossed froth The turbulent surge shall cover ; thus expanding an individual feeling into the vastness and extent of the ocean itself , and depriving it of its bitterness by connecting it with the most magnificent image in nature . We think , indeed , that rio one can go in there and give himself up to the spirit of the place , without feeling something of this expansion-this breaking away from the narrow localities of the dismal church-yard , and diffusing the thoughts over a space that admits and embraces greater sympathies with the creation . The moment the feelings are concentrated , if the subject be ourselves or our own griefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell on the confined and ordinary habitations of the dead , with no images of beauty or magnificence to lead away the thoughts from decay and corruption , we are borne down by our feelings of grief , and disgust , and harrowing sorrow for the dead . But in these beautiful pleasure-grounds of Death , there is every thing needful to rob it of its terrors , while the place of the deposited remains is sufficiently indicated arid exact , to give the feelings a spot on which to dwell . We never lose a certain sort of sympathy for the dead , which arises from placing ourselves in their situation and imagining-strange solecism ! but actually one which we commit-imagining how they feel . If they are sunk beneath the ocean 's wave , we follow them down into those all unvisited depths , where living man never has approached and never can . If , as with the ancients , their bodies are consumed , we strive to go in thought with each atom to the elements into which it is resolved ; and when , at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fain flatter ourselves that all is concentrated there . If they are placed in the common grave , we think , painfully , indeed , and with averted eyes , on the work of dissolution . Wherever they go , whatever disposition is made , thither we go with them , in waking hours and in dreams ; and if any thing can be done to beautify the spot , it is so much taken from the cold , repulsive , cheerless condition , in which our feelings are ever presenting them to us . The history of sepulchral architecture and funereal customs has here a deep foundation in the necessities of our nature and condition . We can not bear that the transition should be so sudden and complete , as it is in its original , unadorned , and simple state . We would make the dead to " stay a little longer , " by surrounding them with things which really belong to this world , but which we have thereby consecrated to uses on the passage to the next . Why did the Indian lay the bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the dead ? Why did the Egyptian embalm and emblazoii ? Why do the natives of Southern Africa carry food and raiment to their cemeteries ? Why do we busy our grief about the marble and the shroud , deeming it a sacrilege that the dead should be more meanly served than was their wont in life ? Not solely , in any of these cases , from a regard to decency and custom ; but because we would feel , if haply we can persuade ourselves to do so , that they are not wholly beyond the consciousness of pomp and ceremony , and have not ceased to be within the sphere of circumstance . We would connect them back , if we could , by some of the things of sense , " the appurtenances of affectionate superstition ; " and knowing that we can not pass over the great gulf , really to minister to // their wants , we solace ourselves by creating imaginary wants for that only part of them that is still within our reach . But we are at the gate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been there , if not a dweller in the neighborhood ; or , if you have , it can not be unwelcome to stroll with us again through the grounds . As you go in , there is the beautiful sarcophagus , chiseled in Italy , erected to the name of Spurzheim , who died among us , as if without a country , but as a citizen of the world , and a member of the human family ,  --  meeting the visiter first , on his entrance , as if to remind him how completely all the members of that great family , whether of the East or the West , are mingled and united at the grave . A little farther on , lies all that was mortal of him , who ministered in the temple of Law , and whose spirit still lingers in the University , shining in the labors of his successor . Where is his learning , now ? Where his clear reasoning , his refined acuteness , his grasping intel* lect ? They are active in that other sphere , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And where is the gratitude of his pupils ? Does the marble still sleep in the quarry , or has the chisel begun its work ? As you turn to the right , in one of the larger dells , she , who traced the recorded History of Religious Sects , lies buried " First Tenant " of the Cemetery , who led the way , in her fullness of hope and usefulness , down into the new valley of death , at the head of that long train , which every day is gathering in . Many other names meet the eye , of fathers and parents , who have here prepared the last resting- place for themselves and their families , even as in the city they have built fair , costly homes for the sojourn of life . And now we have wound our way up to the hill-top , let us pause , and look around and think . We are but beggarly at description , even with rich autumn woods and fair towns at our feet . But we can not forbear to remind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake on the other , and the long stretch of marshes , with the university , and then , the city beyond* The city-with its thousand pulses of life , beating warm and quick , through the great heart of society-how many eager hopes , vast plans , idle fancies , useful purposes , are there ; how do they toil , and enjoy , and pull down , and build up , and then-here ! here , where sleep can not be disturbed , though the roar of twenty Babels were rising up into the peaceful groves , and where the unbroken goings-on of nature seem to mock the fitful , feverish courses of man Here the hand will fall , and the eye sink , and they be brought out , one after another , to lie here and take their rest . And still the world will go on , nature and society , nor be stirred in its heavy current by the falling of their stricken leaves . Do their thoughts ever come up here , to contemplate that final rest ? Does the image of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business , or the throng of pleasure ? We remember , on the day when this place was consecrated , sitting down with a friend , and remarking , that the proprietors seemed in great haste to lay out the grounds , as it would probably be long before many interments would begin to be made . But the seal has long been fully set to that ceremony of words , by the consecrating presence of Death itself . Some , who were of the multitude here assembled on that day , now lie in the recesses , which they then admired , and , perchance7 // selected ; and many more come daily to wander over the grounds , anticipating , perhaps even longing , for the time , when they , too , shall set up here their everlasting homes . The moral influence of such an establishment , in the immediate vicinity of a large city , can not be too highly measured , or too often dwelt upon . It is here , that the prospect of death to ourselves , or that of friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , that it ought to be ; familiarized , by being divested of the old accompaniments , which have made it revolting , and , by being connected with much that is lovely , and tasteful , and new . Who ever thinks of visiting the common grave-yards in a city , to stumble over crowded mounds and old sunken monumental stones ? Who can do so , but at the call of duty ? And who does not feel the inestimable blessing of going to the grave of buried friends , amid scenes and objects that do not render it an utterly repulsive task ? " When the funeral pyre was out , " says the quaint Sir Thomas Browne , and the last valediction over , men took a lasting adieu of their interred friends . " Now , indeed , the lasting adieu is taken , both of that which dies , and that which can not die . But the place of rest can be visited with holy joy ; the sorrowful is steeped in the beautiful ; the dark , deep waters of affliction can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be caught on earth . We have no fears that the fine effect should be lost , through publicity and the debasing purpose of amere lounge for idle pleasure . The novelty will wear ofl in a few years , both to the immediate neighborhood and to the more distant parts of the community ; and , so long as the place retains its features of stillness and beauty , it will be impossible for levity often to invade its precincts , without sinking to the tone , which they inspire . There have been some few indications of a different spirit ; but we have too much confidence in the natural influence of " whatsoever things are lovely and of good repute , " to anticipate that it should be wholly lost on the public feeling . We would say something of decorations and monuments , did we feel sure that our individual opinions are consonant to the intrinsic dictates of good taste and reason . Variety there must be , in these things , and ought to be ; for the ornaments set up here , are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affliction , now taking the form of hope and aspiration , now breaking forth in passionate expression , that can not rise from under the weight of grief* and , sometimes , in fantastic conceits of sorrow , mingling images and thoughts that even verge upon the grotesque . But , in considering this subject , though there are , doubtless , in the sepulchral , as well as all other arts of decoration , certain principles of taste to be violated or to be followed , yet we have need , before we condemn , to cultivate a catholic and tolerant spirit . Whatever has been or shall be erected under the dictates of feeling and pious sorrow , will be sure to fall within the compass of the natural and the true ; what is expressed in words , or figured in symbols , will be consistent with the heart and mind from which it emanated , and will embrace some of the forms and some of the ideas , in which the boundless variety of human grief and passion seeks its natural expression . We should go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into the great field of human character itself . Some are nearer to , some more remote from , // the standard of perfection ; but all were not made to be alike , and in all , we reverence the likeness of the Maker . So the grief and the piety of all men will not find its expression under the same forms , and by the same attempts at external and fixed ideas ; and , therefore , one element of correct judgement , on such a point , must be a regard for that metaphysical and moral principle of variety , which runs through all nature and all classes of ideas . We do not mean , however , to deny the cultivation of the public taste , by good models and long attention to the subject ; our argument only is , that whatever is done from feeling , will be , in this high and universal sense , natural and tasteful . The sun is gone down , and the moon is up ,  --  the Autumn moon ,  - -  with its flooding light , filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling down through the thick foliage into the dark groves , far below . What Elegies would not Gray have written here ! if , from a common church-yard , he could so strike a chord , that has sounded through the world . What Night Thoughts would here have swept through the mind of the melancholy , but pious Young ! The burialplaces of a city 's dead ! When a half century has passed , and when , of that active throng , the eloquent tongue , the skillful hand , the robust form of manly beauty , and the charm of female loveliness , shall all have come to moulder here , how will your borders be hallowed to that generation ! How will the fond regrets , the deep remembrances , the generous pride , of thousands , centre here ! Let them live on , while yet they may , and busying eager life in all the *vays which duty and pleasure have wrought out . Let them live on ,  --  for the trees are now growing , that shall flourish over their graves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their simple story , or their elaborate eulogium . Let them live on ,  --  and buy and sell , and laugh and weep , and love and be disappointed , and press on and be checked in their eagerness . Let them live on ,  --  for " there is a time for all things . " G.T.C.@@183068831.txt IMMEDIATELY after the publication of the Vindicia* I-Iibernica* , ( March , 1819 , ) struck with the calamitous state of the country , the result , as I was and am persuaded , of its unsound policy in withholding its support and protection from that important branch of human industry , employed in converting the rude produce of the earth into elaborated articles , suited to the necessities and the comfort of mankind , I commenced writing on political economy . To prove satisfactorily that the intensity of the prevailing distress , afforded adequate reasons to impel every man who felt an interest in the national welfare , to exert himself to ascertain its extent , its causes , and the most practicable remedies , I shall present a brief view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from official documents , of the most unexceptionable character , and try to ascertain the real causes that led to such a baleful result , and to prove the utter fallacy of the pretexts that were assigned.
