txt At this time of day , nobody thinks of placing reliance UI ) Ofl the account of the British revolution given by Mr. flume . Many writers have within a few years combined to expose his inaccuracies of fact and his partiality of judgment . He was a Scotch tory of the last century in i ) Olitics , and a skeptic in religion . He was bred up in attachment to that law which made the Roman Emperors absolute sovereigns in their dominions , and he nursed in himself a supreme contempt for every thing that savored of devotion . Admirable , therefore , as the literary acquirements of Mr. flume certainly were , he was by no means the person to compose a text-book upon English history . He is to be heard not as a judge , but as an attorney pleading a cause , and his arguments are worth no more from him , than they would be coming from Clarendon himself Indeed , they are not worth so much , for Clarendon was a religious man . tie could understand the sincerity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the line of his own practice . Numerous as the corrections of flume have been , few , we might say not one , has been directed particularly to the point where he was rnostunjust ,  --  the history of the Puritans . We are therefore delighted at last to take up a work which undertakes to supply this deficiency ; which proposes , in a brief compass , to review and rectify what has heretofore been written . Mr. Vaughan is evidently equal to his task . He writes with boldness , because he feels that he is doing an honorable duty , and has truth and justice to sustain him . His volumes may not meet with the applause which they deserve , but the cause will be apparent . The British public has been long in leading strings both in Church and State . It is only now making a struggle to get odt of them . The events of the day merely // shadow forth as yet a portentous change . May we not hope that the change xviii be an improvement ? It can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost exclusively owing to the Puritans . They alone possessed the determination , which was necessary to effect that result . The Reformation , in our humble opinion , did far more for the liberty of England , than Magna Gliarta , the conjirmatio chartarum , or the statute : le tallagio non con* cedendo . It made the people think , and not the barons . It rested the public safety upon the basis of the public interest , and not that of the nobility . There have been many struggles where the . name of liberty has been freely used , which have yet ended only in a change of despotism . Such efforts are of no use , unless the people act understandingly in the matter , - without this , civil wars are the curses of the earth , and the producers of them not a whit better than seditious disturbers of the public peace . Shall we be deemed enthusiasts if we go a step farther , and say that the cause of liberty must forever be united with the cause of the Christian religion ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appeals to the mind and not to the senses ,  --  that which is the result of reflection and not of passion . The great and leading error of the church of Rome seems to have been the union of a temporal with the spiritual power ; a union which the history of the Saviour expressly disavows , and of which even Dr. Lingard indirectly doubts the expediency . The interests of religion were made secondary to the interests of the Prince . The acquisition of power and of supremacy was too tempting an object to the minds of a succession of mere mortals , and the Christian virtues of forbearance and humility were consequently too often forgotten . Thus grew the gorgeous hierarchy , which so long governed the Christian world . Its basis was false and inconsistent with the spirit of the founder of the faith , and it could be sustained no longer than the people could be kept in mental ignorance . The slavery of the mind and the slavery of the body went hand in hand together . When the former was released , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the Testament and compared the simplicity of Christ and his followers with the arrogant pretensions of their self-appointed representatives , pushed itself with similar zeal and success into the subject of civil rights . The lessons were hardly learnt and dearly paid for , but they // were lessons which produced the British constitution and our own free system of government . But if , on the one hand , the Bible teaches men to think and feel for themselves , instead of trusting the whole business in the hands of a Sovereign Prince , it equally teaches the necessity of a strong and self-restraining civil government . A well ordered and moral Christian government would never make an unhappy State . So true is this , that every demagogue , who cries for liberty and means licentiousness , thinks it necessary first to reject Christianity . It was the want of this restraining principle , that produced the horrors of the French revolution ; it was the existence of it , though even in a mistaken form , which arrested similar horrors during the civil troubles in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not be an idle foresight in the people to look well at the religious principles of their leaders and flatterers , before they move an inch . Revolution is not a business to be trifled with . We have uttered a doctrine not much in fashion among politicians , nor properly considered in the world at large ; but the present are perilous times and require extraordinary treatment . It is not right that the peace of numbers should be jeopardised every day by any person , however able he may be , merely because he takes the fancy into his head . If it be a security to a body politic that the men who aspire to lead should be moral and religious men , without cant or affectation , let those qualifications be required . If it be not , then the case of this world must be very bad indeed . At the same time , we are not to be understood as advocates of a union between church and state , any farther than as both mark the same course for human conduct . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about practice . It remains yet to be proved to the world , by what rule of argument a bad character in private relations can be at the same time worthy of confidence in public affairs . The Puritans have been unjustly treated . They were conscientious men . They were fearless and uncompromising in matters where they thought their duty concerned ; and even their faults , many of which they undoubtedly had , were productive of some good to the world . They were stern and unamiable , but the times required such spirits . Would gentle and refined beings have carried on , at every disadvantage , a // contest , mental and physical , against all the power of prescription ? They were bigoted and intolerant . The inconsistency between their professions and their practice has done infinite service to the cause of liberal Christianity . Time and suffering produced lessons upon which they themselves improved . rrheir history is a striking one , from the very fact that they meant well and did ill ,  --  that they began right though they ended wrong . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be no hard task to avoid their faults . We shall pass at once over the five chapters of the Introduction , and come to the important question , which presents itself at the very opening of the reign of James , What line of policy should then have been adopted towards the Puritans ? There can be no doubt , that the decision of this point has a very important bearing upon the whole of the subsequent history . If James was right in the measures which he determined upon , then the whole of the subsequent resistance of the Puritans is unjustifiable . If on the other hand he was wrong , he and his advisers must be held responsible for the consequences . Mr. Vaughan discusses this subject in a new and a very powerful manner ,  --  and we consider this portion of his book as by far the most valuable . He shows the moderate nature of the concessions which the Puritans required of James ; he proves that they were favorably disposed to the king personally , and he endeavors to show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested , had they been granted . This last point involves the difficulty . It is not in the character of parties , whether religious or political , to stop the tide of success ; and spirits were too eager in those days for the acquisition of supremacy to rest quiet with a bare toleration ,  --  at least this has been the best argument used in defence of James . Mr. Vaughan brings us a powerful witness to show that it is not invincible . It is not a little singular that all preceding historians , not even excepting Mr. Hallam , should have overlooked him . Let us borrow the words of our author . Not long after the kin&amp; s accession , Lord Bacon submitted a dispassionate review of the religious disputes of the period to the attention of the parties at issue ,  --  and it is somnex*hat iemarkable that historians and polemics , who have professed to furnish rea ( lers with a summary of the merits of the Puritan controversy , should have made so little use of the Chancellor 's profound observations in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conjecture // why the name of Bacon has been passed over in this subject , by writers , who can look at one side of a case only , and who , in this instance , have taken their place with the dominant party . Very few of the Chancellor 's remarks will suit the purpose of such men ; and some of his statements will be questioned by the persons , who , under the influence of a similar prejudice , but from a more generous feeling , become incapable of perceiving any grave fault in the conduct of the oppressed and suffering . But while neither party is held to he blameless , the scale , as presented by the acute and comprehensive genius of Bacon , turns greatly in favor of the Puritans ,  --  and it must he remembered , that every thing in the character and conduct of this far-sighted man requires us to suppose , that whatever he ventured to publish in the cause of a party so obnoxious to the court , was extorted by a deep sense of justice and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court had adopted , would prove to be a benefit to the court itself ' Lord Bacon , upon this subject , has every qualification that can entitle a witness to confidence ,  --  and his testimony is tolerably decided . We must confess , that it has done much to clear up doubts which we had ourselves entertained . We admit that James , at so critical a moment , committed a fundamental error in policy at the outset , and we can easily trace the operation of that error upon the fortunes of his race , through all the succeeding events . Aside from these questions , however , we can not deny ourselves an extract , which the powerful mind of Bacon has made applicable to every age . Again to my lords the bishops I say , that it is hard for them to avoid blame in the opinion of an indifferent person , in standing so precisely in altering nothing . Laws not refreshed with new laws , wax sour . Without change of ill , a man can not continue the good . To take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . A contentious r*taining of custom is a turbulent thing as well as innovation . A good husband is ever pruning in his vineyard or his field , not unseasonably indeed , not unskilfully , but lightly ; he findeth ever somewhat to do . We have heard of no offers of the bishops of bills in Parliament , which no doubt proceeding from them to whom it properly belongeth , would have every where received acceptance . Their own constitutions and orders have reformed them little . Is nothing amiss ? Can any man defend the use of excommunication , as a base process to lackey up and down for duties and fees , it being a precursory judgment of the latter day I ' // 170 Vaughan7s Memorials of the Sttwrts ' . Of course , it is not possible now to decide , what success the ' course suggested by the gifted mind of Bacon might have had The British Solomon adopted a very different - one . He had not reached that degree of wisdom , which brought one of the greatest of the ancient philosophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Petitioners to a conference at Hampton Court . Instead of conciliating , he disputed , and finished by announcing his determination not to concede , but to harry them out of the land . ' Thus in the first year of his reign , without reflecting upon his ability to execute , he declared uncompromising war against a considerable , and ai* increasing religious party in his dominions . At the same time it is but just to notice the motive that led* James to this bold determination . It was not religious feelings for he had been bred up in a Puritan school . It was a clear perception of the political consequences which might result . At the Hampton Court Conference , he had repeated the maxim , No bishop , no king . He threw himself upon the ' English Hierarchy to sustain the political doctrines he felt to ' be in danger from the Puritans . The act was a bold , and it might have been a successful one , if he had possessed the energy necessary to follow it up . The bishops served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their monarch 's title upon the most immovable basis , by coining forward in the political arena , and urging the absolute doctrines which have been so perpetually used for the same purpose . The only consequence was , that the intended opposition to the church was concentrated upon the king , as all parties saw that , by his own election , that establishment was made to stand or to fall with him . We have already expressed it as our belief , that the union ' of temporal with spiritual power in the Romish Church , was the source from which much of the misery of the human race has come . It embittered all the struggles of the Reformation in the sixteenth century , which were not carried on for toleration , but for power . The possibility of separating the interests of religion from the pretensions of the Pope , could not naturally come into the head of any Catholic , nor did any of the sects , who resisted those pretensions , do much more than assume the same to themselves . James , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to sustain his favorite theory of government . // And in doing so , he exposed boib equally to the attack of n hold and numerous party . Nor was he at the same time dis .. creet in avoiding other subjects of just complaint . His favoritism , his vacillating foreign policy , the immorality of his court , and his inclination towards Catholic connexions , all tended to degrade him in the estimation of his people . Mr. Vaughan has briefly , but very satisfactorily , touched upon all these points . Lord Bolingbroke has thought fit to attribute to James all the subsequent miseries of England . This opinion , like many of his lordship 's , requires qualification . That he was very wrong may he true , though it must depend somewhat upon the opinion one forms upon the abovementioned testimony of Bacon ; but , admitting that he was , there was something in the character of his successor , which had a material and independent influence on the course of events . He died , leavIng nothing to that successor hut his crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declarations had been all in vain . The Puritans had not been harried out of the land ,  --  so far from it , they had grown and strengthened in every year of his reign , continually reminding him of their power , by thwarting his favorite measures . Every Parliament he summoned , showed their increase , and , ( though it was not reserved to him to know this , ) every injury he inflicted upon them , was destined to return with tenfold force upon the head of his son . Our author has devoted two chapters to an explanation of the state of religious parties at this l ) eriod . He has discriminated very forcibly among the divisions of the Puritans . One of these has been made most unjustly , and as it would seem unwillingly , to bear the name and the sitis of its original founder , Robert Brown . After describing the principles peculiar to it , Mr. Vaughan adds with spirit and justice ; - That such a man should have given his name , even for a brief space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated by some of the most enlightened men , and become the creed of millions , is a fact , which exposes the folly of reasoning indiscriminately , from the character of individuals to that of their system . Such , however , is the philosophical temper with which the story of these early separatists continues to be told by our most popular writers . The little occurrences which betray individual weakness , are culled with vigilance , and put forth with an air of triumph , as demonstrating the unmixed absurdities of // 172 Vaughan 's Memorials of the Stuarts. theories which the parties , thus caricatured , are said to have embraced . From this rule of proceeding , it follows , that the man who shall be aware of the atrocities of certain kings , or the worldliness of certain bishops , must regard kingship as every where a curse and bishoprics as the same . It is curious to observe how an affected superiority to vulgar natures may be thus coupled with a mode of reasoning borrowed from the veriest vulgar. * The Independents are evidently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the Atlantic , claim an interest in their leader , Robinson , as one of the founders of Plymouth , though he did not live to come out himself . We take pleasure in extracting the following spirited eulogy . Rarely do we meet with such lucid proof of sincerity , as in the case of this once persecuted and still calumniated people . No explanation of their conduct can be given , apart from that which they themselves supply ,  --  a sacred sense of duty to their God . No other motive could have sustained them under sufferings so complicated and so protracted . Their state involved a relinquishment of every tie to earth , and what could have supported this , except that religion , which includes a vigorous hold on the future and the eternal ? In the state of degradation to which they were reduced , they had no sensible monuments of former greatness to cheer them with that melancholy pleasure which such objects never fail to inspire . The Catholic exile could point to the most powerful nations , as devoted to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majesty that wealth or genius could supply ,  --  and even in those countries , where its dominion had ceased , he could assert the extended possessions which imparted so much dignity to a new race of priests , to be possessions pertaining of right to his communion , and could bid those splendid or mouldering ruins , which connect the imagination with the ages far remote , to speak for the greatness of that empire which his creed had once possessed . Not so these professors of a system so distinct from , and so unlike the kingdoms of this world . No nation had adopted their policy , and the clergy , even in the only spot of Europe where they could find an asylum , were frequently their persecutors . But they were not without reasons to assign in vindication of their conduct , nor without facts of pre-eminent grandeur to adduce in support of those peculiarities , which had exposed them to so much obloquy and suffering . They could trace their favorite opinions to an antiquity with which the cathedral and the monastery had no alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their reproaches and their many wrongs , in the history of the great founder of Christianity , and in the history of the men who were endowed by him with a greatness of nature , which raised them far above the common level of humanity . As to the ascendancy of creeds , they could tell of centuries , through which their own had maintained its ground , against every conceivable kind of hostility , extending its triumphs , as a system of truth , even in such circumstances , to the most distant nations . What it had done , in this respect , they were persuaded it would do again . It was their solemn conviction , that the cause , which in its own native strength had triumphed over the paganism of one empire , must prevail , in its appointed time , against the 3emipaganism of that which had succeeded it . Through the first two centuries , their principles were those most generally recognised ; and to the age of Constantine , Christianity was , as in their case , the religion of a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see their principles adopted by the most powerful states of the new world , and by many myriads of their countrymen ; but they had their moments , in which they could anticipate a change even thus surprising , and in which they could brave any hazard , and apply themselves to any toil with a view to promote it . The first party in Christendom to advocate the cause of religious liberty ,  --  we mean to advocate it fully and consistently , was this party of outcasts , and because , in this respect , they were wiser than their generation , they were long despised by it . ' We must now pass to the consideration of the critical reign of Charles the First . The history of England furnished to each of the great parties which divided the kingdom , the precedents upon which they rested their opposite claims . And each began to revive those practices , which were best likely to serve their present design , Charles and his lawyers found themselves sustained by the examples of the Tudors , while the other party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The monarch set in operation his forced loans , his benevolences , ship money , forest laws , the honor of arbitrary knighthood , Star Chamber and High Commission Courts , forming together a complete net-work of despotism over the country , while his opponents claimed the support of the Charter of Runymede and the authority of Parliament . Precedent has great influence in the way of restraining the passions of men , and is therefore always of considerable value as a support to justice . But we can not admit that the case of the re // sisting party could have been a whit less just , if every one of the acts of Charles had been practised from time immemorial , and there had been no offset against them to be shown on the face of the statute book . Man has rights beyond the har of limitation , and it is only necessary for him to claim them understandingly , to place his cause upon an eternal basis . The British people had arrived so far in the reign of the first Charles ,  --  and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove them to madness . It will be perceived , from this view of the case , that we are disposed to rely very little , for a justification of the Revolution upon the mere records of ancient times ,  --  nor are we at all aware that such reliance is necessary , excepting perhaps in a single point . A doubt might reasonably he entertained , whether forcible resistance was justifiable by the degree of oppression , that had yet been experienced by the people at large . The well known rule is , that the danger of suffering by submission must exceed that likely to result from any attempt at change . Clarendon has drawn a striking picture of the national prosperity at this time , for the purpose of illustrating that question ; and even Mr. Fox , whose partialities are by no means on the same side , has , in his Historical Fragment , treated as a doubtful case the propriety of the appeal to the ultima ratio , at the time when it was made . There is always a disadvantage attending measures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmlessly over , and wonder how they could have been so much alarmed , without reflecting that their own acts had dispelled it . In this way it is , that a skeptical nature , like that of Hume , has every advantage . The actual consequences of a measure do not appear to correspond with the dread entertained of it previously . Immediately , such an author attributes personal motives to the leaders for so unnecessarily ' exciting the public feeling . Charles on the throne , having dissolved three Parliaments in less than his three first years , and reigning for twelve more without calling one , with Strafford for his right and Laud for his left hand man , and with all the instruments which the ingenuity of the crown lawyers were devising to support his tyranny , might well be deemed an enemy to the public peace , fit to he resisted . But apart from this consideration , so far as the Puritans constituted the popular party , they had no other resource . Archbishop Laud required conformity to that which // their consciences would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceable alternative , that of secession from the State , he as resolutely refused to them . Cromwell . Hampden , Haseirig and others were prevented , by his interposition , from sailing to this country , after they were actually on board a vessel . The choice , therefore , was to them between war or total humiliation . It seems difficult to suppose a case in which a struggle is justifiable , if this attack upon religious opinions and civil rights together do not make one . Mr. Fox seems to us to have erred , as many other writers have done , .. -. by placing the contest of 1640 too exclusively in a popular light . Had resistance been confined strictly to the defenders of civil liberty , it may well be doubted , whether at that stage it was completely justifiable . We must be permitted to add a doubt , whether it would have happened . The Puritans and they alone felt the double motive . It has been said , that the king was willing to concede , and did concede enough to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enmity ,  --  and this has been brought as an argument to show their ambitious views . Nobody who judges fairly of the character of Charles , can be long blinded upon this point . It has been the practice of such writers as Hume , to cover this monarch 's failings , under the mantle of sympathy for his hard fate . Yet it eannot be denied , that dissimulation and double dealing were his peculiar characteristics . The consequences were exceedingly unfortunate for himself . The popular leaders could never rely upon him , even when he was most sincere . They felt themselves embarked in a new and adventurous undertaking . Loyalty had all the power that European prescription could give it . The popular idea of ' the divinity that doth hedge a king , ' was not then worn away . If they had submitted , and Charles had been false to his word , their cause would have been almost irrecoverably lost . Now that Charles would have been in fact false , there is every reason to believe . His letters found at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of right proves it ; his first appearance before Parliament to bolster up Buckingham 's false account of the business of the Spanish Marriage proves it ; his voluntary and violated promise to impose a restriction upon his wife 's religious establishment proves it . Throughout all his history , if we consider it by the aid of pri // vate documents that have since reached the light , it would he difficult to fix upon one act of his reign , that can he called a sincere concession to the feelings of his people . Yet this is the man , whose cause Mr. flume takes up against what he considers the hypocrisy of the Puritans . This is the man in whose favor that historian ventures to make an insir*uation against the memory of 11am pden , and in justification of another of whose acts , he coolly pens the following paragraph . Because Sir John Eliot happened to die while in custody , a great clamor was raised against the administration , and he was universally regarded as a martyr to the liberties of England . ' Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of his performing a certain portion of his duty in Parliament ; his physician declared his health to he affected by the imprisonment , and the king knew it , yet refused him any indulgence . We are somewhat at a loss to know , what claim short the stake or the axe , could be stronger to the title of a martyr . And withal the philosophical historian proceeds to generalize , and quotes with approbation some old royalist writer , who says that the Puritans , though they would not swear and drink , yet would lie and deceive . In just such a spirit does Mr. Achille Murat remark of the people of New England at this day , that they go to church , and are strict in the performance of religious exercises , while , at the same time , they do not stick at a fraudulent bankruptcy . The sweeping character of such charges ought always to inspire a doubt , not only of their correctness , but also of the authority that pretends to make them . All bodies of men are necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is manifestly unjust to judge of the mass by the exceptions . The proper method of arriving at a conclusion , would he to compare the general character for morality of one portion of the community with that of another . New England need not shrink from such a comparison with any portion of the earth , nor will the character of the Puritans , even by flume 's own admission elsewhere , suffer by comparison with that of the cavaliers . But it is hardly worth while to grow indignant against flume . His work has much merit , even if he did forget the old rule , ste quid falsi dicere audeat , ste quid yen non audeat . We will close our notice of him , by quoting , as strikingly applicable // to condemn him , the words of one of his contemporaries . The man , ' says Dr. Johnson , who considers himself as constituted the ultimate judge of disputable characters , and entrusted with the distribution of the last terrestrial rewards of merit , ought to summon all his fortitude to the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such dignity with the most vigilant caution and scrupulous justice . To deliver examples to posterity , and to regulate the opinion of future times , is no slight or trivial undertaking ; nor is it easy to commit more atrocious treason against the great republic of humanity , than by falsifying its records and misguiding its decrees . ' We have unconsciously occupied so much space already , that we can barely recommend what it would have pleased us to extract ,  --  the author 's very eloquent treatment of the subject . From those who wish to examine fairly , we would claim particular attention to the chapter upon Laud and the clergy , to the three last pages of chapter seventh on Charles I. , and to the closing ones in the first volume . It is the general character of revolutions to begin well . The danger only comes from the impetus of the mass they set in motion . Powerful agents , whether in the physical or the moral world , can never be used safely by the inexperienced , nor for many ways by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of its career , did itself great credit . It contained much of the wealth and the talent of the kingdom , and it redressed grievances and corrected abuses , with a judgment worthy of the commanding station it held . The proceeding against Strafford opened the way for all the subsequent violences . No question has been argued with more vehemence in our day , than that of the justice of this act . Mr. Vaughan devotes a whole chapter to it , and from the tone of the two leading British reviews , one might be led to conclude that the question of Reform itself was not more momentous . In one respect , it certainly is important . If the conduct of Strafford is to be justified , because the attainder is condemned , it will be as well to shut up the volume of History at once . Its lessons can do no goo*J . If the man , who , from being a violent friend of popular rights , becomes a king 's most arbitrary minister , and professes thorough and thorough ' to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , is not to be held up to the indignation of posterity , or , on the contrary , is to be // styled , as he is by the Quarterly Review , a most virtuous and suffering patriot , then it is the height of injustice for us to require any consistency in our public men , or to pass any censure whatever upon them . Benedict Arnold himself muse be called an angel of light . We profess no sympathy for the fate of Strafford , although we have no hesitation in saying that his condemnation was a most illegal and arbitrary act . The impeachment itself was one of those acts of policy , effective in itself , but xxhich can he supported only by those who love party better than we do . The evidence brought forward at the time did not justify it . Strafford 's own defence is too strong for it ; and it is not too much to say , that the Commons were perfectly sensible of this themselves . Then came the act of attainder , in itself not justifiable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , carded through by threats and intimidation . We can imagine no rule of more general application than this , that all prosecutions for the violation of law should he themselves strictly within it . Otherwise the very process to punish justifies the offender . If such a rule should apply in common cases , how much more so on great occasions in representative bodies The moral sense of these degenerates much faster than that of individuals . Perhaps they are more slow to feel power , but once felt , they are quicker to forget right . Responsibility seems to rest no where . Inasmuch then , as the impeachment and disgrace of a public man derive all their importance from his being a warning example to all who come afterwards , it would seem requisite for the production of this effect , that the justice of the proceeding should be apparent . The popular leaders felt very soon that they had overstepped the limit of *i*ht ,  --  and the choice to them , was to sink or to go on still more boldly . The great object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Government of England 500fl took the shape of an oligarchy , as intolerable and intolerant as the preceding monarchy . It had not even the merit of the latter , for it was not energetic , and was constantly agitated by internal divisions . The tendency of things is in these cases constantly demonstrated ; until some single mind starts forth to assume the superior station that is its due* and to restore order and success . Such a mind was Oliver Cromwell 's . The crisis had arrived , * when it was necessary to choose between long and disastrous confusion or the supremacy of the king . This man saved the // country from both . We are gratified to find Mr. Vaughan dis. * posed to treat his memory with fairness . He was not so had aman as most writers have chosen to represent him . He died , and was buried not many months hefere the party which attributed , and justly , its downfall to him , obtained undisputed possession of the land ; and from that day , not only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and birds of prey , hut detraction of his character became the incense with which men paid their court to the vindictive passions of their new sovereign . Cromwell has been painted with the powers as well as the wickedness of an evil spirit . In truth he had neither . He was much like other men , excelling them in some points , and falling below them in others ; not able to control events , but knowing how to take advantage of them . If it be true , that mankind is always composed with a free admixture of virtues and vices , and that individual character varies only according to the predominance of the one or the other , it is fair to suspect the correctness of any description , where either quality appears too exclusively . There is hut one perfect historical character in modern times . Why should there be any in the other extreme ? Yet it is but lately that we read a French biography of Cromwell , by no mean literary name , which denies him almost every good quality under Heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It requires great acquaintance with the secret workings of the human heart in every situatidn , and a patience of investigation that very few will take the trouble to endure . Many writers have set portions of his conduct in a true light ; few with more success than Dr. Lingard and even Voltaire , hut we know of none who have presented a satisfactory explanation of it as a whole . Of course we shall not attempt lere to supply the deficiency . Our purpose will be answered hy recommending the author 's views upon the subject , and by extracting a passage or two , which hear more particularly upon acts for which Cromwell has been most blamed . The first relates to the celebrated self-denying ordinance , SQ often called a master stroke of policy . The members of both houses resigned their commissions , with the exception of a single individivnl , thc very man who had proposed the self*denying regulation . This circumstance is alleged by many writers , as a proof of the consummate art with which Cromwell applied himself to remove impediments from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of his ambition . it is certain , however , that his continu .. ance in office , suspicious as that circumstance may appear , resulted from a succession of occurrences which he could not possibly have foreseen . Before the day arrived on which the ordinance was to be enforced , Cromwell was sent with Waller to oppose the progress of the royalists in the West ,  --  on his return , he was despatched to prevent the junction of the royal cavalry with the forces under the King ; and he next received a commission to protect the associated counties . When the time prescribed by the ordinance was nearly closed , Fairfax expressed his unwillingness to part with so experienced an officer in the present state of affairs ; and the two houses consented that he should remain forty days with the army . Before this interval had expired , the great battle of Naseby was Ibught , and in respect for the courage and capacity which had contributed so greatly to the fortunes of that day , the ordinance was again suspended in his favor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as necessity was thought to require it . ' This extract is quoted by Mr. Vaughan from Lingard , and is fair , as that historian generally is , where his Catholic prejudices do not operate . It states merely the simple facts . If it had not bean the fashiou to attribute a had motive to every thing done by Cromwell , nobody would have thought of blaming him for the self-denying ordinance . Considered in itself , it was a wise measure , and the only one that could have been successful in overcoming the difficulties of the moment . It is notorious that Essex and Manchester were weak and inefficient leaders of the army ; it may well be doubted whether they were sincere . Yet their party in Parliament was so strong , that any thing like direct censure would have produced the most imminent danger to the common cause . Knowing this , and that his activity had made him obnoxious to the same party , Cromwell saw that nothing but a sacrifice on his part could bring ou that sacrifice on theirs , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice . No doubt he believed , that he would afterwards find some opportunity to restore himself to consequence . He was a man of great talents , and every such man believes that . Still it was for the time a sacrifice* lie shut his eyes at the prospect which was opening at the moment before him . We must admit this , or we must at once assert , that when he offered his commission , he knew that Fairfax would command the army , that he would request his services at the expiration of the forty // days , and that the battle of Naseby would take place ; a degree of fore-knowledge to which Cromwell himself , with all his saintly grace , never pretended . If every act of his life had been as little reprehensible as his share in the self-denying ordinance , instead of having merely to defend him , we should venture into the field of praise . We will praise him where we think he deserves it . Cromwell was always a strenuous and consistent advocate of that liberty of religious opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertions effected a salutary change in this respect . Cromwell was in his own person a strictly moral man , and he was an admirable domestic character . Even his enemies confess this , by the romance they got up , about the royalist reproofs of his daughter Cleypool . Had we no high charges to bring against him , this would weigh down much of common error . Did we consider him as merely in the ordinary line of English kings , how would the acknowledged order and sobriety of his court and army , though both were splendidly and expensively supported , contrast with the venal prostitution and heartless , soulless profligacy of his successor ? Lastly , Cromwell was never a mover of those extravagant and disorganizing opinions which were so popular in France in the last age , and which lead at once to the destruction of society ,  - -  and this position leads us to another portion of his history , upon which we propose to descant mere freely . Tic Presbyterian oligarchy , that governed Great Britain after Charles was delivered over by the Scots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected by Cromwell and the Independents , who made up the army . It is generally supposed that by that officer 's instigation , Cornet Joyce and his troops took the decisive step of seizing the person of the king at Holmly . A negociation shortly after took place , the purpose of which was to restore the monarch . Now the question is , whether , in that negociation , Cromwell and his party were sincere . We have not a doubt that they were , because they incurred considerable risk , and that without any adequate motive unless we suppose them so . The king himself was then so low in fortune , that very little dependence could be placed upon any effort or co-operation of his . The design clearly was to get rid of the dominant party in Parliament , as well as the seditious and leve1lin* spirits of the army . The propositions made were extremely liberal . Charles had // seen nothing like them for many a day . They did not claim the destruction of covenant or hierarchy , but merely that dissenters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They reserved for ten to the Crown , and they were to except five royalists from pardon . These demands do not look selfish . The only objection that can reasonably be made to them , is , that they were too generous . The king was during all this time treated with great respect , and an indulgence he had not experienced under other guardians . His singular perverseness of mind blasted all this fair promise . He suspected this kindness to arise from the necessity which Cromwell and the army felt of his support , and presuming too boldly upon xvhat was hut partially true , he imagined the time was come for him to dictate his own terms , either to the army or the Parliament . However just his view might abstractly have been , he should have remembered that he was a captive and not at the head of an army , and that he was j ) personally a heavy burden for either of the parties to sustain . He did not remember any of these things . He announced openly to Ireton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . rrhe consequence could not fail to come upon himself . the moment was one of all others , when sincerity on both sides was of the greatest importance . If your majesty have a game to play , ' was the proud reply of Ireton , you must give us also the liberty to play ours . ' Nothing further remained to be done , hut for Cromwell and his friends to save themselves while it was yet time , and leave the king to find alone the bottom of the precipice into which lie was resolved to plunge . Cromwell did save himself , hut not without one of those daring measures , which always test the difference between a genius and a driveller . The Levellers had denounced him for his partiality to the king , and some of the regiments went so far as to mutiny in the field . The story is , that he shot one of the ring-leaders with his own hand ,  --  and it is certain that his bold and instant action was the sole reason why the mutiny failed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii negociatinrr with the king , what motive could he have had in riskin his popularity with the army ; that army too , which was in that case to be his only reliance ? What could he gain by a tedious negociation , if he expected from the first to take the violent nieasures to which he resorted at // last ? Why weaken the confidence of men , who were to be his most efficient instruments ? On the other hand , if he were sincere , we meet with no corresponding difficulties . He was fearful of the authority of Parliament . He knew himself exposed to their hostility , and he felt that a union with the king would shield him , while it presented a favorable opportunity for a settlement of the affairs of the country , without an undue preponderance on the Parliament 's side . We must he permitted to express our belieg that it was fortunate for him that no such union took place ,  --  for with all his energy , his undertaking must have failed . There are only certain stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before Cromwell became bmself aware of this , which accounts for his sudden change of conduct to open hostility . His only mode of keeping himself upon the surface , was to float for a time with the current that had set against the monarchy . That Cromwell was usually influenced by mixed motives of action , after he became a military man , we do not doubt ,  - -  but there is no satisfactory evidence , that before the brilliant victories of Dunbar and Worcester , he aspired to govern the state in his own person . Whatever projects he might have entertained , could never have done for him what his military career did , and this he could not long have foreseen . In all states convulsed by internal broils , or indeed generally in any states , it is the plainest and comnionest of steps from the command of a victorious army , to the government of the whole nation . There is no truth more palpable in history . We shall not enlarge upon the career of Cromwell as Protector . Had he only been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he able to boast of a more successful , a more vigorous and a more patriotic prince . Which of them ever did so much of his own free will , to give the country a free and liberal government ? Which of them more honorably sustained such generous spirits as Blake and Hale and others , although he knew they were unfriendly to him ? Which of them , with a powerful and enthusiastic army at his command , would have voluntarily called three Parliaments in three years , in each of which a majority thought , spoke and acted against himself ? The leading and irremediable defect that frustrated all his exertions , was the want of title to the place he held . The English people would not admit his right to rule over them . It was his perpetual labor to avoid resting this right upon his sword , // and he was perpetually driven to it . We are rejoiced that he was . We are rejoiced that his usurpation was so glaring , that no subsequent age can mistake it , but while we condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise of being a very moderate one . On the whole , Mr. Vaughan 's summary deserves consideration . It is a fact , 5 he says , that until a few months before the late king 's death , Cromwell was an advocate of monarchy , and even hazarded his own life to save that of his sovereign . It is a fact , that the fragment of a Parliament , which his violence dissolved in 1653 , was on the eve of adopting measures , which , whether they saw it or not , must have brought back Charles Stuart , and with him the return of oppression to a large portion of the people , along with the penalties of death and confiscation to the leaders ci the army , and to many besides . It is a fact , also , that in all his subsequent experiments with regard to Parliaments , the Pro- ' tector consulted the general feeling of the nation , and labored to restore the ancient constitution quite as far as was consistent with his personal safety ; and it is not less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed to establish , accorded more nearly with the claims of all the parties , included in the British dominions , than any thing that had preceded it , or than any thing which followed until the revolution of 1688 . Cromwell insisted with all parties on the general equity of his plns ; and hoped that self-interest would aid the greater number in discerning it ; but all continued blind , and all , save one , were to be made captives in their blindness . ' No doubt , self-interest would have been served , by admitting the title and the authority of Cromwell ; hut with deference we would submit , whether there may not have been a higher motive of action in resisting them . The deep stain upon the character of that man is selflsh ambition . Was it for those who had openly and honestly acted with him for other purposes , to sacrifice their principles , and bow the knee to him , who had frustrated those purposes ? Neither will it do to blame them for being made captives to Charles the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the consequences that ensued . He knew that he was not the choice of the people of England . Why did he persist in forcing himself upon them ? He thus prevented that settlement of the nation , which he might have materially aided in // producing , and wearied the feelings of every body to such a degree , that at last they were willing , for the sake of peace , to take back Charles Stuart , even without conditions . He had not that highest degree of greatness of mind which makes a man willing to descend , and to be little . Cromwell has done even more mischief yet to the world . lie has inflicted a serious injury upon the cause of liberty and religion . It is to his name that the enemies of popular rights will point , for a justification of their resistance , even to the most righteous demands . It is such men as he and Napoleon Bonaparte who do infinite harm , by attracting the admiration of men to talent , instead of virtue , and by confounding so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reason loses all its force in contending with the impetuosity of enthusiasm . He has injured religion , by connecting his practice in the minds of men with hypocrisy . After he began to follow the ignis fatuus of ambition , he was a hypocrite . Dissimulation became a necessary instrument for his advancement . In proportion as his enthusiasm gave way before the cooler judgment that was requisite to conduct his plans , the void was to be filled by an artificial emotion . His example has , therefore , been the perpetual theme of scoffers at religion , and has had the effect of spreading his disgrace over a whole sect of conscientious men , who had no similar motives to lead them astray . Cromwell was a kind and generous friend to New England , and we have , therefore , been induced to give more space to an impartial view of his character , than we could well afford . To sum up all in a few words , we can only say , that he appears to us to have been one of those extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree by such times . A deep-toned enthusiast at first , acting sincerely and violently in the cause he had espoused , the superiority of his abilities raised him above all his fellows , and placed the supreme power within his reach . The temptation was too great for his virtue , and , in yielding , like Macbeth before him , he was driven to make his face a wizard to his heart , disguising what that was . ' There were many men in that day , who , in sternness of principle , were not unworthy of the ancient Roman character . These men had not resisted Charles , to favor Cromwell . It was tyranny under any shape that they opposed . But they had drawn their notions of government , not so much from an // accurate view of the condition of the people to be governed , as from the popular and dazzling examples of the ancient republics . England certainly was not then , ( it may be doubted whether she ever was or will be ) , prepared for a democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lost all influence , when that influence would have been of greatest use ,  --  at the moment of the Restoration . The great majority of the people , weary of change , were easily led by early prejudices to wish back their kings . A union of the two intolerant religious parties with those who had no religion , and the head of the army effected , without a struggle , the return of the Stuart dynasty . And never , during the eighty-five years that it ruled in England , was there a moment when it might have fixed itself so firmly in the hearts of the nation . Charles the Second wantonly trifled with their affections . But history has yielded a lesson from it , which should be often considered when we are led to doubt the soundness of popular ' institutions . That lesson is , that the people learn wisdom by suffering , faster than monarchs do . It was strikingly shown ' after the return of the Stuarts . It has been shown not less so in the late instance of the Bourbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution in 1688 , was a real improvement upon the experiments of 1640 , and the French Government of 1830 manifests still greater progress since the days of the Convention . There is a strong analogy between these cases in many respects ,  --  in one , a difference which it is worth while here to point out . The recall of Charles was the spontaneous act of the nation ,  --  the return of Louis touched no sympathies of the French . How much more criminal must have been the misconduct of the former ! The Royal Declaration issued at Breda confirmed little for which the people had been contending , and that little was not suffered to remain . The liberty for tender consciences which it guarantied , terminated in a complete re-establishment of the hierarchy and the enforcement of the act of uniformity . The indemnity for past offences was violated by a swelled list of exceptions . The record of twenty-four years is little else than a gradual retracing of steps to the point where the quarrel hegan ,  --  and this too , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot in the court . Profligacy of every description infected the nation . The monarch himself set a glorious example . His father , arbitrary though he was , // never received the gold of a foreign prince to betray the interests of his people ,  --  nor lavished their substance upon mistresses of every description . He did both . His father assumed the reins of government , under all the difficulties accumulated upon him by his predecessor . He thoroughly exhausted the greatest share of popularity that fell to the lot of any of his race . We have left ourselves no room to enter into any detail upon the suffering which the act of uniformity , so unjustly forced upon the nation after it had confided in the king 's honor , produced . It is probable that the sum of it was greater than that which produced the revolution . The refusal to conform to ceremonies has besides been made , throughout their history , a reproach to the Puritans . It has been represented as unreasonable obstinacy upon trifles ,  --  as if any thing were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to add any views of our own to the following spirited defence by Mr. Vaughan . Men who are acquainted with the character of the non-conformists at this time , must often be surprised at the language adopted concerning them by certain writers , who would be thought particularly enlightened on these subjects . It is almost amusing to observe the airs of wisdom , with which these persons affect to deplore the weakness of so many well-meaning individuals , who , to escape kneeling at an altar or *vearing a surplice , could expose themselves to so much suffering . But these persons should , perhaps , be reminded that the sum which Hampden was called to pay under the name of ship-money , was a very small sum ; but inasmuch as that small sum was a tax , and a tax imposed by an authority which had no right to impose taxes , it was a trifle involving a momentous precedent ,  --  an embryo from which the most extensive revolutions might proceed . And men who look on these things with the eye of common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church are not to be resisted suite as steadfastly , as false authorities in the State . If a sickly acquiescence has often been found to make way for despotism on the part of the Crown , has it not often made way for the same thing on the part of the mitre ? And who , with the history of the papal hierarchy before him , will pretend that there is less to fear from the usurpations of the priest than from those of the magistrate ? The men who stood forth in l66* , waging the war of freedom against the powers of intolerance , were , in no small measure , the saviours of their country ; and well would it be , if // thousands who have since bestowed pity on their weakness , could be ascertained to possess any fair portion of their strength , - strength , we mean , to lay hold on important principles , and to stiffer with a *artyr*s firmness in the cause of them . Such men as Baxter and Flume and Calamy had few equals in their day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We can not pass entirely over the name of Sydney . His condemnation alone would suffice to disgrace the reign of Charles . His career , like that of his greater predecessor , Cato , is calculated to strike the imaginations of men , though it may reasonably be douhted whether such persons ever effect any great practical results for their generation . The human race may sometimes be coaxed , but can not be driven . It will not answer for one of them to set up for himself so rigid a rule of action that nobody can follow it , and then cry out because nobody does* Such a man may gain general respect , but he will never acquire any permanent or useful influence . Sydney could speculate upon a perfect republic , but he could neither check the ambitious designs of Cromwell , nor avert the unlimited settlement of the crown upon Charles . He seems either not to have had any influence , or at least , if he had , not to have used it to much purpose . Yet there is a moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was condemned , which may be beneficial to all posterity . A noble mind , struggling with adversity , according to an ancient writer , is a sight worthy of the gods . When that adversity is occasioned by the misdeeds of fellow mortals , something more than passive observation would seem requisite . There is hardly a stronger practical satire upon human justice , than the slow but sure destruction of a noble nature in the process of a court of law . Jeffries judging Algernon Sydney , Socrates condemned by the Ttihunal at Athens , and we might add a still greater , if he had been a mortal example , guide a generous mind with more unerring certainty to the conviction of a future state . Their sufferings were not lost , for cases like theirs call most forcibly for the exercise in another world of those most splendid attributes which all men , who believe in a Supreme Being , love to ascribe to him . We regret our inability to pursue more fully the author 's history of the two last Stuarts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal place in the nation , but their influence became at last of great importance in turnrng // the scale . And to their credit be it said , that influence was exerted in favor of principle against their immediate interests . The established church , in order to sustain itself as well against a Catholic monarch on one *side as against the Dissenters on the other , became more and more exclusive and intolerant ,  - -  while James endeavored to conciliate all who were dissatisfied , for the purpose of combining their force in support of his favorite schemes . At a period when private and public morals were almost universally corrupt , when the character of nearly every political party was too much in unison with the profligacy reigning in society , it is to the credit of the non-conformists that they at least adhered to their duty . But for a more detailed account of events , we must refer our readers to Mr. Vaughan 's book , of which we now take leave by recommending it generally as a moderate and candid exposition of a momentous period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though favorable to one side , not unjust to any . The point we desire to establish is , that public conduct should in every state he placed upon the firm basis of private morality ,  --  and there is no guarantee for morality like that of religion . It is in this view , that we attach much importance to works , in which the motives and conduct of religious and conscientious men and parties are not uniformly depreciated . The close of the last century brought forward writers , * have done much injury to the world . Most of them were distinguished for arbitrary political doctrines or religious infidelity , and not unfrequently for both together ,  --  Gibbon and Voltaire attacked the foundations of the faith of the Christian world ,  --  Hume labored in defence of English tyranny ,  - -  and Mitford attempted to raise up the monarchs of Persia and Macedon at the expense of a State , whose history is the history of the intellect of man . It is quite too bad that the lessons of experience should be twisted into arguments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Utopian infidel republics and Agrarian laws on the other . Let us hope that men are becoming wiser ,  --  that we are not to lose sight entirely of the land-marks that time has preserved , while we derive advantage from the valuable practical instruction to be drawn from the annals of mankind.
