txt THERE is perhaps no country in the world whose national character has been so little understood as that of Spain . This very interesting work , which has recently been published in Paris , throws considerable light upon a subject of the highest interest , at a moment when this singular nation is convulsed by a civil war , marked by the most uncommon and opposite features of ferocity and heroism . It is a subject of much regret that the modern literature of France is so little known or appreciated in this country . Apart from the more cultivated natives of the country , resident among us , a very limited circle here , only , is acquainted with its richness and variety , and few indeed of the numerous important works which are continually appearing in Paris , in every branch of science and literature , ever reach our shores , much less become known to the mass of our population . A few extracts , translated from the work of an intelligent and accurate observer , as we turn over its pages , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interesting glimpses of Spanish history and politics , from a quarter where , we venture to say , a large proportion of them would not have become acquainted with them , and the touching details of the Young Napoleon 's short and mournful destiny , which we gave in a late number from the well known work of Monthel , were found to possess as much freshness of interest and attraction , as if the palace doors of the child of destiny had then first been opened to the imagination of every reader . Again and again , we shall return to the stores of French literature . The first volume contains a narrative of the author 's arrival at Barcelona ; an account of Saragossa , Madrid , and Toledo ; portraits of the most distinguished members of the Spanish Ministry , during the last century , and a sketch of the events that have taken place since the marriage of Ferdinand VII . with Christina , now Regent . We will begin our extracts with the following remarks on the capital of Catalonia : " Barcelona bears some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , customs , and civilization are concerned , is to Spain , what Milan is to Italy . Since the decay of Cadiz , it bas been the principal commercial town of the peninsula . It surpasses the capital in wealth and elegance . It is , of all the Spanish towns , that in which the theatre is the most constantly attended . The opera is often well organized ; but they have little national music . Rossini reigns as an absolute master over the hearts of the Catalonian diletlanti . The Barcelonian is essentially maritime . He is adventurous and loves the sea ; the *reater part of the emigrants , who , during the last century , went to seek their fortune in the Indies , were natives of Barcelona . " // After remaining thirty-eight hours at Barcelona , the author proceeded to Bruch , a miserable village which derives its whole celebrity from the Benedictine convent in its vicinity . " The guide I hired at Bruch , " says M. Didier , " is , I think , the personification of a Spanish peasant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leathern bottle of wine . When he became hungry , he , with a very nonchalant air , made me a sign to stop , and seating him self by the road side , took a piece of bread , and a handful of nuts , out of his portmantle , which he quietly ate , not forgetting to invite me to share in his fru*al repast . There is something in this sansgene that pleases me , for it proceeds from a feeling of pride and of personal dignity that is noble in itself and that seldom dis*usts one with low and servile obsequiousness . False shame is unknown in Spain . The poorest peasant speaks to the kind without being abashed ; but notwithstanding the ease and freedom of his manners , he possesses uncommon tact , and never infringes on the rules of politeness and respectful reserve . You never have to dread his becoming indiscreet or troublesome from being treated with familiarity . " M. Didier , although a Chrigtinos , gives no very flattered portrait of the Queen Regent . Of her daughter , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular , and , truth to tell , ridiculous sight , to see the monarchy of Charles V. , the monarchy of Spain , and of the Indies , represented by a doll , four years old , who has been taught to smile and bow . I saw her infantine Majesty driving on the Prado . She wore an immense hat and blue feathers that threatened to crush her . She is exceedingly like her father , and looks like a little old woman . " Solemn illustration of human folly ! In this country , where the divine principles of Democracy have made the once awful mysteries of Government as simple as the parent 's control of his child , and rendered every man of the land 's millions , a participant of the national sovereignty , it seems almost as impossible to believe that millions of rational and educated human beings , are so firmly persuaded of the Divine right of this poor infant to rule over them ,  --  so devout in the belief that Heaven has endowed it with a sacred knowledge of the arcana of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood has been spilt like water , and years of national horrors , wretchedness , and crime , have been endured like a fate and a necessity , to secure to her the throne and the perpetual privilege of monarchy without molestation-as it was for the Japanese Emperor of old , to credit the first Dutch voyager 's relation that once every year in his country the water became so hard that men and horses could walk over it in security . And is not the same spectacle , in a state of peace and harmony , witnessed also in England , the honored land of our fathers , exulting under the Heaven-born sway of a young woman who , under a better political system , would be deemed trusted to the extent of her capacity , were she to have the management of her household . In Thibet the grand Llama , is viewed with the same reverence and allegiance , and wields as much power , as beneficially , certainly , for the happiness of the governed . // The author 's judgment of the Spanish character , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the duration of the present struggle , and the apparent indifference manifested by the mass of the nation as to the ultimate success of Carlos or Christina . " The Spaniard does not see what he can win or lose by the triumph of either party . He will stand by the window to see Isabella or Don Carlos pass ; he has no more sympathy with one than with the other ; he has always been so badly governed that he has no hope of being well governed . Any government seems to him an evil , and the consequence of this is , that he has become resigned to it as we are resigned to sickness , death , or any other evil . As to civil war , he bears it as he bore the cholera . It seems as if so slow and deliberate a people ought , by v*ay of compensation , to be an extremely reflecting and provident people , but quite the contrary ; no one in this country calculates , every one acts from impulse . " The second volume of M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid Zumalacarregui ; an account of the Spanish Government during the last century ; a visit to Seville , etc. , together with much curious and general information as to the present state of Spain . Among the sketches given of the most distinguished members of the Cortes , we select the following of Martinez de la Rosa : " Martinez de Ia Rosa was born at Granada , in 1788 , and possesses all the flowery and flowing eloquence of his countrymen . He early began the study of the law , and the French invasion of 1808 found him occupying a professor 's chair at Granada . When this city was taken by the French , the young professor found a refuge at Cadix , the last and inviolable sanctuary of Spanish independence , where he wielded his pen in the most sacred of causes . He abstained from mixing in all public affairs until 1813 , when he was named deputy of the Cortes , by his native town . The national assembly , which at first met at Cadiz , was transferred to Madrid , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sittings for some time . After the return of Ferdinand , Martinez was one of the first victims offered to the in*ratitude of the royal perjuror . After having languished for two years in imprisonment , he was transported , without trial , and by means of a simple Zettre de cachet , to the African fortress of Penan de Velex , an unhealthy rock , where he lived , or rather vegetated , for four long years , when the revolution of 1820 released him , *and a government vessel brought him in triumph to his country . Hewas reelected by the town of Granada , and appeared once more in the Cortes . He took his seat among the moderate party , and inspired Ferdinand with sufficient confidence to induce him to confide the reins of government to those hands he had formerly loaded with fetters . Martinez was named minister of foreign affairs and entrusted with the formation of the cabinet . He fulfilled this duty , but without success . His resignation became indispensable , and he gave it five months after entering the ministry , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disinterestedness which en . titled him to that reputation he has since enjoyed . When he left the ministry , the official Gazette announced that he had refused the emoluments of his place and given them to the treasury . Another incident made considerable noise in the foreign newspapers . Martinez was accused of having , in concert with Ferdinand , meditated an arbitrary act against the constitution of 1812 , which he desired to replace by a charter and two legislative chamhers . The execution of this plan had already began . The Royal Guard rose in insurrection , but was put down by the National Guard . The resignation of Martinez soon followed this event . Thus , even in 1822 , he showed considerable lukewarmness as to revolutionary ideas . The second restoration was more indulgent to him than the first ; he was not even exiled . He voluntarily went to Italy , and from thence to Paris , where he gave himself up to literary // pursuits , and was considered by his countrymen as entirely independent of politics . He took no share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . **** In less stormy times , Martinez de Ia Rosa would have made an excellent minister of the fine arts or public worship , but he was never destined to be placed at the head of a revolution . He is an honest man , but not a statesman , not even a man of business . His is not the talent of action , nor the instinct of reform . He is not so blind as not to see the abuses under which Spain labors ; but he fears using the axe ; he ventures to touch nothing with the hand of reform , because he fears being compelled to touch every thing . His eloquence is pompous ; to exhibit it he requires the excitement of the forum ; in a drawing-room he has no conversation . He has a bad memory and is obstinate , which two circumstances do not facilitate business . On his return to Madrid , after an excursion to Valencia and Seville , M. Didier found that the ministry had resigned . Yaldes has been named minister of war , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be upright but powerless , I fear . It is not the minister who reigns , it is the army of official clerks . The minister issues orders , or signs a law voted by the Cortes , and then lies down to rest , believing that he has done something , while in reality he has done nothing . If the . ordinance or law does not suit these tenants of the hureaux ( and as they live upon abuses it may readily be imagined what laws suit them ) it might as well not be passed ; they have a thousand ways to prevent its being put into execution . Thus , in Spain , a law is often but a sheet of paper . I often see a young poet , a man of talent , but rather hotheaded , who has been exiled these three months , but who , nevertheless , goes to every ball , and meets Martinez de la Rosa every day on the Prado the fashionable walk of Madrid . The minister gives orders but it is thus they are executed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Can he conjure up an army by magic i Can he coin money from the rocks of Navarre ? Money is wantmg-men are wanting ; and besides , that almost supernatural enthusiasm , which alone leads a nation through a revolution , and which performed the miracles of the French republic . " M. Didier then goes on to say that he believes in the possibility of Don Carlos taking Madrid , but that even should he enter that city , he could not remain there . " His reign , however , should it last but a day , would be a great calamity for Spain , where vengeance is implacable , and reaction horrible , but still , this calamity would be useful , by uniting in a compact body all the fractions of Spanish democracy , which are now dispersed and divided . An absolute government is no longer possible in Spain , and however contradictory may appear to be the scene offered by the peninsula , it will forever remain the domain of liberal ideas . I feel , therefore , no anxiety as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Carlos is in vain . The lukewarmness of the people for the cause of the Queen does not prove that they feel any devotion for Don Carlos ; with few exceptions , the nation is neutral ; now neutrality is not sympathy . An incontrovertable fact ; one which has been proved by events , is , that if the Spanish nation has not yet rallied visibly to the new social order , it has , at least , completely separated itself from the ancient . It is in a state of doubt , of transition ; it is deliberating before takinb a decisive step . It takes its time for that , as for every thing ; and when it has taken a resolution it need only breathe on the civil war in order to extinguish it . " The following remarks on Count Toreno , written at the time when he took the place of Martinez de Ia Rosa , may interest our readers : " Some days before his fall , Martinez had solicited the intervention of the French . As soon as Toreno entered the cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the loss of the hope of foreign intervention , Toreno lost courage , and felt that he could no longer retain his post . But , to tell the truth , had Toreno undertaken the // direction of affairs earlier ; had he obtained the intervention , his reign would still have bcen transitory . Toreno is not the man of a revolution ; he is sceptical and not ambitious . Without that firm conviction which produces civil virtues , he does not heartily embrace public principles , nor seriously embark in the public cause . Toreno , I repeat , is not ambitious . He does not aspire to power . He loves it not . Now ambition is a necessary virtue for a statesman ; it is almost indispensable in any high social position ; it is ambition which makes a great minister it is ambition which triumphs over difficulties ; it is by means of this passion that a name is imprinted on he rock of ages , and that the wo rId is shaken ; without ambition there are no durat ble conceptions , no firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful execution ! But here , be it understood , I speak not of that vulgar ambition that destroyed the temple of Ephesus . The love of notoriety is but an inferior appetite . Ambition is another thing ! It is Julius Cresar who pursues one only object for fifteen years ; and then in the field of Pharsalia breaks the Roman patriciate ; it is Richelieu who sees the end he proposes to himself and marches steadily on to it ; he dies , but with him expires the French aristocracy ; he leaves th people and the throne ; it is Napoleon who places the people on the throne , and inoculates Europe with plebian royalty . Such is ambition ! and it is a ray of this ardent flame of life that I would wish to see in Toreno . I would , that the regeneration of Spain should be his constant idea ; that he should devote himself to it , that he should resolve to accomplish it at any price . But he is not anxious to acquire fame by performing a glorious work . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long exile , to European customs , his country seems to him barbarous , and so much behind all others , that he despairs of it . Such are the faults of Toreno . ' Here our space compels us to close our translations from this valuable little work . We refer those of our readers who may wish to know more of it , to the original , which we doubt not can be readily procured.
