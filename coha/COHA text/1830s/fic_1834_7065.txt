Covers , Edges and Spine Main text AN OUTLINE SKETCH . BY THEODORE S. FAY . The young Lord D. yawned . Why did the young lord yawn ? He had recently come into ten thousand a year . His home was a palace His sisters were angels . His cousin was  --  in love with him . He , himself , was an Apollo . His horses might have drawn the chariot of Phoebus , but in their journey around the globe , would never have crossed above grounds more Eden-like than his . Around him were streams , lawns , groves , and fountains . He could hunt , fish , ride , read , flirt , sleep , swim , drink , muse , write , or lounge . All the appliances of affluence were at his command . The young Lord D. was the admiration and envy of all the country . The young Lord D. 's step sent a palpitating flutter through many a lovely bosom . His smile awakened many a dream of bliss and wealth . The Lady S. ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her train of dying adorers , grew lovelier and livelier beneath the spell of his smile ; and even Ellen B. ,  --  the modest , beautiful creature , with her large , timid , tender blue eyes , and her pouting red lips  --  that rosebud  --  sighed audibly , only the day before , when he left the room  --  and yet  --  and yet  --  the young Lord D. yawned . It was a rich still hour . The afternoon sunlight overspread all nature . Earth , sky , lake , and air were full of its dying glory , as it streamed into the apartment where they were sitting , through the foliage of a magnificent oak , and the caressing tendrils of a profuse vine , that half buried the verandah beneath its heavy masses of foliage . " I am tired to death , " said the sleepy lord . His cousin Rosalie sighed . " The package of papers from London is full of news , and  --  " murmured her sweet voice timidly . " I hate news . " " The poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my teeth on edge . I have had a surfeit of poetry . " " Ellen B. is to spend the day with us , to-morrow . " Rosalie lifted her hazel eyes full upon his face . " Ellen B. ? " drawled the youth , " she is a child , a pretty child . I shall ride over to Lord A 's . " Rosalie 's face betrayed that a mountain was off her heart . " Lord A. starts for Italy in a few weeks , " said Rosalie . " Happy dog ! " " He will be delighted with Rome and Naples . " " Rome and Naples , " echoed D. , in a musing voice . " Italy is a delightful heavenly spot , " continued his cousin , anxious to lead him into conversation . " So I 'm told , " said Lord D. , abstractedly . " It is the garden of the world , " rejoined Rosalie . Lord D. opened his eyes . He evidently was just struck with an idea . Young lords with ten thousand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his seat . He paced the apartment twice . His countenance glowed . His eyes sparkled . " Rose  --  . " " Cousin  --  . " What a beautiful break . Rose trembled to the heart . Could it be possible that he was  --  . He took her hand . He kissed it , eagerly , earnestly , and enthusiastically . She blushed and turned away her face in graceful confusion . " Rose ! " " Dear , dear cousin ! "  --  " I have made up my mind . " " Charles !  --  " " To-morrow ! " " Heavens ! " " I will start for Italy . " Ocean ! Superb  --  endless  --  sublime , rolling , tumbling , dashing , heaving , foaming  --  coelum undique et undique pontus . Lord D. gazed around . The white cliffs of Dover were fading in the distance . Farewell , England . It is a sweet melancholy , this bidding adieu to a mass  --  a speck in the horizon  --  a mere cloud , yet which contains in its airy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Noble England ! " ejaculated Lord D. , " and dear mother  --  Ellen B.  --  pretty fawn  --  Rose too  --  sweet pretty dear Rose  --  what could mean those glittering drops that hung upon her lashes when I said adieu ? Can it be that ?  --  pshaw  --  I am a coxcomb . What ! Rose ? the little sunshiny Rose  --  the cheerful philososopher  --  the logical  --  the studious  --  the  --  the  --  the  --  ! " Alas ! alas ! What are logic , study , cheerfulness , philosophy , sunshine , to a warm hearted girl of twenty  --  in love ? Lord D. went below . Italy is a paradise . Surely Adam looked on such skies , such rivers , such woods , such mountains , such fields . How lavish , how bright , how rich is every thing around . Lord D. guided his horse up a mountain near Rome . The sun had just set ; the warm heavens stretched above him perfectly unclouded ; what a time to muse ! what a place ! The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , was broken by a shout of terror  --  the clashing of arms  --  a pistol shot , and a groan . He flew to the spot . A youth of twenty lay at the root of a tall tree , weltering in his blood . The assassin , terrified at the sight of a stranger , fled . " I die , " murmured the youth , with ashy lips . " Can I aid you ? " asked Lord D. , thrilling with horror and compassion . " Take this box . It contains jewels , and a secret , which I would not have revealed for the world . Carry it to England , to the Duke of R  --  . Open it not , no matter what happens . Swear never to reveal to any human being that you possess it  --  swear . " Lord D. hesitated . " My life-blood ebbs away apace . Speak , oh speak , and bless a dying man  --  swear . " " I swear . " " Enough . I thank you  --  hide it in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see  --  home  --  again  --  never , nev  --  . " The full round moon , beautifully bright , went solemnly up the azure track of sky . Lord D. dashed a tear from his eye , as he gazed on the pallid features of the youth , who stretched himself out in the last shuddering agony and convulsion of death . He placed , his hand upon the stranger 's bosom . The heart had ceased to beat . No longer the crimson gore flowed from the wound . The light foam stood on his pale lips . " And he has a mother , " said the chilled nobleman  --  " and a once happy home . For their sake , as well as his , his wishes shall be obeyed . " The tread of horses ' feet came to his ear , and shouts and confused voices . Lord D. thought the fugitive ruffian was returning with more of the gang . " Shall I fly like a coward ? " was his first thought ; but again , he said , " why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sprang to his saddle , in his hurry , leaving behind him a kerchief  --  dashed the rowels into the flanks of the snorting steed , and was presently lost in the winding paths of the forest . The midnight moon was shining silently into the apartment , as Lord D. 's eyes closed in sleep , after having lain for some time lost in thought upon his couch . His senses gradually melted into dreams . " Ah , Rosalie . Dear Rosalie . " The maiden suddenly grasped his throat with the ferocity of a fiend , when  --  hah ! no Rosalie  --  but the iron gripe of a muscular arm dragged him from the bed , and shook his idle dreams to air . " Bind the villain ! " said a hoarse voice . " Away , away to the duke 's ! " Bewildered , indignant , alarmed , the astonished lord found himself bound , and borne to a carriage  --  the beautiful and soft fragments of Italian scenery flew by the coach windows . If you would freeze the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust him into a dungeon . Lord D. never was so unceremoniously assisted to a change of location . A black-browed , dark-complexioned , mustachio-lipped soldier hurled him down a flight of broken steps , and threw after him a bundle of clothes . " By St. George , my friend , if I had you on the side of a green English hill , I would make your brains and bones acquainted with an oaken cudgel . The uncivilized knave . " He lay for hours on a little straw . By-and-by some one came in with a lamp . " Pray , friend , where am I ? " The stranger loosened his cord , and motioned him to put on his clothes . He did so  --  unable to repress the occasional explosion of an honest , heart-felt execration . When his toilet was completed , his guide took him by the arm , and led him through a long corridor , till , lo ! a blaze of sunshiny daylight dazzled his eyes . " You are accused of murder , " said the duke , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your victim was found weltering in his blood , at your feet . You left this kerchief on his body . It bears your name . By your hand he fell . You have been traced to your lodgings . You must die . " A witness rushed forward to bear testimony in favor of the prisoner . Lord D. could not be the perpetrator of such a crime . He was a nobleman of honor and wealth . " Where are his letters ? " He had brought none . " What is the result of the search which I ordered to be made at his lodgings ? " " This box , my lord duke , an  --  " The box was opened . It contained a set of superb jewels , the miniature of the murdered youth , and of a fair creature , probably his mistress . Lord D. started . " By heavens , it is Rosalie ! I am thunderstruck . " " Enough , " said the duke , " guilt is written in every feature . Wretch , murderer ! To the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed . Nay , sir , lower that high bearing , those fiery and flashing eyes , that haughty and commanding frown . Not thus should you meet your Creator . " Night , deep night . How silent ! How sublime ! The fated lord lay watching the sky , through the iron grating of his cell . " Ah , flash on , myriads of overhanging worlds  --  ye suns , whose blaze is quenched by immeasurable distance . To-morrow just so with your calm , bright , everlasting faces , ye will look down upon my grave . Jupiter , brilliant orb ! How lustrous ! How wonderful ! Ha ! the north star  --  ever constant ! Axis on which revolves this stupendous , heavenly globe . How often at home I have watched thy beams , with Rosalie on my arm . Rosalie , dear Rosalie  --  " " I come to save you , " said a soft , sweet voice . " What ! Boy  --  who art thou ? Why dost  --  " The young stranger took off his cap . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl  --  angel  --  " " Hush ! " said Rosalie , laying her finger upon her lip . Ocean  --  again  --  the deep , magnificent ocean  --  and life and freedom . " Blow , grateful breeze  --  on , on , over the washing billows , light-winged bark . Ha ! land ahead ! England ! Rosalie , my girl , see  --  " Again on her lashes tears stood glittering . How different from those that  --  Onward , like the wind , revolve the rattling wheels . The setting sun reveals the tall groves , the great oak , the lawns , the meadows , the fountains . " My mother ! " " My son ! " " Friends ! " A package from the duke . " The murderer of  --  is discovered , and has paid the forfeit of his crimes . Will Lord D. again visit Italy ? " " Ay , with my wife  --  with Rosalie . " " And with letters and a good character , " said Rosalie , archly.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
