Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : THE DESTRUCTION OF SODOM . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1835 ) Night 's curtains are dissolving , and the dawn Rolls up its billowy brightness in the East : The plains of Mamre glow ; and every stream  --  From Zoar , to the blue mountains that afar Their kingly peaks are lifting ,  --  touched with fire , Gives gentle music to the gush of morn  --  A morn whose gleam , eclipsed and red like blood , Opes on the affrighted cities of the plain As lightnings to the houseless traveller 's eye , When he , belated , meets on dismal heath The desolating storm . The sun is risen : The shadow only of his God , he walks Upward unto the zenith , painting throngs Of clouds , in gold and purple , that essay To check the glory of his onward way . The sun is risen  --  but to that lidless eye , Glaring in heaven , is interposed a bound Which leaves no smile beyond ; a bound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the hue On pale , tempestuously shifting folds Of ceaseless-moving clouds , there dawns no day ; But changeful darkness , gloomier made , by change That no distinctness owns , seems gathering round , Touched with a fitful crimson ; like some stain , By watch-fires seen upon a murderer 's robe , When evening wolves disturb the spell of peace That wraps the midnight forest glooming round . Sodom , thine hour is come ! Thy streets no more What time the sunset 's cloudy banners fade , And early stars hold vigil in the sky , Will call the child of lust , to bide the time Of foul appointment with some kindred soul , In mutual guilt immured . No more for thee The tabor or the timbrel e'er shall breathe Voluptuous numbers on the breeze 's wing , Or the polluted dance at eve go round . Thine hours are numbered , Sodom ! and the throngs That crowd thy streets will sink to sleep no more , O'erwearied by the natural weight of sin , When revels and the wassail feasts are done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Like locust tempests o'er Egyptian land , The veil of Death is moving : on the gale Mephitic vapours roll : now , quaking forms , Rising from attic casements , mark the morn , Struggling and scarlet-hued ; and strive in vain To pierce the boundary of that cestus grim Which binds the plain 's proud cities . Bow thee down , Oh Sodom ; let thy denizens in dust Enrobe themselves , and sackcloth ; for their sins Have cried to Heaven until the Eternal 's ear Can hear those earnest prayers and groans no more , Sent up for thine and thee . No goodly ten , With souls unstained , within thy walls remain  --  There Guilt 's imperial reign extends alone . Hark ! in that knolling thunder 's distant sound Thy funeral hours are boded ! Hark , again , Affrighted cities ! Bend the attentive ear Of sense , and heart , and soul ! God walks abroad  --  His voice directs the whirlwind , and His power Marshals those gloomy companies of clouds , Whose inmates dangers are ; whose smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sodom , howl ; For never more on earth , beyond this hour , Thy spires shall look in mockery to heaven ; Thy streets be tenanted , thy dwellings gay , Or thy tall gates unbroken . Doom , despair And quick destruction wait thy busy throngs , That in the gray light wander to and fro : Those long , long streets , whose domes and temples high The inconstant lightnings show  --  these , each and all , Before the mid-day sun shall from his tower Look forth upon the world , in gloom will lie  --  In ruin , and in darkness , which nor sun , Nor the chaste silver moon , nor countless stars , Fretting the vault of night with paly gold , Can e'er again illumine . Still onward walks the tempest , and its edge , In undulations huge , is flecked with fires , Like fabled serpent 's twine ; in flashing wreathes , And forms of burning stripes athwart the clouds , They dart inconstant ; now the warring winds Rise from their hidden caverns ; and their voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloom afar , and shuts the plain , And all its cities from that solar light , Which bathes in radiant joy the world beyond . Gaze over Sodom ! On the house-tops risen , Are many multitudes ; the shifting light , Red , but inconstant , paints their tossing arms , And pallid brows , with hues that seem as blood . The thunder 's swelling volume of deep sound Shakes o'er tall spires and pillared temples gray , Till their vast halls and porticoes seem rent By some invisible hand . Sublime on high , Those voiceful sounds resistless boom along , As heavy waves each other chase , and beat The encumbered ocean strand . Now bursts the stooping storm . Around , above , And deep beneath , the Almighty 's power appears From zenith to the centre  --  now , the plain Shudders for many a league ; and every street In every city , deluged o'er with fire , A liquid stream , sends up its line of light ; And thick discoloured smoke , in volumes wide , Rolls heavenward , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dun . Across the ways , With sandals burnt and stained in running flame , Delirious numbers rush  --  while from above , Red torrents , pouring from consuming roofs , With bickering hiss , descend : thousands fall down And die , despairing aid from God or man . Heart-rending shrieks from every mansion rise  --  Pale , blasted leaves flit through the darkened air , Swept from suburban bowers ; the howl of winds And bubbling voices , choaked with gusts of flame  --  The knell of rolling thunders , and the crash Of fanes by lightning smitten , rise around In dire confusion mingled ; till at last , Dissolved in one dark ruin , all the plain , A smouldering level lies , without a sign , Or murmur of existence , save the groan Of some scathed wretch , just lingering o'er the abyss That parts a dread eternity from time . ..... Sunlight is on the mountains , and the gale Stirs the gray locks of Abraham , and his beard Waves white upon his bosom , as he stands And looks from Mamre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that gloomy plain . Faint rumblings tremble in his aged ear , Borne from that fated land ; as spreading wide Like a vast funeral pall above the scene , The smoking surges rise , to bar the sun From all the mournful sights which they enfold . Yet all around and far , that pall beyond The vivid morning lies ; the vales , the hills , Kadesh , and Shur , and Gerar , drink its rays In the serene " south country : " every stream Flashes its silver sheen by verdant shores , And emerald greenness laughs on field and tree ; While , in the extended view , the patriarch sees Comparison , in nature pictured forth , Betwixt the Almighty 's vengeance and his smile . But where are they Who laughed , at yester-even , when the day Paled all its gorgeous richness in the west , And bade the twilight hour array the stars Along the cope of heaven ? Where are they , Who sought the angels , nigh to Sodom 's gate , And spurned them , unaware ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeer , and all the guilt That fired so many hearts ? Gone to the grave ! From countless lips , all red at yestermorn , And prompt in uttering guile , have rushed away The moans of dissolution ; o'er each cheek , Then glowing like the rose in summer bower , Hath passed a fear-born pallor , midst the storm Whose every drop woke anguish as it fell ! Mock not thy God , vain man ! for in the flush Of pleasure , and the fulness of its dream ; When thy gay soul looks downward from its source And seeks its low desires , without an aim , Delighted with iniquity  --  e'en then The tempest of a retribution sure , Is gathering from afar . This vale of earth Is like the Plain of Sodom . Doom and death , O'er all its borders hang ; and he alone , Who sees , with faith 's clear eye , the land of rest  --  The city which no mortal hands have made  --  Who views the pinnacles and domes of light , Bathed ever in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walls of flashing gems , Girding that place of refuge  --  he , alone , Who walks in sweet communion with his God , Is safe amid this wilderness of wo . Philadelphia , 1834 . Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : THE PEACE OF GOD . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1835 ) Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you : let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . John , XIV . 27 . Thus spake the blessed Lord , When the Last Supper 's sacred hour was done ; And each reviving word Came , like rich incense from an altar-stone : Kind , from those holy lips , so soon to breathe Their last forgiveness forth , and taste the cup of death . ' Peace , peace I leave with you ! ' Thus to his flock the glorious Shepherd said ; And , pure as morning dew On Hermon 's mount , or marge of Jordan shed , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindling hope  --  of confidence profound . " My peace to you I give , Won from the immortal home of bliss above , Where the redeemed shall live , In many mansions of eternal love ;  --  Peace , like its radiant source , serene and calm , Where flowers unblighted bloom , and all the air is balm . " Not as the world bestows Its fleeting gifts , I yield my peace to you ; No clouds of death can close Around my Father 's house , or dim the view Where fadeless lustre fills the gorgeous sky , And sinks into the soul , and lights the enraptured eye . " And there , where golden rays Play on still waters , and in pastures green , The eternal Father strays ; His voice like music haunts each sunny scene  --  A pleasant odour floats where'er he moves , A sense of pure delight  --  a pomp of heavenly loves . " Earth has no fount of peace : Sins , sicknesses and death , begird it round ; Its hopes untimely cease , And baseless dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can gain , And the gaunt miser hoards his gold in vain . " Here , sorrow comes to all  --  For pale Mortality his standard rears Beside the bier and pall ; And smiles are quenched in unavailing tears ; To Joy 's light laugh succeeds the weary sigh , And no sweet rose may blossom , but to die . " Then , with untroubled heart , Look upward to yon home to which I go ; And ere I yet depart From toil , and suffering , and death below , Let my farewell of peace your steps attend  --  ' I go , to meet in heaven my Father and your Friend . ' " And thus the Saviour died ! Thus , to the hill of blood , he went his way , And there was crucified , While a world 's guilt upon his bosom lay . How should that risen Lord be praised and blest , Who drained the dregs of wo , to give us peace and rest ! Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : EARLY PIETY . from Poems , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see The brow of childhood brightened with the love , Which comes , in purity , From the rich fountain of delight above : Which can not fail or die , and knows no end  --  Bestowed in ceaseless gifts , and by a deathless friend ? And is it not a joy , From balmy lips the words of prayer to hear , The spirit 's best employ , Like music melting on the enchanted ear ? To note the early journeyings of the soul , Up to its source and home , beyond the world 's controul ? To mark the yielding heart Turn from the blandishments of earth and time , To choose " the better part "  --  A treasure , all unsullied and sublime , Beyond the stain of death or blight of sin  --  Which pours upon the soul a flood of rapture in ? How fair , when life is new , On youth 's soft cheek the blooming roses lie ! Then , to the ardent view All scenes are lovely , and delight the eye : Each pulse is novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening couch is pressed . Then o'er the earth and sky A glory and a gleam of newness play : The endless void on high Spreads its blue glory to the blaze of day ; A gorgeous radiance gilds the field and stream , And smiling nature wears the beauty of a dream . In that rejoicing prime Of hope and golden thoughts , the heart aspires Beyond the bound of time , And high to heaven uplifts its fond desires ; Ah , then , how sweet to hear the gentle prayer Float softly upward , through the twilight 's holy air ! Then , when the mind is new , Before the shades of care bedim the brow ; When all things to the view , In hues of beauty and effulgence glow : Then should the visions of the soul arise , And catch the living glow that fills the upper skies ! For it is thus the heart Is strengthened for the trial-hours to come , When childhood shall depart , And its rich garlands lose their sunny bloom ; When many griefs the mournful brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the spirit crowd . Thus is the bosom taught That lesson of delight , which lifts the soul Up to the source of thought , Whose splendours round its soaring pinions roll ; Beyond the brightness of the golden sun , From stores of boundless light and living glory won ! And it is thus , the tomb Is robbed of terror , and a ray divine Beams on its lonely gloom ,  --  Making its pale recess a radiant shrine , Where kindred hearts should rather sing than weep , That there the holy dead in peace triumphant sleep . Where , for the funeral hymn , Or wail of grief , the chant of praise should swell , That then , no longer dim , The lofty spirit fenced with clay should dwell ; But rise exulting , and with angels , blend Its anthems and its hopes , in bliss that knows no end ! This is the priceless boon  --  The promise offered , and the high reward , To that true heart , which soon , In young existence , seeks the Blessed Word : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And life 's dark cares are nought , and every trying scene . Thus , shorn of power , the toil , And heat , and burden of its day are brief ; And then , beyond the spoil And scathe of time , the spirit finds relief : From earth 's Aceldema it turns away , And basks in visions bright of heaven 's eternal day ! There , where nor cloud , nor gloom The vernal soil or brilliant sky o'ersweep , All the redeemed shall come , With crowns unfading and affection deep ; And see life 's crystal river roll along , And hear the tuneful notes of many an angel-song ! Can childhood thus be taught In early days that blessed path to tread , Which maketh sorrow naught , And thornless flowers on every side can spread ? Can fond parental love that path descry , And point its beauty forth to youth 's inquiring eye ? Then , let the way be shown  --  And when its onward track is duly found , And to sweet children known , Their little footsteps light should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race is ended , they may hear A Saviour 's welcome breathed , within the dying ear ! A welcome , like the one Which , at Capernaum , on earth he spake , When God 's incarnate Son ,  --  And bade his friends love children for his sake ; He spread their guileless ways and charms to view , And said , " like them in heart , be simple , pure and true . " Thus reared , a tender child The newness of its soul , till death , may keep , Serene , and undefiled ; Bright shall its day-dreams be , and calm its sleep : And when the twilight of decline shall come , A band of seraph forms will guide the spirit home . And in the courts above , The Father and the Friend , with smile benign , Shall in his kindness move , And greet that spirit in his realms divine ; And midst a scene no mortal eye can see , Speak the fond words of love  --  " Ye children , come to me !
