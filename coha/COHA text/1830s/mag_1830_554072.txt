txt The laws of the United States which regulate the operations of the Post-Office Department , although they contain no specific // provision on the subject , have been supposed by the executive officers of the Government to authorise the transportation of the mail , and the distribution of letters on Sunday . Whether this construction be conformable to the intentions of the Legislature , or to the spirit , which has prevailed in the construction of the laws , which regulate the operations of all the other departments of the Government , may well be doubted . The practice of the Post-Office certainly forms an exception to that of all the other branches of the administration , whether of the General or State Governments , in all their ramifications , as well to that of the citizens at large , both in their individual and corporate capacities . The sittings of Congress and of all the State Legislatures are regularly suspended on Sunday . The courts of justice , the custom-houses , the banks , the land-offices , the compting-rooms , offices , warehouses , and shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Post-Office alone continues its usual labors with unremitted activity , and with but little variation in its modes of proceeding . As the laws which regulate the operations of all the other departments , although equally silent on the subject , have been all construed to intend a discontinuance of the transaction of business on Sun.day , it would perhaps have been more natural to put a similar construction on the Post-Office laws . For some reason or other-probably by the effect of mere accident  --  a different system has prevailed , and the practice of this branch of the public service has hitherto formed , as we have just remarked , an exception to the rule observed in all the rest . The singularity of this circumstance , to whatever cause it may have been owing , has for some time past attracted the attention of many of the citizens in all parts of the country , and numerous memorials have been annually transmitted to Congress , setting forth the supposed inconveniences of the present state of things , and requesting such a modification of the existing laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn been transmitted in favor of perseverance in the existing system . There is no appearance of any improper or dangerous motive for these proceedings on either side ; nor have those who have taken part in them been arrayed on one side or the other according to any sectarian divisions . The several religious sects , which , from their agreement in certain fundamental points of belief , are popularly denominated orthodox , are among those , which are apparently most desirous of a change in the existing practice ; // while some other sects of considerable influence in particular parts of the country , and which hold a different opinion upon the points alluded to , have appeared to agree with their orthodox brethren upon this . It is understood that one of the petitions for a change in the existing practice was drawn up and headed by a justly respected Unitarian clergyman of this city , and extensively signed by individuals of the same persuasion . As the memorials in favor of a change proceed from citizens of all the different religious sects , it is probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact , that the same is the case with those who pray for the maintenance of the existing system . Both parties are , no doubt , equally honest in their belief of the expediency of the courses which they respectively recommend . The memorials on the subject , transmitted to the last and present Congress , were referred to committees which reported in both houses against a change . The petitioners are , however , apparently not discouraged , and will probably continue their efforts at the future sessions of Congress . The question , like every other connected with religious belief and practice , naturally excites a strong interest throughout the community ; and we have thought that a few remarks upon it might not be uninteresting to some of our readers . The report , which forms the immediate subject of this article , is attributed to Colonel Johnson of Kentucky , who acted as chairman of the committee , and who had previously , when acting in the same capacity in the Senate , made a report on the same subject to that body , corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or protest , of the minority is attributed to Mr. Macreary . Whenever any change is proposed in the existing laws , or the practice under them , it rests , as a general rule , with the party or person recommending it , to prove its necessity orexpediency ; and on this principle it would belong to the petitioners against the present system to show that it ought to be abolished . In this particular case , however , it strikes us that the general * presumption against innovation , and in favor of existing laws and practices , considered as such , is rebutted by the fact to which we have already adverted-that the practice in the PostOffice Department is different from that which prevails in all the others . If the people , acting in their corporate capacity through their different agents , consider it a religious duty to suspend all the other operations of Government on Sunday , a presumption arises , that those of the Post-Office should also be suspended // for the same reason . The presumption being then in favor of a change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing system ; and it belongs to them to show why the practice in the Post-Office Department ought to form an exception to that which prevails in all the others , and why the same religious considerations , which induce the people to suspend all their other political *and private labors on Sunday , should not induce them to discontinue the transportation of the mail and the distribution of letters . The committee , though apparently actuated by good intentions , and a laudable anxiety to maintain the political and civil rights of the citizens , have , we think , been led into error by not adverting sufficiently to the considerations detailed above . So far , indeed , are they from appearing to be aware , that the practice of the Post-Office Department is an exception from the rule observed in all the others , that they evidently consider the petitioners for a change in this practice as endeavoring to make it such . Tbns they inquire , in the course of their report , Why the petitioners have confined their prayer to the mailswhy they have not requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive functions on that day-why they have not required that our ships shall not sail-that our armies shall not march-that officers of justice shall not seize the suspected or guard the convicted ? ' The committee , when they put these questions , had obviously lost sight of the fact , that all the other functions of Government-executive , legislative , and judicial-are in fact suspended on Sunday , excepting in a few particular cases , like those which they enumerate , and which are made exceptions to the general rule on account of the great inconvenience which would result from its observation . If the jailer , for instance , were to suspend the exercise of his duty on Sunday , his prisoners would all escape ; so that there is an absolute necessity for his continuing it . If the commander of an army were to suspend the exercise of his functions every seventh day , his adversary might , under certain critical circumstances , obtain such an advantage over him , as would decide the fate of a campaign-perhaps the political situation of the country . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a moral necessity of violating it , and so of all the other cases mentioned . The practice of the Post-Office can only be justified , if at all , in the same way , as a case of exception . The report , by not adverting to this circumstance , and by employing // in support of the present system only certain general considerations , which might be applied with equal force in any other branch of the public service , proves either too much or nothing at all . The inconveniences apprehended by the committee from a discontinuance of the existing system , are of a remote and prospective kind , such as the tendency to a union of Church and State , and the inconvenience of diminishing in any way the activity of the business of private life . Now it is quite obvious , that these inconveniences , if there be any danger at all of their occurrence , would be as likely to result from a discontinuance on Sunday of the business of any other department as of that of the Post-Office . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a tendency to bring about a union of Church and State-an apprehension which we believe to be wholly groundless-it is clear to us , that a suspension of the sessions of Congress , of the State Legislatures , or of the courts of justice , must have the same tendency in a still greater degree , in proportion to the superior importance of the business which would thus be kept in abeyance . Hence the reasoning of the committee , as we have just remarked , tends , as far as it has any weight , to show that the whole business of the administration ought to proceed with the same activity on Sunday as on any other day of the week . The argument , if it prove any thing , proves a great deal too much ; and of course in reality proves nothing . This defect in the reasoning of the committee is obviously a fatal one , and we are of course authorised , without seeking for any other , to reject their conclusion . It may not , however , be improper , considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more particularly the real importance of the objections alleged by them , to the application in the Post-Office Department of the same rule which is observed in all the others . These objections , as we have already seen , by proving too much , prove nothing  --  but independently of this defect , and supposing that we were willing to admit their validity to the full extent to which they can be applied , it will appear , we think , on examination , that they have in fact little or no real weight for any purpose . They are , if we rightly understand the reasoning of the report , the two following ; 1 . The tendency of the suspension of the transportation of the mail , and the distribution of letters on Sunday , to effect a union of Church and State . // 2 . The practical inconvenience which would result from such a measure , in the diminished activity of the ordinary business of life . The second of these objections is the only one which appears to us to possess much plausibility , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most strongly , and which they evidently regard as the more important of the two , it may be proper to give it a moment 's consideration . On this head it is argued by the committee , that there are various opinions in the community , as to the proper manner of observing the Sabbath ; that each individual has hitherto been left to pursue his own course ; but that the effect of suspending the transportation of the mail on that day , would be to decide the question in favor of those who prefer a particular system , and would therefore come within the spirit of the clause of the constitution , which prohibits any legislative preference of one religious sect over another . It does not appear to have occurred to the committee , when they employed this argument , that the act of Congress regulating the transportation of the mail must necessarily provide either for carrying it or not carrying it on Sunday ; and that if a provision for not Qarrying itbe decisive of the question at issue between the sects in favor of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive in favor of another . This being the case , it is obvious that the existing system involves precisely the same violation of the spirit of the constitution , which , if any , would result from the other . It is plain to us , however , that there is not in either case , any violation of the spirit of the constitution , as there is confessedly none of the letter . The enactment of a law regulating the transportation of the mail is admitted to be within the power of Congress , and this law must , as we have just remarked , provide either for carrying or not carrying it on Sunday . In adopting one or the other part of the alternative , each member of Congress will naturally be governed by his own views of expediency and duty , excepting so far as he may have the instructions of his constituents . If he would hesitate as a private individual to travel or order his agents to travel on Sunday upon his own business , he will probably in like manner decline , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to do . If on the other hand , he would feel no sciuple on the subject in his private capacity , he would prc4ably feel none in his public one . In either case , it does // not appear to us , that he imposes any trammels upon the consciences or acts of others . Each member of the community retains the same right that he possessed before of travelling or not travelling on Sunday , according to his own peculiar views , and , if these views have not been carried into effect by his political representative , he retains in full force his former right of giving his vote for another at the next election . in all this we can discern no appearance of any thing unconstitutional , either in letter or spirit , or of any thing at variance with the regular routine of ordinary legislation . It is intimated , indeed , by the committee , that a political representative ought not in any case to be guided in the discharge of his official duty by religious considerations , and the same opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , that have happened to fall under our observation ; the writer of which considers the being influenced in the exercise of temporal power by religious belief , ' as neither more nor less than the union - of Church and State , and afterwards declares , that it is the sacred duty of a representative , before he gives his . vote upon a point any wise connected with religious considerations , to search the inmost recesses of his conscience , and to ascertain that religious belief is not operating in his mind as a motive to that vote . ' But , independently of the objection already stated to this argument , as applied to the present case , namely , that a vote in favor of carrying the mail on Sunday is as much given from religious considerations , though of a different kind , as one against it , it is clear to us , that there is some very singular perversion of language , or obliquity of judgment , implied in these remarks , which if taken in their natural and obvious sense , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the letter and spirit of Scripture . Instead of being bound , as the writer of them supposes , to exclude all religious considerations in giving his vote upon a subject connected with religion , the representative is undoubtedly bound on that , and on every other occasion , whether of a public or private character , to act under the influence of religious considerations . Whether we eat or drink , or whatever we do , ' we are directed in Scripture to do all to the praise and glory of God . ' It is expressly enjoined on rulers in particular , to govern in the fear of the Lord . It is in fact the peculiar virtue of religion , as a motive of action , that it is applicable on every occasion , and to every part of // conduct . It is one branch of our religious duty to obey the constitution and laws of the land ; and if the constitution prohibit the establishment of a national church , it is the religious duty of a representative , even though he individually prefer an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the prohibition in the constitution be repealed ; but even in voting against an establishment , he is or ought to be as much influenced by religious considerations , as if he voted in favor of it . It is impossible , in short , to conceive a case , either in public or private life , in which it is not the duty of every member of the community to act under the influence of religious motives ; and in proportion as an individual is more completely influenced by such motives to the exclusion of any others , which have their origin in mere expediency , so much the more probable is it that he will avoid error , and render himself acceptable to the Great Judge , to whom he is ultimately to give an account of the deeds done in the body . The assertion that the union of Church and State consists in being influenced in the exercise of temporal power by religious belief , seems to argue a great looseness of ideas upon the whole subject . The being influenced in the exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , or , if habitual , a particular trait of character in individuals ; - the union of Church and State is a form of political institutions . To say that one of them is the other is about as correct as it would be to say that courage is a military despotism-teinperance a constitutional monarchy  --  or the love of liberty a republic . If the remark alluded to be merely-as is probable enough-an incorrect mode of expressing the idea that a disposition in individuals to act from religious motives has a tendency to bring about a union of Church and State , the ob*ection is rather more intelligible , though not much better founded than on the other construction . Religious motives are , as we have shewn , the best under which we can possibly act , and tend of course to produce the best possible results . If one of these results be the union of Church and State , it could only be because this union is the best of all possible modes of regulating the relations between religion and government . Hence the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from religious motives tends to bring about a union of Church and State , affirm by implication that this union is an excellent institution-which is probably not their intention , and is , at all // events not the opinion of the people of the United States . If a union of Church and State be , as is generally supposed , and as the committee appear to think , a dangerous institution , it is certain that the surest way of steering clear of it , is for the public agents to act in all cases to the best of their ability on the best and purest motives , which are , undoubtedly , the fear of God and the honest intention to do His will . The moment you allow any weight to considerations of mere expediency in opposition to these , you open a door to corruptions of every kind , which are the more likely to gain admittance in proportion as the names they bear are more respectable and plausible . For ourselves , so far are we from apprehending any practical inconvenience from the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of this influence as one of the most fortunate things that could possibly happen to the country . The great evil in practical legislation is the influence of corrupt , or low and narrow views . how often does the passage or rejection of an important law depend entirely upon the relative strength of political parties , divided perhaps by considerations wholly foreign to the subject of it ! During the last session of Congress we have seen the newspapers of a political party declaring , with great satisfaction , that the question of the right of a member elect to take his seat was decided by a party vote . When the motive is not absolutely corrupt , how often is it of a low and narrow cast ! A legislator votes in favor of a rail-road because it passes through his own town , or against it because it does not . If he happen to live in a cotton-growing state , he opposes the protecting policy ; if in a manufacturing one , he supports it ; if he remove from the latter to the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of his new residence . The only sure way of rising above the influence of improper motives , whether absolutely vicious , or only narrow , is to give no weight to any considerations but those of duty , or in other words , religious principle . The individual , whether in public or private life , who pursues this course , is sure of doing right as far as he knows what right is ; and we are all but too well aware , that our practical errors are much less frequently the result of not knowing what is right than of a disinclination to do it . We have enlarged rather more upon this objection than its real importance perhaps rendered necessary , which , as we have remarked above , and have since endeavored to show , is // very little . The other , which is founded on the practical inconvenience that would result from suspending the transportation of the mail and the delivery of letters on Sunday , is the only one which appears to us to have any considerable weight . But even this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive character . It is , no doubt , true , that the rapidity of the progress of all private business would , to a certain extent , be diminished by the change in question ; but it will hardly be pretended that the inconvenience resulting from this diminution , is of such a kind as to make out a case of necessity , which would authorise the community in waiving the observation of the moral and religious rules , of which they acknowledge the obligation in all others . The committee , certainly , have not proved or attempted to prove the reality of any such necessity . They say that if you stop the mail one day in seven , you retard by one seventh the advancement of the country . This reasoning supposes that the mail is the only instrument that is or can be employed for the advancement of civilisation  --  a supposition which is obviously incorrect . lit is , no doubt , one and a very useful instrument for that purpose . The objection more correctly stated would be , that if you stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficacy of the Post-Office in producing the advantages that naturally result from it . This is true ; but it is only an application to a particular branch of labor of the general proposition , that if you suspend the labor of the community one day in seven , you make the labor of the community one seventh part less productive than it otherwise would be . This we know , or at least may admit for argument 's sake ; but notwithstanding this , there are certain religious and moral considerations , which induce the community as a general rule to suspend all their labors one day in seven . Why should not this rule be applied to the labor employed in carrying the mails as well as to all the rest ? As the committee think that it ought not to be , it was their business to tell us why ; but it is obviously not sufficient to tell us , that the labor of the PostOffice department would be immediately , in the case supposed , one seventh part less productive in a given time than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the principle is as true of all the other departments as of the Post-Office . But why deduce from it in regard to that department a conclusion , which you do not deduce from it in regard to any other ? Why , in short , make the practice of the Post-Office department a // exception to that of all the others ? This , as we have repeat. - edly said , is the real question , and it is one to which the committee have not attempted to reply . Although we have admitted , for the sake of the argument , in the above remarks , that the labor of the community , if suspended one day in seven , is for that reason one seventh part less productive , we are far from thinking that such is in fact the case . We believe , on the contrary , that this is one of the instances m which two and two do not make four . Whether we consider labor as intended to produce the immediate result , wealth , or the more remote one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in saying , that we believe it becomes more instead of less productive by an occasional suspension . We all know that our faculties can not be kept forever on the stretch . Without the nightly intervention of that blessed thing , sleep , ' as Coleridge calls it , to suspend our toils and labors , soothe our cares , and recruit our strength , we should all , in a very short time , go mad and die . But the preservation of a sound , healthy , active and cheerful condition of our nature requires , in addition to this , an occasional suspension of labor for longer periods ; and it was , doubtless , in the kind view of accommodating his commrtnds to the constitution which he had given us , that the Creator prescribed the observance of a weekly day of rest . The man , who constantly pursues his worldly objects without allowing himself a moment 's leisure , gradually acquires , by a sort of moral gravitation , an accelerated and feverish intensity of action , which , if not checked in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin . By wholly diverting his thoughts one day in seven from business , and turning them upon the high and glorious subject of his intellectual and moral relations to God , his fellow-men , and the universe , he cools the fever of his mind ; and when he takes up his affairs again on Monday morning , he is surprised to find with how much clearer a judgment he considers the plans and purposes of which he took leave on Saturday . He now perceives errors , that before escaped his attention ,  --  rejects imprudent projects that before presented themselves in tempting colors to his heated fancy  --  and if his gains at the end of the week be one seventh less , they will probably at the end of the year , he seventy fold more . Instead of being a miserable bankrupt , he will be a thriving , healthy , happy man . We have no hesitation in saying that the fault we have here indicated of a too urgent // pursuit of worldly gain , is a common trait in the character of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath to repose and religious contemplation would be a most wholesome corrective of the evil . We strain every nerve to the utmost , employ every cent of capital that we own or can borrow , and not content with obtaining an honorable subsistence for ourselves and our families by the regular practice of our respective callings , grasp , with an agonising effort , at any project that holds out the least prospect of extraordinary gain . What follows ? A few persons amass immense fortunes , the possession of which has no very favorable effect upon their own characters , or those of their children . The rest-at the first little convulsion in the world of business-are swept-like dead leaves before a November blast-into the gulf of bankruptcy . It would be vain to deay that the general habits of our active men of every class correspond in the main with this description ; and it is , in our opinion , equally certain , that a real and bona-fide suspension of worldly cares one day in seven would greatly improve-were it only by its negative and sedative effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts and their disastrous results . It is , in short , clear to us , that the labor of the community-by being suspended one day in seven-becomes , not less , but on the contrary a great deal more productive of mere wealth , than it otherwise would be . But this view of the subject , however important , is by no means the most so of those which may be taken of it . The object of all this toil and trouble-these convulsive strainings and desperate enterprises-is after all the acquisition of the means of subsistence- ' meat , clothes , and fire , ' - nothing more . But this , though a legitimate object of pursuit in life , is far from being the only one . It belongs entirely to our lower and animal nature . The intellectual and moral principle  --  the God within the mind-that loftier and nobler portion of our being , by which we hold affinity with the Sublime Spirit that created and informs the universe-this too has its claims ; and they are of a far more urgent and momentous character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do them justice if our thoughts are forever absorbed , without the interruption of a day , an hour , a moment , in the routine of business ? Our intellectual and moral nature is refined and exalted by study , solitary musing , or instructive conversation on elevated subjects-by the interchange of kind // and charitable feelings-by the contemplation of the goodness of the Creator , as shewn forth in the majesty , harmony , and beauty of his works . If we mean to rise in the scale of being above the tools we work with , or the brute animals that we employ , we must allow ourselves time for these ennobling and delightful pursuits . The merchant must not nail himself forever to his counter like a bad shilling ; and the lawyer should remember that there is one Supreme Court in which his precedents will lose their authority , and his special pleas their importance-. that there is one case , and that his own , which he must finally argue upon its merits . Let it be enough , that the business of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Saturday night . When Sunday comes , let the weary be at rest-let the laborer of every kind cease from his toil , and go up to the house of God , not to ruminate upon the affairs of the preceding week , or to lay new plans for the coming one  --  but to yield up his whole soul to the current of lofty contemplations which the scene and the service are fitted to inspire  --  to feel the ravishing influence of sacred song  --  to indulge the devout aspirations that lift the humble spirit in holy trances to the footstool of the Almighty . Nor let him think it too hard , if in the mean time his letters remain unread in the Post-Office . They will not grow stale before tomorrow . His communion with GOD is of much more consequence than his correspondence with his agent or consignee . Whatever the mere man of business may think of it , this is , after all , a matter of high importance . Unless the deepest thinkers have erred in their conclusions from the most mature experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word of revelation be a lie " - it is certain that our mysterious nature is only one of the transitory forms of a permanent existence-that our lot hereafter will be determined forever by the use . that we make of our faculties here . As the tree falleth , so it must lie . ' If we voluntarily degrade our minds in this world to the level of the brutes , it is impossible that we can start in the race of eternity with so much advantage as others , who have done their best to strengthen , exalt and purify the intellectual and moral principle that survives the body . These are at once glorious and fearful truths . They are truths which the greatest sages and lawgivers of every age from Moses to Numa , and from Numa to Franklin , have kept in view in their political creations . No state of ancient or // modern times ever obtained any real stability , of which the government did not rest , in one way or another , on the steadfast and immovable rock of Religion . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way in which this salutary principle can produce its beneficial effects , is by its influence on public opinion ; and however much we may regret to differ from the very respectable committee , whose report we have been examining , and the writers who concur with them , we have no hesitation in expressing our conviction that the people of the United States have nothing better , in regard to their political concerns , to hope or wish , than that all their agents should be influenced in the exercise of temporal power by religious belief . This would not hring about , as the writer above alluded to supposes , without apparently attaching any very distinct meaning to the terms , a union of Church and State ; but it would procure us the blessing of Providence-a wise , liberal , efficient , and above all , honest administration of the government in all its branches  --  a condition of general and constantly progressive prosperity  --  and to sum up all in one word-peace . On reviewing the above , we perceive that we have omitted to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject comes properly within the jurisdiction of the State Governments ; but we can not think that the committee would themselves , on further reflection , maintain this doctrine . The regulation of Post-Offices and Post-Roads is plainly attributed by the letter of the constitution to the United States.
