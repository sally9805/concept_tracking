txt MANIFOLD are the perils , according to Madame de Stael , that beset the female writer who aspires to fame ; in a monarchy , she must expect to be assailed with the poisoned weapons of ridicule ; in a republic , with the formidable if less fatal enginery of universal hatred . But the remarks of this lady are not to be received as undisputed axioms ; they were apt to be suggested by her own feeling , rather than by observation of the world around her ; nor is there one of her many writings , in which she herself forgets , or suffers the reader to lose sight of her personal claims to sympathy . She said this in the bitterness of her heart , while , by the streams of Babylon , and amidst the serious privations that wait on exile , she remembered the place which she regarded as the wandering Hebrew did the Holy City , - the scene of her intellectural victories , the field in which alone she could encounter spirits as fiery and restless as her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peculiar , gives no just indication of the destiny awaiting others ; the burning track of the comet does not shew the unchanging orbit of a planet . Even her own fortunes were no fair illustration of the justice of her own remark . It was not her literary talent that exposed her to the ridicule or hatred , which she herself encountered ; it was not her philosophy or eloquence , that brought down upon her the ponderous vengeance of Napoleon ; she might have written till the twentieth century , without being driven out from the paradise of her affections ; it was rather the consuming passion for power and distinction , - // the fatal ambition of guiding the flashing wheels of the political revolutions of her own eventful day . It was when she concentrated the rays of her glorious intellect to consume the imperial throne , - when she spoke to the conqueror of the avenging judgment of the world and of posterity , - that he expressed his aversion to such recreations , and hastened to postpone the lecture to a more convenient season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy a page in his history , it was not without a secret consciousness that she would ask for nothing better ; the hurt of the dau : , hter of ambition might be mitigated , if not entirely healed , by the balm of general applause and sympathy . if the remark of Madame de Stael were well founded in its application to France , it would still have been destitute of justice as respects society elsewhere . There , the condition and influence of women have long been quite peculiar ; owing to an unusual social position , she has been conversant with subjects which are in other countries appropriated exclusively to man . From the time of Clovis to the Revolution , by an involuntary abrogation of the Salic law , the sceptre has often been consigned to female keeping by the weary , inefficient hands that held it . The personages thus selected as its guardians have sometimes bought this honor at the cost of better fame ; but the influence attending their position has been such , as to render the ibovements of the political machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on which the lips of English females would be sealed , have been canvassed ; schemes designed with fear of change to perplex their own and all the nations , have been ordinary topics of speculation in the saloons of Paris . Such a character as that of Madame de Stael , at home in the whirlwind and the storm , burning to ride in the one and direct the other , could have been formed nowhere else . She was herself aware of this ; and has given in her Corinna a picture of the English female character , as icy and repulsive as the summer of Prince Regent 's inlet ; a picture , which is indebted to her fancy for many of its darkest hues , but which very strongly shews the h6rror with which she looks upon the fetters of English propriety and reserve . Madame Roland is another example of the influences we have mentioned ; with less of brilliancy and ambition than her great contemporary , she was fired by a generous enthusiasm , combined with practical sense and talent , of which Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew little : but it was the opportunity presented for the exhibition of these qualities by the peculiar tone and feeling of French society , which made her the guiding spirit of a party , of which Guadet and Vergniaud were champions , and enabled her to shew a spirit and magnanimity superior to theirs . We may imagine the dismay of the coteries of London , if they were to see some English Madame Roland discussing affairs of state at a cabinet dinner in Downing street ; if it were suddenly disclosed to them , that the despatches of the foreign secretaries *Vere written by their wives , or that the Premier had poured into the ears of majesty the substance of a curtain lecture . But there have been within a century some great changes of opinion , not limited in their operation to France and England , which have : emoved the real or imaginary dangers attending the exhibition of female talent . It would be idle to talk of these perils , in communities not destitute of female critics , and full of female readers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been divided ; the sexes are beginning to share it pretty impartially ; nor would it be safe to say that woman 's portion of it is less fertile or less wisely governed than the other . We should hold him to be rather indiscreet , to say the least , who should at this day make the experiment of casting reproach or ridicule on female writers , unless the circumstances of the case were pretty aggravated ; if things shall continue to go on as they have done for the last twenty years , it is by no means certain that these writers will not constitute a majority of the whole number , and , acting in the spirit of the republican principle , manage matters at their own discretion . Those , who love to search out the literary characteristics of the time , and to read in the aspects of the heavens the movements of the intellectual constellations , will do well to watch the glittering train which are going up the sky , as the beautiful stats of the southern hemisphere lift themselves upon the view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidences of a change , entirely without a parallel in the history of literature ; which has already raised the intellectual glory of woman to a point of elevation , not before attained or even conceived , and bids fair to produce still more important changes in the universe of mind . If it had been revealed to some philosopher* of old , that the day should ever come , when the laurel wreaths of science , as well as the flower // garlands of romance and poetry , should entwine the brows of those whom he regarded as the painted insects of a summer day , no doubt he would have looked down with lofty scorn on the oracle and soothsayer ; nor would the poet of antiquity , we fear , have taken it in kindness , had he learned that woman , in the order of nature an inferior thing , in the order of society without rank or influence , should in coming years divide with him the jewels of his starry crown . But it were needless to go hack to distant ages to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who merely turns to the beginning of the last century in Great Britain , will obtain a sufficiently just idea of the difference in the state of female literature in our own day and the past . One might have expected that the reign of a female queen , fruitful as it was in literary talent , would give at least some indications of female power ; hut the age of Anne took little of its character from her whose name it bears . She was as inefficient a personage , as the best regulated limited monarchy could possibly have asked for ; and her reign brought no distinction to her sex ; with the exception of one or two , who gained a transient notoriety by their talent for political intrigue and mischief , there is no female who has given the historian the trouble to record her name . It was at the beginning of the reign of George I. , that Lady Mary Wortley Montagu burst upon the world in the full splendor of her wit and beauty . She was undoubtedly an extraordinary person ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her intellectual as well as personal attractions . it was no common mind , on which Pope exhausted his power of flattery in verse , and his hyperbole in prose ; he prostrates himself before her like an Indian idolater before the sun ; the depth and fervency of his devotion are quite too great to he entirely sincere , but they certainly shew in what general esteem the object of so much eulogy was held . At the period of their subsequent estrangement , he seemed afraid to avow himself her enemy ; Johnson declares that he meanly retreated before her , and disavowed the application of satires , the aim of which was plain enough to others ; and well he might ; she had the power and the will to repay such favors with ample liberality ; and the " little nightingale , - all sound and no sense , " as she bitterly called him , however he may stand in the eyes of posterity , fared no better in those of his own generation for his quarrel with // " that dangerous thing , a female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the praise of Young , and of the sarcasm of that prince of literary exquisites , Horace Walpole . Her reputation as a writer is principally founded on her letters ; they are certainly models of ease and grace , of keen observation and polished wit ; hut they elevate our respect for her understanding more than they exalt our estimation of her delicacy , and leave upon the reader no strong impression of any lofty traits of character . It is hut fair to say that the letters were not published by herself , nor even in her lifetime . The pupil of Burnet , the lady who translated the Enchiridion of Epictetus at twenty , might , had the moral purpose not been wanting , have been remembered as the glory of her age ; as it is , her memory is scarcely preserved , and is scarcely worth preserving . Lady Mary long survived her beauty , and lived in comparative retirement abroad for many years before her death . The only female writers of distinction , contemporaneous with her at the latter period of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright example of learning and unpretending piety , the other more remarkable for her influence in society than for her writings . Neither requires much notice as an instance of female literary success . Southey , in his specimens of English poetry , has endeavored to redeem some female poets of this generation from the tomb ; but it is impossible to imagine a more melancholy charnel-house than the edifice he has erected to their memory . Scott has also engaged in the same amiable task in the lives of the novelists ; but there is really little in the works of those whose hiographies he has recorded , to give them an abiding place in the public favor . Nor would one obtain an exalted idea of the influence or estimation of woman , from the novels of the last century , regarded as delineations of society ; such writers as Fielding and Smollet , to be sure , could hardly be expected to discover any examples of either , in the haunts they most frequented ; but in Richardson , we might expect , if anywhere , to1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally by their passive qualities , and attract us rather as objects of compassion , than from any power which they display over the minds of others . This is natural enough in general ; but in the many and massive works of such a painter , who was ambitious to copy nature , some portrait of woman in her most commanding // form would probably have been found , had his observation furnished him with the original of such a picture . The change , however long delayed , came at last , and the first decided sign of it appeared in the works of Fanny Burney . Ahout sixty years ago , she began to give to the world her animated pictures of society , full of contrasts as deep and striking , as that of the light and shadow of a portrait painted by torch-light . They were doubtless exaggerated , and were indebted to this depth of coloring for much of their effect ; but they were also pervaded by a spirit and freshness , which seem like the result of inspiration , when compared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was Evelina , and there are some curious anecdotes on record concerning its reception . " You must have it , Madam , " thundered Johnson to a female friend ; Edmund Burke sat up all night to read it ; Sir Joshua Reynolds refused to quit it for his dinner , and , after the fashion of Mr. Oldbuck , read and ate at the same time . " With flying colors , " as the author herself remarks in her late strange memoirs of her father , " the work went off . " " No imagination , " said Burke , " not even the imagination of Miss Burney ,  --  could have invented so extraordinary a character as that of Cardinal Xirneues : no pen ,  --  not even the pen of Miss Burney , - could have described it adequately . " Dr. Johnson , after exhausting his eloquence in praise of the work in a large company , proceeded from words to deeds , and set about personating Mr. Smith , one of the vulgar characters of the work , himself . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have died no other death than that of suffocation , on seeing Dr. Johnson handing about any thing he could catch or snatch at , and making smirking bows , saying he was all for the ladies , - every thing that was agreeable to the ladies , except going to church with them . ' " Certainly it was no ordinary work , that made such innovation in the brains of these grave personages . Cecilia came next , having been read and admired in manuscript by Mr. Burke before its publication . It was of this work that Lord Thurlow , when conducted into the library of a nobleman whom he was visiting , remarked , " What signify all your fine and flourishing books ! Here is a little work ( taking Cecilia from his pocket ) that 's worth them all I " We mention these circumstances , because , from the character of this lady 's later productions , one can scarcely form the least conception of that of her earlier ones , and because they serve // very strikingly to shew with what cordiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , and extravagance of coloring , strike one more forcibly on a second reading than the first ; hut they are certainly works of remarkable talent , considering the youth and position of the writer . Nearly at the same time was presented the strange apparition of a country girl , with no advantages of birth , and no unusual ones of education , the charm of whose conversation places her at once amidst the highest circles of the intellect and fashion of the capital ; before whom Johnson composes himself into unusual and reluctant courtesy , and Walpole bows down with instinctive homage ; who writes poetry , not of the very first order , but which the first minds of the day are contented to admire , and dramas , which win the rapturous applause of the pit and boxes ; who speaks to the sense and feelings of the multitude , when the clouds of revolution are gathering in their wrath , in tones the remembrance of which has long survived the excitement that gave them birth ; who next addresses her impressive lessons of morality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great ; and having done this , retires from the sphere she was thus fitted to adorn , in order to instruct the children of the poor ; to nourish in solitude the flame of her religious feeling , and make it burn with kind and gentle influence on others , through the closing years of a useful and protracted life . The wise and good of many nations pronounce with grateful reverence the name of Hannah More . It is difficult , at this day , to measure accurately the extent of her influence , great and well-defined as it undoubtedly was , because most of her writings were occasioned by temporary circumstances , and lost , of course , a portion of their interest with the changes of the times . But there is enough to shew , that she possessed the surest evidence of genius , the power to set its seal on other minds ; whether she wrote anonymously or under her own name , her writings were welcomed with equal earnestness , and produced equal effect ; and if we measure the degree of merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any superior writer of her age , in the field which she selected ; a field , which can hardly be said to be a popular one , and in which talent of no inferior order is required to command success . It was a more certain evidence of ability no less than virtue , that she gave her whole mind and heart to the highest and holiest cause , at a time when the world solicited her with // seductions , which too often tempt our nature beyond its strength . flow striking and how delightful is it , to see one to whom the literary princes of the earth did homage , retiring voluntarily from their brilliant circle to labor in a village school , in her quiet retreat at Cheddar ; cheerfully encountering the evil report of minds too narrow to comprehend her own ; and never pausing in her toil for the welfare of her race , even when pressed by the infirmity that is apt to make the kindest selfish , till her heart was cold in death ! The present age will do well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find no surer way to exalt its own . We come next to a name , on which the young and old , of this country as well as of her own , alike delight to dwell ; - the name of Maria Edgeworth ; who , by a fortunate exemption from the ordinary laws of exhaustion and decline , has lately reappeared before the public as a writer , with scarcely less vigor and success , than when thirty years ago she stood without a rival . It was about the beginning of the present century , that she began to pour forth , in beautiful succession , her diversified and striking tales of character and life , with invention as untiring as the eagle 's wing , and a generous purity of purpose , that flowed from an unfailing fountain . The earliest of her writings was published several years before . It was well that she should appear , while the star of Hannah More was in the ascendant ; they shew , by their remarkable and impressive example , that the modes of doing good are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though moving at almost the same point of elevation , in the same sphere , neither ever crossed the others ' track , or eclipsed the other 's light . The inspiration of the one was borrowed from fountains , that flow fast by the oracles of God ; her lips were touched with fire from high and holy altars ; and this consciousness of an exalted mission gave a corresponding dignity to her efforts , while the natural intensity of purpose which it produced , led her to convey her lessons in the form in which they could most directly reach the heart . The other went forth into the abodes of men , to draw them by gentle persuasion in the way of virtue ; not so much by shewing them its innate loveliness , as by convincing them how closely it was connected with their happiness and comfort , the only kind of conviction to which a large portion of mankind will condescend to listen ; and in doing this , she spread the sunlight of her generous feeling on all around her , making it shine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cliffs and mountains ; until many , who could not be induced to follow virtue for virtue 's sake , were content to do it for their own . We wish she had added to her other titles to admiration , that which is derived from the wisdom from above ; but we can not forget that while the name of Christianity never escapes her lips , she assiduously labors to promote one of its noble ends , and thus prepares a way , by which religion may gain an entrance into hearts , that never before gave it welcome . Each of these distinguished writers was employed in her own way in the lofty task of making , others better ; and they remind us of two instruments of music , the one responding to the winds of heaven , the other struck with the perfection of human skill , mingling together their delightful harmony . Both had in a high degree the power of reformers ; the direct and animated eloquence of one aroused the attention of those , on whose ear the warnings of religion had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of morality alluring to the eye , which had long been averted from the frigid portraitures of the writers that went before her . The range of Miss Edgeworth , great as it is , has very definite limits . She has a conscientiousness about her , which impairs her spirit , when she steps beyond the sphere of her own observation ; within it , she sees and describes with wonderful accuracy and truth , standing at the precise point of view at which every object is represented in the proper light , and in its just relative proportions . Her talent is obviously not adapted to the historical romance , because she does not possess the instinctive faculty of divining how those whom she has never seen , will think , and talk , and act , by studying the thoughts , conversation and actions of the persons with whom she is familiar . Some of the personages whom she has introduced into her novels , accordingly , are cold and formal ; like the bailiffs , introduced as gentlemen in Goldsmith 's Goodnatured man , who look their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprecation upon all Frenchmen and wooden shoes . On the other hand , her descriptions of Irish life and character are so spirited and vivid , that we never ask whether they are accurate ; we at once feel and know that they are true . In all that appertains to social and ordinary life , she goes below the stillness of the surface , and watches with unerring certainty the forcb and direction of the under currents , the efficient principles of action . The reader , therefore , surrenders himself at // discretion , because he finds every thing tine to nature , true to character , true to life , and is never harassed with those doubts , which sometimes destroy the moral effect of striking delineations . Then her magical invention illuminates the whole , with a radiance like that which our own landscape sometimes presents , when the leafless forest is encrusted with ice , and blazes like a fairy palace in the winter 's sun . How happily must the brilliant drapery of fiction be wrapped around the severe beauty of moral instruction , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and find a permanent dwelling-place in all memories ! When does mild philosophy appear more charming , than when she gracefully stoops to impress her precepts on the ear of infancy ? Had the present generation produced no other female writers than the two whose merits we have mentioned , it would still have furnished enough to shew , that the intellect of woman may possess commanding influence ; but the names of other illustrations of the remarks which we have made throng upon the recollection , and it would require a larger space than we can now command to do them anything like justice . Even in advanced age , we see Miss Baillie still tracing the fiery streams of passion to their sources , - searching into the hidden things of that dark mystery , the heart , - and arraying her startling revelations in the imposing garb of rich and classical poetry . Mrs. Somerville , going still farther beyond the province of inquiry , which custom has allotted to her sex , has invaded the domain of physical science with a power and comprehension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her native isle . Miss Martineau has also redeemed that sex from the class of unproductive laborers , by bringing the principles of political economy from the lecture-room and study to the fireside , until the public is ready to share the enthusiasm of the sailor , who exclaimed in reply to one applauding the beauty of the representations in Captain Parry 's arctic theatre , " Beautiful ! I say t is philosophy ! " We ought not to forget the graphic pencil of Miss Mitford , who seems to have imbibed a portion of the spirit of Miss Edgeworth , with independent excellencies of her own ; nor can we easily forget another , who has associated herself not ingloriously with the best modern poets of her country , and who has just descended to an immature and honored grave , at the moment when she might have been expected to do much more to render permanent a // reputation , which rose with every year of her life . The excel. * lencies of Mrs. Hemans were her own ; she imitated no one but herself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so much beauty of sentiment and language , that the associations she awakens are forever bound with them in the recollection of her readers . We are not awed by her power , but attracted rather by her tranquil grace , and still more by the purity , that runs through all her writings ; a quality , which certain commanding poets of our time have held in somewhat light esteem . She aimed at nothing bold and startling , but she accomplished every thing at which she aimed . Those who love to see the waters of poetry overhung by the dark masses of the cloud , or lashed by the tempest into wrath , or heaving and menacing at the very moment of their deepest repose , will find in her writings little to admire ; her course is that of a gentle stream , stealing through meadows carpeted with flowers , and cheerful , even when it flows beneath the depths of shade . While the literature of Great Britain has been thus adorned by female intellect , our own has not been slow to partake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woman 's literary effort , in proportion to the whole , is greater here , and has done more to elevate the national character and her own , than in any other country ; and it should be remembered that those who have labored longest have not yet reached the meridian of their powers , and that what they have already done is not to be taken as the full measure of what they have it in their power to do . When we speak of the female writers of our country , the heart , in the strong language of Johnson , " goes out to meet " Miss Sedgwick ; if no other had yet appeared among us , no other nation would have cause to boast its own superiority . To speak at large of her writings , would be about as superfluous as to gild refined gold , or paint the lily ; they are familiar already to every lover of truth and nature . Deep pathos , perpetual sympathy with all that is generous in feeling , and a keen insight into all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspire no less respect for her moral qualities , than admiration of her talent . To an inventive power and quickness in seizing the delicate shades of society , as well as in presenting them with perfect distinctness , inferior to that of Miss Edgeworth , she unites a faculty of description , and of giving reality and life to the character of // other times , which Miss Edgeworth does not possess , at least in the same degree of perfection ; and in one of the most recent cf her publications , to which we shall presently advert more fully , she has exhibited a power of conveying moral truth through the attractive medium of fictitious story , not surpassed by that of any other writer of the time . While she has wielded the sceptre of romance with so much grace and skill , she has been followed with no very unequal steps by other ladies , who share her talent and her name . The range of Mrs. Child is somewhat more diversified ; her first beautiful romance yields to no other , which is founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less at home in the graver department of biography ; and her fine powers have been applied , with equal skill and success , to the task of rendering instruction attractive to the young ; while , in the mean time , one of her publications gives portentous evidence that she has not sacrificed to literature the sublunary concerns of domestic economy . We owe to the graphic pen of Miss Leslie some of the most curiously wrought delineations of character and manners ; no Flemish paintings could be more truly colored or accurately drawn . Mrs. Hale has cultivated with success the sister branches of romance and poetry ; and , in another department , the name of Mrs. Farrar holds a distinguished place . It is , however , needless to pursue the enumeration of names , familiar to all readers . A very large amount of talent has been displayed in fugitive efforts , that deserve a record in more enduring forms . This is a very cursory view of the evidences of the change , of which we have been speaking* So great a change could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without producing some important changes in its spirit ; and in one respect , the alteration is already visible . By a beautiful illustration of justice , it appears to be reserved for woman to do for Christianity in some degree what Christianity did for her , when it raised her to her just position in the social scale , and enabled her to become a bright example of its own beatitude . Such have , accordingly , been the aim and tendency of female literature in general ; we may confidently believe that it will continue to be found on religion 's side ; and if such should be the fact , it would be treachery to the great purpose of our being not to welcome it , as a momentous and restoring power . Whoever believes that the ultimate end of science is to instruct , and that of poetry to please , mistakes the matter great // ly ; the true and only worthy object of literary effort , and all scientific research is , to purify the heart while they enlarge the mind , and thus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Source to which they owe their powers . Great minds have prostituted their high endowments to base and sordid purposes ; philosophers have labored with insane delight to degrade and vilify their nature ; historians have gone deep into the lore of ages to shew the sad condition of their race , and its still more wretched destiny ; the great masters of the lyre have invested sensuality with the robe and diadem of virtue ; but it is wisely ordained by Providence , that they shall forfeit permanent and enviable fame , while they thus abuse their trust . The only glory to be won by such unholy means is poor and perishable ; it can not strike its roots deep , and spread forth its giant arms , so as to resist the waste and storms of centuries . The writer , who expects the future generations to rise up and call him blessed , who would add his name to those of the great benefactors of mankind , whose memory shall not fail , must inscribe it on the rock of ages . These are truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than man , from whose memory the pride of intellect or the hope of applause , so frequently obliterates them . If such is to be the religious character of female writers , their moral influence will of course be great and happy ; this result is equally assured by their social position , and their prevailing qualities of mind and heart . The spirit of man is militant , and whatever be the cause he is engaged in , strikes for victory ; passion sweeps over his purest purposes , and leaves the heart a desert ; interest , the god of this world , takes possession of the abandoned dwelling-place ; rivalry and envy blight , like a summer frost , his generous emotions ; and vanity , the gilded serpent , whispers her temptations not vainly in his ear . It was remarked by Edmund Burke , that nothing in this world is so hard as the heart of a thorough-bred metaphysician ; but the same petrifying effect is visible in every pursuit , by which fame and honor are to be won ; because the whole mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single object , an object frequently without relation to the welfare of others . The spirit of philanthropy sometimes takes possession of the bosom . Then the dreams of ambition vanish , the iron grasp of avarice is relaxed . Then the missionary of humanity traverses the arctic snows , and the burning waste ; flies to the // sickly vapors of the prison , and buries himself in the anticipated grave of the hospital ; shrinks from no privation , smiles at all danger , wherever there is evil to he averted , or good to he done ; and if the cause demand the sacrifice , the victim is ready for the altar or the stake . Surely there is nothing in the world more commanding , than this fierce energy of the human mind ; - nothing nobler , when it takes the form of dazzling and enthusiastic virtue ; nothing more absorbing or intense than this stern devotion of the soul , even to a selfish object . But it is not from lips that are sounding forth the war-cry of passion , whether good or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ; it is not thus that one mind becomes qualified to commune with another with mild and salutary influence ; least of all , to speak to the young heart in tones that shall win it to the love of virtue . The mind , thus absorbed , stands separate from others by its solitude or elevation . But the gentle voice of woman addresses that heart , when its earliest thoughts may be easily inclined to good , in the soothing accents of interest and tenderness , in the fireside lesson , in the music of the infant hymn ; before it has gone forth to wrestle with temptation , but not before the education for eternity is begun . It speaks to the maturer mind in those accents of truth and reason , which are heard amidst the conflict of contending passions ; and which , however unheeded , are repeated from the opening of life till its last sun goes down . By a peculiar happiness of position , she is in a great degree removed from the influence of those infirmities of the mind , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its power ; as if the delirium of fever were an indication of the usual temperament , or the fierce effort of convulsion the measure of our ordinary strength . She can not comprehend , how the intelligent and haughty can he brought to wear the iron fetters of political party with no less triumph , than if they were badges of sovereignty , instoad of slavery ; she is slow to understand , how the Christian can obey to the letter all the commandments , except the one expressly given by the Author of his faith ; she is reluctant to believe the humiliating truth , that the applause of mankind is to be won by employing the gifts of God in hostility to Him who gave them . We may surely venture to indulge the hope , that her influence will mitigate the wild excitement of the chase for wealth and fame , tranquillize the angry passions which constantly rebel against the necessary ills of our condition , and // convinca men that the way of wisdom is the way of pleasantness and peace . We know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the power of woman 's intellect may be thus exerted , than is presented in Miss Sedgwick 's little tale , entitled " Home . " For ourselves , we should hold the applause which she had won before in light esteem , compared with the consciousness , which the effect of this touching story must have given her , of her power to do good . With a single exception , in which a practical lesson is inculcated at variance with the opinions of large portions of the community , we know no production , in which the soundest moral lessons are more attractively conveyed . Its scenes and pictures are generally of a kind , which no writer of the other sex could have exhihited with half so strong and affecting an impression ; - they are family L ) ictures , - fireside scenes , - and their images rise up before us , with all those associations , the first to enter and the last to leave the heart , which entwine and cling around the venerable name of home . If anything could render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happiness of others , it must be works like this . They will win for their accomplished author a more enduring title to the public gratitude , than any that romance or poetry can give ; and if her whole attention should henceforward he exclusively applied to them , she would only enhance her pure and exalted fame . With such examples before us of what female talent can accomplish , as those to which we have alluded , we can not well point to any literary department , in which it is likely henceforth to be exclusively displayed ; for even while we are engaged in speculating in regard to its capacities , they may be developed in novel forms and to a hitherto unknown extent . A few years ago , no one would have indicated scientific research , as likely to become the field for their exertion . It may probably , however , be safely assumed , that those branches which belong to the province of imagination , are those to which woman will be most inclined by her prevailing taste and qualities ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches , the fashion of the day has attached unusual interest to romantic fiction ; and there is no doubt that this , under the guid uce of true observation and sound principle , may be an active handmaid of virti*e . Those who are most // inclined to doubt its value , object to it on the ground of what all admit to be its abuse and imperfection ; nobody denies that false representations of life and character are of pernicious tendency , but it is far from following , that just ones are injurious also . On the contrary , they stand to us in the stead of experience , by connecting causes with their consequences , and presenting moral results , often more directly than we can trace them in real life ; nor is it an evil that this is done in an attractive way ; if ornament be necessary to captivate and gratify , we know not why morality should scorn to wear it . Some of the most instructive lessons , and those which come the nearest to the heart , are to be drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , when they are without fidelity to nature ; and this sort of truth is one of those graces , which romance has been much too slow to acquire , and too ready to part with . One may as well study human nature in Gulliver or Peter Wilkins , as in the greater portion of our novels . We may anticipate with confidence , that much female talent will take this direction , and that , combined with the keen observation and power of description with which it is rarely unaccompanied , it will raise the standard of excellence in this branch of literature , while it accomplishes real and extensive good . There is one thing which woman may certainly effect in it ; she may do her own sex justice ; a point on which the novelists of the other sex have not been very scrupulous ; and when a striking example of female character is wanted , she may create a Belinda or Lady Geraldine , instead of a Meg Merrilies or Norna . In poetry , too , she may find a fit province for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will in other climates grow . Her eye may not look with piercing brightness through the lower clouds , and gaze undazzled on the seraphim around the throne ; she may not send forth strains of more than mortal depth and fulness , like the few , who have been invested with angelic attributes below ; but her voice will be heard in those aspirations for higher things , - in those breathings of a lovely and confiding spirit , - which shew what poetry is , when it fulfils its worthy office of withdrawing the mind from the earthly and material , to fix it on that which is spiritual and undying . In short , she may display her happy and improving influence in all those branches of literature , which are most nearly connected with the welfare of mankind , and tend to exalt and dignify our nature ; and thus // redeem them from the discredit in which they are apt to be involved , by the unworthiness of those who abuse , while they pretend to cultivate them . The two ladies , whose writings we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our expectations are not wholly groundless . About twenty years ago , at the very outset of our critical labors , the earliest publication of Mrs. Si . gourney , then Miss Iluntley was reviewed in this journal . It was considered as evincing much real merit and still greater promise , and derived an additional claim to attention from the circumstances under which it was prepared ; circumstances reflecting so much credit on the author , that a slight allusion to them here will not be thought indelicate . She was indebted for her education to her own exertions ; in early life she had none of the advantages , which affluence and leisure can bestow ; yet , under the pressure of various inconveniences , she cultivated with success the art to which she owes her fame . It remained to be seen , whether , under other and more favorable circumstances , she would retain the same inclination , and go on improving in the way to which her youthful tastes inclined her . This was by no means certain ; many are the ladylike accomplishments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown aside with infinite satisfaction , at certain eventful stages in life 's journey ; but the reputation she has since acquired has been so general , that we need hardly say how our hopes have been fulfilled . Without devoting her attention exclusively to poetry , or engaging in the composition of any extensive work , Mrs. Sigourney has continued from time to time to give to the public , principally through the medium of the magazines and annuals , a variety of productions , by which she has acquired a high rank as a popular and useful writer . The volume before us is a collection of the poetical productions , which the author has thought proper to publish in a more permanent form . Some of its contents were written at a very early age ; others , as she herself assures us , were composed at later periods , amidst domestic occupations or maternal cares ; and the greater portion of them were suggested by passing circumstances , and may be regarded as extemporary in their nature . She describes them " as the wild flowers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clefts of the rock ; " but we feel ourselves entitled to assure her , that they will neither bloom like the wild flowers in solitude , nor fade as // soon ; they will be more likely to be numbered among the lasting favorites of the garden . Such writings do not ask nor admit of the display of some of the very highest attributes of poetry , and to these Mrs. Sigourney presents no claim . The excellence of all her poems is quiet and unassuming . They are full of the sweet images and bright associations of domestic life ; its unobtrusive happiness , its unchanging affections , and its cares and sorrows ; of the feelings naturally inspired by life 's vicissitudes from the cradle to the death-bed ; of the hopes that burn , like the unquenched altar fire , in that chosen dwelling place of virtue and religion . The light of a pure and unostentatious faith shines around then , blending with her thoughts and giving a tender coloring to her contemplations , like the melancholy beauty of our own autumnal scenery . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her eye looks beyond them to the habitation of the disembodied spirit ; sometimes she muses at the eventide , and the forms of the loved and lost are present to her view ; presently she carries us to the domestic fireside , and while dwelling on its blessings , points to the great Source from which they flow ; again , we see the mother at the bedside of her dying boy , or herself extended on the bed of death , - and the lofty aspirations of the Christian faith invest the verse with a dignity appropriate to their own sublimity . Mrs. Sigourney 's habitual tone of thought is pensive , but not melancholy ; serious , but not severe ; and her views of life , without being joyous , are not shaded by repulsive gloom . Every subject she touches is made the fountain of calm reflection , which is often striking , and always pure . If she do not often excite the reader to enthusiastic admiration , she generally leaves a strong impression of her power , and never fails to inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Si , ourney 's versification is , in general , correct and sweet ; although , in this respect there are occasional instances of want of care . The effect of short pieces , like the greater part of her 's , very much depends upon the delicacy and perfection of their finish ; in those of greater magnitude , the attention is withdrawn from minute defects , or they are lost in a comprehensive survey of the general proportions ; as an imperfection , which would pass unheeded in a panorama , is at once detected in a cabinet picture . Her writings in blank verse are , however , remarkable for the music of their flow . In their // style of thought and expression , they remind us of those passages of Cowper , where the movement of the verse is in perfect keeping with the gravity and tenderness of the subject . Like him , she is attracted only by Nature 's soothing and gentle aspects ; her spirit holds no communion with the elements in their wrath ; she takes no delight in witnessing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons , as they change , not to people them with images of gloom , hut to draw from them whatever of happiness and instruction they can give . A voice of praise is uttered in her Winter Hymn ; the beautiful drapery of the woods in autumn reminds her less of approaching decay , than of the newness of life which is to follow . We could not desire that the moral influence of her writings should be other than it is ; while she pleases the fancy , she elevates the heart . Great as Mrs. Sigourney 's merit certainly is , she has not yet displayed it with so much effect as she may and will do , if she shall be inclined to render poetry a more exclusive object of pursuit . Thus far , it has evidently been little more than the amusement of her leisure hours ; with less divided attention , she has the power of accomplishing higher and better things . The productions before us are ornaments , wrought without much effort by taste and ingenuity ; they resemble the lighter works , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can spare from his severer labors . Whenever , instead of limiting her range to that portion of the atmosphere which can be traversed with a light and careless wing , she shall prepare herself for an adventurous flight , she can not fail to gain a permanent place in the public favor . As an illustration of her sensibility to natural beauty , and of the grace with which she describes it , we extract " A Cottage Scene . " " I saw a cradle at a cottage door , Where the fair mother with her cheerful wheel Carolled so sweet a song , that the young bird , Which timid near the threshold sought for seeds , Paused on his lifted foot , and raised its head , As if to listen . The rejoicing bees Nestled in throngs amid the woodbine cups , That o'er the lattice clustered . A clear stream Came leaping from its sylvan height , and poured Music upon the pebbles , - and the winds , // Which gently mid the vernal branches played Their idle freaks , brought showering blossoms down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary commerce with the heartless world , But when I felt upon my withnred cheek My mother nature 's breath , - and heard the trump Of those gay insects , at their honied toil Shining like winged jewelry , - and drank The healthful odor of the flowering trees And bright-eyed violets ; - but most of all , When I beheld mild slumbering Innocence , And on that young maternal brow the smile Of those affections which do purify And renovate the soul , I turned me back In gladness , and with added strength to run My weary race ; - lifting a thankful prayer To Him who shewed me some bright tints of Heaven Here on the earth , that I might safer walk And firmer combat sin , and surer rise From earth to Heaven . " The following lines , written C* on seeing the deaf , dumb and blind girl sitting for her portrait , " afford a just idea of the natural and pleasing sentiment , with which the author knows how to invest her subjects . There is apparently an imperfection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide thee , artist ! Though thy skill Can make the enthusiast 's passion tear , And catch expression 's faintest thrill , What power shall prompt thy pencil here ? She hath no eye , - God quenched its beam ; No ear , - though thunder 's trump be blown , No speech , - her spirit 's voiceless stream Flows dark , unfathomed and unknown . Yet hath she joys , though none may know Their germ , their impulse , or their power ; And oft her kindling features glow In meditation 's lonely hour , Or when unfolding blossoms breathe Their fragrance neath a vernal sky , Or feeling weaves its wild-flower wreath As some remembered friend draws nigh , // Then doth the heart its love reveal , Though lip and eye are sealed the while , And then do wildering graces steal To paint their language on her smile . For still the undying soul may teach Without a glance , a tone , a sigh , And well canst thou its mirrored speech Interpret to the wondering eye . What though her locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason fails to find A clue to that untravelled shrine , Yet may thine art with victor sway Win laurels from this desert wild , And to a future age portray Mysterious nature 's hermit child . " Several of the remarks , which we have made in reference to Mrs. Sigourney , will apply with equal justice to Miss Gould . This lady has been for some years very favorably known , chiefly by the fugitive pieces which she has contributed to many of our most popular periodical works . Within a year or two , she has collected these and published them in a separate volume , which has already received a very strong expression of the general sentiment in its favor , by the demand for a third edition , a compliment very rarely paid in our generation to any of the sons or daughters of song . One of the principal attractions of her writings is their perfect freedom from pretension ; she composes without the slightest effort to do more than to express her own thoughts in the most unaffected language ; in this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do by laborious effort . The sin of affectation is the one , which most easily besets the poet , for the reason that it wears the air of novelty ; whoever undertakes to describe feelings which we have never experienced , and to express sentiments which have rarely figured in verse before , or even to clothe familiar ideas and feelings in a masquerade dress , will be pretty sure to attract admiration , until the public have had time to detect his borrowed plumage , when he is likely enough to be dealt with according to the most rigorous canon of the law . In this respect , Miss Gould never offends ; sbe is uniformly faithful to // nature . Like Mrs. Sigourney , she gathers the wild flowers of the rock and deli ; and she does more ; she collects those which many pass by unnoticed , as too common and familiar to he entitled to a place in an ornamental garland ; but she looks upon them as the works of God , and fitted to convey a strik. ' ing and impressive moral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome beauty wherever it is tobe found , with- ' out regard to the rarity or estimation of the oliject in which it dwells . It is , doubtless , the secret of her popularity ; she sees in the retiring ground-laurel , the no less timid anemone , the crocus in its snowy winding-sheet , the hyacinth bursting from its temporary grave , the emblems of our own vicis-* situdes . Nothing in nature is without its moral lesson ; she finds instruction in the solitary snowflake , the little bower of violets , the forsaken nest of the bird , and even in the breast-pin , the lost kite , and the playthings of infancy . But tones of deeper feeling come forth from the winter funeral1 the prayer of the broken-hearted , the empty bierby the churchyard gate , the soul 's farewell to its earthly prison . These are some of the diversified subjects on which she loves to dwell she invests them with sentiment and imagery , sometimes familiar , sometimes new , but always in harmony with true and amiable feeling , and awakening associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investing the objects around us with moral associations may be too freely exercised , and there are some instances in the volume before us in which the familiar sinks into the homely , and the rock is struck in the unreasonable hope , that the living waters of poetry will flow ; but such instances are very rare , and scarcely cast a shade over the good taste and excellent feeling , which characterize her writings . Several imitations of the Scottish are given at the close of the volume . They are not , as respects the truth and beauty of the sentiment , inferior to the rest ; but there is not one of them that would not appear to more advantage in an English dress . The Scottish dialect comes gracefully from the lips of Burns , because it was his own , and because he wrote for the peasantry of Scotland ; but it loses all its beauty , when it ceases to be natural , and is then entitled to no higher praise than that which is due to an easy imitation . We never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which circumstances have given popularity , without regret ; it is so rarely witnessA // in Miss Gould , that we allude to it now , rather in reference to others than to her ; excepting in the single particular which we have mentioned , it is one from which she is wholly free ; but it is quite too common , and involves an error of the same sort , as an imitation of the gait or dress ; for the very peculiarities , so assiduously imitated , are invariably the least attractive characteristics , and not unfrequently the most serious defects of the model . The following lines , on the subject of " The Lily , " present an interesting specimen of the style and sentiment of the author . " Imperial beauty ! fair , unrivalled one ! What flower of earth has honor high as thine - To find its name on his unsullied lips , Whose eye was light from heaven ? In vain the power Of human voice to swell the strain of praise Thou hast received ; and which will ever sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs shall die as summer winds That wafting off thine odors , sink to sleep ! I will not praise thee , then ; but thou shalt be My hallowed flower ! The sweetest , purest thoughts Shall cluster round thee , as thy snowy bells On the green , polished stalk , that puts them forth * I will consider thee , and melt my cares In the bland accents of His soothing voice , Who , from the hill of Palestine , looked round For a fair specimen of skill divine ; And , pointing out the Lily of the field , Declared the wisest of all israel 's kings , In his full glory , not arrayed like thee ! " There is an air of originality in the following lines . Their title , " The Consignment , " is not , perhaps , sufficiently descriptive of their character . " Fire , my hand is on the key , And the cabinet must ope ! I shall now consign to thee Things of grief , of joy , of hope .. Treasured secrets of the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must thou impart , But reduce them all to dust* // This , - in childhood 's rosy morn1 This was gaily filled and sent . Childhood is forever gone ; Here , - devouring element . This was friendship 's cherished pledge ; Friendship took a colder form ; Creeping on its gilded edge , May the blaze be bright and warm . These , - the letter and the token , Never more shall meet my view ! When the faith has once been broken1 Let the memory perish too ! This , - t was penned while purest joy Warmed the heart and lit the eye ; Fate , that peace did soon destroy , And its transcript now will I. This must go ! for , on the seal , When I broke the solemn yew , Keener was the pang than steel ; T was a heart-string breaking too ! Here comes up the blotted leaf , Blistered o'er by many a tear . Hence , thou waking shade of grief Go , forever disappear ! This is his , who seemed to be High as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , and he , - Spare , Oh memory ! spare the sight Of the face that frowned beneath , While I take it , hand and name , And entwine it with a wreath Of the purifying flame ! These , - the hand is in the grave , And the soul is in the skies , Whence they came ! T is pain to save Cold remains of sundered ties . Go together , all , and burn , Once the treasures of my heart ! Still , my breast shall be an urn To preserve your better part ! " A portion of the contents of this volume is designed for the entertainment and instruction of the young . The pieces to which we allude are full of simple beauty , and are well adapted to produce a pleasing and salutary impression on the mind // Since its publication , we have seen in various journals poems from the pen of Miss Gould , superior in spirit and elegance to any which it contains .

ART . IX . Thomas Carlyle . Sartor Resartus : in three Books . Reprinted for friends , from Fraser 's Magazine . London . 1834 . THIS little work , which , as the title-page informs us , was first published in successive portions in Fraser 's Magazine , comes before us under rather suspicious circumstances . It purports to be a sort of commentary , by an anonymous writer , on a late work upon the Philosophy of Dress , or Clothes , by Dr. Diogenes Teufelsdroeckh , Professor of the Science of Things in General at the University of Weissnichtwo in Germany . The commentator represents himself as having made the acquaintance of this writer , some years ago , on a visit to the place of his residence ; and giv*s a pretty full description of his personal habits and character , to which we may advert hereafter . Some time after his return , the commentator , or , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German friend a copy of the work just alluded to , the title of which , at full , is as follows : Die Kleider , ihr Werden und Wirken , ( Clothes , their origin and influence , ) von Diogenes Teufelsdroeckh J. U. D. *c . Stillschweigen and Co . Weissnichtwo . The volume was accompanied by a number of the Weissnichtwo'sche Anzeiger , containing a notice of it in the following favorable terms . " Here comes a volume of that extensive close-printed , close-meditated sort , which , be it spoken with pride , is seen only in Germany , perhaps only in Weissnichtwo ; issuing from the hitherto irreproachable firm of Stillschweigen and Co. with every external furtherance , it is of such internal quality , as to set neglect at defiance . A work , " concludes the well-nigh enthusiastic reviewer , " interesting alike to the antiquary , the historian , and the philosophical thinker ; a master-piece of boldness , lynxeyed acuteness , and rugged , independent Germanism and philanthropy , ( derben **31;540;TOOLONG MR . WORCESTER *5 not one of those persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , he appears to love hard work for its own sake , and to be led by inclination to those objects of pursuit , in which most men are with diffie*ulty induced to engage by the urgency of some controlling motive . We have already had occasion more than once to draw the attention of our readers to the results of his industry . Nearly twenty years ago , he became known to the public by his geographical researches . His Universal Gazetteer was // published in 1817 , and a second edition of it but a few years after . This was a very comprehensive and valuable work . and met with as favorable a reception , as could well be anticipated for any of the same dimensions ; indeed , we are inclined to believe that the author would find his account in pub- ' lishing another edition of it at the present time , with such improvements arid additions as the change of circumstances might require . To this succeeded a Gazetteer of the United States , and the Elements of Geography ; the last obtained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used in many of our schools as a manual of the branch of science of which it treats . All the publications which we have named required a minute accuracy , as well as a wide extent of investigation ; the character which they all acquired sufficiently shews that they were executed with judgment and ability ; for this is a department , in which the deficiencies of an author are not to be concealed for any length of time , and are by no means easily forgiven . To these succeeded the Elements of History and the Historical Atlas . Passing from this field , in which his success had been quite flattering , Mr. Worcester entered upon another , not less laborious , nor demanding less attention and fidelity , - that of a lexicographer . The first results of his labor in this line were displayed by his publication of Johnson 's Dictionary , as improved by Todd and abridged by Chalmers . While engaged in the preparation of that work , he formed the plan of the Comprehensive Dictionary , which is now before us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , in consequence of an engagement into which he had entered to prepare an abridgment of the American Dictionary of Dr. Webster . When he had completed this engagement , he resumed his own plan , and published the work about five years ago . Several impressions of it have since been called for , and he has repeatedly revised and enlarged it with much expense of time and labor , until it has assumed the form in which it now appears . The Elementary Dictionary is the last of his publications . In the mean time , Mr. Worcester is understood to have been the editor of the American Almanac , since the first year of its publication , and to have prepared all its contents , with the ex ception of the astronomical department ; and this is no mean title to distinction ; for there are very few works , in which so // mu*h * of a kind not easily accessble , is presented with so much authenticity . In all his publications , he has exhibited a conscientious love of accuracy , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in the estimation of those who e favorable judgment in matters of the sort is most to be desired . We confess that we look with respect upon men of industry and talent , who are willing to devote themselves to the investigation of subjects , in which the exhibition of those qualities is very slow to be appreciated , because there is little in the result of their researches calculated to strike the imagination . To one who reflects upon the importance of preserving our language in a state of purity , it is really surprising to see with how little compunction men are willing to murder it , or at least to subject it to relentless torture ; and how little gratitude they entertain for those , who teach them to save their credit , by conducting themselves with more humanity . It is no easy matter to arrest and prosecute to judgment the foreign interloping words , particularly French ones , which are perpetually intruding themselves into our language . where their absence is much preferable to their company , , with the aid , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to exhibit more patriotism and more discretion ; but an achievement of this sort , wearisome though it be , is even more exciting than the task of pursuing doubtful etymologies far back into the dim regions of departed tongues , of establishing the local habitation of controverted accents , or of ettling the questionable claims of suspicious letters to the residence in particular words , which they may have gained by accident or usage . The results of assiduous toil in this department of philology* valuable and even necessary as they are , are apt to he fatiguing to the laborer , . while they are not very imposing in the eyes of others . When , therefore , we see a man like Air . Worcester , willing to engage in it with the intensity of purpose , and fidelity of execution , that he brings to every subject upon which he enters , we owe him something more than a cold and formal acknowledgment ; he is entitled to receive at least a portion of the commendation , which is not unfrequently bestowed by the public upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of any such standard to preserve the purity of language as the French // Academy have established for their own1 and having no reason to anticipate that any authoritative one will soon be provided , we must be content to rely , like our English brethren , upon tl ) e authority of individuals , whose influence in the estimation of the community will be proportioned to their talent , diligence , and devotion to their task . Among these mdi viduals , a high place xviii be assigned , by common consent , to the author of the work before us . Mr. Worcester 's object , in undertaking to prepare his Cornprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary , was tn remedy certain defects , which appeared to him to exist in the works of a similar kind , generally used in our schools . rrlie most prominent of these deficiencies were found in the number of words which these dictionaries contained , and in their definitions and rules of pronunciation . He has adopted the works of Johnson and Walker as the basis of his own ; but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critical Pronouncing Dictionary of the latter . A large number of technical terms employed in the various arts and sciences are given , with their appropriate definitions ; so are also many of the words from other languages familiarly used by English writers , but their foreign origin is at the same time indicated , and in various instances , the American or provincial uses of terms are pointed out . These are points , respecting which a dictionary is constantly consulted , and on which a deficiency of information is quite embarrassing to the reader . The advantages to be derived from the pronouncing . vocabularies of scriptural , classical and modern geographical names , are quite obvious . There is , also , a copious vocabulary of words of various or doubtful orthography , accompanied by remarks and rules relating to that subject . The volume is very convenient in form , and contains about four hundred pages , pnnted in a very clear and handsome type . Mr. Worcester appears to have been particularly solicitous to render his work useful as a pronouncing dictionary , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , has been very widely felt . Owing to the circumstances which we shall presently mention , he has not attempted to establish his own work as such , in the many doubtful cases which are constantly occurring , and it is probable that if he , or any other person , should undertake to do this , the attempt would // be wholly unsuccessful . His system of notation , which fur. - nishes the key to the sounds of the letters , is in some respects peculiar ; but it is as exact as any system of the kind can well be made , and imposes no great burden on the memory ; in point of preciseness , it appears to us to possess advantages over every other . As a general rule , he has adopted Walker 's system of pronunciation , without hesitating to deviate from it where it seemed to him to be required . He has chosen to give words of various or doubtful pronunciation , as they are pronounced by several of the most approved orthoepists ; selecting in the first place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , and then presenting other modes , together with the authorities by which they are respectively sustained . This course may be objected to by some , on the ground that it embarrasses the learner , by referring the choice among the various authorities to his own discretion ; but it appears to us less liable to just exception than any other would have been , and more likely to give general satisfaction , because the reader can endure with much more patience to have a question referred to his own decision , when the best means of forming a judgment are set before him , than to have a particular view of it presented as the only one he is at liberty to adopt . It appears , too , to in. - dicate that Mr. Worcester has pursued his researches in a proper spirit , without undertaking to dictate , or to rely on his own judgment too exclusively . There is no other acknowledged standard of correct l ) ronlmnciation , than that which is afforded by the usage of intelligent and refined society ; but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes even in the same place ; what one regards as of unquestionable authority , another may declare to be sustained by no authority at all . It will hardly answer for a lexicographer to set up his own opinion , as an infallible standard of right , the imposing dignity of the conscience of the lord chancellor did not prevent Selden from comparing it , as respects its fitness for a standard , with the foot of the same learned personage . Had Mr. Worcester chosen , in all doubtful cases , to select a partico. - lar mode of pronunciation , and to adhere to it without noticing the modes recommended by others , lie would probably have satisfied nobody ; those who might agree with him in regard to the pronunciation of one word , would have condemned his mode as applied to a thousand others . // The subject of orthography is not without its perplexities . They were felt and lamented by Johnson nearly a century ago ; in the remarkable preface to his dictionary , he mourns over them with an affecting solemnity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cost him . His task was undoubtedly a more serious one than that of any of his successors ; because before his day there existed no English dictionary , of authority in the slightest degree approaching to that of his own great work ; and the mighty lawgiver was sorely troubled to reduce his discordant and rebellious materials into any thing like uniformity ; but there is still a serious toil awaiting those , who undertake to reform his code , and apply it to tile exigencies of the present time . Take , for example , the question of the propriety of using the letter u in words which terminate in or or our ; no great matter , perhaps , but one which illustrates the difficulty to which we refer . We avail ourselves of the research of Mr. Worcester to shew the want of harmony among the various lexic%raphers , as respects the introduction of this hapless letter . Johnson , as a general rule , retains it in the class of words just mentioned ; he even goes so far as to introduce it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior and posterior , which would seem to be quite as well entitled to it as the others , his heart appears to fail him , and he drops it . Entick excludes it from those words which are of direct Latin origin , but retains it in many others , derived from other sources ; in the word arbour he inserts it , and gives armor and savor according to both forms . The compilers of some dictionaries have chosen , as the safer course , to follow the example of Johnson ; but most of the later ones , as well as most writers of the present day , retain the letter only in a few instances . Dr. Webster , with a strict regard to uniformity , omits it wholly . Mr. Worcester has adopted the same course , but gives those who are dissatisfied with it the means of ascertaining and applying the rules of others . His remarks upon the subject of orthography are just as well as valuable ; and his vocabulary of words of various or doubtful orthography , taken in cdnnexion with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learner , as any exposition which could be easily devised . The vocabulary of Greek and Latin proper names , which is appended to the dictionary , is founded on a plan similar to that // of Walker 's Key to the pronunciation of such names , but is more complete and accurate . That of geographical names is still more valuable . Mr.Worcester , in preparing it , felt the very serious difficulties arising from the want of established usage in regard to a very large portion of the names , the disagreement of various authorities , and the uncertainty to what extent the English analogy should be followed , where it varies from the foreign in respect to the names of places in other countries . these difficulties render it impossible for any person to devise a system , that will not he open to objection . Mr. Worcester offers his own , as he observes , " with much diffidence , yet not without hope that , imperfect as it is , it may nevertheless he found of some use . " Imperfect it undoubtedly is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible that it should be otherwise ; but it has evidently been prepared with great care and judgment ; and will he found very convenient atid useful , by all who have occasion to refer to it . It will not lead to entire accuracy of pronunciation , because no one can say , in reference to many of these tiames , what perfect accuracy is ; but it will tend to remove much of the perplexity which almost every person must have felt , arising from his uncertainty respecting the pronunciation of words of almost hourly recurrence . Without entering more at large into the consideration of the manner , in which this work is executed , we may say , that it gives evidence of the sound judgment and diligent research of its author , as well as of his philosophical spirit . Thie testimonials of its excellence are very numerous , and we douht not that every one who may have occasion to examine or to use it , will concur in the opinion they express.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
