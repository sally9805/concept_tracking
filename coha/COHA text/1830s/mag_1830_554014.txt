txt THE author of this book is certainly a sprightly , sensible , well informed traveller , with great activity of observation , a good talent at narration , and not deficient in the power of presenting scenes and objects to the reader 's imagination . In October , 1826 , he finds himself at Perpignan in the South of France , which he is the more willing to leave behind for Spain , as he had been disappointed in the scenery , and especially , what he expected to find the most delightful , the vineyards , which , instead of answering to the brilliant picture he had fancied , appeared very like our bean-fields or hop-fields ; and as the cold north wind had withered and scattered the vine leaves , and the props , which answer to our bean-poles or hop-poles , had been removed to he housed for the winter , the prospect of the naked fields offered no charms to detain him from passing the Pyrenees . He found little of the Arcadia which he had imagined in this part of France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful ; their glowing eyes and arch expression denoted intelligence and passionate feeling ; while their ruddy hue and symmetric conformation gave assurance , that they were both healthy and agile . ' In short , // they were very much like the women of many other places , especially those of Spain , whom our youthful traveller omits no occasion of admiring and celebrating , and , we should say , with some excess of enthusiasm , without , however , intending any offence to the Spanish women , who , as well as those of Rousillon , are , we have no doubt , most fascinating creatures . ' After being warned over night by an old stationary French captain , at the same inn , of the necessity of being robbed and assassinated in Spain , he finds himself , before daylight in the morning , rattling over the drawbridge of Perpignan , occupying a part of one of the three compartments of that ample portable structure , a French diligence , drawn by two wheel-horses and three leaders abreast , all managed by a postilion who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being inserted into an immense pair of jackboots , and the rest fantastically dressed . But the equipage was not committed wholly to the skill and discretion of this cavalier , who , with the machine and appurtenances , was under the guidance of the director , whose place , prescribed by law , is the round top , or imp6rial , a circular apartment on the top of the diligence , whence he directs its movement , and superintends its management , but from which he had , in the present instance , descended to occupy the cabriolet in front , answering in some degree to the seat of our stage-drivers , where he sat in a scaiskin cap , sundry fur jackets , with a red comforter round his neck , contemplating at his leisure the management of the postilion and the progress of the engine . The dawn disclosed his room-mates to be a French captain going to join his regiment at Barcelona , and the wife of a sub-lieutenant going to join her husband , who was at Figueras in the same service , both belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into so near an intimacy , and a part of them for the first time , did not reconnoitre each other with an indifferent or repulsive silence , but seized the first opportunity of some act of politeness , and seemed to be mutually solicitous of snaking some little sacrifice , each of his own comfort , in behalf of the others . The difference between the French , ' says our traveller , and most other nations , and the secret of their enjoying themselves in almost every situation , is , that they endeavor to content themselves with the present , and draw from it whatever amusement it may be capable of affording . Utiliser ses moments , is a maxim which they not only utter frequently , but follow always . // They make the most of such society as chance may send them , are polite to persons whom they never expect to see again , and thus often begin , where duller spirits end , by gaining the good will of all who come near them . ' As seen from Perpignan , says our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising gradually from die Mediterranean , and bending westward where Mont Perdu reared its snowy head upward until it was lost in the heavens . There are three principal passes across these mountains , the southernmost of which was pursued by our travellers , which winds along towards the Mediterranean coast without ascending to a very great elevation . At Junquera , the first Spanish village , a strict scrutiny was made into the baggage for concealed goods , and more especially for prohibited books , a long list , including more especially the works of Voltaire , Rousseau , Marmontel , with all the modern metaphiysicians and economists , about which the officers were the more inquisitive , as they had shortly before intercepted a Spanish translation of the Social Contract , ' invading their territory under the title of the Lives of the Saints ; which made our traveller apprehensive for a copy of the Henriade ' in his baggage , for which , however , he conciliated the connivance of the officer by a small bribe , which the representative of the Spanish monarchy at that place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be unacceptable to him . The traveller remarks upon the striking contrast in passing the barrier of the two nations . On the French side , the custom-house officers are snugly sheltered ; gendarmes , well accoutred and well mounted , patrol the country in pursuit of robbers , and for the protection of the inhabitants in their avocations ; and all those employed about the custom-house are remarkable for the cleanliness and uniformity of their dress . On the Spanish side , miserable looking aduaneros crawl forth with paper cigars in their mouths , in old cocked hats of oiled cloth and tattered cloaks , from ruinous mud hovels . Every man carries a gun for the protection of his person and property . Descending on the Spanish side , the scene gradually softens , and the valleys are covered with wheat , vines , and olives , and the hills fringed with cork trees . This useful production is known in Spain by the name of alcornoque . It is a species of the encina , which , though of very different appearance from our oak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces acorns , which are not so bitter as ours , and which , as an article of food , the poorer classes do not always abandon to the hogs . Thus we are told , that Sancho was a great lover of bellotas . The cork tree grows to the height of our apple tree , and spreads its branches much in the same manner ; but the trunk is of much greater dimensions , and the foliage of a more gloomy hue . its trunk and branches are covered with a thick ragged bark , which would seem to indicate disease . The trunk alone , however , furnishes a bark of sufficient thickness to be of use in the arts . It is first stripped away in the month of July , when the tree is fifteen years old ; but is then of no use , except to burn , and is only removed for the sake of producing a stouter growth . In the course of six or eight years , the inner bark has grown into a cork of marketable quality , and continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . ' p. 17 . Passing through Figueras , remarkable for the strength of its fortifications , and Gerona , no less remarkble , according to the author , as the scene of one of the labors of Hercules , on the way to Tordera , the diligence crossed several streams without bridges ; they came to one , down the banks of which the postilion drove with the greatest speed to which he could provoke his team . When , in the middle , however , ' says the author , we were near stopping ; for the river , which was much swollen , entered at the bottom of the diligence , washing through the wheels , and striking against the flanks of our horses , until it rendered them powerless , and had well nigh driven them from their legs . They were for a moment at a stand ; but the whip and the voice of the postilion encouraged them to greater exertion , and , after much struggling , they succeeded in dragging the coach over the stones at the bottom of the torrent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alone in this little embarrassment ; for there was a party of about a hundred Frenchmen crossing the stream at the same time . They were going to join a regiment at Barcelona , and with the exception of a few vieur moustaches among the noncommissioned officers , who did not need their stripes of service to proclaim them veterans , they were all conscripts , as any one who had seen Vernet 's inimitable sketches would readily have conjectured . It happened that there was a small foot-bridge , only one plank in width , which stood on upright posts driven into the bottom of the stream . The water was now nearly even with the top , and in some places flowed over . This , however , afforded a more agreeable way of crossing , than wading the river with water to the arm-pits . The commander of the party had already passed , and stood , buttoned in his capot and with folded arms , upon an // eminence beyond the stream , watching the motions of his followers . Those of the soldiers who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallooing at the unsteady steps of the conscripts , as they came faltering over with caps and coats fitting them like sacks , and their muskets held out before them to assist in maintaining a balance . Though many tottered , only two or three fell , and these came to land well drenched , to the infinite amusement of their comrades . Last came a young sub-lieutenant , evidently on his first campaign , tripping along the plank with the airy step of a muscadi*t . Unfortunately , just as he had cleared two thirds of the bridge , and was quickening his pace with an air of great self-complacency , a flaw of wind , rushing down the ravine , caught the skirts of his oil-cloth coat , and throwing him out of the perpendicular , he fell full length , like a thresher fish , upon the water . The soldiers respected the feelings of their officer and repressed their mirth ; they rushed into the stream , each with exclamations of anxiety for mon lieutenant , and soon drew him to land dripping with the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ' pp. 13 , 19 . The author gives a very lively description of the Catalans he met with at Tordera , whose dress seems to be sufficiently striking and singular . The men were of large stature , perfectly well made and very muscular ; but there seemed something sinister in their appearance , partly produced by the length and shagginess of their hair and the exaggerated cast of their countenances ; partly , by the graceless character of their costume . It consisted of a short jacket and waistcoat of green or black velvet , scarce descending half way down the ribs , and studded thickly with silver buttons , at the breasts , lapels , and sleeves the trowsers of the same material , or of nankeen , being long , full , and reaching from the ground to the arm-pits . Instead of shoes , they wore a hempen or straw sandal , which had a small place to admit and protect the toes and a brace hehind with cords , by means of which it was bound tightly to the instep . Their dark-tanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocking , whilst their loins were girt with a sash of red silk or woollen . This article of dress , unknown among us , is universally worn by the working classes in Spain , who say , that it keeps the back warm , sustains the loins , and prevents lumbago ; in short , that it does them a great deal of good , and that they would be undone without it . Most of the young men had embroidered ruffles , and collars tied by narrow sashes of red or yellow silk ; some displayed within their waistcoat a pair of flashy suspenders of green silk , embroidered with red , and adjusted by means of studs and buckles of i4lver . The // most remarkable article , however , of this singular dress , and by no means the most graceful , was a long cap of red woollen , which fell over behind the head , and hung a long way down the back , giving the wearer the look of a cut-throat . Whether from the association of the bonnet rouge , or some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not able , during my short stay in Catalonia , to overcome my repugnance to this detestable headgear . As for the women , some of them were dressed in a gala suit of white , with silk slippers covered with spangles ; but more wore a plain black frock , trimmed with velvet of the same color . They were generally hare-headed , just as they had come from their dwellings ; a few , returning perhaps from mass , had fans in their hands , and on their heads the mantilla . The Spanish mantilla is often made entirely of lace , hut more commonly of black silk , edged with the more costly material . It is fastened above the comb , and pinned to the hair , thence descending to cover the neck and shoulders , and ending in two embroidered points which depend in front . These are not confined , hut left to float about loosely ; so that , with the ever-moving fan , they give full employment to the hands of the lady , whose unwearied endeavor to conceal her neck furnishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the female foot was doomed in Spain to scrupulous concealment , to display it is now no longer a proof of indecency . The frock had been much shortened among these fair Catalans , each of whom exhibited a well-turned ancle , terminated in a round , little foot , neatly shrouded in a thread stocking , with a red , a green , or a black slipper . They were , besides , of graceful height and figure , with the glow of health deep upon their cheeks , and eyes that spoke a burning soul within . There was much of the grace , and ease , and fascination of the Proven*ale , with a glow and luxuriance enkindled by a hotter sun . ' pp. 19 , 20 . The authot* gives a good sketch of the scene presenting itself on his coming in prospect of the Mediterranean , soon after leaving Tordera , and describes the journey as very pleasant along the coast , where the route often passes through neatlooking villages of two rows of houses , mostly of one story , with plastered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They arrived at Barcelona on Sunday evening before sunset , and entered the capital of Catalonia with the concourse of the inhabitants and French officers and soldiers , making altogether a very variegated , fantastical group , who had been out to recreate themselves in the promenades and fields , and were hastening to enter the town before the gates should be closed // for the night . Here the French captain , who had been a fellow traveller with the author from Perpignan , had reached the rendezvous of his regiment , but they did not separate for their respective lodgings without exchanging addresses , as a pledge of further acquaintance ; and , though we are afraid of too early exhausting the capacity of our article for quotations , we can not withhold from our readers the very descriptive and animated picture of this survivor of the Russian campaign . Besides , the sketch is a good specimen of the life led by the officers of an army of occupation . Our traveller and a young Frenchman , with whom he had made acquaintance in the diligence , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Nations , than they sallied out to find those of the captain , whom they at length discovered in a little room overlooking one of the narrowest streets of Barcelona . As we entered , he was sitting thoughtfully on his bed , with a folded paper in his hand , one foot on the ground , the other swinging . A table , upon which were a few books , and a solitary chair , formed the only furniture of the apartment ; while a scimaiko , which hung from the wall by its nailed throat-lash , a sword , a pair of foils and masks , an ample cloak of blue , and a small portmanteau , containing linen and uniform , constituted the whole travelling equipage and movable estate of this marching officer . We accommodated ourselves , without admitting apologies , on the bed and the chair , and our host set about the task of entertaining us , which none can do better than a Frenchman . He had just got a letter from a widow lady , whose acquaintance he had cultivated when last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , his amatory correspondence seemed very extensive ; for he took one billet which he had prepared from the cuff of his capot , and a second from the fold of his bonnet , and read them to us . They were full of extravagant stuff rather remarkable for warmth than delicacy , instead of a signature at the bottom , had a heart transfixed with an arrow , and were done *ip in the shape of a cocked hat . As for the widow , he did not know where to find words sweet enough for her ; and protested that he had half a mind to send her the remaining one of a pair of mustaches , which he had taken from his lip after the campaign of Russia , and which he presently produced , of enormous length , from a volume of tactics . When we were about to depart , our captain said that he was going to the caserne of his regiment , to assist in an assault of arms which was to be given by the officers , and asked us to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement room . rFhe pavement // of pounded mortar was covered with plank , to make it more pleasant to the feet . We found a couple already fencing , and our companion soon stripped to prepare for the encounter . It was singular to see the simplicity of his dress . When he removed his boots to put on the sandal , his feet were without stockings , and under his close-buttoned capot there was no waistcoat , nothing to cover his shaggy breast , but a coarse linen shirt without a collar ; for the French officers wear nothing about the neck beside a stock of black velvet edged with white . Having taken off the sword-belt which hung from his shoulder , and bound his suspenders round his loins , he rolled his sleeves up , chose a mask and foil , and was ready to step into the arena . It appeared that our captain was master of his weapon , from the difficulty in finding him an antagonist . This , however , was at length removed , by the stepping forth of a close-built little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see the opening salutations of courtesy , and the fierce contest that ensued , as they alternately attacked and defended , winding themselves within the guard of each other with the stealth and quickness of the serpent , and glaring from within their masks with eyes of fire . The buttons of their foils were not covered with leather , as is usual among more moderate fencers , lest the motion of the points should be embarrassed . hence the rough edges , as they grazed the arm or struck full upon the breast , brought blood in several places . This same weapon , the foil , is generally used by the French military in duels , with the single preparation of cutting off the button . When the assault was concluded , the antagonists removed their masks and shook hands , as is the custom , in order to remove any irritation that might have occurred during the contest . Then commenced a brisk and earnest conversation upon the performance , furnishing matter for many compliments and never-ending discussion . During a year 's residence in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken part in the campaign of Russia ; as I now looked , however , upon the muscular arms of the captain and his iron conformation , I was *iot surprised that he had been of the few who had gone through the horrors of that disastrous expedition . ' pp. 23 , 24 . Our traveller 's room at the inn overlooked a field encumbered with the ruins of a convent of Capuchins , which had been demolished during the troubles of the Peninsula . The site had been sold under the constitution ; and the purchasers were already collecting materials to build , when church and state , and the French army under the Duke of Angoul*me , dispossessed them of their purchase ; and the Capuchins , now returning one after another , like bees hovering about their de // molished hive , had laid hands upon the materials collected by the dispossessed purchasers , and were moving to and fro in their long beards , dingy gray dresses , and rope girdles , directing some twenty or thirty workmen in laying anew the foundations of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing and repassing throng in the Rambla , or public walk , in front of the inn , the writer particularly distinguishes the clergy , who very naturally occupy much of his attention , as well as that of every other traveller in this singular country . But this easterly corner of the Peninsula seems to he peculiarly blessed with this consecrated part of Spanish society , the number of priests , and friars , black , white , and gray , ' being , as he says , two per cent . of the whole population of Catalonia . One person , out of fifty inhabitants , is equivalent to one out of every twelve and a half of the able-bodied male population , a proportion which would be altogether incredible , if these devout persons were all wholly incumbents , one to every eleven , on the industry of their lay neighbors . The truth is , however , that many of them , in a great measure , support themselves by laboring with their own hands in their gardens . But after making all possible allowances in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energies , both moral and physical , of the Spanish nation . The author gives a very pleasing account of this city , the third in Spain , being next in population to Valencia and Madrid ; the sketch of its history is well drawn , and not too long ; the passages , which he commemorates , are all striking ,  --  its foundation by the Carthaginian , Ha milcar , the father of Hannibal ,  --  the Roman town , the arches and pillars of which are incorporated with the present buildings of the oldest part of the city ,  --  the pompous spectacle exhibited in the public square , or plaza , where Ferdinand , in presence of his courtiers , received from Columbus the tribute of the first-fruits of the New World ,  --  and the first experiment of steam navigation made in 1543 , with an engine invented by Blasco de Garay . But we pass over the description of the city and its environs , to give an account of the noria , a simple machine used for raising water from the wells , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe their fertility . We wish to attract the attention of our cultivators to the subject of irrigation , for which a great many parts of our country afford so great facilities , not hitherto applied to any practical advantage . // The noria consists of a vertical wheel placed over a well , and having a band of robes passing round it , to which earthen jars are affixed . These jars , set in motion by the turning of the wheel , descend empty on one side , pass through the water in the well below , and having small holes in the bottom for the air to escape , fill easily , before they ascend on the opposite side . A little water leaks from the air-holes during the ascent , and falls from jar to jar . When arrived at the top , the water is emptied into a trough leading to a reservoir , so placed as to overlook every part of the field which it is intended to irrigate . Connected with the reservoir is a basin for washing clothes . As for the vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion from a horizontal one , turned by a horse , cow , mule , or more commonly an ass . There is something primitive in this rude machine , that carries one back to scripture scenes and oriental simplicity . Often have I sat by the road-side for an hour together , watching the economy of these little farms , such as one may see in the environs of Barcelona . While the laborer was digging among his lettuces , that old-fashioned animal , the ass , performed unbidden his solemn revolutions ; the wheel turned , and the ropes of grass brought up the jars and emptied them of their burthen , while at the neighboring reservoir a darkhaired and dark-eyed damsel would be upon her knees beside the basin , her petticoats tucked snugly around her , and as she rubbed the linen with her hand , or beat it against the curbstone , singing some wild , outlandish air , like anything but the music of Europe. - Much labor is doubtless lost by the rude construction of the noria ; but the system of irrigation , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is the means of fertilizing lands which must otherwise have remained uncultivated. ' p. 28 . After passing the EUro at the ferry near its mouth , and arriving at Amposta on its western bank , the traveller is struck with the entire change of personal appearance , physiognomy , and costume of the inhabitants . Though he is still in the province , or kingdom , of Catalonia , still h&amp;seems here to meet with the manners and race of the neighboring kingdom of Valencia , that stretches along the coast of the Mediterranean some two hundred miles in a southwesterly direction ; the capital of which , the second city of Spain in population , is the next destination of the traveller . - Instead of the long pantaloons of the Catalans , reaching from their shoulders to the ground , these Valencians wear short linen small-clothes , bragas , which tie over the hips with a drawing-string , and , like the Highland kilt , terminate above the knee . But the long , hanging , point- // *47 ed , red woollen cap is common to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a footless stocking or a sort of leathern gaiters . Instead of the velvet jacket and silver buttons of the Catalan , the Valencian wears a sort of sackformed garment over his shoulders , which serves both as a bag and a garment . In this he carries the seed-corn in sowing or planting in the fields . At this little town of Amposta , on the bank of the Ebro , the writer fills his journal with a group of card-players before the entrance of the court-yard of the inn , sitting with their bare legs crossed , very intent upon their game ; and the motley collection of boxes , straw panniers , fodder for the mules , and supper for the guests in the dining-room of the inn . He remarks that pork is one of the ingredients in al-. most every dish , the frequent use of which by the Spaniards grew out of the persecutions of the Jews , when the eating of this meat was a practical profession of faith , and proof of orthodoxy . As this part of the tour , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treating his readers to a robbery , we ought to give some little account of his companions , by way of introduction to this incident . They consisted of a Valencian shopkeeper , dressed in as many colors as a harlequin , but affable and good-natured withal ; his wife , a little en bon point , as is usual with Spanish married ladies ; with their pretty daughter of fifteen ; a company of Valencian students , dressed in black , as usual in Spain , without even the relief of a white collar ; and a friar . Our traveller is as much troubled with the rapacity of his young companions at this Amposta inn , as Captain Hall was with that of his fellow-guests at the inns in the United States , and the author admits , that the magnificent apartments and luxurious tables of a North River steamboat afford a scene of equal vivacity of appetite . These black , little Catalan collegians incontinently plunged into the first dishes with a very keen alacrity , to the inconvenience of their fellowfeasters , who were for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared of each dish . But after assuaging their ardor by rel ) eated assaults upon the garlic-flavored viands , they began to offer to others the dishes of which they had par-. taken , and at length to help others before serving themselves . Their politeness was more particularly directed to the fair Valenciana ; and when the desert came , each one of them who sat near , after paring an apple , offered her a portion of it on // the end of a knife , which she always accepted , eating either the whole or a part , as if obliged so to do by usage . And the young men accompanied these civilities with sundry gallant speeches , all which seemed to be a great violation of propriety to our young traveller , who was fresh from the modest reserve of French damsels ; but not so to the parents , who felt quite secure while their daughter was in their sight ; nor to the young lady herself , who received the civilities in good part , and occasionally replied to the compliments of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two o'clock in the morning ; and while it was winding about the hills , and ascending and descending the declivities along the coast , on its way to Valencia , the conductor ( mayoral ) being comfortably rolled up in his box asleep , having left his team to his postilion , Jose or Pepe , whom he affectionately called Pepito , an interesting , sprightly boy ; and while our traveller , who , together with his companions , had fallen into a slumber , was just dreaming of being on the last stage of his journey towards his home , the coach was suddenly stopped , and the momentum of his body , acquired from its velocity , threw him against the forward pannel , and effectually dispersed his dreams . There were voices without , speaking in accents of violence , and whose idiom was not of my country . I now raised myself erect on my seat , rubbed my eyes , and directed them out of the windows . By the light of a lantern that blazed from the top of the diligence I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by olive trees ; and that the mules having come in contact with some obstacle to their progress , had been curtailed of their open column , and brought together into a close huddle , where they stood as if afraid to move , with pricked ears and frightened , gazing upon each other in dumb wonder at the unaccustomed interruption . A single glance to the right hand gave a clue to unravel the mystery . Just beside the fore wheel of the diligence stood a man dressed in that wild garb of Valencia which I had seen for the first time in Amposta . His red cap was drawn closely over his forehead , reaching far down the back , and his striped manta , instead of being rolled round him , hung unembarrassed from one shoulder . Whilst his left leg was thrown forward in preparation , a musket was levelled in his hands , along the barrel of which his eye glared so fiercely upon the visage of the conductor , then in eont*ct with the end of it , that it seemed to reflect the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene was somewhat different . Pepe being awake when the interruption took place , was at once sensible of its nature . He had abandoned the reins , and jumped from his seat to the road-side , intending to escape among the trees . Unhappy youth , that he should not have accomplished his purpose ! He was met by the muzzle of a musket ere he had scarce touched the ground , and a third ruffian appearing at the same moment from the treacherous concealment of the tree towards which he started , he was effectually taken and brought round into the road , where he was made to stretch himself out upon his face , as had already been done with the conductor . J could now distinctly hear one of these robbers-for such they were-inquire in Spanish of the mayoral as to the number of passengers he had brought ; if any were armed ; whether there was any money in the diligence ; and then , as a conclusion to the interrogatory , demanding " La bolsa ! " in a more angry tone . The poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough to draw a large leathern purse from an inner pocket , and , stretch .. ing his hand upward to deliver it , he said , " Tome usted caballero , pero no me quita usted la vida ! " or , " Take it , sir , but leave my life ! " Such , however , did not seem to be his intention . He went to the road-side , arid bringing a stone from a large heap which had been collecfed to be broken and thrown on the road , he fell to beating the mayoral upon the head with it . The unhappy man when thus assailed , sent forth the most piteous cries for misericordia and piedad ; he invoked the interposition of Jesu Gliristo , Santiago Apostot y Martir , La Virgen del Pilar , and all those sainted names , which , being accustomed himself to hear pronounced with awful reverence , were most likely to prove efficacious in arresting the fury of his assassin . But he might as well have asked pity of the stone that smote him as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon . He struck and struck again , until becoming at length more earnest in the task he laid his musket beside him and worked with both hands upon his victim . The cries for pity which blows at first excited , blows at length quelled . They had gradually increased with the suffering to the most terrible shrieks , and when this became too strong to bear , it worked its own cure . The shrieks declined into low and inarticulate moans , which , with a deep drawn and agonized gasp for breath and an occasional convulsion , alone remained to show that the vital principle had not yet departed . It fared no better , nay even worse with Pepe , though instead of the cries for pity which had availed the mayoral so little , he uttered nothing but low moans that died away in the dust beneath him . One might have thought that the youthful appearance of the lad would have ensured him compassion . But the case was different . // The robbers were doubtless of Amposta , and being acquainted with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world would have formed a claim to kindness was here an occasion of cruelty . When both the victims had been rendered insensible , there was a short pause , and a consultation followed in a low tone between the ruffians ; and then they proceeded to execute the further plans which had been concerted between them . The first went round to the left side of the diligence , ai ) d having unhooked the iron shoe and placed it under the wheel as an additional security against escape , he opened the door of the interior , and , mounting on the steps , I could hear him distinctly uttering a terrible threat in Spanish , and demanding an ounce of gold from each of the passengers . This was answered by an expostulation from the Valencian store-keeper , who said that they had not so much money , but what they had would be given willingly . There was then a jingling of purses , some pieces dropping on the floor in the hurry and agitation of the moment . Having remained a moment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabriclet , but passed at once to the rotunda . Here he used great caution , doubtless from having seen the evening before at Amposta that it contained no women , but six young students who were all stout fellows . They were made to come down one by one from their strong hold , deliver their money and watches , and then lie down flat upon their faces in the road . Meanwhile , the second robber , after consulting with his companion , had returned to the spot where the zagal Pepe lay rolling from side to side . As he went towards him he drew a knife from the folds of his sash , and having opened it he placed one of his naked legs on either side of his victim . Pushing aside the jacket of the youth , he bent forward and dealt him many bloWs , moving over every part of the body as if anxious to leave none unsaluted . The young priest , my companion , shrunk back into his corner , and hid his face within his shivering fingers ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw them from the cruel spectacle , and my ears were more sensible than ever . Though the windows at the front and sides were still closed , I could distinctly hear each stroke of the murderous knife as it entered its victim ; it was not a blunt sound as of a weapon that meets with positive resistance ; but a hollow hissing noise as if the household implement , made to part the bread of peace , performed unwillingly its task of treachery . This moment was the unhappiest of my life ; and it struck me at the time that if any situation could be more worthy of pity than to die the dog 's death of poor Pepe , it was to be compelled to witness his fate without the power to raise an arm of interposition . Having completed the deed to his satisfaction , this cold-blooded // murderer came to the door of the cabriolet , and endeavored to open it . lie shook it violently , calling to us to assist him ; but it had chanced hitherto that we had always got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had never before been in a diligence , thought from the circumstance that there was but one door , and therefore answered the fellow that he must go to the other side . On the first arrival of these unwelcome visiters , I had taken a valuable watch which I wore , from my waistcoat pocket , and stowed it snugly in my boot ; but when they fell to beating in the heads of our guides I bethought me that the few dollars I carried in my purse might not satisfy them , and replaced it again in readiness to be delivered at the shortest notice . These precautions were , however , unnecessary . The third ruffian , who had continued to make the circuit of the diligence with his musket in his hand , paused a moment in the road ahead of us , and having placed his head to the ground as if to listen , presently came and spoke in an under tone to his companions . The conference was but a short one . They stood a moment over the mayoral and struck his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow who had before used the knife returned to make a few farewell thrusts , and in another moment they had all disappeared from around us . In consequence of the darkness , which was only partly dispelled by the lantern which had enabled me to see what occurred so immediately before me , we were not at once sensible of the departure of the robbers , but continued near half an hour after their disappearance in the same situation in which they left us . The short breathing and chattering of teeth , lately so audible from within the interior , gradually subsided , and were succeeded by whispers of the females , and soon after by words pronounced in a louder tone ; whilst our mutilated guides by groans and writhing gave evidence of returning animation . My companion and I slowly let down the windows beside us , and having looked round awhile we opened the door and descended . The door of the interior stood open as it had been left , and those within sat each in his place in anxious conversation . In the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I presently recognised for the six students who had occupied the rotunda , and who having been made to come down one by one , deliver their money and watches , and then stretch themselves out in the road upon their faces , made the oddest figure one can conceive , rolled up in their black cloaks , and with their cocked hats of the same solemn color , emerging at intervals from out the heap . As we came cautiously towards them , they whispered among each other , and then first one lifted his head to look at us , arid then another , until finding that we were of the party they all rose at once like a cloud , notwithstand. * ing the threat which the robbers made to them at their departure , // as we afterwards heard , to wait by the road-side and shoot down the first person who should offer to stir . ' pp. 47-50 . In this distressed condition the party were obliged to remain , as they were , in the highway , until the alcalde of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat little officer appeared , with a red cockade in token of his loyalty ; and when he had very deliberately taken note of the transaction , and the two mangled conductors had been put into a cart to be carried back to Amposta , where they both died of their wounds , two of the patrolling guards , whose business it is to scour the country in pursuit of robbers , cut the rope , which had been stretched across the road and had so suddenly slopped the mules , and conducted the diligence on to San Carlos , the next village on their route . they proceeded on to Valencia without any other accident , passing on the way through Murviedro , a small town on the coast , some fifteen or twenty miles north from Valencia , on the site of the ancient Saguntum , which the author commemorates by giving a short account of Hannibal 's siege . From Valencia the route still keeps the coast , frr , but not towards , Madrid some fifty miles to the city of San Felipe , which is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road turns in a northwesterly direction for the capital of Spain* and after rising gradually until it has nscended to the height of two thousand feet , you come to the wide plain of New Castile , in which rises the branches of the river Guadiana , which discharges into the Atlantic on the southern boundary of Portugal . This plain the author represents at this season , early in November , as being sufficiently chill , dreary , and monotonous . Small decaying villages are scattered at great distances , between which are no habitations , as the danger of robbery prevents the inhabitants from dispersing their dwellings ; and not a tree or shrub is to be seen in the wide unbroken prospect . This nakedness of the countrj* is occasioned by a prejudice of the inhabitants , that trees , by giving shelter to birds , would only invite invaders to their scanty crops . According to the description given by the author , it seems a strip lying between the highlands and Mediterranean , along his route , is comparatively fertile , populous , and busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the whole distance to Madrid , the signs of fertility and industry disappear . And so our conductor brings us to Madrid , having met and being about to meet a thousand adventures , and noting a. // thousand circumstances , characteristic of Spanish character , manners , and ways of life , which we can not notice . Indeed we have not often travelled with a writer , who selected his objects and incidents better , prosed less , or described and narrated in a more graphic and lively style , or made more sensible and pertinent remarks . His journal at Madrid from the fifth or sixth of November , to the eleventh of April , including his excursions to Segovia and Toledo , is full of interest and information . Among the numerous passages which might be selected in this part of the work ( lbr the difficulty is in choosing , not in finding ) , we take the account of Don Valentin with whom he took up his quarters for the winter , as throwing incidentally some light upon the government , the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had already agreed with his instructer , an impur*ficado , that is , a person who had been in service under the constitution , and had not received that sort of acquittal granted , by certain associations of loyalists , to those who had not been flagrant patriots , and who would pay for this purification . This person was Don Diego , who had , under the constitution , been employed in the office of the secretary of state . Diego recommended to his pupil to take lodgings at Don Valentin 's , of whom the following account is given . Don Valentin was a native of Logronio in the fertile canton of Rioja . He was by birth a hidalgo , or noble in the small way , after the manner of Don Quixote , and had been of some importance in his own town , of which he was one of the regidores . In the political ups and downs of his country , he had several times changed his residence and occupation ; was by turns a dealer in cattle which he purchased in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthen the stomachs of the combatants , who disputed for the possession of Spain ; or else a cloth merchant , keeping his shop in the same house where he now lived , near the Puerta del Sol . His last occupation ' was interrupted , according to his own account , in a very singular way . Whilst he had been regidor in Logronio , the Ayuntamiento of the town became acquainted with the hiding-place in which some French troops , in retreating rapidly towards the frontier , had deposited a large quantity of plate and valuables , robbed from the royal palace . On the return of Ferdinand , the account of the buried plate reached his ears ; and having likewise learned that there was a man in Madrid who knew where it had been concealed , he sent at once for Don Valentin , who was the person in question . When // informed by his majesty that he was required to conduct a party to the place of concealment , he was reluctant to comply . He urged the situation of his affairs . If his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks , who are the most unprincipled fellows , except the escribanos , to be found in Spain ; and if it were to be shut up , he would lose both present and future custom . Besides , the other regidores , his colleagues in the municipality , were yet alive and still resided at Logronio . He hoped , therefore , that his majesty would not send him from his affairs , for he was but a poor man , and had a wife and daughter . These excuses , however , were not satisfactory , and were set aside . Ferdinand promised to recompense all losses that Don Valentin might sustain by abandoning his trade , and to pay him well for the sacrifice ; he ended by putting it upon his loyalty . Don Valentin was an Old Castilian ; so he hesitated no longer , but sold out , shut his shop and went off to Rioja . Whether it was owing to the small number of persons who had been knowing to the secret , or to the sacredness with which the Spaniards regard everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure was all found untouched in the place of its concealment . It was brought safely to Madrid , Don Valentin being at the expense of transportation . He now presents his various claims to government , for damages suffered by loss of trade , and for the expenses of the journey , including the subsistence of the foot soldiers , who had served as escort , which he had defrayed from his own purse . These claims were readily admitted , and an early day appointed for their liquidation . The day at length comes , but the money does not come with it . Don Valentin has an audience of the kino ; for no king can be more accessible than Ferdinand . He receives the royal word for the payment ; for no king could be more compliant . He has many audiences , receives many promises , but no money . Meantime he lives upon hope , and the more substantial balance remaining from the sale of his stock . These were near failing together when the year 1S*2O brought some relief to the misfortunes of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking advantage of the publicity which was allowed in Spain by the new system , he establishes a reading-room , were all the daily papers of the capital and of the chief cities of Europe were regularly received . This went on very well , until the French , who never yet came to Spain on any good errand , overthrew the Constitution . The liberty of thought and speech fell with it . Don Valentin was invited to shut up his reading-room , and he once more retired to live upon his savings , amounting to some ten or twelve hundred dollars , which he had stowed away in a secret corner of his dwelling . This was taken out , piece by piece , to meet the necessities of his // family , until one day the house was entered by three robbers , who muzzled the old woman with a towel , tied her to the bedstead , and then carried off , not only the earnings of Don Valentin , but silver spoons and forks and everything of any value , to the very finery of Florencia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back . All that he now did was to take the Diana and Gaceta , which his wife let out to such curious people as came to read them in the common entry of their house . This furnished the trio , of which the family consisted , with their daily puchero ; his daughter with silk stockings and satin shoes , to go to mass and walk of a feast-day upon the Prado , and himself with now and then his paper cigarillo. ' pp. 90-92 . The author having established himself with Don Valentin , of whose family and domestic economy he gives a very dirtinct picture , he sallies out from his lodgings daily in pursuit of the lions of the metropolis . He remarks in regard to the situation of this city , that it is by far the most elevated capital in Europe , being two thousand feet above the ocean , and accordingly many times the height of most others , and twice that of Geneva , which is the next hiThest . This extraordinary height of the metropolis and whole neigh boring district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this latitude . He states that in the winter of 1825-6 , some of the sentinels of the royal palace were frozen to death in their boxes , though stationed but for half an hour , and though they were Swiss , who might be supposed to be more able to resist frost than the native inhabitants . Madrid has fifty public fountains from which the water is carried to the houses by people who make it a business , and this is wholly in the hands of Gallicians and Asturians , who bear water about the city until they have made a small fortune of Iwo or three hundred dollars , arid then selling out the good will of their district or range to some successor , retire to their native country to pass the rest of their lives In a comfortable independence . Some of the water-bearers carry water about the streets , selling it by the glass-full to those who pass . They are represented as a rough set , little regardful of ordinary courtesy , who never turn from the narrow side-walk for any one . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered his room with his hat in his hand , endeavoring to rid it of a dint , and cursing the Gallego who had run against him at the turning of a corner . He had undertaken to lecture him , but the Gallego putting down his keg , and drawing himself up with // dignity , said to him , I am a noble , and you , may be , are no We were struck with the author 's account of the figure made by the prompter at the Spanish theatres . He is always placed in a tin pulpit , which rises a few feet above the floor , and which is reached from below . The tin , being polished and kept bright , reflects the glare of the lights between which the pulpit is placed , and renders it a most conspicuous object . Hence the prompter reads the whole of the piece , which is afterwards repeated by the players . 1-us book and hand usually project upon the boards , and are seen pointing from one to another of the actors , to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , occasionally in a pathetic part , his declamation becomes loud and impassioned , arid he forgets where he is , until called back by the audience . Since the prompter precedes the actor , you frequently know in anticipation what the latter is to say , and the idea is conveyed by the ears before you see the action which is meant to accompany it . After a while the actor draws himself up in a mysterious way , to repeat to you a secret which is already in your possession . This is even more monstrous than the custom which prevailed in the infancy of the Greek drama , of having one man to speak and another to gesticulate. ' p. 129 . Some of the public institutions of Madrid appear to be upon a very liberal , magnificent scale , particularly the royal library , consisting of two hundred thousand volumes offered freely to the use of all persons , with a commodious provision of chairs , tables , &amp;c. , thirteen persons in all being employed in attendance upon , and superintendence of the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the arts , especially that of painting , in which the Spanish masters hold a very high rank ; and the author finds among their works numerous pieces of which he speaks particularly , and for the most part , with great admiration . Though the Spanish national spectacle of a ibull-fight has been often described , we should copy the very animated account of one witnessed by the writer at Madrid had we not already quoted so largely . Having gratified his curiosity at the capital , the author took his departure early in April for Cordova ; and on this journey also , besides those incidents and novelties with which he has a happy talent of filling his journal , he has another opportunity of giving an account of a robbery , for the diligence had but just passed the site of the inn where Don Quixote watched // his armor and was dubbed knight errant , when it was stopped by the robber , * Cacaruco , who with his companions proceeded to plunder the passengers , alleging in excuse that he had no other way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family was not long to enjoy the benefit of his industry , for the author learned , before leaving Spain , that he had been seized and executed . In his account of Cordova , as well as in that of Seville , Cadiz , and of Gibraltar , where the journey ends , the author perhaps introduces historical recapitulations a little too copiously , which can be usually resorted to advantageously by a writer of travels , only for those striking events and incidents , which give a greater interest to living characters and present objects or places visited . As the journal proceeds , there is a little abate-. ment of the freshness of coloring and individuality in the discription usually imparted to a traveller 's style by the novelty of objects on first entering a country , and the distinct and strong impressions consequently made upon his own mind . From this cause , as might naturally be expected , from Cordova to the termination of the journey , the journal is less free , rapid , and vivacious than before . But it does not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but think that the historical epitome in the concluding part of the volume , might have been advantageously omitted , for the same reason that we should have preferred less of history in some of the preceding parts ; and the pages in which the latitude , longitude , climate , fertility of soil , and other well known geographical and statistical facts , are given , add little to the value of the work , not because the author betrays want of talent or information in those abstracts , but because they are not what readers look for in a volume of this description . Some parts of the division under the title of General view of Spain , ' are among the best portions of the book . The sections upon the revenue , the army , the government , and the clergy , are full of interesting facts and just reflections ; and the general view of the Spanish character hears marks of a mind of penetrating observation and good skill in generalizing . In this part of the book the author takes occasion , in a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation of Mr Everett , our late minister to Spain , whom he found at Madrid . We quote the sketch of Ferdinand the Seventh , whose administration of the government , the author , and justly no doubt , // attributes more to the clergy and the character of the great body of Spanish peasantry , than to any positive qualities and dispositions of his own . From these causes , then , and not from the sovereign will of a single individual , originate those persecuting decrees and apostolic denunciations , which have brought on Ferdinand the appellation of bloody bigot , and all the hard names in the calendar of abuse . There is much reason to believe , on the contrary , that he cares little for religion ; and though by way of flattering the clergy and the nation , he may once have made a petticoat for the Virgin Mary , yet if the truth were known , he would doubtless he willing to do less for her than for any living Manola or Andaluza . The character of the present king is , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere fact of his being called El Rey Absoluto , everything is supposed to emanate from his individual will . His character is not , in fact , so much a compound of vices , as made up of a few virtues and many weaknesses . He is ready to receive the meanest subject of his kingdom , and is said to he frank , good-humored , accessible , courteous , and kingly , in an unusual degree . lie will listen attentively to those who appeal to him , appear convinced of the justice of what they ask , and promise compliance , without ever returning to think of the matter . Facility is his great foible , and yet is he occasionally subject to irritability and a disposition to be wrongheaded an*l have his own way , to the no small inconvenience of those who undertake to direct him . The faults of Ferdinand are partly natural , partly the effect of education . Instead of being trained up and nurtured with the care necessary to fit him for the high station to which he was born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverted . Godoy , whose views were of the most ambitious kind , took great pains to debase the character and understanding of Ferdinand . With this view , and partly perhaps to get rid of his own cast-off courtesans , he not only abandoned him without restraint to the ruling passion of his family , but even threw temptation in his way , *veil knowing the debasing effect of those early indulgences , which sap the moral and physical energies of youth . Thus a life of uninterrupted sensuality has deadened every manly and generous sentiment . The person of the king was noble and prepossessing in his youth , when he is said to have been the most graceful horseman of his kingdom . In 1808 he was the idol of every heart in the nation . Had he hut proved worthy of this devoted loyalty , Spain would present us with a different spectacle . Even now , though his figure has been bent by long indulgeiice , and his features engraven with heaviness and sen // 259 suality , yet is his appearance still rather pleasing than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good humor and rough jollity , which gives a flat denial to the cruelty ascribed to him . lie is said to have a leaning towards liberalism-weak , perhaps , in proportion to the inefficiency of his character , yet rendered probable by the fact , that he is now more detested by the ruling party , and acting under much more restraint , than in the most boisterous period of the Constitution . ' pp. 389 , 381 . After what we have said , it is hardly necessary to add , that , on the whole , we think very favorably of the work ; and the extracts we have made , being tolerably fair specimens , will , we doubt not , be thought by our readers to justify this opinion , and recommend it more effectually to their attention , than any general praise we could bestow . The modest pretensions of the author would entitle him to a liberal indulgence , if the faults of his production required it ; but , compared with its merits , they are few and trivial . Though he proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing in it of juvenile , excepting , perhaps , the rather enthusiastic admiration , and frequent mention , of female charms . The opinions seem to be formed with deliberation , and the reflections , in general , bear the marks of a just thinking.
