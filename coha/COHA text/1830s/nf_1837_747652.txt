txt /q/hat is commerce with foreign nations  --  what is not ; and what is the internal police of a state ? 4th , What is the effect of a compact of boundary , made between two states , with the consent of congress ? On all of which there had long been , and continued to be , great diversity of opinion among the judges ; which did not cease to exist after they were decided , and may exist in future , when the same or similar questions shall occur . It had long been to me a subject of deep regret , that notwithstanding the numerous , consistent , most solemn , and , ( with some few , and mostly late exceptions , ) to my mind most satisfactory adjudications of this Court , in expounding the constitution , its meaning yet remains as unsettled , in political , professional , and judicial opinion , as it was immediately after its adoption . If one is to judge of the next , by the results of the past half century , there is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expiration , than it is at the beginning of the period . It is indeed to be feared , that unless some mode of interpretation , different from what has been usually pursued in argument , is adopted ; the present uncertainty must become utter confusion . In reviewing the course K ) f argument on both sides in these cases , the remark is fully justified , that we have been referred for the true interpretation of the constitution to /z/ books , essays , arguments , opinions , speeches , debates in conventions and legislative bodies , by jurists and statesmen , and by some who were neither ; which would not be offered , or suffered to be read in any court , as entitled to respect in construing an ordinary act of legislation , or a contract between individuals . This reference has not been confined to expositions cotemporaneous or near to the time of the adoption of the constitution , the views of its framers , or those opinions to which courts of justice can consistently with their duty defer their own ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever has appeared in print on the various subjects involved , either here or abroad , and up to the present time , while these suits have been depending in this Court for re-argument The history and spirit of the times , past and present , admonish us that new versions of the constitution will be promulgated , to meet the ever varying course of political events , or aspirations of power ; and that if we suffer our judgments to be influenced by what has been pressed upon us as authority for present adjudication , we must pay the same respect to the same kind of authority , when future opinions shall be formed , and new expositions be announced . We have listened to the disquisitions of late writers on the constitution of England , to the decisions of their courts , nay , to the opinions of their judges given within the last year ; as rules to guide us to the true intention of the framers of the constitution , in a most solemn instrument , carefully and most deliberately reduced to writing , in 1787 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now draw our knowledge of constitutional law , or respect them as a rule of present decision , they must be so taken in future ; and though the legislative authority of Westminster-hall over us has been extinct for more than sixty years , this tribunal must continue to still look to its emanations , whether in treatises or judicial decrees , to ascertain the meaning of our own supreme law . I have long since been convinced that there are better and safer guides to professional and judicial inquiries after truth , on constitutional questions , than those which have been so often resorted to , without effecting the desired result ; a clear and settled understanding of the terms and provisions of an instrument of writing , which operates with supreme authority wherever it applies . To me it seems that it can be made intelligible in all its parts , by . applying to it those established rules and maxims of the common law , in the construction of statutes , and those accepted definitions of words , terms , and language , in which they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood , in their ordinary , or legal sense , according to the subject matter . In appealing to the common law , as the standard of exposition , in all doubts as to the meaning of written instruments ; there is safety , certainty , and authority . The institutions of the colonies were based upon it ; it was their system of jurisprudence , with only local exceptions , to suit the condition of the colonists , who claimed it as their birth-right and inheritance , 9 Cr. 333 , in its largest sense , as including the whole system of English jurisprudence , 1 Gall. 493 ; the inexhaustible fountain from which we draw our laws , 9 S. &; R. 330 , 39 , 58 . So it continued after the colonies became states , in most of which the common law was adopted by acts of assembly , which gave it the force of a statute , from the time of such adoption , and as it was then ; so that in the language of this Court  --  At the adoption of the constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whose jurisprudence was not essentially , that of the common law in its widest meaning ; and probably no states were contemplated , in which it would not exist .

It is also the basis on which the federal system of jurisprudence was erected by the constitution , the judiciary and process acts , which refer to " cases in law and in equity " suits at common laWj " the com , m.on law the principles and usages of law as they had at the time been defined and settled in England ; 5 Cr. 222 ; 3 Wh , 221 ; 4 Wh. 115 , 16 ; 7 Wh. 45 ; 10 Wh. 29 , 32 , 56 , 8 ; 1 Pet 613 : and were adopted as then understood by the old states . From the very beginning , till the consummation of the revolution , the people of the colonies and states , in all successive congresses , took their stand upon the common law and constitution of England , as the " heirs of freedom ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from their ancestors , to make those tremble who dare to think of making them miserable .

These are the rights a profligate ministry are now striving by force of arms to ravish from us , and which we are , with one mind , resolved never to resign but witii our lives . " Ib. 57 . The very rights which placed the crown of Great Britain on the heads of the three princes of the house of Hanover , 170 . Such was " the equitable system of English laws , " ib. 30 , 41 , 50 ; " the inheritance left us by our forefathers , " 66 ; " the great bulwark of our constitution , " 148 ; " the first and best maxims of the constitution , venerable to Britons and to Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liberties they boasted of , and conveyed the same fair inheritance to them . By that system the colonists claimed all the benefits secured to English subjects , whether they lived " 3000 , or 300 miles from the royal palace , " 37 ; and the several colonies as constituent members of the British empire , rested for " the perfect security of their natural and civil rights , on the salutary and constitutional principles " it contained , 61 . It was " the covenant chain " between the mother country and them ; the charters of the king were their written civil constitutions of government , and the colonies would not part with , or loose their hold of this old covenant chain which united their fathers ; 153 , 4 . On this system , the congress , the people , and the colonies relied . They claimed as their indubitable right , the benefit of the common law of England , its constitution , and their several charters ; in their Declaration of Rights , in 1774 ; 1 Journ. 77 , &c.; in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in December , 1775 ; ib. 263 ; and on the 4th July , 1776 . Among the other grievances set forth in the Declaration of Independence , are the following : " He , " ( the king , ) " has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our conistitution , and unacknowledged by our laws , giving his assent to their - acts of pretended legislation , " &c.; &c.; " For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighbouring province . " Vide 1 Journ. 30 , 58 , 9 , 64 , 61 , 174 . " For taking away our charters , abolishing our most valuable laws , and altering fundamentally the forms of our government " 1 Laws , , 9 ; 1 Journ. 125 , 178 . The common law was not merely the basis of the revolution , in opposing the oppression of England , or deemed incompatible with the genius of the people after the revolution was effected , as a burthen imposed upon them ; but the contrary . By the ordinance of 1787 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these republics , their laws , and constitutions , are erected ; and which congress therein fixed and established , as the basis of all laws , constitutions , and governments , which forever hereafter shall be formed in the territory north-west of the Ohio .

" 1 Laws U. S. 479 . That system , which had effected in England , what it was one of the declared objects of the present constitution to effect  --  ' to establish justice and " secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , by the judicial power of the United States ; which shall be vested in one supreme court , and in such inferior courts as the congress shall from time to time ordain and establish .

In thus recurring to the source of those great principles , on which all our governments are founded , it is clear that they must be traced beyond the instrument which created them , to that great charter of English liberty , which embodied the common law ; and from 1774 , to 1787 , was equally revered by the Britona of both continents . The great men of the revolution , in their first meeting In coogress , on the Sth September , 1774 , and in their proceedings till the 26th October , when " the congress then dissolved itself ; " did not merely declare in their resolutions and letters , on what ground they stood in asserting the rights of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . To the journal published by their order , and verified by the autograph of their secretary , is prefixed , in the title page ; a medallion of which the following is a fac simile . The magna charta of England , was the pedestal on which the column and cap of liberty was raised , supported by the twelve colonies , assembled by their delegates ; declaring that " on this toe fely " " this we will defend . " In looking too to the names of the members of that congress , * six of whom , thirteen years afterwards , in a convention " of twelve qwq of those colonies , then states , signed the proposed constitution ; I find a weight of political authority , which my mind can not resist : and so feel bound to trace the great work of the fathers of the revolution and the country , back to its source in the common law , the magna charta , and constitution of England ; the basis and pattern of our own . In so doing , I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the constitution was established , and has consummated all its beneficent purposes , there will be found a " via iuttty to my judgment , on its true meaning in these parts that bear on the cases which have been before us for adjudication , I shall do it without the aid of any commentator , . except this Court , as the sworn interpreter , appointed by the constitution itself , not only to expound the meaning of its provisions , but to pronounce final judgment on their results , on " all cases in law and equity arising under ? ' it Nor shall I consult any other commentaries upon it than those which are found in the opinions of the Court ; delivered , with few exceptions , by the late venerated Chief Justice . In thus adhering to the old maxim , " Sed melius et tutius estj peterefontes quam sectare rivulos , ' I am well aware of departing from the modern mode of construing our ancient charters , and grants of governments ; but if it should lead to their true interpretation , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patience to read and consider the general views of the constitution , herein presented to explain the grounds of my concurring judgment in these cases , ' Si quid novisti , rectius istis candide imperii , si non his utere mtcumV In the full conviction , that by this mode of investigating constitutional questions , there will be found standard Tules by which to measure the different parts of the supreme law , and extract its true intentions , and that any other mode will be an abortive attempt , ' ex humo dare lucemf I proceed to give my general views . Taking it as already apparent , that in 1774 , and 1776 , our constitution was the English constitution , Siud the free system of English laws was the common law then ; and that system to yet be the law of the land , by the authority of the states , the constitution , the acts of congress , and the adjudications of this Court It is in this law , that we find the rules of interpretation of acts of assembly and of congress ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts ; and to which we resort , as the standard by which to make our decisions in all cases , where it has not been altered by established usage , or legislative power . I know no other guide which is safer , which better conducts the mind to certainty ; nor do I feel at liberty to follow any other than the principles of the common law , that are well established and applicable to a case arising under the constitution , and which turns upon its interpretation ; their adoption has been , in my judgment , most clearly made by every authority which can impose the obligation of obedience . My course then will be , to first ascertain what are the settled rules and principles of the common law , in the exposition of writings , public and private , in the definition of terms and language , used to denote the meaning and inten- us ' 3:a.yA /z/ new theories or exigencies , which will make it still more obscure , by new readings , commentaries , and expositions . That those which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , have been insufficient to settle its meaning ; is but too apparent in those questions now before us for adjudication , and those numerous ones which agitate and excite other tribunals and the country . Discarding all rules of interpretation , which are inconsistent with those which it has applied to the constitution , I shall follow in the path defined by this Court , and take that instrument , as it has declared it to have been intended by its framers , to endure for ages to come ; 1 Wh. 326 ; 4 Wh. 415 ; and designed to approach immortaliti/y as nearly as human institutions can approach it 6 Wh. 387 .

But if the plain meaning of a provision is to be disregarded , when not contradicted by any other provision in the same instrument , because we believe the framers could not have intended what they say ; it must be one , in which the absurdity and injustice of applying the provision to the case , would be so monstrous , that all mankind would unite in rejecting the application . 4 Wh. 262 , 3 ; 1 Bl .

The intention of congress is equally manifest , in their unanimous resolution , adopted after receiving " the report of the convention , lately assembled in Philadelphia , in the words following : ( the constitution ) " That the said report , with the resolutions and letter accompanying the same , be transmitted to the several legislatures , in order to be submitted to a convention of delegates , chosen in each statCy by the people thereof in conformity to the resolves of the convention , made and provided in that case . 1 Laws , 59 , 60 .

There are other objects of the grant , besides the delegated powers of agency ; the grant imposes conditions , limitations , prohibitions , and makes exceptions on the exercise of the powers of the states , and the people thereof ; which form an all important part of that supreme law , which declares , that " the judges in every state shall be bound thereby , any thing in the constitution or laws of any state , to the contrary notwithstanding . " It is therefore , a law , paramount in authority over the people of the several states , who adopted it in their conventions ; supreme , as well over their supreme law , ordained by their sovereign power , as those laws enacted in the ordinary course of legislation , by delegated power . The efiect of which is , that the constitution , the creature , prescribes rules to its creator , which expressly confine its action within defined limits , and annuls all acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , it imposes as a condition , that states shall not act by &eir; own law , or compact , or agreement , with another state , without the consent of congress ; which is a creature created by the grant of the people of the states , in their separate conventions : from which it necessarily results , that this grant j this constitution , and appointment of agents , must emanate fromf /z/ some power , paramount over , or from the people of the several states themselves . We search the constitution in vain , to find the existence or recognition of such power paramount ; there is no function which it can perform ; it can control no action by the government , or any of its departments . The whole frame of the constitution can be deranged ; the structure of government , with all its powers and prohibitions , may be prostrated by amendments , save that " no state shall , without its consent , be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate , * ' according to the provisions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paramount to that which can operate with such force .

" These terms , states , ' ' states respectively , ' ' and " the people , " to whom this reservation is thus made , have been defined by this Court , too clearly , and too often to be mistaken , or to remain open for discussion , while its authority is respected . THE TERM " STATE , " AND " UnITED StATES , " AND " THE PEOPLE , " /z/ In Fletcher v. Peck , this term is applied to a state , as existing independently of any restraint ; " a single sovereign power ; " and to a state as one of the United States , under the federal connection between them , it is thus qualified .

The political situation of the United States , anterior to the formation of the constitution , and the change by its adoption , is l ) etter illustrated in the language of this Court than it can be in mine . ** It has been said , that they were sovereign , were completely indej ) endent , and were connected with each other only by a league . " This is true . - But when these allied sovereigns converted their Heague into a government , when they converted their congress of embassadors , deputed to deliberate on their common concerns , and o recommend measures of general utility , into a legislature , empowered to enact laws on the most interesting subjects ; the whole character in which the states appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined by a fair consideration of the instrument y which that change was effected .

These references suflSce to show how names and terms are used by statesmen and judges , by congress , and this Court . It needs no reasoning to show , that the varied phraseology in the same political act , or judicial opinion , or in different ones , at different times , can not change the thing referred to . There is no difficulty in defining a state or nation . It is a body politic , a political community , formed by the people within certain boundaries ; who , being separated from all others , adopt certain rules for their own government , with which no people without their limits can interfere . The power of each terminates at the line of separation ; each is necessarily supreme within its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the limits of another , without its consent . The name given to such community , whether state , nation , power , people , or commonwealth , is only to denote its locality , as a self-governing body of men united for their own inter*-nal purposes , if two or more think proper to unite for common purposes , and to authorize the exertion of any power over themselves , by a body composed of delegates or ambassadors of each , they confederate . Each has the undoubted right of deciding , what portion of its own power , it will authorize to be exerted in a meeting , assembly , or congress , of all ; what it will restrain , prohibit , or qualify . If this can be done by common consent , the terms of their union are defined , and according to their nature , they form a mere confederacy of states , or a federal government ; the purposes and powers of which depend on the instrument agreed upon . If they can not agree , then each state instructs its delegates according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which all the states are assembled by their deputies : each state is considered as present , and its will expressed by the vote of its delegates . The congress of states are left , in such case , to perform such duties as are enjoined , and execute such powers as are given to them , by their respective and varying instructions ; the extent of which is testified in the credentials of the separate delegations , as before the confederation of 1781 . It is not necessary to give efficiency to the acts of the congress , that their power be derived from one state , nation , or people ; if they are authorized by each to act within their boundaries , they can act within and on the whole ; this action of congress does not make the states , or the people thereof one ; they remain as distinct as before any confederacy ; but congress , acting as the common legislature of each , for specified purposes , its laws operate in and over each state , as state laws do for state purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who distribute it between the two governments , as they may think most conducive to the welfare of each and all ; the machinery is simple , one moving perpetual power direct* two machines , which will operate in harmony , by the lines of sepa- ration , drawn by the same hand . But if the line and rule are placed in one hand , guided by a master spirit , with controlling power over /z/ thirteen subordinate ones ; the one declares what are federal purposes , delegates federal powers , restricts states , and prohibits state laws , by its single sovereign power ; and as to its own will and pleasure shall seem fit . The lines of separation between the states are effacied ; the people of all are " compounded into one mass , " having such supreme power as they may choose to assume ; leaving the states and people in their distinct capacities , only that portion of sovereignty which remained in them , after the paramount power had taken to itself all it wanted ; and had denied to the governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government of the Union could not use ; annulling or restraining them , according to the supreme law , which was competent to effect whatever it ordained . If such was the power which created the constitution , then our federal system is like the solar ; one sun , with as many planets as there are " the several states , which may be included within this Union : " with both systems alike created and put in motion , by an invisible , incomprehensible , but almighty power , behind and beyond them both , which can regulate and control the movements of all , at its sovereign will . Such a political creation may be a sublime conception ; present " the august spectacle of an assemblage of a whole people , by their representatives in convention ; " " conscious of the plenitude of their own proper sovereignty , declaring with becoming dignity . We , the people of the United States , do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America . " Vide 12 Wh. 354 ; 2 Dall. /z/ There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessings which the establishment of the constitution has diflfused over the whole Union , can repress those feelings , which , like an iispiration , carry the mind beyond the regions of fact , to those of fancy and imagination ; and no man more than the first , and the late Chief Justice of this Court , would give way to the effusions of their patriotism , when contemplating the glorious results of the happy consummation of a revolution , in which one had devoted his time and labours to his country , and the other pledged his life for her defence . Yet , when we descend from fancy to fact , look to the convention , in which the people did assemble , how they acted , what they did , the work which came finished and perfect from their hands , and the scenes of action ; there is indeed a moral grandeur and sublimity in the whole , which impresses itself on the mind with irresistible force . Cool reflection , however , corrects the impressions of enthusiasm , reason and judgment concurring with more exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act were of imposing grandeur and dignity , augyst in contemplation , and sublime in its beneficent results ; yet , like the constitution , and its best expositor , that these impressions are stamped on the mind , by the simplicity , rather than the splendour of exhibition . /z/ Twelve states met in convention by their separate delegations to digest , reduce to form , and submit to a congress of the states , a frame of government for such of the states , as should , in conventions of the state , ratify it as their act : the frame was made , it proposed the institution of a government between the states who should adopt it , nine of whom were declared competent These separate conventions were not to be like the general convention , composed of members appointed by state legislatures with power only to propose an act to them as their constituents , and through them to the people of the state . To the proposed act was prefaced a declaration , that it was to be the act of the people and a constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Nvas submitted to congress , and by them to each state legislature , who called conventions of delegates elected by the people of each state ; nine of these conventions separately ratified the act , in the name of the people who had authorized it ; and thus the proposed frame of government was established as a constitution for those nine states , who then composed " The United States of America ; " and between themselves only . . The declaration , in its front , therefore , necessarily refers , not to the time when it was proposed , but when it was ordained and established , by " the ratification of the conventions of nine states , " as this was done by the people of those states ; so the act declares , " We , the people of the United States , ( which have ratified ) do ordain ( by our separate ratifications ) this constitution , " for ( the states , and between the states so ratifying the same , who are thereby ) " The United States of America . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by whom for whom the act was done , and what the act was when ordained . All history proves , and all opinions agree that it was in this way that the great work was accomplished in fact , and if so , there was no other way in which it could have been done ; no reasoning can reverse the fact , or ingenuity make the act of nine distinct bodies of people the act of one , in whom all the power exerted , was previously vested . How it may be in theory , is not material ; but taking the constitution as the creation of a competent power , existing and acting practically , and not one ideal and imaginary , operating only by theory ; I find in the fifth article , and the tenth and eleventh amendments , express provisions , which point to the true source of power from which it emanated . Every part of the constitution may be amended save one , without invoking the power of the whole people , or all the states ; the amending power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or by conventions of three-fourths thereof , " as the one or other mode may be proposed by congress . " It depends on the number of the ltes , when each acts by its legislative power ; and the majority of the delegates of the people in convention of each state , when it acts by its people , not a majority of the people of all . /z/ - The tenth amendment excepts from the constitution , and reserves * to the states respectively , or the people , " all powers not delegated or prohibited . The eleventh amendment annuls a jurisdiction expressly granted to the judicial power , by the third article of the constitution ; by prohibiting its exercise , in suits against a state , by individuals , it operates on suits pending , and makes void the exercise of any judicial power in such cases , either past , present , or future . 3 Dallas , 382 , 3 ; -6 Wh. 405 to 409 , S.

It is no imaginary power that can arrest the judicial arm , or a subordinate power that can , by its own authority , avoid the exercise of that judicial power over itself , which has been granted by a paramount power .

If it is said tht the constitution authorized this amendment , we should impute little of wisdom , foresight , or common prudence , to those who framed or adopted it , by ascribing its creation to a power so indifferent to its preservation ; or to make three-fourths of the states competent to throw off the shackles on their laws , which all the states , and the whole people thereof , had imposed . There can not , therefore , be , in my opinion , a proposition more hostile to the provisions of the fifth article , and these amendments as understood by this Court , than that the constitution was a creation of the whole peopleof the United States , in their aggregate collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or state , acting by the plenary sovereignty , and in the unity of absolute political power . In thus viewing this amendment , as to " the feature " which it thus expunged , I use it as this Court does . " This feature is no longer found in the constitution ; but it aids in the construction of those clauses with which it was originally connected . " 6 Or . 1 39 . Independently of these considerations , there is another which arises from the relative condition of the states as to extent and population ; to which we must refer for the discovery of the intention of those who have left us a work " designed for immortality . " 6 Wh. 387. /z/ " We can not look back to the history of thetimes when , ( 12 Wh. 354 , ) the general convention assembled , without the conviction that the framers of the constitution would naturally examine the state of things existing at the time ; and their work sufl &ciently; attests that they did so . " 6 Wh. 416 . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its operation to the present time , we can , I think , ascertain from whose hands it has come to us to be expounded , by its objects and intentions . /z/ The apportionment of representation among the states , which was made by the constitution , was with a reference to the congress of the revolution , 1 Journ. 153 , of the whole number 65 ; the six largest states had 43 ; the remaining 7 , only 22 ; and the constitution could be adopted by nine states , having thirty-three representatives . When in 1789 , the government was organized , there were only 11 states with 59 representatives : of which , 4 states had 32 , and the other 7 , only 27 ; yet they could elect a President , and had a majority of votes in the Senate : so that a minority/ of the people of the United States , had the operative power of two branches of the government ; and could make the third , in which the majority was represented , either subservient to their will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sixteen senators , representing eight states , and a population entitled only to twenty-five representatives , could exercise ' the . treaty-making power ; and the President and twelve Senators , from states entitled only to nineteen representatives , could appoint all the executive , military , and judicial ofl &cersof; the government ; overruling five states entitled to thirty-nine representatives : whereby all offices could be filled , and treaties made the supreme law of the land , in defiance of the will of a majority of the people , and their representatives , estimating the population of 1789 by that of 1790 . Under the first census of 1790 , the free white population of the thirteen states , was 3,100,000 : pf which , Massachusetts had 469,000 ; New York 314,000 ; Pennsylvania 424,000 ; and Virginia ( and Kentucky ) 503,000 ; making 1,710,000 ; leaving 1,390,000 to the other nine states . These four states had 56 members in the House of Representatives , the other states 47 ; they had 8 votes in the Senate , the other states 18 ; they had 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , witb a whife population of 1,390,000 , could dissolve the old confederation , establish the new constitution , and throw out of the union , four states , containing 1,700,000 , or could control them if they became parties to it . Was this a government of a majority of the people of the United States , as one people ? Did the one people " ordain and establish " this " Constitution for the United States of America ? " At the census of 1800 , there were 16 states : the whole white population of which was 4,247,000 ; these 4 states , exclusive of Ken- /z/ tucky , ( taken from Virginia ) contained 226,000 , the other 12 contained 2,021,000 ; these 4 states had 74 votes in the House , 8 in the Senate , and 82 for President ; the other 12 states had 67 votes in the House , 24 in the Senate , and 91 for President ; the minority , in effect , controlling every branch of the government , and competent to amend the constitution . What became then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , composing the people of the United States ? At the census of 1810 , there were 17 states , with a white popuIa  - -  tion of 5,765,000 : of which , these states contained 2,948,000 , the other 13 contained 2,717,000 ; these 4 states had 93 votes in the House , 8 in the Senate , and 101 for President ; the other 13 states had . 88 votes in the House , 2 in the Senate , and 114 for President , the minority of the people still controlling . At the census of 1820 , there were 24 states , the white population 7,856,000 ; the 4 states , with Maine ( taken from Massachusetts ) and Kentucky , contained 4,199,000 ; the other 18 contained 3,657,000f the 6 states having 114 votes in the House , 12 in the Senate , and 126 for President ; the other 18 states had 99 votes in the House , 36 in the Senate , and 135 for President  --  the minority still ascendant In 1830 , the entire white population was 10,846,000 , of which , these 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territories , 5,311,000 ; the 6 states have 124 votes in the House , 12 " in the Senate , and 136 for President ; the other 18 states , have 117 votes in the House , 36 in the Senate , and 153 for President . It thus appears , that from the year 1790 , till this time , the four states of Massachusetts , New York , Pennsylvania and Vii:ginia , have contained within their original boundaries , a majority of the whole people of the United States : yet such is the structure of the government , that there is no one act which could be effected by such majority . Adding to the free white population of these states , according to the last census , and their present boundaries , that of Ohio and Tennessee , the 6 states contain 6,090,000 ; the other 18 states 4,646,000 , ieaving a majority in the 6 states of 1,444,000 ; which may be found to be perfectly passive for all purposes , except representation , in the House of Representatives . There are 9 states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can defeat a treaty , impeachiXient , proposition to amend the constitution , or the passage of a law , tithout the approbation of the President , against the will of fifteen " tates , containing a majority of 8,146,000 of the people of the United S " tates , in the aggregate . Thirteen states , with a population of 04,300 , can elect a President in the last resort , in opposition to lven states , with 8,232,000 . Congress is bound to call a convention amend the constitution , on the application of the legislatures of ' o-thirds of states , whose population is only 3,546,000 , less than xe-third of the aggregate of all the states : and amendments may be adopted by eighteen states , in opposition to an aggregate majority of 5 444,000 ; one of which amendments might give the smallest state . /z/ an equality of suffrage in the House of Representatiyes , and in voting for a President by electors . Seven states , with a white population of only 812,000 , may defeat any constitutional amendment ; though it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union , amounting to 9,924,000 : so that a minority may force on a majority a new government ; and less than one-thirteenth of the people of the United States in the aggregate may continue the present without any change whatever , though the reasons which call for an alteration , may be most imperative for the good of the whole . There are but two means of changing these results from the present organization of the government ,  --  one is the division of the large , or the junction of small states into new ones ; and the other , by giving tnem a representation in the senate , in proportion to their numbers . But the constitution has placed both beyond the power of any majority of the people , however preponderating ; unless by a majority of the states in the one , and by all in the second case . " New states may be admitted by the congress into this Union ; but no new state shall be formed or erected , within the jurisdiction of any other state , nor any state be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of states , without the consent of the legislature of the states concerned , as well as of the congress . " 4 art , sec. 3 , clause 1 . The senators of any thirteen states can prevent the admission of any new states , or the junction of old ones ; this can be remedied only by an amendment , which seven states can prevent . The fifth article , providing for amending the constitution , contains this proviso : " and that no state without its consent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate . ' Thus the irrevocable , irrepealable supreme law of the land , has made Delaware , with an aggregate population of 77,000 , the peer of New York in the senate , with her 2,000,000 : and she may hold her rights in defiance of the constitutional power of twenty-three states , with an aggregate population of 12,789,000 ; equal to 166 to 1 ; in federal numbers , 165 to 1 ; and in free population , 147 to 1 . How contemptible are mere numbers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of states , by the standard of the constitution /z/ The basis of representation , composed of people and property , mixed into the constituent body of federal members , leads irresistibly to the character of the government . The inevitable effect of making five slaves equal to three freemen , is , to take power from a majority of the people : so long as this apportionment of representation among the states continues ; a minority of the people of the United States in the aggregate , may elect a majority of the members of the House of Representatives ; and the conventions or legislatures of seven of the slave-holding states , can perpetuate this state of things . The general result of the last census , including the District of Columbia and the territories , is : aggregate population , 12,856,000 ; slaves , 2,010,000 ; federal numbers , 12,052,000 ; free people , 10,846,000 ; /z/ slaves represented , 106,000 : thus , the representation of the states in which they are owned , is increased by the addition of twenty-seven members ; is a representation of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may control even this branch of the government , by a majority equal to the slave representation . These results are not the efiect of accident ; they must have been foreseen at the adoption of the constitution : unless it was anticipated that the population of the states would be in an inverse ratio to their territory . In 1788 , the whole territory of the thirteen states contained about 500,000 square miles ; of which there was comprehended in the boundaries of Virginia and Kentucky , then one state , 103,000 ; in North Carolina , including Tennessee , 84,000 ; and in Georgia , including Mississippi and Alabama , 153,000 : in the aggregate , 340,000 . The other ten states , included only 167,000 , adding the territory ceded by Virginia and New York , now composing the states of Ohio , . Indiana , and Illinois , containing 134,000 ; all that was in possession of the confederacy or the states , was 640,000 square miles ; of which , three states had more than one-half , while three others had no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and ninety - third , and one only the four hundreth part . Yet this enormous disparity of territory has no more effect on the equality of a state with any other now , nor hereafter can have without its consent , than the disparity of population . Rhode Island , with 1,360 square miles of territory , is the peer of Virginia , with 64,000 . Delaware is the equal of New York , though their population is most enormously disproportionate . The rights of these states are emphatically the rights of a minority of people ; and a government which can be organized , administered , and reorganized , by a minority j whose power is expressly guarantied against any rhajority of states or peopky can not be any other than a ' federal government of these states . ' ' There can be no political absurdity more palpable , than that which results from the theory that the people of the United States , as one people , have instituted a government of the people ; a majority ( of the people ) government ; or one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no one right , , can do no one act under the const : itution , or prevent such amendments as would expunge every semfcl.ance of a popular feature from it , by reducing New York to an uaUty with Delaware , in the House of Representatives , and in voting for President ; these being the only particulars in which the Iople of the largest have any more right than those of the smallest stisites . Nor is there a political truth more apparent from the bills of I'ights in the constitutions of the several states ; their unanimous deIsu-ation in congress , in October 1774 , and July 1776 ; their alliance ' ' ith France in 1778 ; with each other in 1781 ; and the supreme law 1788 , established by the people of each , between themselves , as Sk-ch sovereign ; than that the government which they have brought ' ito existence , is a creature of the people of the several states , a i i /z/ government of a majority of the states ; which may be in all its departments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority of the people of the United States ; and changed in its whole organization and distribution of powers , by such minority , in all respects save one ; and that one is the provision which makes the right and power of the minority irresistible , by the equal suffrage in the Senate , forever secured to each state . The thirteenth article of the confederacy contained a sinlilar provision : the assent of each state was necessary to any alteration . The principle , that a majority of states , of the people of the United States , or of either , in any unity of political character , could , in any stage of our history , alter , abolish the oldy or institute a new government is utterly without any sanction in the acts of the states or congress . States were units , who could impart or withdraw power at their pleasure , until they made an express delegation to congress by the league of 1781 ; each state had its option to become a party to the compact , constitution or grant , made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sovereign , independent state , nation or power , foreign to the new Union , after the old was dissolved . By becoming separate parties , they did not divest themselves of their individual unity of character ; they remain units as to representation , and as units , reserve all powers not delegated or prohibited : and the ultimate power of revoking all parts but one of the grant , with the concurrence of three-fourths of their associates , and modifying it at their pleasure . This is the essence of supreme and sovereign power , which testifies that the ultimate absolute sovereignty , is in " the several states , " and the people thereof ; who can do by inherent right and power , any thing in relation to the constitution , or change of government , except depriving the smallest state of its equal suffrage in the senate : not in the United States , or the people thereof , as one nation , or one people , who in their unity of character or power , can do nothing either by inherent right , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rightfully exercise acts of supreme absolute sovereignty , is the sovereign power of a state ; no body or power , which can neither move or act , can be sovereign : it exists constitutionally , but as matter incapable of either . The soil of the United States , is as much the source of political power , as its aggregate population . Until the power which can establish government is brought into action , and designates the one or the other as the basis of representation or taxation , each is a perfect dead body ; and both are perfectly so by the constitution , in reference to the United States in the aggregate , or as one nation . But in reference - to the states both the land and the population , within their separate boundaries , are brought into operation ; its federal numbers are made the stock from which representation arises , and become represented by the actioa of the qualified electors of the state ; and the land in the state is assessed with taxation , by the same rates as its representation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same proportion as population produces representation . This rule is perfectly arbitrary , being the result of a compromise : the people of the states could base representation on property or people ; they could select either , or a proportion of both , and the kind of either ; and three-fourths of the states or people thereof , can now change the proportion , by excluding slaves altogether , enumerating them as each a freeman , or substituting any other species of property than slaves . Representation by numbers is not by natural right : slaves have neither political rights or power ; it is by compact , the will and pleasure of the states who have so ordained it , as separate sovereigns ; and in doing so , have shown in whom the supreme power is vested , and yet remains to be exercised in the future , as it has been in the past . The institution of the federal government is decisive of the question , it shows the creature and the creator ; the power which has made and can unmake the machine it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hands , moving within defined limits , operating only on specified subjects , by delegated authority , revocable at will . The act of delegation is the exercise of sovereignty , and acting under it is a recognition of its supremacy : it may be without limitation in some cases , and until revoked it may be supreme ; but it is so only as a delegated authority or agency ,  --  the right to revoke , and render its exercise a nullity , is the test by which to ascertain in whom it is vested by original inherent right Men are not less free when they unite and form society out of its original elements , into a body politic for the mutual safety and happiness of the parts , by a government instituted for all . Less or more bodies politic , may unite in their separate character for the same purposes ; and agree that the power of each shall be administered by one or more bodies , whom they shall separately authorize to act in their name , and for their benefit , without a surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is adopted voluntarily by each as an unit ; the only efiect is to create and erect a new body politic or corporation , by a charter or grant by the sovereign power of each . It may be declared revocable by each , by three-fourths , or require the assent of all , as by the confederation ; yet as this is a matter of compact , it does not afiect the nature of the ultimate sovereign power , which they separately reserve . Thus , the constitution itself , gives an indelible stamp of character to the government it created . It is what all confederated or federal governments are , and from their nature must be ; formed by the union of two or more states or nations , on an equal footing , by the act of federation ; a league , alliance , or constitution , is the act of each constituent part ; acting in the plenitude of its own separate sovereignty , it executes the act , which delegates to a body in which each is separately represented , such powers , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with such restraints on their /z/ several powers , as will prevent the objects of the federation from being defeated . /z/ The statesmen of the colonies could not mistake the government under which they lived ; the absolute sovereignty of the country was in the king and parliament ; colonial and provincial governments were created by charters granted in virtue of royal prerogative , not by acts of parliament . " The British government , which was then our government , ' claimed the whole territory by right of discovery and conquest ; 8 Wh. 588 , ( ante et post ) ; the right of the king to legislate over a conquered country , was never denied in Westminster hall , or questioned in parliament Cowp. 204 , 13 ; 9 Pet 748 . Hence , he may , by his grant by letters patent or charter , authorize the exercise of legislative power , by a government created in a colony , or the proprietary of a province ; and letters patent will be presumed from prescription , when a territory has been long possessed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crown , though none were in fact ever granted : as was the case of the three counties , now composing the state of Delaware . 1 Vez . Sr. 446 . Penn v. Baltimore , Chalmers , 60 , 40 , 1 . No federal connection did or could exist between the mother country and the colonies , or between them , consistently with the constitution of England , whereby parliament was the controlling government over them by their own consent The colonies could establish a federal government over themselves , when the power of Great Britain over them became extinct by the revolution ; but neither they or the states entered into any act of federation , till 1781 ; neither their separate or unanimous declaration of independence , created or announced the existence of such political relation between them . They declared what was their then political situation , consequent upon the cessation of their allegiance to the king , and the dissolution of all connection between them and " the state of Great Britain , " by the acts set forth , one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring us out of his protection , and waging war upon us . We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation , and hold them as we do the rest of mankind , enemies in war , in peace friends . " A reference to the prior declarations of the congress , will elucidate this . In October , 1774 , they declared among other rights , that they " were entitled to all privileges and immunities , granted by charter , or secured by their several codes of provincial laws ; ' * " which can not be taken from them , altered or abridged , without their own consent , by their representatives in their several provincial legislatures. " 1 Journ. 28 , 9 . In their petitions to the king , at the same time , they state their objects : " We ask but for peace , liberty and safety ; we wish not a diminution of the prerogative nor do we solicit the grant of any new /z/ right in our favour . Your royal authority over us , and our connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support and maintain . " 66 . In July , 1775 , they declared , that " societies or governments , vested with perfect legislatures , were formed under charter from the crown , ' 134 . After stating the causes which induced them to take up arms against the king , they proceed , " We mean not to dissolve that Union subsisting between us and our fellow subjects in the empire . Necessity has not driven us into that desperate measure , or induced us to excite any other nation to war against them . We have not raised armies with ambitious designs of separating from Great Britain , and establishing independent states/ ' 138 . In their letter to the Six nations of Indians , they use a term peculiarly appropriate to a declaration of independence : " You , Indians , know how things are proportioned in a family  --  between the father and the son  --  the child carries a little pack . England , we regard as the father  --  this island may be compared to the son . The pack is increased ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asks that it may be lightened ; asks if any of the fathers in any of their records , had described such a pack for a child ; he is ready to fall every moment ; but after all his cries and entreaties , the pack is redoubled ; yet no voice from his father is heard . " He therefore gives one struggle and throws off the pack ; and says he can not take it up again . " " This may serve to illustrate the present condition of the king 's American subjects or children , " 135 . The language is plain , but very easily understood . In December , 1775 , they disavow any allegiance to parliament , but fiivow it to be due to the king ; and deny that they have opposed any of the just prerogatives of the crown , or any legal exertion of those jj ) rerogatives , 263 . Their petition to the king in 1774 , taken in conxiection with this declaration , shows the precise ground assumed in 1774 , and retained , till in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y the boy . " We know of no laws binding on us , but such as have T ) een transmitted to us by our ancestors ; and such as have been consented to by ourselves , or our representatives , elected for that purpose .

Had the congress then declared , what they did afterwards , the - only pack they ever acknowledged to have been constitutionally imj ) osed on them , ( the prerogative of the crown and consequent alleiance to the king , ) would have been thrown off , and the boy becomeg a freeman . This was done in effect , on the 15th of May , 1776 , when congress resolved , that " it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown , should be totally suppresed ; and all the powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies ; " 2 Journ. 166 . This resolution was a preamble to the resolution of the 10th , recommending to the respective assemblies and conventions of the United Colo- /z/ nies , to adopt governments for themselves , 158 ; taken with the original resolution , as agreed to on the 2d of July , as follows : Resolved , " That these United Colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent states ; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown ; and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain , is , and ought to be , totally dis solved . " 2 Journ. 227 . It may well be asked , in the words of congress , in December preceding , " Why all this ambiguity and obscu* rity , in what ought to be so plain and obvious , as that he who runs may read . " " What allegiance is it that we forget ? Allegiance to parliament ? We never owed , we never owned it Allegiance to our king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever been consistent with it . " 1 Journ. 263 . Now it is very immaterial what form of a declaration was adopted two days afterwards ; when congress , for a fourth time , declared the rights and wrongs of the colonies , and their actual condition after an open annunciation of an existing war between the king and state of Great Britain and these United Colonies , then independent states . /z/ It was announcing what had been done , and the causes for doing it ; and must be taken to have been done , on the principles declared from the beginning of the complaints and struggles of the colonists to throw off the pack ; it declared the pack removed , and the boys freemen . The result was obvious , and was so declared , " the thirteen colonies of Great Britain , " thereby became " the thirteen United States of America ; " connected in a war for their defence , but not confederated by a government , to make laws for , or to put a pack on them . A comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as contained in 1 Bl . Com . 109 , ( a book then in quite as familiar use as now , and that was evidently under the eyes of congress at the time , ) will show their meaning : " that all his majesty 's cofonies and plantations in America , have been , are , andofriht ought to be , subordinate to , and dependent upon , the imperial crown and parliament of Great Britain . " Congress declared that , " these colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent states . ' Not all his majesty 's colonies in America , for Canada and Nova Scotia were no parties to the declaration ; not that these colonies had been free , for they admitted they had been dependent , and the people had been the loyal and faithful subjects of the king ; hence the words were appropriate . " These colonies , ( now ) are , and of right ought to be , not subordinate and dependent , but free and independent states . ' The same author defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A state , a realm , a nation , an empire ; the supreme head whereof , is " the king ; inferior to , accountable to , and dependent on no man upon earth ; " " as sovereign and independent within these his dominions , as any emperor is in his empire , " ( the imperial dignity , 1 Journ. 65. ) " and owes no subjection to any po- /z/ tentate upon earth/ 1 Bl . Com . 242 ; or , in the language of this Court , " a single sovereign power , " 6 Cr. 136 . The transition was from this condition of a colony , to that of a state ; from subordination to freedom ; from dependence to independence . The declaration in its front was , by the thirteen states who had been colonies , were then what they were declared to be ; and the name and style of each was separately affixed at the foot , as united by the style of the United States of America , as- they had been since 1774 , by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed , and they remained towards each other as they were before , as colonies , and then as states ; they did not alter their relations : the same delegates from the colonies acted as the representatives of the states ; so declared themselves , and continued their session without new credentials . The appointing power being the same , the separate legislature of each state , as a state , nation , or empire ; the people , the supreme head , as the king , the emperor , the sovereign . These colonies were not declared to be free and independent states , by substituting congress in the place of king and parliament ; nor by the people of the states , transferring to the United States , that allegiance they had owed to the crown ; or making with the state , or nation , of the United States , a political connection , similar to that which had existed with the state of Great Britain . A state , to be free , must be exempt from all external control ; on a " separate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " within whose territorial limits , no state or nation can have any jurisdiction : this is of the essence oi freedom , and beingyree , in the grant and exercise of legislative power at their pleasure , a state , and the people thereof , must have the absolute sovereignty , illimitable , save by the people themselves . Such was the situation of the states and people , from 1776 till 1781 , when the several state legislatures made an act of federation , as allied sovereigns , which was only a league or alliance ; and being utterly defective , was substituted by a new act of federation ; a constitution , ordained by the people of the several states , in their primary inherent right and power , existing in themselves ; before any portion of its sovereignty had been impaired by any act of federation , or any severance from its territorial boundary . /z/ So taking the power which ordained the constitution , it can be traced in all its provisions and amendments , in perfect consistency with its preamble and ' mode of adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the colonies , when they abolished the royal governments , and established new ones by their own authority as states ; and by which they abolished the confederation , and ordained the constitution . Viewed in all its bearings , as a grant , a charter , conveying and restricting the exercise of power , providing for its /z/ own amendments , and the amendments made pursuant thereto ; the people of the several states are seen in all its movements ; their acts are referrible to no other power ; and the existence of any au-thority , not subordinate to theirs , deranges the whole system . When it is so considered , without any theory but that which is developed in the English system of jurisprudence ; which , in all its parts , is infused into all our institutions of government ; there is no difficulty in finding out its intention by the settled rules of interpretation . We can understand the federal and state system in their origin , organization , and operation , as the work of the same hand ; which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and another for the federal purposes of thirteen united or confederated states , has acted in separate bodies ; and can ascertain what it has granted , how far it has restrained itself , and measure the grant by its exceptions and reservations . There never has been , or can be any difference of opinion as to the nieaning of the ordaining parts of the constitution in the terms , " the people of the several states ; * ' the several states which may be included in this union ; ' ' ' each state ; ' ' for they do not admit of two meanings . They refer to those states which , having ratified the constitution , are each a constituent part of the United States , composing , by their union , the United States of %/imerica ; and to the people of each state , as the people of these United States . When terms are so definite in the body of an instrument , and one less definite is used in the preamble , which can be made equally definite by reference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reddi potest , " Let then the term . We , the people of the United States , be referred to the second section of the first article , and compared with the terms , " the people of the several states ; " " the several states which may he included within this " union ; " the sense of both is identical . So , when we refer the terms to the seV-enth article , prescribing the manner of ordaining and establishing the constitution , there is the same identity of meaning . No other variance exists between the terms in the preamble and body , than exists in other terms which are varied in form , but are the same in substance , and used in the same intention ; as , " eacA state ; " " the several states ; " the several states which may be included within this union ; the United States ; the United States of America ; a congress of the United States ; the congress ; congress " &c.; When the various parts of an instrument can be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to the certain words of . another , without doing violence to their appropriate sense ; every just rule of construction calls for such reference as will remove ambiguity : if the two terms can not be reconciled , it is a settled rule , that the preamble is controlled by the enacting part . No case can arise to which these rules can be more applicable , and there is no discrepancy between the different terms ; one is less full and explicit than the others , the name given to the granting power is not its substance ; the thing is the power ; when- /z/ ever that is clearly defined , the name will be made to suit it . If this term in the preamble was , by common consent , or the settled course of professional and judicial opinion , taken as a mere name given to a thing of an agreed determinate nature , it would be a waste of time to inquire whether the name was appropriate to the thing ; or whether the reasoning , which makes the action of thirteen distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the same result , as the action of one on the same object , and may be deemed in legal contemplation , the sole action oi one body , was metaphysical or sound ; for it would be merely a discussion on words f which would not determine the sense of the constitution as to substance and things . That the states acted in the same distinct and separate capacity , in the creation of the government , as they did , and yet do in selecting their agents who administer its powers , is apparent in the seventh article , before quoted . The mode of action was by the people of each state , in conventions of delegates chosen by themselves ; the action of the separate conventions being , by their express authority , delegated for the special purpose , was the action of the people . The grant was theirs , of their powers ; and thus made it was in perfect harmony with all the provisions in its body , and as declared in its front ; that , " We , the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the United States of America . " The meaning is clear and plain , by a reference to the people of each of those states who ratified it in convention , and to the people of the several states who were to elect the representatives of the state , in a congress of the United States ; the same people performing different functions , the first in creating , the second in organizing the government of the states , which had been thus established between themselves . In so taking the declaratory part of the instrument , it harmonizes throughout ; no violence is done , or a strained construction put to any part ; every word has its own meaning , when it is referred to its sub- ' ect matter of application ; power flows from its original and acknowledged fountains , and is distributed by each depository , among the appropriate agents for its execution . It is the same power which lid been exerted in the institution of a government for each state ; was competent to do so for the states , which were united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in their congress ; by making any change which an organic power , absolute and unlimited , could effect , and which this Court has often declared it did effect , in its exertion by separate bodies . If it was so taken as settled doctrine , it would be easy to expound the instrument in which this power was exerted , as a charter or grant , ex visuHbus 9uis , the law at the time it was made , the common , the statute , and constitutional law of England , the history and state of the times then ' and before , the acts of the people , the states , and of congress , in their domestic and foreign relations , in some of which sources there would be found satisfactory means of its interpretation . Three of these cases turn on those clauses of the constitution /z/ which restrain the states ; the fourth depends , in my opinion , on those which are reserved by the tenth amendment : so that none can be decided , without identifying the power which made the grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign right , and which was competent for all these purposes . The preamble declares , that " We , the people of the United States , &c.; do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America/ ' That it was done by the power of the people , and not of the state legislatures is universally admitted ; as also that they had the competent power to do it . The only question which is open is , whether this power was in the people of the separate states , as separate bodies politic , or in the whole people of the United States , as one . /z/ This Court , as the appropriate tribunal for expounding the constitution , has used various terms to express their sense of the term ; as . The people of the United States in 1 Wh. 324 . The people of America , 4 Wh. 193 . The American people , 4 Wh. 403. 6 Wh. 377 , 381 . It is deemed a term of " becoming dignity , ' * suited to the solemnity of the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when they use the term , and describe how the people acted , and by what acts the instrument was adopted , they add this expression ; which one would think was in language comprehensible and clear , excluding all construction , and admitting of no two-fold meaning or interpretation : " No political dreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down the lines which separate . the states , and of compounding the American people into one common mass . Of consequence , when they act , they act in their states . " 4 Wh. 403 ; M'Culloch v. Maryland . Here is a declaration , that the organic power was not a compound mass of the people in their states . In a subsequent part of their opinion , they declare that the same power which establishedj is the same which is represented in , and exercised by congress , as well as what that power is , and in what body politic it was , is , and of right ought to be . " The people of all the states j have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general power of taxation . The people of all the states , and the states themselves are represented in congress , and by their representatives exercise this power . ' ' 4 Wh. 435 . In the same case they had explained the difiFerence between the people of the states , and the states , or state sovereignties , state legislatures , or , as they afterwards called it , the supreme power ; all meaning the same thing , when referred to the power of the state , as exercised by the legislatures thereof . 12 Wh. 347 . ( Vide 1 Bl . Com . 147 , p . S2 . ) " To the formation of a league such as was the confederation , the state sovereignties were certainly competent But when in order to form a more perfect unioi it was deemed necessary to change the alliance int an effective government possessing great and sover- /z/ eign powers , and acting directly on the people , the necessity of referring it to the people , and of deriving its powers directly from them , was felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this language there is neither a mystical or an erudite meaning , in its clear and conclusive explanations of the two systems . The congress of the confederation , was a body which conducted the affairs of the league , under the authority of state legislatures only ; and as the power could not rise higher than its source , congress could operate only by their secondary power ; and reach the people only by requisitions on the states , to be enforced by state laws . The congress of the constitution , representing both " the states , ' and " the people of the several states/ ' by a grant emanating directly from them , could operate on the people of the state ; and carrying into effect their own laws , could , without the intervention of any intermediate power j execute them to the full extent of their granted powers . Let these judicial expositions be applied to the constitution , ta ascertain by its language , the meaning of the terms , people , states representation , congress : taking them in the same order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art . 1 . Sec. 1 . " All legislative powers herein granted , shall be vested in a congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . " This is a definition of the general term congress , and its constituent parts ; which are composed as follows : Sec. 3 . " The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year , by the people of the several states ; and the electors in each state , shall have the qualifications requisite for the most numerous branch of the state legislature . " This defines the parts of the one constituent body of the congress , and who shall elect them . The next clause prescribes the ratio of each state . Clause 3 . " Representatives and direct taxes , shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union , according to their respective numbers ; which shall be determined , by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . " This defines the basis of representation to be , the federal numbers within the several states ; not the people of the states only , who elect the representatives of each ; they are included as free persons , each an unit ; but all other persons are also included , five of whom make three units ; the aggregate deterinines the number of members who shall be chosen by the people of tHc several states , to compose the House of Representatives . ** The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every tliirty thousand ; but each state shall have at least one representative : a-tid until such enumeration shall be made , the state of New Hampshire shall have three , " &c.; - Thus , the members of the House of Representatives , elected by the people of the several states , according to an enumeration of the re-/z/ spective federal numbers of the several states , are the representatives of the several states .

" The congress shall assemble at least once in every year . " Here , then , we have a definition of the body in whom all legislative powers granted by the constitution , are vested : after their meeting it is , " The United States in Congress assembled , the same as all preceding congresses had been termed .

Though they are individually the representatives of the several states , and the members from each state are its representation in congress ; yet that body being invested with legislative powers , authorized to act by majorities of votes , without any reference to states , as in the old congress , it follows , that as they may thus legislate to the full extent of their constitutional powers , their laws are binding throughout the territory of the states , who are within the Union . " They serve for all . " Vide 1 Bl . Com . 159 . In creating the executive power of the government , the constitution introduces a new principle , in directing how , and by whom , the person who is to hold the office of President , shall be elected ; as it is neither by the people or the states , but by a third body , he is the representative of neither ; but the officer designated in the mode prescribed , to perform the duties enjoined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

' ' Thus far the constitution delineates the action of the people , the states , or state legislatures , and the electors , in organizing the legislative and executive departments of the government , which enables it to execute all its functions and powers : it remains only to be seen , how , and by what power , this organization of government , the distribution and administration of its powers , was authorized and directed .

Until the other four so acted , they were no part of the United States ; nor were the people of the nonratifying states , any part of the people of the United States , who ordained and established it That the term , conventions of states , meant conventions of delegates , elected by the people of the several states , for the express purpose of assenting or dissenting , to their adoption of the proposed constitution , is admitted by all ; as also , that no general convention of the whole people was ever convened for any purpose : and that the members of the convention which framed it , met , and acted as states , consented to , and signed it for and in behalf of the states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was proposed to the people of each state separately , and was so ratified ; it existed only between those states , whose people had so accepted it It would , therefore , most strangely contradict itself , throughout all its provisions , to so construe the preamble , as to make it a declaration , that it was ordained by any other power than that of the people of the several states , as distinct bodies politic , over whom no external power could be exerted , but by their own consent These are not only the necessary conclusions , which flow from the plain language and definite provisions of the constitution itself , but their settled interpretation by this Court " From these conventions the constitution derives its whole authority . The government proceeds directly from the people , and is ordained and established in the name of the people . " 4 Wh. 403 .

The same people perform both functions ; the one creative , the other elective ; " Me people of the several states/ ' the states , or state legislatures , each submitting the constitution to the convention of the people thereof ; and when ratified , choosing the senators , and directing the appointment of electors ; all done by the free action of the people and states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and structure of the government are thus complete , by the separate action of people and states ; its movements continue by the same action , and are renewed at the periods prescribed .

By thus tracing both governments to the same fountain , and the power of both , emanating in separate grants , their bearing on both systems can be well understood , by referring any ambiguity in the grant , or any part thereof , to the same rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expound other grants and charters , which convey property , delegate , restrain , or reserve power . /z/ These considerations , however , have utterly failed to settle the true meaning of the term , " We , the people of the United States , ' as the granting or constituent power of the federal government . So far from their being any general assent to that meaning , which , to my mind , is so apparent in the constitution , with its necessary practical results , which its framers and adopters must have known and foreseen to be inevitable ; the reverse may be the common opinion . It is but too apparent that there have been two classes of both statesmen and jurists , who , from the time of the convention of 1787 to the present time , have radically differed in their constitutional opinions . Those of one class , fearful of the recurrence of the evils of the confederation , adopt the most liberal rules of construction , in order to enlarge the granted powers of the federal government , and extend the restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ natural and obvious import Those of the other class , more fearful of the gradual absorption of the powers of the states , by the assumption of powers tending to turn " a federal government of states " into a consolidated government of the Union ; adopt the most narrow construction which can be put upon words , to contract the granted powers of the one , and the restrictions on the others , by which the reserved powers will be proportionably enlarged . There was a third class , of which there is yet a small remnant , who were willing to take the constitution with its amendments , as it is , and to expound it by the accepted rules of interpretation ; whatever might ' be the result on the powers granted , restricted , excepted , or reserved ; if it was the meaning and intention of the supreme law of the land , it was their rule of action . Each of the three classes , justly considering that political power operated like the screw in mechanism , gaining strength by every onward turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and retaining its hold so far as it had turned . Each of the two first classes would , therefore , endeavour to find by construction , a lever by which to give it a power , stronger in one case , and weaker in the other ; while the third would leave it at the precise point where the first moving power had fixed it ; believing , that it ought to remain stationary , till the amending power should turn it forward or backward from its original position . Taking my position in the ranks of the third class , it has been my endeavour , in all stations , to find out the meaning of the constitution by its ex pressed intention , to be collected from all its parts by old settled rules ; the history of the times which preceded , and the state of the times at its adoption . In so doing , I can give to the preamble , or to , jAe declaratory part , no greater importance than to the other parts of the whole instrument ; when they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ; if they can not be made consistent with each other , that which most clearly indicates the intention , must control ; recital must yield to enactment ; form to substance ; the name to the thing . Those who use it as a lever , by which to press the screw more severely on the powers of the several states , must trace the power which first propelled it to some source of sovereignty , absolute and unlimited , in matters of government ; else it can not restrict the states . If the preamble truly points to the majority of the whole people of the United States , in their aggregate collective capacity , as the original depository of this power ; that power is competent for all purposes of consolidating , or distributing it , in one , or among many governments : but it necessarily excludes federation between the several states . They must come into it as equals in power , who can acknowledge no federal head , except the one created by the act of federation : no federal legislation can be exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If congress is the creation of the sovereign power of one state or nation , whose people have done the act in the unity of their political power , it is no federal government ; there are no constituent parts by which to compose it /z/ The residuary sovereignty of the several states of this Union and the people thereof , can not be the same as the absolute sovereignty of the one nation and people thereof ; which by its own unaided power can institute a government over the whole thirteen states : the term absolute admits no limitation as to power ; residuary , can mean only that residuum which the absolute power has not pleased to exercise . The use of the terms absolute , and residuary sovereignty , thus applied , either in argument or illustration , is , of necessity , with a view to make the constitution operate by its grants and restriction ; by an authority paramount to that of the people of the several states ; and thus bear essentially on its exposition . Hence , the preamble has ever been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strength , and on which they maintain their proposition ; if they abandon that field , the constitution gives them no other defensible position . The object can be no other than by the potency of the preamble , to control the provisions of the constitution ; so as to give to the term , " the people , ' ' the same meaning and reference wherever it is used . The term is found only in three places ; in the preamble it is the people of the United States ; " in the second section , first article , it is **the people of the several states ; " and in the tenth amendment " thB states respectively , or the people : " in all it is connected with " states ; " but the phraseology is different as to both terms . It then becomes all important to examine , whether " the people of the United States , " who established the constitution " of the several states ; " who elect the " representation from each state ; " and " the states respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted or prohibited , are reserved ; refer to the same or different bodies . It can not well be doubted , that if the general term in the preamble refers to the whole people in the aggregate , as " the people of the United States ; " the still more general term in the tenth amendment must be taken in the same sense , " the people ; " if they are so taken , then the intermediate term " the people of the several states , " must receive the same interpretation , or there must be this consequence . That the granting , restraining , and the reserved powers , were , and are in the " one people , " and the power of organizing and adminis " tering the government , is in the " several people of each state ; " of course there can be no reserved power- in them , and it must remain in that body which could grant , restrain , except and reserve , according to the doctrine of this Court . " Any restriction upon it , derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sovereignty to the extent of the restriction , " &c.; 7 Cr. 136 . On the other hand , if the three terms mean the same thing , the one people , the words , " several states , " " each state , " are made to mean the states in the aggregate ; by which the words " several " and " each " will be virtuailly expunged from the body of the instrument ; and the words , " in the aggregate or collectively , " inserted by construction . No one , then , can fail to perceive , that by adding these words , or taking out , or neutralizing the words " several " and " each , " the whole /z/ is made to speak in different language ; and to express an intention wholly different from that which its words import , read as they are . I , therefore , wholly disclaim this mode of construing the constitution , by adding or altering a word ; the tendency whereof is too well understood to be mistaken . It is to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operations of the instrument , in the terpis of which there is no ambiguity in defining the term people or states , and confine it to its caption or preamble , which in itself may admit of a reference to suit the object , if it is not compared with what is ordained and established in detail . By adding to the term , " We , the people of the United States , the word severally , all ambiguity is removed ; ( if any could exist after connecting it with the second section of the first article ) ; the creating , organizing , and administering power is one . By adding the words , in the aggregate , or collectively , or any others of equivalent import , the two powers are necessarily separated , and must be incompatible , unless one can control the other in its appropriate function ; so that if the constitution is to be construed by its preamble only , its meaning will depend on the interpolation of the word severally , or collectively . Now if there is any rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to make the declaratory part refer to one people in the aggregate , and the ordaining part refer to " the people of the several states which may be included in this Union , " and thus bring into action conflicting powers ; a fortiori , the word severally may be added , to make the different terms correspond , and indicate the same power , in order to produce harmony between the parts , and make the instrument speak from its four corners , in the same language , and express the same intention . This , however , is not necessary for those who take the power to be several , inasmuch as the uncertainty of the one part is removed by reference to the certainty of the others ; but as a matter of right in expounding writings , interpolation is not an exclusive franchise ; the power is , in its nature , concurrent in both sides ; the propriety of its exercise by either depends on the writing itself , or the nature of the interpolation , and its effect on its sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised by the same right ; the one operates by addition , the other by subtraction , to change the sense of words or language , in order to put in or take out of the constitution , powers which one party is desirous of including within it , though not granted , nd the other of excluding from it those which are granted ; one striving to impose new , the other to remove existing restrictions , and thus to expand or contract it to suit their respective purposes . These are two of the modes by which the human intellect has , for fifty years , been exerted , to make a supreme law , by construction and implication , what it ought to have been in terms and declared intention , in the opinion of those who think that the federal government is too weak or too strong , and that of the states are under too little or too much restraint , if the words are taken in their natural and obvious , their ordinary or legally , defined sense . A third /z/ is , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular provisions , which neither declare or refer to them ; and making them the premises , draw from the words such conclusions as must follow from such premises , whether the words warrant them or not . Either mode effects the object ; let words be added or taken out ; let us assume certain objects and purposes , motives and intentions , not apparent in express words , or necessary implication resulting from those used ; any one may make the constitution conform to his opinions , and meet his purposes : but it will not be the same as when it came from those who framed or adopted it , or as it should be read by the judicial eye . Whenever we depart from the established rules for expounding grants , and insert a new subject matter , on which power can be exerted by colour of the grant merely , and not by fair exposition , the power is absolute ; for the constitution limits only those federal powers which it grants expressly in words ; or in such terms as by their force and meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on states in definite cases , their extension in either mode , to other cases , is capable of no limitation ; so when the same process is applied to narrow the powers of the one , or the restrictions on the other governments ; or to expand or contract the exceptions on either powers , or the reservations of the amendments . The work of plain men must be explained by plain rules ; those of subtlety and refinement tend to pervert its meaning and impair its effect : it can not be a bond of perpetual union , by adding to , diminishing , or altering any term or clause which can change its sense in any way by mere implication : if it is made to speak m language different from its expressed or obvious meaning , it will defeat its own declared objects , and become the apple of discord , and the germ of disunion . It tends little to the elucidation of truth from any writing , to dwell too much on mere phraseology , when it is evidently not the true index to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial provisions are not closely examined by authoritative rules , and mere opinion substituted as the test of intention . The weighty matters of constitutional law are not in mere words and terms of designation : there are some legal instruments of which they may be the essence , or affect their operation ; such as the technical terms of some art or science , which require research to find out their peculiar meanings , when they are used in a sense different from common import . But when we approach an instrument so sacred as the constitution , discussions about words are dangerous , unless , when their meaning is admitted , and the intent is apparent ; the contest is as to the phraseology or mode of expressing it , which is most appropriate or correct , according to its classical or other standard of definition , use or application . Without such admission , and when words are intended to be made substance , and terms things ; there is great danger of an undue importance being attached to them , especially on those , upon which so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is , what was the substantive power j the acting thing j which 41 t created the federal government , infused vitality and efficiency into its action ; if we suffer our minds to be drawn from the great first moving power , to the mere terms which denote it , by engaging in a war of words , we shall pursue a phantom , a phrase . The thing sought will be first overlooked , next forgotten , and another be taken for it ; and in the end we may repudiate that power , that alone did or could act ; and conclude , that what has been done , was by a power which never did , could , or can act , so as to effect the declared object , which it is admitted has been actually effected . Apprehensions of this nature are not chimerical ; they have been felt and expressed by this Court , after the experience of forty years ; during which it had been seen , that discussions on words and terms had been made , with the endeavour to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carried so far , that the appropriate organ of the Court , thus expressed his and the sentiments of the majority , in the following language : in the exposition of a clause in the 10th section of the 1st article of the constitution , on which one of the causes now before us depends , viz : Briscoe et al v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky . It is due , however , to the very able argument on both sides , to declare , that the remarks are not applicable to the course taken at this time , or intended to be so applied . " And can this make any real difference ? Is the proposition to be maintained , that the constitution meant to prohibit nameSy not things ? That a very important act , big with great and ruinous mischief , which is expressly forbidden by words most appropriate for its description , may be performed by the substitution of a name ? That the constitution , in one of its most important provisions , may be openly evaded by giving a new name to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We think the certificates emitted under the authority of this act , are as entirely bills of credit , as if they had been so denominated in the act itself . " 4 Pet . 433 , Craig v. Missouri . In the entire correctness of these views , no one of that majority concurred more cordially than myself ; and having so concurred , I may apply it , mutatis m , utandis , to a term intended , not only to affect ' ' the m , ost import ant provisions of the constitution but to remove it , together with all its erections , from its foundation on the power of the people of the several states , to one resting on the power of one people of all the states ; as the original power which exists , if at all , only in the preamble , and is unknown to any of its provisions . The same venerated organ of the Court had , in a great case and opinion , given his and their views on attempts to give to the constitution , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obvious import , " by an express disclaimer , 9 Wh. 188 : and in a subsequent part , thus expresses himself , in language equally appropriate to the two classes of statesmen and jurists . Those who desired to extend too widely , or contract top narrowly , the powers of the government , " in support of some theory not to be found in the constitution . " " Powerful and ingenious minds , taking as postulates , that the /z/ powers expressly granted to the government of the Union , are to be contracted by construction into the narrowest possible compass , and that the original powers of the states are retained , if any possible construction will retain them ; may , by a course of well digested , but refined and metaphysical reasoning , founded on these premises , explain away the constitution of our country ; and leave it a magnificent structure to look at , but totally unfit for use . They may so entangle and perplex the understanding , as to obscure principles which were before thought quite plain ; and induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own course , none could be perceived .

" 4 Wh. 222 ; Gibbons V. Ogden . In this great opinion , concocted by a great mind , in which was stored the true principles of the constitutional law , as understood in the olden time , and as the illustrious father of federal jurisprudence expounded them in our own times ; we find it concluding with sentiments , alike worthy of the great and good magistrate who expressed them ; the tribunal whose judgment he pronounced ; and the instrument as to which it was his first and last aspiration ; esto perpetua , ' As that case and opinion too , bears most essentially on one of the present ones , the Corporation of New York v. Miln ; inclination and duty alike , induce me to follow in the path thus illumined , and with such a guide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests of the merits of all the cases before us . Assuming , that the principles of the constitution are " safe " and " fundamental ; " that there can be no exposition of its words and meaning , so authoritative as that of this Court ; I am not without the hope , that when the text and commentary are found to be in perfect harmony , there may be less discord concerning them , in judicial opinions , at least , if not in those of the profession , than there has been . /z/ No men were better acquainted with the jurisprudence of England , in all its branches , or had studied it more diligently , than the statesmen of the revolution , and those who framed the constitution ; our institutions , our ideas of government , our principles of law , the rules of rights and property , were as perfectly English as our habits and language . The colonists based their course upon the constitution and laws of England ; it was in them that they found out the nature of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powers of the people ; the duties of the government ; and a line drawn between the asserted and legitimate powers of parliament and royal prerogative . Their appeals and remonstrances were founded on the principles of a constitution , understood and respected in both countries , as the standard , line , and rule of right and power , though it was unwritten ; there were customs , charters of property and franchises , a magna charta , and acts of parliament , for their confirmation ; /z/ which secured the people in the enjoyment of their private and corporate rights , against violation by any law . Grants charters and customs confirmed by parliament , had the force of statutes ; and though they could be impaired or annulled by its supreme and transcendant power , in the mother country , where the people were represented ; the colonists denied the power , unless they were also represented . They followed the examples of theirancestors , in making a declaration of their rights and wrongs at the commencement of their struggle ; in which they claimed and complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking their stand on its principles , they asserted them in all their public acts , which led to the revolution ; and when they resolved on renouncing allegiance , and dissolving connection with the English government , congress did what parliament had done at the revolution of 1688 . When they declared the throne vacant , and who should thenceforth occupy it , they also declared to whom allegiance was due , and prescribed the form of the oath ; and when the change of government was effected in fact , announced it by a solemn declaration of the causes which led to it . Vide 3 Ruff . Statutes , 415 , 440 . The proceedings of parliament were a guide and the pattern of those of the states , and congress , from 1774 , to July , 1776 . The same principles pervaded the subsequent proceedings of both , till the present government was established ; but their experience had taught them , that two great changes were indispensable , in order to avert , for the future , the perils and evils of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested in any legislative body , as it was in parliament ; that the power of the people must be absolute and unlimited over all government ; and that no power should be exercised , unless by their own authority . That the powers to be exercised by the legislature , as well as those prohibited , excepted , qualified , or reserved , should be defined by a written constitution of government ; so that there might be more certainty and safety in ascertaining its meaning as a supreme law , than when it depended on usage , custom , and prece- , dent These changes were made by all the states but two , during the revolution . /z/ To understand the constitution then , we must trace its principles , terms and provisions , back through the leading acts of the people , states , and congress , to the great fountain of constitutional , statute , and common law , from which our statesmen traced our whole system of jurisprudence ; and by a careful examination of the whole ground , endeavour to discover the intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own expressed intention . That it is a charter of government , a grant of power , all admit : it is also an ancient charter , for the federal government rests upon it as a fundamental law ; those of the states also , are regulated by it in its grants , as well as its restrictions ; it ought therefore , to be expounded , as all /z/ such grants and charters are , according to what the law was at the time of making them .

" 4 Pet . 431 , 2 .

It is a settled rule , that grants by states , of things , to which the grantor has no right or title , are void , 9 Cr. 99 ; 5 Wh. 303 ; 6 Pet 730 : and that no external power can restrict a state , 7 Cr. 136. /z/ , It must then be ascertained , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the main position which I assumed , and have endeavoured to maintain , that each state was " a single supreme , sovereign , power , ' exclusive , and absolute , within its own boundaries ; unless by its own grant by the constitution , and the restraints it has thereby imposed on itself ; I can understand it in all its parts . The people of a state , who had by their state constitution , granted the power of legislation to their state legislatures ; had plenary power , to take from them such portions as they pleased , and by their grant vest them in a federal legislature . The same people could , by the same power which made their con- /z/ stitution the supreme law of the state make that of the United States , the supreme law of the land , embraced in the Union ; by each declaring it so within their respective boundaries , and uniting all the constituent parts , by a deed , signed and executed by the people of each . They could grant and modify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fieri ; when consummated , they had no further power over it , for , by their own consent , a case arising under it could be decided only by the judicial power , as in a case arising under a grant of land by A. to B. So , when a state renounces all power to emit a bill of credit ; to make a compact with another state , without the consent of congress ; to impair the obligation of a contract , and declares its exercise to be prohibited ; the consequence is plain . Limitations are imposed by itself , which it can not pass ; the act is declared by the people to be void , by being a violation of a supreme law , by which they have bound themselves . By this law , they order their judges to obey it ; and by which , this Court must adjudge the act of the state to be void , for the want of power , in obedience to the command of that " single sovereign power , ' ' ' which could bind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own supreme law , to the judicial power of its own creation . If a state has thereby became " shorn of its beams , ' ' and thenceforth shines with less original brightness ; " it is by its own act : and for the future , it must move within the circle by which it lias confined its own action , until i , t shall be enlarged by another power , to which each state has bound itself to appeal . The amending power , existing in " the states , respectively , or the people , " to be exercised pursuant to the fifth article of the constitution ; which must be taken and construed as a clause of revocation , in a deed , grant , or charter , by an individual , the king , a proprietary , a colony , a state in its legislative capacity , or by the people as the sovereign thereof . It is a declaration by the grantor , that he reserves , and in the mode he has prescribed , will exercise his right to modify or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has imposed on himself , whenever the requisite number of the separate parties concur , with such exceptions as are specified in the revoking clause . Subject to this power of revocation , the sixth article declares what the effect and obligation of the grant shall be ; then the tenth amendment is added by way of a proviso , a condition and limitation , operating on the whole constitution ; declaring that what is not granted or prohibited , is reserved to the organic power ; " the states respectively , or the people , " ( respectively ) . ' /z/ Such is the meaning of these terms , according to the language of the instrument in which they are used , the precedent acts of the people , the states , and the congress , the convention , and this Court , which , in any other cases than those arising under the constitution , would have been held to be conclusive , and closed all discussion . /z/ There will not be found in judicial history , an instance of a question arising on the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , law , or treaty , that would have been deemed an open one , after such a course of adjudication on their construction as has been already shown . Nor is there any other country , in which the decisions of its own supreme judicial tribunal would be overlooked , and the interpretation of its fundamental laws be sought in the opinions of foreign writers , or the adjudications of the inferior courts of foreign nations . In England , one judgment of the house of lords settles the law ; and it is not suffered to be again discussed in an inferior court . Here too , the same effect is given to a final adjudication of this Court on any other question arising on a written instrument , save on the constitution . Yet their repeated definitions of the terms states , and people , of contracts , their obligations , cessions of territory , of jurisdiction , by deeds and laws of states , or treaties with foreign powers , have been unavailing . All profess to respect this Court , as competent to the high functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the constitution : all profess to revere that instrument , as the best and most perfect emanation of human wisdom : but practically it would seem , that neither its framers or its constituted expositor , have expressed their intention in intelligible language . We find that every thing which has the semblance of judicial opinion , whether from the bench or bar of Westminster Hall , at this day ; is pressed upon us as evidence of the meaning of a grant made fifty years since , without an inquiry how the law which bears upon it , was then . We are asked , in effect , to overlook its great feature as the supreme law of the land , speaking in the same language , from the time it was proposed to the present , and through the whole intervening period ; and to make its construction accord with the fluctuations of judicial opinions in England , which we well know have been very great within the last fifty years . /z/ If we follow this course in our opinions , and it should appear on investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England by judicial power , and we follow the example , one of two consequences are inevitable . The constitution will have one meaning in its application to the old states , and a different one as to the new ones ; according to the law as laid down by some of the courts in England , a judge at nisi prius , or some elementary writer , at the different periods when each state became a party to it : or the law , as laid down at this day , must be incorporated into the constitution , as " a fresh infusion f and it be made to speak retrospectively , in a language wholly unknown to its framers , and those who adopted it ; nay , wholly different from what was understood , and universally accepted at the time , as declared by this Court in one uniform series of decisions for forty years . In either case , we give to these opinions of foreigners , which have no reference to our constitution , of /z/ men who know not its principles ; not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we virtually make this tribunal subject to the appellate power of foreign courts . If , as an individual , I could be willing to waive the quantum of colonial dependence , which would be implied in thus recognising any judicial authority over us , as yet remaining in the land of our ancestors ; I would expect at least , that it should be only that of a court of as high authority there as this Court has here ; not of a court whose judgment may be reversed by the king 's bench , exchequer chamber , and house of lords ; the opinion of a single judge , which may be overruled in bank ; or of a writer , whose lucubrations are read in neither court , or at nisi prius . As a judge , I am bound to take the law of a grant or charter as it was " at the time of making them , and their ancient allowance ; ' in the administration of the system of jurisprudence which pervades the land , I take it as it was ' when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their legislatures , by the constitution , congress , and this Court As a constituent member of a court of the last resort , I feel bound by its solemn and deliberate expositions of the law , in cases involving the collisions of power between the state and federal governments ; restraints on either , or the rights of individuals or of corporations , secured by either . The same rule must be the law in the thirteen old , and the thirteen new states , which have been admitted into the Union . If we suffer our minds to be influenced by other authority , we must expound our supreme law , our great bond of union , not by the rules and principles which were taken as settled law , at the time of its adoption , but as it now appears to be the doctrine of the day in foreign courts , which may be changed before the next term . If the constitution is to be taken as a certain grant , an uniform line of power , one law , regulating old and new states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original boundaries of the states , or late acquisitions by treaty ; it must speak in the same language , and its terms have , in 1837 , the same interpretation as they had in 1787 , otherwise it must forever remain unsettled . Judicial reformations of the existing law , are as much liable to be reformed , and the law restored to what it was , as present law is subject to future reforms ; if we do not respect the opinions of our pre- decessors , it can not be expected that our successors will respect ours . We must , therefore , look with a single eye to what the law was in 1787 , as declared by this Court ; and carry its settled principles into new cases as they arise : if we do not , it will become impossible to sustain the principles of the constitution against the assaults which will be made upon it . Our only safety is , in its being received as a standard rule of action and judgment , the same through all time , directing the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , as this Court say , " We can not comprehend that train of reasoning which would maintain that the extent of power granted by the people is to be ascertained , not by the nature and terms of the grant , but by its date . Some state constitutions were formed before , /z/ some since , that of the United States . We can not believe that their relation to each other is , in any degree , dependent upon this circumstance . Their respective powers must , we think , be precisely the same as if they had been formed at the same time . ' 4 Wh. 410 . If , then , the respective powers of the state and general govern- . ments are to be tested by the law , as it was , fifty years ago ; I can not regard its subsequent changes , when judicially examining the questions now before us . I can not look to late adjudications in England as the rule by which to determine the effect of a grant of a ferry in 1640 ; a charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what was the obligation of the contract granting them when it is made ; but look only to the law as it then was . In so doing , I follow another principle settled by this Court , in Saunders v. Ogden ; that though the obligation of a contract can not be impaired by a law made subsequent to the contract , yet all contracts are subject to the regulations prescribed by laws , existing when the contract is made ; 12 Wh. 368 ' , 9 . By a contrary course , the principle is completely reversed ; we repudiate the law in force when the contract and grant was made ; we apply to it the law as subsequently altered : so that while we are bound to declare a state law void , so far as it impairs the obligation of an existing contract , we give effect to an English decision , which may produce the same result . As an example , let the case of a grant of a ferry be taken to illustrate my position . In Saville , 11 , 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the court of exchequer chamber , in 23 Eliz. 1581 ; which was then the highest court in the kingdom , as the house of lords had not then assumed their supreme appellate jurisdiction . It is admitted by the judges below , and counsel here , that the common law as to ferries is , and has ever been , the law of Massachusetts ; notwithstanding which , an opinion given in 1835 , by a lord chief baron of the exchequer , has been relied on in opposition to the case in Saville , to show the nature and extent of a ferry granted in 1 640 . Whether the latter or the former opinion may now be the received law in England , matters not ; the colonists brought with them the law of ferries , as it was at the time of their emigration ; this ancient grant of the colony must be construed accordingly . To be consistent , we must suspend a final judgment till the present court of exchequer chamber has reversed the principle established as the law for two hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court will not readily introduce any innovation into the common law on a subject so important , on the authority of a single judge ; this Court certainly would not so far respect the opinion of one of its own members . That these views are peculiar , is evident from the course of argument and opinion : but their peculiarity is , in itself , no reason for abandoning them ; if they are not erroneous , they are safe as a guide to a true interpretation of a grant of power , to be exercised by the several governments in the United States , whose basis was the constitution of England , and the common law ; as the great system of jurisprudence , from which all our institutions arose . /z/ I now proceed to trace the constituent power of government , in the several states , as the constituent power of the United States , of which the people are the head , the " caput et Jinis ;  --  the emperor , king , prince , potentate , sovereign , each of his own empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , original fountain of all legislative , executive , and judicial powers , granted or restrained , in and by the constitution , to the colonies of Great Britain : who became states of this Union , and were its constituents in 1788 ; according to my position , each in their own right , " absolute and unlimited in matters of government , commerce and possessions ; ' ' as held and enjoyed by them respectively , and not collectively , or in the aggregate , as one people , one state , or nation . The proposition is stated in these terms , as well to support it by the political and judicial authorities which bear favourably on it , as to negative the antagonist proposition ; which having been laid down by authority of both descriptions , more weighty and influential , than mine can or ought to be ; I must either make it the rule for my judgment , by submission to its results , or show by some paramount authority to which we all profess to submit , that it is not founded on historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fundamental maxim , and necessary principle of English " tenures , that the king is the universal lord , and original proprietor of all the lands in his kingdom ; and that no man doth or can possess any part of it , but what has mediately or immediately been derived sls a gift from him , to be held upon feodal services . " 2 Bl . Com . 51 , The feudal tenures were abolished under the commonwealth , and their abolition confirmed at the restoration , by the 12 Car . 2 , ch. 24 ; and by the 4th section it was enacted , " that all tenures hereafter to be created by the king , ' &c.,; " shall be in free and common soccage , and shall be adjudged to be in free and common soccage only .

A third class were , charter governments in the nature of civil corporations , with the power of making by-laws for their own internal regulation , not contrary to the laws of England ; and with such rights and authorities , as are specially given them in their several charters of incorporation . The form of government in most of them , is borrowed from that of England . They have a governor , named by the king , ( or in some proprietary provinces by the proprietary , ) who is his representative or deputy . They have courts of justice of their own , from whose decisions an appeal lies to the king and council here , in England , Their general assemblies , which are their house of commons , together with their council of state , being their upper house , with the concurrence of the king or his representative , the governor , make laws suited to their emergencies .

But the association drawn up on the 20th of the same month , shows , that they agreed on the condition of ih people of the colonies , who in a full and free representation thereof ; thus headed their association : " We his majesty s moat loyal subjects , ' ' &c.; so they then were , and so they remained , till they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance due to the king , which devolved on them when they ceased to be dependent on " him .

' The British government , which was then our government , and whose rights have passed to the United States , * ' 8 Wh. 588 , as instituted and organized ; must then be examined in its great outlines , as the pattern of the colonial state and federal governments , which have superseded it , but which are all founded on the same fundamental principles . All resting on the supreme power of the people of the state , as one state ; but consisting of the people of three distinct estates in England ; each acting separately in constituting the government of the nation , the state , empire , realm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power which created and continues it , is in those separate estates , as the constituent parts . The colonies were mere dependencies of the state , a part of its dominion , but not of itself ; for from the preceding view taken by Mr. Justice Blacks/one , it is evident that they were not states or estates of the kingdom , as they are defined in p. 50 , 51 . " The legislature of the kingdom is entrusted to three distinct powers , entirely independent of each other : the king , the lords spiritual and temporal , which is an aristocratical assembly of persons , selected for their piety , their birth , their wisdom , their valour , or their property ; " and " the house of commons , freely chosen by the people from among themselves , which makes it a kind of democracy : this aggregate body , actuated by different springs , and attentive to different interests , composes the British parliament , and has the supreme disposal of every thing ; ** 51 ; as the power of making laws constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any state resides , it is the right of that authority to make laws ; 52 . ( Vide 12 Wh. 347 . ) " With us , therefore , in England , this supreme power is divided into two branches ; the one legislative , to wit : the parliament , consisting of king , lords and commons ; the other executive , consisting of the king alone ; the British parliament in which the legislative power and , of course , the supreme and absolute authority of the state is vested by our constitution ; 1 Bl . Com . 147 . Parliaments are " general councils , ** 149 ; " an assembly that met and conferred together ; ** general assemblies of ihe states/ 147 ; " great council ; ' * " the meeting of wise men ; ** conventus magnatum , ** &c.,; 148 ; to make new laws ; novis injuriis e ? nersisy nova constituere remedia , &c.; Congress , to " consilio , convention , constituere , ) A legislative assembly , 1 Bl .

The constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " the king in his political capacity , and the three estates of the realm , the lords spiritual , the lords temporal , ( who sit together with the king in one house , ) and the commons , who sit by themselves in another. ** And the king and these three estates together , form " the great corporation or body politic of the kingdom , of which the king is said to be caput prindpium et Jinis* 1 Bl . Com . 153 . These are the constituent parts of the sovereign power , " 156 . Both classes u /z/ of lords , however , though in the eye of the law , the lords spiritual are a distinct estate from the lords temporal , and are so distinguished in most of our acts of parliament , yet in practice they " are usually blended together under the one name , the lords ; they intermix in their voles , and the majority of such intermixture joins both estates , " 156 . The lords spiritual being archbishops and bishops , and formerly abbots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ancient baronies under the king , in right whereof they were allowed their seats in the house of lords , 155 . The lords temporal consist of all the peers of the realm , 156 ; as a body of nobles having a distinct assembly , deliberation , and powers from the commons , in order to support the rights of the crown and the people by forming a barrier to withstand the encroachments of both , 158 ; representmg themselves and the landed property of the kingdom , they hold or are supposed to hold . The commons consist of all such men of property in the kingdom , as have not seats in the house of lords , every one of which hjas a voice in parliament , either personally , or by his representatives . In a free state , every man who is supposed a free agent , ought to be in some measure his own governor ; vide 1 Journ .

( Tliis is the principle which is now applied to the people of an empire , extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean ! ) " In a large state , the people should do that by their representatives , which is impracticable to perform in person ; and have them chosen by a number of minute and separate districts , wherein all the voters are or may be safely distinguished . " The counties are therefore represented by knights , elected by the proprietors of land ; the cities and boroughs by citizens and burgesses , chosen by the mercantile or supposed trading interest of the nation , " And every member , though chosen by one particular district , when elected and returned , serves for the whole realm .

The king , lords and commons in parliament assembled , 196 . The king is a constituent part of the supreme legislative power , - 961 ; the executive power a branch thereof , whose " share of legis- /z/ lation " is in the power of rectingy rather than resolving/ this being suflScient to answer the end proposed , 154 ; the lords , in law two estates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , or supposed so ; the commons , composed of the knights of shires , as the representatives of the landholders , or landed estates of the kingdom , 172 ; citizens and burghers supposed to be elected by the trading interest , as the representatives of the most flourishing towns , who , as they increased in trade and population , were admitted to a share in the legislature , and yet retain it , though they had decayed ; and the representatives of the two universities , to protect in the legislature the rights of the republic of letters , 174 ; so of the cinque ports . Herein we have the legislative power of the colonies and states , by substituting the term general assembly in their charters and constitutions , in lieu oi parliament ; excepting only the restrictions and qualifications by them respectively imposed . have also the merely resolving power of " the United States of America in Congress assembled before the confederation ; and the power to make requisitions on the states under it , which was but a shadow of a parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legis lative powers herein granted , ( which ) shall be vested in a congress of the United States ; the American parliament , composed of the President , Senate , and House of Representatives , the caption of whose laws is , " Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives , &c.,; in Congress assembled ; * ' as in England , by the lords spiritual and temporal , and commons , in parliament assembled . The great difference between the two constitutions is , the one defines the " legislative power , and limits it by enumerating the subjects of its exercise ; ' ' 4 Wh. 405 ; 9 Wh. 188 , 9 , 195 ; the other does not ; of consequence , it is supreme and absolute ; but both define the executive power , when it acts otherwise than its appropriate part in legislation . In England , it is by the prerogative power , inherent in the person who fills the throne , as king or queen ; here it is like legis-Jative power , which is only what is granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 1 Wh. 326 . The president is invested with cei'tain important political powers ; 1 Cr. 166 ; which , if he or any officer acting by his orders , exceeds , the act is void , and the officer suable , 171 ; as a legislative act , repugnant to the constitution , is void , 177 , so must an executive act be . But Vrhen the executive acts within the powers delegated , his acts have the power of the constitution , in the same extent as acts of congress ; 1 Cr. 164 , 172 . The royal prerogative can no more be exercised by the executive joower here , than the transcendent absolute power of parliament Cian be by congress . Both powers are exerted by constitutionally cJelegated powers , and are void else . In England , the king 's prerogative is limited by certain bounds ; it extends to all things not injurious to his subjects ; 1 Bl . Com . 239 . ( The exemptions need not be stated here , as they will be more appropriately referred to in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in the king , for the sake of unanimity , strength , and despatch ; he is the chief magistrate of the nation ; 250 . He may reject what bills ; make what treaties ; may coin what money ; may create what peers , and pardon what offences he pleases ; unless when the constitution hath expressly , or by evident consequence , laid down some exception or boundary , declaring , that thus far the prerogative shall go , and no farther ; 250 . " With regard to foreign concerns , the king is the delegate or representative of his people , in whom , as in a centre , all the rays of his people are united ; ' 252 . " As their representative , he has the sole power of sending and receiving ambassadors ; ' 253 . " The sole prerogative of making war and peace ; " 257 . " The first in military command in the kingdom ; " 262 . " It is partly upon the same , and partly upon a fiscal foundation , to secure his marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports and havens . " " The navigable rivers and havens were computed among the regalia , and were subject to the sovereign of the state ; the king is their guardian , and lord of the whole shore . " " But though the king had a power of granting the franchise of havens and ports , yet he had not the power of resumption , or of narrowing , or confining their limits , when once established ; " 264 . " He is the fountain of justice , and general conservator of the peace ; " 266 ; " though he has delegated his whole ju-. dicial power to his judges ; " 267 . " From the same original , of the kings being the fountains of justice , we may also deduce the prerogative of issuing proclamations , which is vested in the king alone ; " 270 ; " of conferring privileges ; " 272 . " He is , with regard to domestic concerns , the arbiter of commerce ; " 273 ; " and , as such , has the regulation of weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the medium of commerce , it is the king 's prerogative , as the arbiter of domestic commerce , to give it authority or to make it current ; " 276 . " The denomination or value for which the coin is to pass current , is likewise in the breast of the king ; he may legitimate foreign coin , declaring at what value it may be taken in payment ; " 278 . " The king may , also , at any time , decry or run down any coin of the kingdom , and make it no longer current . " 279. /z/ In this outline of our old constitution of government , we see the pattern of our new one , though with a different distribution of powers ; the most important of those which are in the king , by prerogative , in England , are granted to congress ; the judicial power is vested in the courts of the United States , exclusively ; and the executive power is as much defined by enumeration , as the legislative and judicial powers of the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments ; and from this there arises another , which is all important The powers not delegated , or prohibited , being reserved to the states respectively , or the people ; Done can exist by prerogative , or inherent power , in any branch of /z/ the government . Hence the effect of a specification of the powers granted and prohibited , and the express reservation of all others , leaves to the states all the prerogative powers of the king over those subjects which are involved in these four cases , either directly or collaterally ; on none of which are any " powers granted to the United States by this constitution . ' ' The only questions involved are , whether the laws and acts of the states come within the prohibition ; if they do not , they are valid , as the exercise of their reserved powers : to regulate their internal polity , police , and commerce ; to grant charters of incorporation , for enjoying franchises over public rivers and arms of the sea , within a state ; for the establishing the boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the funds of a state , according to the terms of the charter . There is another difference between the executive power here and in England . The king is a natural person , on whom the crown descends by hereditary right , as real estate does ; and in whom the executive power vests , by birth , on the demise of the crown , so that the crown is never without an heir ; 1 Bl , Com . 190 . Here the executive power is vested in a president ; who is an officer created by the constitution , to perform the designated functions of an office , which is filled by an election in the first place ; on the demise of the incumbent , the office devolves on certain other officers , named in the constitution , and act of congress . Of consequence , whether the office is filled by the person elected thereto , by " the electors from each state , " or by " the representation from each state , in the house of representatives , " by " each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer designated to fill it ; the executive power is equally vested in him , as the president of the United States . The office is filled , the officer filling it , whether the vice president , on whom it devolves by the constitution , the president pro tempore of the senate , or the speaker of the house of representatives , on whom the office devolves in succession by law ; the character of the office , the nature and power of the office is the same . It is precisely what the constitution has declared ; neither more nor less ; his legislative functions are like the king 's , except that his veto is not absolute : but in his executive capacity he is , and can be no more than an officer ; the chief executive magistrate , as the chief justice , is the chief judicial magistrate of the United States . The name , or style given , imports no power ; before and under the confederation , congress elected a president , who was ex officio , and from the nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the United States of America in Congress assembled ; " 1 Laws , 481 . But the title was a mere name , till the constitution made it a thing  --  " the executive power , " on some subjects supreme ; on others subordinate ; according to its provisions , in designating the respective powers confided to him as an agency , as all the grants of power to the other branches of the government are declared to be by this Court He has , therefore , no representative character 3 has no representative function to perform ; and neither by his representa- /z/ tion of the states , or the people , can exercise any powers reserved to them ; though they are the very powers vested in the king by prerogative , as the delegate or representative of the people of his kingdom or empire . In other respects , the great features of both governments are the same ; both established by the people of the estates of one , the states of the other ; each state or estate represented by their representatives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen or appointed in a different manner ; but each representing their several and respective estates or states ; though , when elected and returned , " serving for the whole realm ; ' the whole United States . " The estates of the realm , ' ' in parliament ; " the United States , which may be included within this Union ' in congress , acting by " the representation from each state , ' ' in the house of commons , or representatives , and in the house of lords or senate , by persons entitled by birth , oj6 &ce,; tenure , or appointment by the king , or " chosen from each state , by the legislature thereof ; " and both lords and senate constituting the middle power , between the executive and the people . There is another feature common to both governments . In England the king has his constitutional counsellors and councils . The peers of the realm are , by their birth , hereditary counsellors f ) f the crown ; and may be called together by the king to impart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for law matters , 229 . But the principal council is the privy council and by way of eminence is called the council , 229 . So the president has his councils , " He may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer at the head of each of the executive departments , " &c.; 2 Sec. 2 Art , Clause 2 , Const . This is called a cabinet council ; it is a privy council in which the president is present , as the king is in person in his . 4 Bl . Com . 231 . The senate is the council in making treaties , in advising and consenting to appointments to office . Senators are not , ex offiicio , counsellors individually ; but the president " may convene both houses , or either of them . " /z/ THE 2d , and GEORGE THE 3d , COMPARED . Another striking feature of affinity in the great political institutions of both countries , is in the convention of the estates of the one , and the states of the other , as its organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 Bl . 156 . In England it is called a " convention parliament , ' 151 ; because the two houses meet , as the representatives of their several estates ; each sitting and acting separately , as in their legislative capacity , but acting as a constituent convention . There can be no constitutional parliament /z/ without a king : the houses meet in convention , and declare the rightful heir to the throne to be the king , as at the restoration , 151 ; or as at the revolution of 1688 , when the houses as conventions , declared the throne vacant j by the king having abdicated the crown ; name the person to fill it , and fix the succession in future : but in both cases acts of parliament were passed , when all the constituent parts were assembled , to confirm and validate the acts of the conventions . 3 Ruff . 145 , 415 ; 1 Bl .

This declaration has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held , that the two conventions were one , that the people they represented were one ; but the contrary ; the declaration has , by the assent of all , been taken to be what it says it is in the heading , the act of the lords and commons assembled pursuant to their respective letters , which were addressed by the prince to the house of lords separately , from the one to individuals merely . By the fundamental law of the kingdom both could not form one body . The lords , represented the two estates of the nobility ind clergy ; once lords , they remained so though the throne was vacant . They sat in their own right , representing themselves and property f as two estates or states of the nation or realm , wholly distinct from the third estate or state ; that estate was the whole body of the people , represented in the convention of the commons . As there was no king , there could be no parliament , or house of commons in any other capacity than in a convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer so , hence the letter addressed to them was not to assemble as a constituent part of a parliament , but to call a convention , to be composed of representatives of the people of the counties , &c.; to be elected by the same electors of the several places who voted for members of the house of commons , and for the same number . Thus th estates of the kingdom remained distinct as before , when there existed a parliament in all its parts ; the two conventions acting separately and concurring in opinion , made one declaration , to which they had separately agreed , as separate conventions , who were a full representation of the nation , of the three estates thereof , lords spiritual , temporal , and commons . They did not represent the head of the state , the king , because there was none ; hence they used the term , nation , not kingdom , , as there could be none without a head , nor es- /z/ tates of the kingdom , when for the want of the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three estates embraced the whole nation , in all its component parts , though not the state in its supreme corporate capacity ; 1 Bl . Com . 147 ; yet parts of the nation , empire , or the realm ; 1 Bl . Com . 242 ; consisting of the clergy and nobility , or lords , and the people , or commons , who were the nation . Now it is most strange , that when we compare these proceedings with those which commenced in the colonies , in 1774 , from the first assembling of congress , till they made " a declaration* of rights and wrongs , and entered into " an association , preparatory to a revolution ; and from that time to July , 1776 , when the revolution being effected , and the colonies had in fact became states , and made " the unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of Awerica announcing that fact to the world ; that both declarations patterned from the declaration of 1688 , throughout , and in many parts copied , should be taken to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing one nation , instituting a national government thereof ; and not as thirteen colonies or states una animo , declaring each to be a free and independent state , when the name of each was afiixed , signed by their separate agents , calling themselves their representatives . It is equally strange , when in 1781 , the same states by " articles of confederation and perpetual union " between them , naming each , entered into a confederacy or league of alliance , the style of which was " the United States of America , ' * the second article whereof declared , ' each state retains its freedom , sovereignty , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in congress assembled ; ' * and by the third article , " the said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other , ' * &c.; that there then existed an unity , of political power , in the people and government of one state or nation , compounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one , from 1776 ; so that no particular state had any power , right , or jurisdiction to retain to itself , or delegate to the United States . It is stranger still that it should be asserted , that congress acted as the representatives of one people , state , or nation ; when it is an admitted fact , that the first rule adopted by the congress of 1774 , was , " Resolved , That , in determining questions in this congress , each colony or province shall have one vote . " 1 Journ. 11 . So it continued till the confederation which declared , " each state shall have one vote ; " 1 Laws U. S. 14 ; and so it remained till the old congress was dissolved , in 1788 , by the adoption of the constitution by nine states , each having one vote in a convention of the people thereof . If there can be a political truth , it would seem to be this , that where , in a body composed of sixty-five members , there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there must be one vote less for each state that was absent ; that the body did not , and could not represent , and act for all the states and the whole people , as a national legislature , " serving for the whole realm , " nation . /z/ or state . They were a mere conereas of states , colonies , or fHfoyinces ; the legislature of each of which was the separate constituent of its own deputies , or " ambassadors , " who gave the vote of their " sovereign , * ' and not their own ; and , therefore , could by no political possibility , be a legislature in any political sense , as the representatives of a people in their aggregate collective capacity . /z/ If any thing connected with the construction of the constitution - can be deemed a bold and unwarranted theory , or extravagant doctrine , it is in the application of the remarks of Mr. Justice Blackstone , in 1 Bl . Com . 158 , 9 , before quoted , as to the people of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , and the first rudiments of the Roman state . " There , he says , the people legislated " in their aggregate or collective capacity ; which term he uses in contrast with legislative powers exercised by representation of the people in a large state : the power is the same in the people of a large or small state ; the only difference is in the mode of its exercise : in the latter case it is in their primary assemblies , in the former by representatives , elected to act as their agents by their authority . Now , when we find a term used in reference to a petty state , whose whole territory was not as large as a county in one of the states , or its population equal to many towns or cities , applied to the establishment of a government of this Union , of an almost boundless extent ; the utter fallacy of any proposition founded upon it , is self-evident It never has been true , in fact , that the people of any of the states assembled to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Athens would meet at the Areopagus , and of Rome at the Capitol , to make laws or decrees ; but the people of England or the United States never so met When their action is in their primary assemblies , as an aggregate or collective body , it is , and always has been , either to express their opinion , or exercise the elective franchise in choosing their representatives ; this is done , as Blackstone says , in designated districts ; for , in a large state , the people must do that by representatives , which they can not do in person ; that is , legislate by their duly selected agents , and not personally . No lawyer in Westminster Hall would venture to assert , that the ordinances of the convention of 1688 , were the acts of the people of the kingdom , in their " aggregate or collective capacity ; " as the people of Athens or Rome , when in an assembly , they woul4 put down one ruler and appoint another , or change their form of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounded the action of the people of a county or city , in the election of the members of a convention , with the action of the convention by its ordinances ; and no theorist has been hardy enough to take the position , that when the people act in a convention of thei ? representatives , they act at the same time in their individual capacity In England , at least , there is an agreed distinction between the cor /z/ stituent and the agent ; between a body composed wholly of constituents , and another body of mere agents ; between electing the agents for ordaining a fundamental law , and its enaction by those agents under their delegated authority . There , too , the nature of a representative government appears , in the opinion of their jurists and statesmen , as it does in its practical operations ; fact , principle , and theory , point to the same original source of power ; and " no political dreamer " thinks of compounding the people or the estates of the kingdom , into one mass , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers of all corporations or bodies politic are accurately defined , whether they relate to government or other matters ; and voluminous as the reports of their judicial proceedings are , we seldom see one which involves a question of constitutional power , in any department or office of government How different the case is here needs no further explanation than what is afforded by our judicial and political history ; we have not yet attained a knowledge of the power on which the federal government rests ; the meaning of the preamble of the constitution is unsettled ; and as we trace it to the bodies which adopted it , the difficulty thickens . A great question is at the threshold , and must be removed , before we can examine the interior of the structure . All admit , that in fact , the constitution was established by the ratification of the people of the several states , in separate conventions or representatives , whom they elected in the respective counties : yet the preponderance of political and professional authority , is in favour of the proposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective capacity . When this shall become settled doctrine , it will be seen how much better the nature and science of government is now understood , than it has been in England ; and was understood by the congresses and conventions of these states , from 1774 till 1787 . It will also illustrate the happy effects which flow from the great fundamental principle of the American system of government  --  the cer tainly of a written constitution . The congress of the revolution , and the convention of 1787 , were ignorant of any other legislative power than that of the separate states . It is attributing to the members of congress in 1777 , the most utter and profound ignorance of the nature and powers of the government of the revolution , which they themselves administered r five years , if it was such an one as commentators now hold it to have been . In the letter recommending it to the states to adopt the articles of the confederation , they say , " Every motive calls upon us to hasten its conclusion ; " " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to our treaties abroad . " " In short , this salutary measure can be no longer deferred . It seems essential to our Very existence as a free people , and without it we may soon be constirained to bid adieu to independence , to liberty , and to safety , " &c.; 1 Xaws U. S. 13 . The remedy was far worse than the disease , according to modern theory ; but the practical statesmen and jurists of tHe day , deemed it of vital importance to have a government in form , /z/ though utterly defective in substance and execution . Bad as it was , it was better than none ; a line oi duty was prescribed to the states ; if they did not follow it , it was not because it was not plain ; whereas , before , the only line was drawn by the states themselves , in their separate instructions to their delegates , or in acting on their recommendation . When too it is recollected , that congress asked for the delegation of the shadow of power by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the substance already , by delegation from the people ; the men of the revolution were either ignorant in what a government consisted , or the expositors of their acts have made one which never existed but in their own fancy . The same remarks will apply to the members of the convention of 1787 , if we so take the words of the preamble of the proposed constitution , as to be a declaration that the political existence , and organic power of the several states and people , had become so amalgamated into one body of supreme power , as to make it the sole grantor of the powers of the federal government , and competent to restrict the states , and control existing state constitutions . Their letter to congress , and of the latter to the several state legislatures , asking separate conventions of the people in each to ratify it ; was an act indicating political fatuity , if the instrument contained , and was intended to be a declaration , that when ratified by such conventions of nine states , and thus established , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , " but of all collectively . /z/ It would also be an imputation of political treachery to tbe states , who were the constituents of that convention , to draw up a frame of government , which in all its provisions explicitly declared the separate existence and action of " the people of the several states , and of each state , " in all the movements of the government , in all time , in language admitting of no twofold interpretation ; And then prefixing to it a declaration , by which the states , in their most sovereign capacity , in separate conventions of the people , are made to admit and acknowledge , that " the absolute sovereignty " in matters of government , was not , and from July , 1776 , had not been invested in the people of the separate states ; and that they had , at the adoption of the constitution , only such " residuary sovereignty , " as remained after a paramount power had made a supreme law over them . Had the convention so announced it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , in proposing its ratification ; there would have been a fifth unanimous declaration of the rights of the states and people ; not only of rights , but of wrongs and grievances , more aggravated than those which led to the revolution , because they were attempted by their own representatives , in violation of their instructions . No state convention would have convened ; congress would have at once rejected the proposition , and in the name of each state declared , non in hsec federar venemur ; they would have /z/ pointed to their four declarations in October , 1774 , July and December , 1775 , and July , 1776 ; to the articles of confederation , and their state constitutions ; as so many denials in the most solemn forms , of the proposition submitted . It is not credible , that when the power of parliament to legislate for colonies who avowed allegiance to the king , was utterly denied , even under the British constitution , the authority of which was universally admitted ; the free and independent states who had eleven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their old constitution , would have adopted a new one which left them less free in legislation , than tJiey were in their colonial condition . After throwing off the pack put on their backs , while boj/s and children as parts of the family of one common father , by an usurped power of legislation ; they would not , as merij and as freemen , emancipated by their own acts , take up another pack , still heavier and more grievous. /z/ Parliament never asserted by the plenitude of its omnipotence , such powers of legislation over the colonies , or attempted to impose such restrictions on colonial or provincial legislatures , as are exerted by the constitution ; and if it is a supreme law , overriding state constitutions , by any other authority than that of the people of each , without and against their consent , it is one more sovereign over them than that which they threvv off by the revolution . Every principle by which it was conducted , every object sought to be attained , was reversed and frustrated ; if , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equal station among the powers of the earth , ' * which they assumed in 1776 , and did not then each retain all powers which they had not expressly delegated to the congress in 1781 . Every state constitution asserted palpable falsehoods ; and the people thereof exercised usurped powers , if the sole right of instituting any government over them was not in themselves alone . And thus , every solemn act , and written document of the congress , and the states , for thirteen years , will become utterly falsified ; if the " power , right , and jurisdiction ' * of the federal government , and the authority of the constitution is not by grant from each state , of what all had so often declared to be inherent in the people thereof , by original right , and which it had hitherto retained . If these powers were in the whole people of the United States , as one " single sovereign power , " from 1774 , till 1787 , that power still exists in its original plenitude ; and the judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey and expound it as the grant of that power , speaking in its words , and expressing thereby its intention , as the grantor in whom there was full and absolute right to do whatever it has ordained . /z/ If the constitution was only a grant of power , it would be of little importance to inquire whether it was to be considered as made by the one , or the separate people of the states who adopted it ; for its obligation on those states would be unquestioned . But the importance of the vestion arises on the restrictions and amendments ; whether a state restricts itself , or is restricted by an external power ; whether the reservations are to the people collectively , or the people of each state . And it must be remembered , that the terms of reservation in the 10th amendment , make no change in the constitution , in virtue of the amending power in the 5th article ; it is a declaration by the grantor , of the meaning and effect of the grant and prohibibition , which none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is necessary that there should be : first , a competent power to grant the thing granted ; and next , the grantor must have competent power to prohibit and restrain states and state laws ; to make exceptions to the grants and restrictions , and to reserve to itself all other powers not exercised by the grant : and as B can make no exception or reservation out of a grant made by A , all these powers must be original in the one who was competent to make the grant If it is in A , the grant throughout being his act , is easily construed as one deed , with its various clauses ; which , when referred to one person , whose intention it expresses , is taken as a simple , plain writing , the one part whereof explains the other , by reference and established rules . But if the grant is taken to be the act of A , in granting certain things to C , restraining a previous or subsequent grant by B to D ; declaring what B or D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grant a proviso or defeasance by B , that what is not granted to C , or prohibited to B and D , shall be reserved to B or D , the whole is unintelligible . The exceptions and reservations being of original right and title . Which is vested in A , are void and inoperative , if not made by A himself ; they remain in him , and can not pass to B or D without direct grant : of consequence , the grant becomes disencumbered of any exception or reservation ; and must be taken , by all the rules of law , as if it contained none in terms . Taking , then , the constitution as the grant of the one people to congress , imposing restrictions on the states acting in the legislatures thereof , and the people acting in convention ; and the tenth amendment operating as a proviso or defeasance on every part thereof , not as an actual or intended alteration of any of its provisions ; it must follow : That as it was made by a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompetent to except or reserve any tiling out of , or from it , to the people of the several states , if they are not the grantor ; or to the states respectively , if each was not a grantor . Not being parties to the grant , they are strangers to it ; and no principle of law is better settled , than that an exception or reservation to a stranger , is void : it must be to the lessor , donor , or /z/ feoflfor , and his heirs , who are privy in blood , and not to any who is privy in estate , as to him in possession , remainder , reversion , &c; 8 Co. 70 , b , 71 , a ; Shep . Touch . 77 , 80 ; 4 D. C. D. 288 , 9 ; Fait . E. 5 , 6 ; 9 Joh . R. 75 . An exception is of something out of that which the grantor had granted before by the deed , Shep . Touch . 77 ; a reservation doth always reserve that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was before , ib. 80 ; and sometimes it has the force of a saving , or exception , to reserve a new thing , or except part of the thing granted ; Co . Litt. 143 , a . It is therefore evident , that to give any effect to the reservation , it must be taken as the act and words of the grantor , 10 Co. 106 , b ; 4 D. C. D. 290 ; and that whatever meaning is given to the term in the preamble , must be carried into the exceptions and reservations ; so as to make the reserved powers a part of what was in the people before the grant , or something excepted from it . /z/ No jurist has ever questioned the universal application of the maxim , ' poterit enirn quis rem dare et partem rei retinerey vel partem cle pertinentibics ; et ilia pars quam retinef semper cum eo est et semper fuit , Co . Litt. 47 , a . Whether the words operate as an exception or reservation , the effect is the same ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grantor , and always was ; and the maxim has been adopted by this Court in its common law meaning , by the words of the grantor , denoting his intentions , and to be construed accordingly . 6 Pet . 310 , 741 ; 4 D. C. D. 290 ; Fait. /z/ It is then a necessary consequence of these rules , that the people of the several states , have now no reserved powers , or that they are the granting power of the constitution ; and as grantors , could make exceptions to the powers of congress , to their own reserved powers , and reserve what was not so granted or excepted . Another rule results from the preceding ones , which this Court lays down as one " to which all assent , " that an exception to any power proves , that in the opinion of the lawgiver , the power was in existence had there been no exception . 12 Wh. 438 , 9 ; 9 Wh. 206 , 7 , 16 . The exception marks the extent of the power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what is excepted or reserved , 6 Pet . 310 , 741 ; an exception will not be inserted by construction , 4 Pet . 462 , 3 ; but shall be taken strictly against the grantor , 4 D. C. D. 290 ; and " an exception out of an exception , leaves the thing unexcepted . ' Ib . Fait . E. 7 . By keeping in view these unquestioned rules , it is easy to understand the constitution in all its parts as a grant ; and by so considering it , we can trace the true grantor in its provisions , its history , and the political situation of the states at the time of its adoption , and back to theii colonial condition . If by so doing certainty can be attained , no labour can be too great ; nor can time be deemed uselessly employed , if it leads to satisfactory conclusions on a subject so important . /z/ The political history of our country presents a narrative of one continued struggle between the states and the confederacy , either for territory or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the revolution , the question whether the vacant lands which lay within the boundaries of particular states , belonged to them exclusively , or become the joint property of all the states ; was a momentous one which convulsed our confederacy , and thleatened its existence ; but it has been compromised , and is not now to be disturbed . 6 Cr. 142 ; 5 Wh. 376 . It was settled by cessions by particular states , and the adoption of the articles of confederation . Vide post . When that was done , the question of power arose out of 4:he incompetency of congress to effectuate the objects of its adoption ; the collision of opinion was not what were the relative powers of the several states and of congress ; for it was then admitted that what was not expressly delegated , was retained by and remained in each state . That a new government was necessary was the universal opinion ; but the difficulty was , in agreeing what additional powers should be given to congress by the surrender of the states ; no statesman or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way than by the voluntary act of the separate states ; in their sovereign capacity , by the people in conventions . This difficulty did not cease by the unanimous act proposed by the general convention . In their letter submitting it to congress , we find them stating the same reasons which embarrassed their action , and long delayed its ratification by the states . " It is obviously impracticable in the federal government of these states to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each , and yet provide for the interest and safety of all . ' ' " It is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered , and those which may be reserved ; and on the present occasion , this difficulty was increased by a difference of opinion among the several states , as to their situation , extent , habits , and particular interests : " " and thus the constitution which we present , is the result of a spirit of amity , and of that mutual deference and concession , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Laws U. S. 71 . There can be no misunderstanding of the meaning of this letter , that the convention had proposed the frame of a " federal government of these states , " to be created by a surrender of the necessarypowers by the several states , to be made by the people in separate conventions ; so as to make the constitution paramount to those of the states , and not leave the powers of congress dependent on a grant by the legislature , which the people could revoke or change . So it has been considered by this Court , in a most elaborate opinion . " This mode of proceeding was adopted ; and by the convention , by con- /z/ congress , and by the state legislatures , the instrument was submitted to the people . " " They acted upon it in the only manner in which they can act , safely , effectively. , and wisely , on such a subject , by assembling in convention ; it is true they assembled in their several states , and where else should they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of breaking down the lines which separate the states , and of compounding the American people into one common mass . Of consequence , when they act , they act in their states . But the measures they adopt , do not , on that account , cease to be the measures of the people themselves , or become the measures of the state governments . From these conventions the constitution derives its whole authority . The assent of the states , in their sovereign capacity , is implied in calling a convention ; and thus submitting that instrument to the people . But the people were at perfect liberty to accept or reject it , and their act was final . It required not the affirmance , and could not be negatived by the state governments . The constitution , when thus adopted , was of complete obligation ; bound the state sovereignties ; and the government proceeded directly from the people . " 4 Wh. 403 , 4 . Neither in this , or any other opinion of the laite Chief Justice , will there be found an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or collective capacity , " being the constituent power of the government ; it will not be found in any act of any state legislature , convention , or congress ; while every declaration by either asserts all power to be , and to have been , in the people of the several colonies or states . Every fundamental principle of that government , from which all ours have been mainly patterned : every movement of the people of both countries , in convention of their representatives ; explodes the doctrine . So , too , the concurring declarations of this Court , sufficiently numerous to establish a code on any other subject , have indicated and made visible to the most ordinary capacity , the organic power which created , and was alone competent to create government In one of their opinions , delivered twenty-five years since , they little imagined the present clouds which hang over the knowledge of those bodies , in which that power was vested . " The course of reasoning which leads to this conclusion , is simple , obvious , and admits of but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of concessions from the several states ; whatever is not expressly given to the former , the latter expressly reserves ; " 7 Cr. 33 ; United States v. Hudson and Goodwin . It is but reasonable , that this coincidence between the terms of the instrument , the cotemporaneous declaration of those who framed it , the action upon it by congress , state legislatures and conventions , and the exposition of all that ' was done , as given by this Court ; would have led to the universal conviction , that the words and terms used were intended and must be taken in their declared sense . But as it has not sufficed to produce this effect , it becomes indispensable to recur to those acts of the colonies , the states , and congress ; from /z/ which the conclusion has been drawn , that the grantor of the constitution , was not the people of the several states . /z/ From the preceding view of the colonies prior to 1 774 , and while the ancient relations between them and the mother country continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each other , in all matters of internal government , as they now are . Their only political connection was by their union under one common sovereign , as it is now under the constitution ; their governments were in virtue of separate charters then , as they are now under their several constitutions ; and no one , or any number of colonies , had any more power within their limits , than the states have now . No other controlling power did , or could exist then , under the old constitution of the kingdom , than does now under that of the Union , save such as it imposed . Though they had assembled in congress to consult on their common concerns , they had never made a government over themselves ; and when they met in 1774 , their proceedings showed in what capacity they acted . They first resolved , that each colony should have one vote , which was an explicit declaration , that they acted separately in all they did ; their declaration of rights and resolutions are also too unequiv.ocal for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After reciting the grievances suffered in consequence of certain acts of parliament , and of the crown , they declare the character and authority under which they act . " The good people of the several colonies of New Hampshire , Massachusetts Bay , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , New Castle , Kent , and Sussex on the Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , and South Carolina , justly alarmed at these arbitrary proceedings of parliament and administration , have severally elected , constituted , and appointed deputies , to meet and sit in the city of Philadelphia , in order to obtain such establishment as that their religion , laws , and liberties , may not be subverted.

But . from the necessity of the case , and a regard to the mutual interest of both countries , we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British parliament , as are bona fide restrained to the regulation of our external commerce ; for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country , and the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation , internal or external , for raising a revenue on the subjects in America without their consent ' * ' Resolved , N.

So were their other letters and addresses at that time , Q2 . These proceedings can not be mistaken in the distinct assertion , that all the powers of government were vested in the several pro- /z/ vincial legislatures , subject only to the restraints mentioned in the fourth resolution . There was no state or nation , to which the several colonies stood in the same relation , as the counties and towns of England did ; they had no separate powers of government within a county , &c.; the aggregate population composed the state or nation , so did the population of a colony , so now does that of a state .

Hence there can be no analogy between the people of the different districts of a colony , who are the people of the colony , and the colonies themselves in their political capacity , and the people thereof separated from all others by territorial boundaries . To unite them as one , is to erase the line of separation , and make one co/ony and one legislative body out of thirteen , acting by the power of one people , inhabiting the former divisions , and the separate colonies , as merely the counties of the one . Let us suppose , that in the congress of 1774 , an additional resolution had been offered to this effect " Mesolved , N. C.

This was done in a convention of the people in January , 1776 , by a constitution which remained in force till 17S4 ; declaring the dissolution of all connection with the British government , and " assuming that equal rank among the powers of the earth , for which nature had destined us , and to which the voice of reason and providence loudly called us .

No extraneous power could act , within their respective limits , without their /z/ consent : from the moment that the authority of Great Britain ceased to operate , that of each colony became absolute and sovereign ; and no government could exist thereout , which could prescribe laws - within it Such was the unanimous expression of the universal sense of the people , in primary assemblies , in conventions of counties and states , legislatures and congress , from 1774 : four colonies had become states by the adoption of constitutions of government by the inherent power of the people ; the formation of a fifth was in progress on the same principles , which were solemnly promulgated by the original declaration of the rights of the several colonies , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a colony in which any authority under Great Britain was exercised , except in warfare : and when congress resolved that allegiance was due to the several colonies ; that treason was punishable in the colony wherein the act was committed ; and that the regulation of trade was subject to the laws of the respective legislatures ; it was tantamount to a declaration , that they were then independent , and had , in fact , " assumed their equal station among the powers of the earth . " Congress had recommended that all the colonies should do so , by the establishment of a government on the authority of the people only ; four states had exercised , a fifth had entered upon the exercise of this authority ; and a convention of the people thereof was assembled , before the declaration of independence , by congress , was engrossed or signed by any member . Vide 1 Dall . Laws , App. 54 . THE POLITICAL SITUATION OF THE COLONIES AND STATES BEFaRE /z/ From these proceedings , the political results were plain and selfevident ; each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-government , had in fact become an independent state ; five were so , by their declarations of independence in the most solemn manner . No sovereignty did , or could exist over them , unless that of Great Britain should be restored by a reconciliation ; which not happening , their declaration of independence , in their separate conventions , became absolute ; and these states were independent according to the universal opinion of the country , which is most clearly expressed in the language of this Court . 4 Cr. 212 , M'llvaine v. Cox . " This opinion is predicated upon a principle , which is believed to be undeniable , that the several states which composed this Union , so far at least as regarded their municipal regulations , became entitled , from the time when they declared themselves independent , to all the rights and powers of sovereign states , and that they did not derive them from concessions by the British king . The treaty of peace contains a recognition of their independence , not a grant of it . From hence it results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of sovereign states ; and as such were obligatory upon the people of such states , from the time they were enacted . We do not mean to intimate an opinion , that even a law of a state , whose form of government had been organized prior to the 4th of July , 1776 , /z/ and which passed prior to that period , would not have been obligatory . The present case renders it unnecessary to be more precise in stating the principle , for although the constitution of New Jersey was formed previous to the general declaration of independence , the laws passed , on the subject now under consideration , were posterior to it/ ' ( They were for the punishment of treason against the state. ) /z/ Such being the political condition of the colonies and states , it be comes a question of easy solution whether congress intended to make a solemn promulgation of these principles to the world , by declaring the great result of the revolution to have been , or to be , the establishment and continued existence of thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate and sovereign in each ; or of one nation , one state , with one national government Whether this great and crowning act of the revolution was intended to perpetuate , or prostrate , the rights and powers of the colonies , the states , and the people thereof , and to substitute one government , in place of thirteen then in existence . To absolve the people of those states not only from their allegiance to the British crown , but from that allegiance which congress , ten days before , had resolved the people owed to the several colonies ; to abolish as well the royal , as the colonial and state governments , within the boundaries of the United States ; to suppress alike the British constitution , and those state constitutions , which , two months before , they had recommended to be formed , by the authority of the  |p6o|ple  of the several colonies alone ; to proclaim to foreign nations in April , that the power to impose duties , impositions , and regulations on trade , was in the respective legislatures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world that the power " to establish commerce , " &c.; existed in one state , in one government , acting over all the states in their unity of political power , as the representatives of one people , of the one state . Taken in this sense , there must have been two American revolutions ; one to suppress the government of Great Britain , the other to suppress the governments of the states , each of which was by the right of revolution ; for there is no more pretence of any authority by the people of the states , or in the credentials of the members of congress , who were appointed by colonial or state legislatures , to abolish state governments , and constitute a national one , invested with supreme legislative powers over all the states , than there was by the king and parliament to abolish their supreme legislative , or prerogative powers , by any act of the several colonies or states , or when they were assembled in congress by their deputies . The states , by their several representatives , effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congress effected the second , by imposing on the states  - -  people , a new sovereign  --  themselves . Taken in the other sense , the declaration of congress , on the 4th July , 1776 , announced one great revolution ; on the great principles solemnly declared in 1774 , and reiterated in every political movement by the people , whenvr /z/ they expressed their opinion , in large or small popular assemblages or through their representatives at home , or those deputed by their local legislatures , to consult , deliberate , and resolve in a congress . Congress could declare the existing political condition of the colonies and states , as their delegates or deputies : but as congress was not a convention of the people , nor had that body any pretence of power to alter the existing state of things ; to assume to themselves any legislative power ; or take away any from the states ; we must therefore read their great and solemn act , as one done by a delegated , rather than by an usurped authority . Its very front is stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken . " In Congress , July 4 , 1776 . " ( Vide ante , 44 . ) " The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America . ' It declares self-evident truths ; the right and power of the people , to alter and abolish existing government , and to institute new government , on such principles , and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness : it sets forth the grievances of the colonies , and concludes thus : " We must , therefore , acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation , and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind , enemies in war and in peace friends . " " We , therefore , the representatives of the United States of America , in general congress assembled , appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions , do , in the name , and by the authority of the good people of these colonies , solemnly publish and declare , that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free and independent states ; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown , and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain , is and ought to be totally dissolved ; and that dsfree and independent states they have full power to levy war , conclude peace , contract alliances , establish commerce , and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do . And for the support of this declaration , " &c.; &c.; An unanimous declaration of the thirteen states must necessarily mean an union of action between separate states , in declaring their separate rights . It was a self-evident truth , that the " one people of each state , could alter , abolish old , and institute new government at their pleasure : but on every principle of the revolution , it was as self-evident a falsehood , to declare , that " one people " could do so for another ; or that the people of any number of states , could , in any way , control the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that congress held or could exercise the power of the people in relation to government , either separately or collectively ; all their votes , acts , and resolutions , were by states ; not per capite , as a body representing or legislating for one people . They professed to declare only what did exist ; not to alter or abolish any present , or to institute any new government . They declared these united colonies to be independent states , not one state , as the " state of Great /z/ Britain ; ' that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown ; but did not declare , that the people of the several states were absolved from their allegiance to their state , or held them bound to allegiance to the United States , as a state . /z/ It remained still a self-evident truth , that by the absolution of all allegiance to the crown , and the dissolution of all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain ; the thirteen United colonies , became thirteen United States , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had the powers declared , as the necessary result of each colony having then , or previously , become freed of all restraint , by the removal of all incumbrance on their independence . This was the meaning of their separate declaration of independence , as declared by this Court , in Coxe v. MIlvaine , " that the several states from the time when they declared themselves independent , ' ' were entitled to all the rights and powers of sovereign states . It would be strange , indeed , if , by their afterwards uniting with the other states , in their unanimous declaration in congress assembled , they had lost their separate independence , were again dependent , and ceased to hold those rights and powers . This Court has expressed their opinion to the contrary , in Harcourt V. Gaillard , 12 Wh. 526 , 7 . " There was no territory within the United States that was claimed in any other right , than that of some one of the confederated states . " " Each declared itself sovereign and independent , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ( the 31st degree of north latitude , ) as the limit which she was entitled to , and which she had laid claim to , when she declared herself independent ; or which the United States had asserted in her behalf , in the declaration of independence . " The treaty of peace " has been viewed only as a recognition of pre-existing rights , and on that principle , the soil and sovereignty within their ( the states of South Carolina and Georgia , ) acknowledged limits , were as much theirs at the declaration of independence , as at this hour . So , in the Dartmouth College v. Woodward , 4 Wh. 651 ; this Court say : " by the revolution , the duties , as well as the powers of government , devolved on the people of New Hampshire . It is admitted , that among the latter , was comprehended the transcendent power of parliament , as well as that of the executive department " If the authority of this Court is respected , the declaration of independence is to the judicial mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world , by the separate states assembled in congress by their respective deputies , voting for , and signing the instrument by states ; a publication of their existing political condition , each as an independent state , the people of each , " one people ; " the state on an equal footing with the other powers of the earth , united in a common struggle against oppression . The voice of the people , whenever , and however expressed , and their action by their appro- /z/ priate agents , in thei/ domestic , federal , or foreign relations , fikows that this declaration was so received and understood by the whole country ; from the time it was made , till the adoption of the constitution . Each of those states which had not before done it , proceeded to institute government for itself , by written constitutions ; declaring all power to be inherent in the people of the state , and denying the existence of any other , with the exception of Connecticut and Rhode Island . Those states , which had previously adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt felt or expressed , that the governments so organized , were as competent , and in all respects on the same footing , as those which were constituted after the 4th of July , 1776 . Vide 4 Cr. 212 , 13 . The two states , which were exceptions , furnish a still more conclusive illustration of this universal opinion . Connecticut had no constitution till 1818 ; Rhode Island has none to this day : both states continued to exercise their legislative power , under their respective ' charters from the king , in virtue of his prerogative . The people of those states had never assembled in convention to abolish the British government , or to institute one of their own ; they made no separate declaration of independence , or conferred any new authority on their state legislature ; but they silently acquiesced in the course of legislation , founded on the unquestioned existence of a supreme sovereign legislative power , by which legislative usage was , by the tacit assent of the people , a constitution in effect . Herein they departed from the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define , limit , and distribute the powers by written constitutions , instead of doing it according to usage and precedent ; but this very departure shows the force of a principle fundamental in all free states and governments ; that all power emanates from the people of the state . That legislative usage , by the implied consent of the people , makes such usage as much a supreme law ; and to all intents and purposes , the constitution of a state ; as if one had been ordained and established by an instrument in writing , adopted in a convention of the people , by their expressly delegated authority . So this Court have held the usage of Connecticut , 3 Dall. 398 , 400 , &c.,; and of Rhode Island , 2 Pet . 656y 7 , under their respective charters ; and their political condition , by the results of the revolution , as defined in 4 Wh. 661 , is precisely the same as that of the state of Great Britain . The usage of the legislative body , is the only supreme law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state . That the force of such usage in these two states , was in no wise impaired by the declaration of independence in congress , is therefore a self-evident truth ; and as they had made no separate declaration , either in form , or in any writing constituting government , it is as a political or judicial truth equally clear , that the declaration by congress , was made by the delegates of these states , in the name and behalf of each , of the rights and powers of each , as well as the others of the thirteen , by the unanimous act of all . So it was considered by congress , from the 4th of July onwards ; all their /z/ proceedings show that their declaration of tights in 1776 , differed from their declaration of rights in 1774 , only in this . The latter referred to the rights of the colonies , when first united , to obtain a redress of their grievances , by petition and remonstrance ; an appeal as British subjects for justice , by the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law : in the hope of reconciliation , by the repeal of the obnoxious laws , and a disavowal of what the colonists held to be unconstitutional power . The former referred to the then existing rights and powers of the states and people , resulting from the principle declared in 1774 : which , after all hope of redress or conciliation had became extinct , and the appeal to arms taken by both parties , were in 1776 applied to the states ; who being ipso facto independent , by the suppression of the authority of Great Britain , the fact was declared and proclaimed , together with its effect on the condition of the several states . The people of the states were no longer the subjects of the king , but were thenceforth the citizens of a free state , owing allegiance to it , but to no other state or power ; and were thereby on an equal station with the other powers of the earth , as states . In October , 1776 , congress directed that every officer should swear , that " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire , &c.; to be free , independent , and sovereign states , and declare that the people thereof owe no allegiance to George the Third , king of Great Britain , " 2 Journ. 400 . That allegiance is the unerring test of sovereignty , existing in the state to whom it is due , is a . truth too evident to be discussed or denied . In November , congress agreed on the frame of the articles of confederation ; and in their circular letter addressed to the respective legislatures of the states , refer it to them , as " so many sovereign , independent communities ; ' and " to each respective legislature , it is recommended " to invest its delegates with competent powers , in the name and behalf of the state , to subscribe articles of confederation and perpetual union ; 1 Laws U. S. 12 , 13 . These proceedings suffice to show the sense of congress as to the domestic relations of the states before they had adopted the articles of confederation : their federal relation or connection had assumed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its deputies in such form as they chose ; and congress had hitherto acted by an authority , assumed as exigencies required , calculating on the acquiescence of the separate states . If congress was , in 1776 , a national legislature , with power to pass laws independently of the several states , and to control state legislatures , all subsequent acts were worse than useless ; for the government was more absolute than the present . The declaration of independence admits of no qualification of the unlimited powers of a state . Taking it as the creation or the recognition of a government , instituted by one people of one state , as guarantied by the treaty of alliance with France , and acknowledged by the treaty of peace with Great Britain ; it was " absolute and unlimited in matters of govern- /z/ meftt , commerce , and possessions ; ' * and all the rights of the crown , and powers of parliament , devolved upon , and passed definitively to the one state and nation , as well to the soil as the jurisdiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That this view of the declaration of independence is contradicted by historical facts , by all the political events of the revolution , the proceedings of congress , the general and state conventions , and the adjudications of this Court is , I think , fully apparent in the preceding view . It also appears* to me , that this declaration has been as much perverted , as the passage from Blackstone , in its application to the then political situation of the colonies , or states ; its intention and effect , connected with the history of the times , is so plainly expressed , that it seems incapable of being misunderstood . That there were thirteen colonies , with separate governments in each , without any control by one over another , is admitted ; that they assembled by different representations ; that they voted , acted , and signed the declaration by their separate delegates , is apparent on the journals of congress , and the face of the paper . The members who assembled as the delegates of colonies , were the same , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name , and by the authority of the good people of these colonies ; which was :  --  That these united colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent states . ' If this declaration had no bearing on the constitution , or if that instrument was not the most ill-fated one that was ever devised and written by man , not only by being itself perverted , but made the cause of perverting every other instrument in writing which forms a part of its history , or can be referred to for illustration ; there would be the same union of opinion as to its meaning , as there has been for one hundred and fifty years in England , as to the declaration of rights , wrongs , and the effects thereof , in 1688 . That it consummated a revolution in government , whereby all colonial dependence having ceased , each political community assumed , as a state , that separate and equal station among the powers of the earth , which other independent states held , and which each state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universal opinion , if no question of political power was involved in mystifying it . If this paper is taken as it reads , and means what it says , it contains neither a graqt or recognition of the existence of any legislative powers within the limits of the once colonies and then states ; other than what was and had been in the several legislatures thereof , from their first settlement ; and if it can not be made so by bold assertion , or misinterpretation , there is no foundation for the theory of the unity of power in the " one people , " in constituting a government for the United States . To my mind , it seems a contradiction in terms and sense , that the declaration could be true in fact , in principle , or historically ; if the several states could be made subject to a constitution , ordained by /z/ to two great grievances set forth : For taking away our charters f abolishing our most valuable laws , and altering fundamentally , the forms of our government : ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever . " This is the precise effect of the modern interpretation of this great act of the revolution ; by which commentators make congress declare , that the very acts of oppression , committed by the king and parliament , against which the states and people contended as violations of their rights , were no longer so when exercised by congress . If the result of the revolution was a change of masters ; a mere substitution of a supreme national government over states , with powers more absolute than were ever asserted by king or parliament ; then the charters of the states were virtually annulled ; their forms of government altered fundamentally , and their own legislatures not only suspended but superseded . It will be left to theorists to reconcile the commentary with the text . /z/ By these articles , the nature of the confederation , and its objects , were clearly defined : the relations of the states to each other , their separate powers , and those of congress , explicitly declared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states but by delegates , who were the representatives of the respective state legislatures ; who were expressly named as the constituents , who had authorized them to be ratified and confirmed , and in the name and in behalf of each ; and which was so done by the delegates who signed the same accordingly ; 4 Laws U. S. 19 , 20 . For present purposes it is necessary to refer only to three articles . ' Art 3 . The said states , hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other , for their common defence , the security of their liberties , and their mutual and general welfare ; binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to , or attacks made upon them , or any of them , on account of religion , sovereignty trade , or any other pretext whatever . " " Art . 9 . The United States , in congress assembled , shall have the sole and exclusive right and power of sending and receiving ambassadors , and entering into treaties and alliances ; provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the respective states , from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners , as their own people are subjected to ; or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever . " 1 Laws U. S. 16 . This alliance , league , or confederacy of the states with each other , can leave no doubt , that up to the time of the final ratification in March , 1781 , each state was separately sovereign in its own inherent right ; and so remained as to all power not expressly delegated , as was declared in the second article . The third article is also conclusive , that the object of the alliance was to maintain and perpetuate their /z/ separate sovereignty . This is the more manifest , when these articles are taken in connection with the alliance of the states with France . /z/ On the same day , when a committee was appointed by congress to prepare and digest the form of a confederation , to be entered into between these colonies , a committee was also appointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , June 12 , 1776 ; 2 Journ. 198 ; the instructions to the commissioners were agreed to in September following ; 2 Journ. 361 . In the same month , plans of these treaties were submitted to and approved by congress , who made out letters of credence and commissions to the commissioners ; 2 Secret Journ . Cong . p. 7 . As the 9th article of confederation , as drawn up , would give to congress the sole nd exclusive power of entering into alliances , on their adoption , it was a sufficient guaranty for its observance by the states ; but as congress could not restrain the legislative power of the states over commerce , as resolved in April , 1776 , and declared in this article , provision was made on the subject in the 6th article : " No state shall lay any imposts or duties , which may interfere with any stipulations in treaties , entered into by the United States in congress assembled , with any king , prince , or state , in pursuance of any treaties already proposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Laws U. S. 15 . Those of commerce and alliance with France were made in 1778 . The commissions , credentials , and treaties , were in the name of " the thirteen United States of North America , to wit : New Hampshire , " &c.; 2 Secret Journ. 7 ; 1 Laws , 74 , 95 ; and the 2d article of the treaty of alliance declares it object most explicitly . " The essential and direct end of the present defensive alliance , is to maintain , effectually , the liberty , sovereignty , and independence , absolute and unlimited of the said United States , as well in matters of government , as of commerce , ' In the 11th article , the parties make a mutual guaranty ; in that of France , " His most Christian majesty guaranties , on his part , to the United States , their liberty , sovereignty , and independence , absolute and unlimited , as well in matters of government as commerce ; also their possessions , and the additions or conquests that their confederation may make during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 98 . This guaranty was fulfilled by the treaty of peace , in which " His Britannic majesty acknowledges the said United States , to wit : New Hampshire , &c.,; to be free , sovereign and independent states . " 1 Laws , 196 . This recognition , relating back to the separate or unanimous declarations by the states , as this Court have held it ; has the same effect , as if the states had then assumed the same position , by the previous authority of the king ; the treaty not being a grant , but a recognition , and subsequent ratification of their pre-existing condi* /z/ tion ; and all acts which had declared and defined it previous to the treaty , related back to 1776 . Such being the relations of the several states , in their federal and foreign concerns , it follows , that as to their internal concerns , they were in the same attitude of absolute and unlimited sovereignty , before the articles of confederation , as they were afterwards , except so far as they abridged it . Each was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each was bound by the guarantee to France , after the confederation was abolished , and the constitution was established , as firmly as before : the states who delayed their ratification remained so bound , for they could by no act of their own , impair the rights of France : and they were equally entitled to the effects of the treaty of peace , whether they became constituent parts of the Union , by ratifying the constitution , or remained foreign states , by not adopting it . Their state constitutions and governments , remained unimpaired by any surrender of their rights ; so that of consequence , their sovereignty was perfect , so long as they continued free from any federal shackles ; so the states acted , and so the people of each declared , in all their conventions , from 1776 to 1780. /z/ Congress has recommended to the colonies to form governments , " on the authority of the people alone : " this was done by the states who adopted constitutions before , and after the declaration of independence ; by the assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they had by nature and inherent right , all the powers of government , and that none could be exercised by any body unless by their authority . They applied to themselves all the principles announced in their unanimous declaration in congress , in terms incapable of being misunderstood . The people of Pennsylvania declared , " that all power being originally in and consequently derived from the people ; ' ' the community hath an indubitable , unalienable , and indefeasible right to reform , alter , or abolish government , in such manner , as shall be by that community judged most conducive to the public weal . " The supreme legislative power shall be vested in a house of representatives , &c.; Con. of Pennsylvania 55 , 6 , 7 . September , 1776 . The people of North Carolina declared , that all the territory within the bounds of the state , was the right and property of the people , to be held by them in full sovereignty . Laws of N.

" The people of this commonwealth , have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves , as a free , sovereign , and independent state , and for ever hereafter shall exercise /z/ and enjoy every power , jurisdiction and right , which is not or may not hereafter be by them expressly delegated to the United States of America in congress assembled . " Book Const. 53 ; Laws Mass. 6 . March , 1780 . Delaware , Maryland , and Georgia , adopted constitutions in 1776 , and 1777 , and the people of Vermont , though not a state , made a declaration of their political rights in July , 1777 , and adopted a constitution .

The governments which were instituted , were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the states were each in the same political situation ; " sovereign , independent communities , ' as they were styled by congress , in their letter recommending the adoption of the confederation . 1 Laws U. S. 12 . In this , their sovereign character , the people of each state could create what corporations they pleased for their own government , either by written or tacit delegation of power , as best pleased them ; their action in either mode had the same effect , whether the body politic to be created was for one , or all the states , it was the exertion of the same sovereign authority , as the people ; within the limits of their own state , empire , or kingdom . Both corporations , state and federal , were formed on the same authority and in the same right ; and as in England , the three states of the kingdom , comprising all the people thereof , acting , whether by organic , or administrative power , in their several and distinct estates , by their representatives respectively ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politic of the kingdom .

So has our new constitution in writing , signed by the separate estates or states of the Union , created its great corporation ; not as our old one did , a supreme consolidated government of the states , but " the federal government of these states , " as the framers thereof called it in their letter to congress ; and as the several states declared in the heading , by ordaining and establishing this constitution for the United States of America , as the several states , each for itself , had done before , with the two exceptions . When the people of all the states , suffering under oppression , acted by their rights of inheritance from their ancestors , followed their example by drawing their swords upon their sovereign in defending them ; declared , as had been done in time immemorial : ' ' Nollumus leges anglias mu-tareP The people of those two states , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , content with what their representatives in congress had declared for them , and in their name , independence in fact ; adhered not only to the laws , but the usages of old , and established their great corporation , by their silent consent , in submitting to the supreme legislative power of the states ; as exercised by their representatives chosen in towns : a governor and the members of the upper house , by the people of the state at large . Thus , their charter and legislative usage , became their constitution , and so continued ; the /z/ tacit practical consent of the people , being taten as equivalent to a formal delegation of power in convention ; and so considered by this Court . 3 Dall. 398 , 400 ; 2 Pet . 656 , 7 . A reference to the other eleven state governments , will show by what people , and of what state , they were constituted by organic power , original , inherent , and sovereign , whether single or connected , in one or thirteen potentates . It will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , any harmony between the state and federal systems , it arises by the power which created both , being the same ; and tjiat the constitutions of government , over and within both , must be so construed , as to avoid any discrepancy between them , in their origin , organization , or action . /z/ When we thus find that each state had thus separately , either in their conventions or practically , declared , asserted , and exercised their power of instituting a government for each , before 1787 ; and a federal government for , and over all , for federal purposes , as then proposed and adopted , in 1788 ; we can look back , and in reviewing their progress from their dependent condition as colonies , to their independence as states , see and understand the power which effected the conversion by the people of each state , who transferred from their local , to their federal legislature , federal powers , by their cession , in the grant . And in its provisions we can also , see , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts and must continue to act pursuant to its ordinances , through all time , as the constituent of the whole agency delegated to the government . Then , taking the relation of the states to each other , as it exists under the constitution , and as declared by this Court , in one uniform and consistent series of adjudication , from 6 Cr. 136 , to 2 Pet . 590 , 1 ; that " The several states are still foreign to each other , for all hut federal purposes- , ' ' their position , as " a single unconnected sovereign power , " before and without any federation between them , is an inevitable consequence . /z/ states ; operating as a treaty of CESSION , BY A FOREIGN /z/ The operation of the constitution then , must , of necessity , be like that of a treaty of cession , by a foreign state to the United States . As the states are still foreign to each other for all but federal purposes , ( they were entirely so before the confederation of 1781 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the new one ; ) the United States could have neither a right of soil or jurisdiction , propriety or dominion , within any particular state " , but by a cession from the state by its legislature , or a convention of the people . The act or deed of cession is the title to power or property , according to its terms , operating by way of grant ; a treaty , compact , /z/ or contract , transferring the subject matter thereof from one party to another ; whether they are states foreign to each other , or states connected by federal relation , the effect is the same . The constitution is a cession of jurisdiction only , made by the people of a state ; the cession of territory included , in terms , soil and jurisdiction ; so did the treaties of Louisiana with France , and Florida with Spain , by the grant of those provinces , in full sovereignty ; each grant performed its proper office , either to transfer legislative power from the sovereign in whom it was vested , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus passed to the United States , it is held subject to the terms and stipulations of the grant ; and federal power is exercised over all the territory within the United States , puisuant to the constitution and the conditions of the cession . Whether it was a part of the original territory of a state of the Union , or of a foreign state ceded by deed or treaty ; the right of the United States in or over it , depends on the contract of cession , which operates to incorporate as well the territory as its inhabitants , into the Union ; placing both under the jurisdiction of its constitution and government So the constitution operated to incorporate such of the old states as ratified it : so it did as new states have been admitted : so it must operate in future . It was a cession , by nine states , of so much of their separate power as was necessary for federal purposes , to the body politic , called the United States , the " American Confederacy , ' " Republic , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designation , including states and territories . The constitution was the charter of this federal corporation , as those of the different states were the charters of their state corporations of government ; each with power to legislate according to the terms of their respective charters , subject only to that charter which had been made supreme for its designated purposes . All charters and grants of power or property , are governed by the same rules of construction ; all questions touching the boundaries of territory , or lines of jurisdiction , must be referred back to the original sovereign in whom both were vested ; and thence deduced by a regular chain of title , to the contending parties . So this Court has done , as to controversies between the United States and foreign states ; 2 Pet . 299 , 314 , passim ; and in controversies arising from the collision of state laws with those of the Union . Adopting the principle , that all governments are corporations , they apply it to those of the territories of the United States , in such a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution , which can admit of a doubt as to the granting power ; they point to and identify that sovereign power , in which was united property and dominion , within its own original territorial limits , as the supreme lord and proprietor thereof . The Court remark : " Yet all admit the constitutionality of a territorial government , which is a corporate body ; " 4 Wh. 422 . This short sentence , connected with that part of the constitution to which the Court refer , will tend more to solve doubts than any reasoning can do . /z/ " The congress shall have power to dispose of , and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; and nothing in this constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular state . " Art . 4 , sect. 3 , cl. 2 . Here the power to dispose of property or regulate territory , by the establishment of a corporation to govern it , is identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either is considered as " belonging to the United States , " depends on the right by which they were made a corporation , capable of holding , disposing of , or regulating , what belonged to them as a government . This was the cession of soil , and the grant of legislative powers to a congress of the United States , who could dispose of , or regulate by law , their territory , or other property , however acquired ; how then was it acquired , is the only question ; as their right over it is unquestionable , when acquired . The opinions of this Court , concurring with the 16th clause of the 8th section of the 1st article of the charter , point to the grantors , who had the dominion , and the propriety , in and over whatever was granted , whether " to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatever , over such district , and such places , for forts , arsenals , " &c.; " as may by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of congress , become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same may 6e ; " or " to dispose of , and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; " the right is acquired in the same manner , " cession , " or grant , " by particular states/ ' or purchase with the assent of the local legislature of one . In relation to this district , this Court say : " On the extent of those terms , according to the common understanding of mankind , there can be no difference of opinion ; " and they held , that congress had the same power of taxation in the district , as they have in the ter ritories ; by the same rules of apportionment and uniformity , as in the states , 5 Wh. 324 . That the power did not depend solely on the grant of exclusive legislation , but was given in the grant of the 1st clause , 8th sect. 1st art . " to lay and collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without limitation of place , " extending " to all places over which the government extends ; " in the words of the grant , " throughout the United States . " This term designates the whole " American empire .

" That original territory means the charter boundaries of the state can not be questioned ; from which it must follow , that jurisdiction and legislative power being concomitant with territorial rights , the United States can not exercise any federal , or exclusive legislation within these boundaries ; unless it has been ceded by the particular state , in its original sovereign capacity , as a constituent of the Union . /z/ Though these opinions of the Court have been delivered in cases arising in the old states , they are equally applicable to the new states which have been admitted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which declares , that they shall be admitted on an equal footing with the original states , in all respects whatever ; 1 Laws , 480 .

The North Western Territory was part of the original territory of Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York , and Virginia ; in 1787 , it belonged to the United States , by separate deeds of cession made by those states : it was thus the property of the confederation , subject to the exceptions , conditions , and reservations in the respective deeds . The particular states , " had ceded their jurisdiction , and thereby annulled their legislative power over it . The articles of confederation were drawn up in November , 1777 , before any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision made for the exercise of any legisla tion by congress over any territory within the boundaries of those states , while they retained both soil and jurisdiction . But after the cession , from the necessity of the case , congress assumed and exercised the power to pass " an ordinance for the government of the territory of the United States , north-west of the Ohio ; " the j5rst clause of which shows in what capacity they did so , on the 13/A t/i/Zy . " Be it ordained by the United States , in congress assem- bled , " &c.; As an act of the states , by their several ambassadors , it was binding on them in their legislative capacity , if done by their authority , or subsequently ratified ; the act of cession was in effect to authorize it ; the acquiescence of the states was in law a ratification by the states , which the people thereof confirmed by the constitution , as proposed on the 17M September , 1787 .

Cong . 82 , 84 , &c.; The whole subject was thus before congress , and the convention , at the same time ; nine of the members of the convention were members of congress , when the report of the convention containing the proposed constitution , resolutions , and letters , was submitted to , and unanimously accepted by congress . Vide 12 Journ. 99 , 100 . Rhode Island was not present in either body ; but th members of both bodies , on the behalf of the twelve states who were present , acted in perfect concert and unity of opinion , on the appropriate subjects confided to them .

In this union of political and judicial authority , we must know what was " a state an ' original state , " a ' ' new statCy " the United States , " " the congress of the United States , " and " states so admitted into this Union , We also know , what was the territory belonging to the United States in 1787 , by cession from the states , by deeds of cession executed by their agents or delegates in congress , specially authorized ; of New York , in 1781 , 1 Laws , 469 , 72 ; of Virginia , in 1784 , lb. 472 , 5 ; of Massachusetts , in 1785 , lb. 482 , 4 ; of Connecticut , in 1786 , lb. 485 , 6 ; of South Carolina , in 1787 , lb. 486 . We further know , from the cession of Louisiana and Florida , by treaties with foreign states , how the soil and jurisdiction of the new territories passed definitively to these states ; and that pursuant to the stipulations thereof , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Union , on an equal footing with the original states down to the present time . Nay , at this session , ( 1837 ) " the congress " has admitted the state of Michigan , formed out of the territory north-west of the Ohio , ceded by the states /z/ of the Union ; and another , the state of Arkansas , formed out of that ceded by a foreign state , of territory not in the United States , into this Union , on the principles of the ordinance . The territorial government of those states , had been founded on the ordinance , and it is now the basis of the governments existing in the territories of Ouisconsin and the Floridas , under the authority of Congress ; according to the terms and conditions thereof . Congress is therefore bound , and the faith of the present states pledged , by the 6th article of the constitution , to fulfil all its stipulations ; whenever these territories shall be entitled to be admitted into the Union as states . Now then , it may be most confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the solemn acts of the colonies , the states in congress , the people thereof in conventions , directly asserted in the ordinance , and confirmed by the constitution in language , plain , clear , and visible to every eye , and impressing on every mind this fact  --  /z/ That all the new states which have been admitted , pursuant to the 1st clause of the 3d section , 1st article of the constitution , " formed of parts of a state with the consent of the legislature of the state con- . cerned , as well as of the congress , " or pursuant to the ordinance and 6th article ; have adopted it by the act and power of the convention of such new state , wholly independent of the action of any of the old states or people thereof . There are now thirteen new states which have been admitted into the Union , confessedly on an equal footing with the thirteen old states , in all respects ; it is therefore a political impossibility , that the people of the United States in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinance , and the 6th article validating it , remain in force . The people of a territory may , at their pleasure , continue under a territorial government , after they are entitled to become a state ; it is a privilege which they may exercise or waive ; and there is no power in the existing states , the people , or the constitution , to compel them to adopt any other government , than that prescribed by the ordinance . It is idle then to contend , that a new state comes into the Union by any other act or power , than of the people within its limits by their own volition ; so that the only question which remains is , whether the original states became constituent parts of the United States , by ratifying the constitution in the same manner as the new . If they did , it was by the act of the people of each state ; if they did not , then the constitution was made a supreme law within their territory , by an " external power ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an equal station or footing with the new , but were subordinate to a paramount power ; while the new states have voluntarily adopted it , in the plenitude of absolute sovereignty . /z/ This conclusion is inevitable from the premises assumed , and the interpretation given to the declaration of independence , in late commentaries and expositions of the events of the revolution , in their bearing on the condition of the states in 1776 , and thence till 1787 . It is not pretended , that any legislative power was ever granted to congress , unless by the articles of 1781 , the ordinance of 1787 , and the constitution ; the separate states , therefore , never had any such powers , or if they were vested in them by original right , congress could not exercise any legitimate authority within the states , unless by their cession. /z/ By connecting the foregoing view , which principally relates to the right of dominion , jurisdiction , or legislative power of the several states , within their territorial boundaries , with their rights of soil to the lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results ill become manifest . The original right of the crown to grant the right of soil , and the powers of government , in and over the proprietary provinces , and the right of soil in the vacant lands , in the royal and chartered colonies , was never drawn in question after the revolution , by any of the states on behalf of the confederacy ; for whenever the crown had made a grant , it w universally admitted that it was valid . When the proprietary governments were superseded by those of the states , the proprietaries were left in the quiet enjoyment of their rights of property , as in New Jersey to this day ; or the states were suflfered to resume their vacant lands , and to hold them without any claim by the other states , for any share , as in Pennsylvania . Vide 1 Dall . L. Pa. 822 ; and in Delaware , 2 Laws , D. 1074 , 5 . But the states which had no vacant lands , denied the exclusive right of those states whose right of boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty of peace of 1763 , to the Mississippi ; and set up a claim to a proportion of the unappropriated lands within the limits of those states , as a common acquisition by the confederation , for the common benefit , in right of conquest , and from Great Britain . But admitted the legislative power of the states over them , making no claim to jurisdiction . Those states , however , claimed the lands , on the grounds before stated , as their own , by the devolution of the crown to them , the guarantee by the proposed articles of confederacy , and of the treaty with France . To put an end to all future controversy , it was , by the 9th article of the ormer , provided , " that no state should be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States . ' Connecting this proviso with the 3d article , and the 2d and 11th articles of the treaty of alliance with France ; it is clear , that when the confederation became the act of all the states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any valid act to affect the territorial rights of the states , without a direct violation of the express stipulations of both guaran- /z/ tees , and this proviso . This was the principal reason why the final adoption of these articles was delayed from November , 1777 , till March , 1781 . Various attempts were made in congress , to strike out , or so modify this proviso , that the vacant lands should be deemed to be the property of all the states , as a common fund for defraying the expenses of the war ; which having all failed , some ' of the states refused to adopt them . In March , 1780 , congress , finding that the controversy could be no otherwise terminated , recommended to the states to make liberal cessions of their western lands to the United States ; to which Virginia and New York agreeing , the articles were signed , and cessions accordingly made , by those and other states , which were deemed satisfactory . Vide 1 Laws U. S. 11 , 12 , 20 , 22 , 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From this time , that dangerous controversy which had threatened to dissolve the confederacy of the revolution , ceased by this compromise ; vide 6 Cr. 142 : it was no longer a political question after the cessions of the states had been accepted , and congress made no claims to soil or jurisdiction that were not in conformity to the deeds from the respective states . But the United States had not relinquished their claims , within the boundaries of those states which had made no cessions ; though they made no grants of land within the boundaries of such states , yet , from the necessity of the case , they established a territorial government within the state of Georgia , over the territory between the Chatahoochie* and Mississippi . It was done , however , with the assent of Georgia , who was willing to surrender the jurisdiction , retaining the right of soil . By the first section of the act , there was a provision for the appointment of commissioners to adjust the claims to territory with Georgia , and to receive proposals for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ordinary jurisdiction thereof ; * ' by the second section , the lands " thus ascertained as the property of the United States , shall be disposed of &c.; To avoid all controversy by so doing , it was declared by the fifth section , that the establishment of this government shall , in no respect , impair the right of Georgia to the jurisdiction or soil of the territory : but the same were declared to be " as firm and available as if this act had never been made ; " 1 Story , L. U. S. 494 , 5 ; act of 1798 . This , it will be seen , was in precise conformity to the 2d clause , 3d sect 4th art . of the constitution . In 1802 , an adjustment was made between Georgia and the United States , of all matters between them ; by cession , and an acceptance on the terms and conditions therein specified ; 1 Laws U. S. 488 , &c.; which seems to preclude any future controversy about the right of soil or jurisdiction : but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cases of the Cherokees living east of the Chatahoochie . Georgia having made no cession , and claiming , as has been seen , to the Mississippi , had , by the act of 1795 , made sale of a large , tract on the Yazoo river ; on the validity of which sale the old question arose , whether those lands belonged to the United States , or to Georgia , at the time of the grant in 1795 ? /z/ This was one main point directly made in Fletcher v. Peck , on wJiich this Court decided that the title to the land was in Georgia ; that she had a right to grant it ; and that the grant was valid , to pass a title in fee simple to the purchasers ; 6 Cr. 142 . The United States acquiesced in that decision , by making a compromise iVith the purchasers , and paying them a certain sum . In Harcourt v. Gaillard , the same question came up , and was decided in favour of Georgia , as has been shown before ; vide 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration of the accordance of the opinions of this Court , with the great acts of the revolution . Their judgment is founded on the declaration of independence , the treaties of the states with foreign powers , and the treaty of peace . The guarantee of the states with each other , by the third article of confederation , and by France to each , was of their posses sionSy as well as in matters of government ; the guarantee to the confederacy was only of such conquests or acquisitions , as should be made from Great Britain , without the boundaries of the particular states ; " the whole , as ihvr possession shall h fixed and assured to the said states , at the moment of the cessation of their present war with England ; ' * 1 Laws , 98 , 9 . Now , as no conquests were made by the confederacy , and the possessions of the several states were fixed by the treaty of peace , according to their original boundaries , the confederacy could acquire no territory as possessions , or jurisdiction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four solemn decisions , that they did not ; 4 Cr. 212 ; 6 Cr. 142 ; 12*Wh. 524 ; lb. 534 . Taking , it therefore , as a political , or judicial question , it has long since been put at rest ; not only by the authority of the constitution , and all the departments of the government ; but in public opinion . It may then be assumed as an unquestioned proposition , that the United States can have no right of soil within any of the states of this Union , unless by a cession from the particular states , or a foreign state , who was the original , absolute , proprietary thereof ; from this proposition another equally unquestionable one necessarily results . /z/ It is not deemed necessary to enter into any course of reasoning , or any reference to authority , to prove that the state which is the absolute owner of the territory within its boundaries , has the absolute power of government over it ; or that if the legislative jurisdiction was by original right in a paramount power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . If these propositions are true , a third is self-evident ; that if the right of soil or jurisdiction , is legitimately exercised by any other than such paramount power , it must be by its grant or authority , otherwise it must be void as an usurpation . Grants of land or power , must then derive their validity from the same sovereign , who alone can separate the one right from the other ; /z/ and his grant must testify what he has granted , and to whom : the separation is not to be made by theory , assertion , or construction . If the existing condition of the country is such , that the right of soil is in a single state in full propriety , and the dominion over it is absolute or qualifiedly in the United States ; the original sovereign was the people of the state , or the people of all the states , as one " single sovereign power . " I have traced the right to property and power to the people of each state , and deduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their deeds of cession , and constitution of government ; let those who assert that the right was not in each state , show how the rights of the crown devolved on the one people , and how they have made their grant of territory , or the powers of government over the several states . On the first organization of the federal government in 1789 , there were only eleven states within the Union ; yet the constitution was then ordained and established by " We , the people of the United States . " If they were the whole people in the aggregate , in their unity of power , the congress of that day evinced their most profound ignorance of the origin and nature of the government they were administering . As North Carolina and Rhode Island had not ratified the constitution , the revenue laws put those states on the same footing as foreign states , kingdoms , or countries ; 1 Story , L. U. S. 30 , 50 . No provision was ' made for the operation of the judiciary act of 1789 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three branches of the legislative power were not demented , these two states were no more constituent parts of the American empire at that time , than Canada and Nova Scotia , The whole Congress were demented , if the same paramount power , which made the constitution the supreme law of the land in the eleven states , had not the same power over those two states , to force them into the Union , and make them subject to its laws ; without any act of a convention of the people thereof . Should this be deemed by theorists a proposition too bold to advance , they must give some good reasons to show why the constitution and laws have now any more force in those states , than in 1789 ; unless it has been by the ratification of the people , in a capacity wholly separate and distinct from the people of the other states , who having previously done the same act , were functi officio ; and could not act jointly with them . For myself , I am utterly unable to imagine any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how North Carolina and Rhode Island , are now constituent parts of the United States : that they became so by the consent of each , as the other states did , is to me an intelligible proposition ; but how it has been , or could otherwise be done , is incomprehensible to a mind not accustomed to search for mysteries in plain words . /z/ I have only to add one other consideration , to illustrate the meaning of the preamble . All agree that the constitution was to be established by the people of the United States , whenever the conventions of nine states should ratify it ; all must agree , that when it was proposed for adoption in 1787 , it could not be foreseen vyhich of the states would so ratify it ; the states therefore could not be named till their separate ratifications were given . It provided for the admission of new states , but no one could divine their names or locality ; states could be " formed by the junction of two or more states , " but none could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terity , through all time ; and for " the laud , " the whole territory , and all the states , old and new ; as one law , speaking in the same words , and with the same intention , at the time it was proposed , and at each period when any state ratified it , and thus became one of " the United States of America , " by the act of the people of the states respectively . When the terms " we , the people , " " of the United States , " are thus applied , they seem to me not only appropriate to the instrument , but the only terms that would be so ; it uses terms in all its parts , yet we find no definitions or explanations ; it was not intended for a code ; and the term " people , " was a mere designation of the power by which the constitution was made , as " the states " were designated by their separate ratification . Hence it referred , in 1789 , to eleven only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to the thirteen new states : and when others shall be admitted into the Union , it will refer to them as it did to the old , and now does to the new . " The people " " of the several states , which may be included within this Union , " as the constituent power of the federal govern-ment /z/ .1 can adopt no course of reasoning , or use any language that so well supports these positions , as that of the late Chief Justice of this Court . " It is in the 8th section of the 1st article we are to look for cessions of territory , and of exclusive jurisdiction . Congress has power to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over this district , and over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shalj be , for the erection of , &c.; It is observable , that the power of exclusive legislation , ( which is jurisdiction , ) is united with cession of territory ; which is to be the free act of the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections together , without feeling a conviction , not to be strengthened by any commentary on them , that in describing the judicial power , the framers of our con-/z/ stitution had not in view any cession of territory , or , which is esscntially the savie , of general jurisdiction . " " It is not questioned , that whatever may be necessary to the full and unlimited exercise of admiralty , and maritime jurisdiction , is in the government of the Union . Congress may pass all laws which are necessary and proper , for giving the most complete effect to this power . Still , the general jurisdiction over the place , subject to this grant of power , adheres to the territory , as a portion of sovereignty not yet given away . The residuary powers of legislation are still in Massachusetts . Suppose , for example , the power of regulating trade , had not been given to the general government ; would this extension of the judicial power to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction , have divested Massachusetts of the power to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89 . Alluding to the powers of congress , wherever , and however exercised , the Court use this language : " This power , like all others which are specified , is conferred on congress as the legislature of the Union ; for , strip them of that character , and they would not possess it ; in no other character can it be exercised ; " 6 Wh. 424 . " Since congress legislates in the same forms , and in the same character , in virtue of powers of equal obligation , conferred in the same instrument , when exercising its exclusive powers of legislation , as well as when exercising those which are limited , ' &c.; lb. 426 . The Court put their finger on that power which enabled congress to legislate in the states , or elsewhere . " The American states , and the American people , had been taught by the same experience , that this government would be a mere shadow , that must disappoint all their hopes , unless invested with large portions of that sovereignty which belongs to independent states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed by experience , the American people in the conventions of their respective states , adopted the present constitution ; " 6 Wh. 380 , 1 .

The restraint is imposed by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution not been adopted , the Court points to that power which alone can restrain " a single sovereign unconnected power ; " 6 Cr. 136 ; a state , a nation , over whom no external power /z/ can operate ; 7 Cr. 136 ; an independent sovereign state ; 2 Pet 468 ; which can restrict itself , and open its territorial boundaries to another jurisdiction . In these , and the opinions of the Court already referred to , I find in my judgment the most ample support of the preceding views . That the rights of soil , and general jurisdiction over the whole territory , within the boundaries of the several states , was invested in the people of each , as absolute sovereigns of both ; that neither right can be exercised , but by a grant from them , and that what is not given away by cession , still remains with them . Residuary sovereignty is also defined to be what each state has reserved to itself , or excepted from the grant ; and not as commentators define it , what " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave , to " the people of the states respectively . ' If , in the course pursued , I have used plain terms in relation to those theories which appear to be in direct contradiction to the whole political history of the country , to all the declarations of the rights of the states and people , by tjiemselves , by conventions , legislatures , congress , as well as all the great principles of government , thus announced and sanctioned by this Court ; if in testing the constitution by these fundamental principles , and the old established maxims of the common law , I have arrived at conclusions which do not suit the spirit of the times , and the habits of the day , in constitutional discussions ; it has been in submission to the constituted authorities of the country , political and judicial , whose union of opinion , and their striking coincidence with the words , provisions , and history of the constitution , leave no doubt on my mind as to its meaning and intention . In expressing my views , in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from any reliance on my own opinion , or train of reasoning ; but having found fundamental principles , too clearly established to be shaken by any authority , subordinate to that of this Court , I feel with them ; that " this concurrence of statesmen , legislators , and of judges , in the same construction of the constitution , may justly inspire some confidence in that construction ; " 6 Wh. 421 , In one respect , my conclusions difier from those of the late Chief Justice . To my mind he has given no construction to the constitution ; he has only declared what it says , by carrying out the definition of the general terms it uses , and making , a practical application thereof , to the various cases , in which he has delivered the opinion of the Court . On inspecting the constitution judicially , no one can fail to be impressed with the truth and force of his remarks . " A constitution , to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of which its great powers will admit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried into execution , would partake of the prolixity of a legal code , and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind . It would probably never be understood by the public . Its nature , therefore , requires that only its great outlines should be marked , its important objects designated , and the minor ingredients /z/ which compose those objects , be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves . That this idea was entertained by the framers of the American constitution , is not only to be inferred from the nature of the instrument , but the language . Why else were some of the limitations found in the 9th section of the 1st article , introduced ? It is also , in some degree warranted by their having omitted to use any restrictive term , which might prevent its receiving a fair and just interpretation . In considering this question then , we must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding ; " 4 Wh. 407 . S. P. 1 Wh .. 326 . This great and good judge , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the text more faithfully , or ever made a commentary more accordant with its strict intention and language ; he never brought into action the powers of his mighty mind , to find some meaning in plain words , of known import , and in common use , that would be above the comprehension of ordinary minds . He knew the framers of the constitution , who were his compatriots ; he was the historian of his country ; so that , as the expositor of its supreme law , he knew its objects , its intentions ; could and did apply to it the rules of interpretation , as the principles of law , then understood , according to the political condition of the people , the states , and the state of the times . Though it is now the fashion of the day , to practically consider his opinions , as less worthy of attention in and out of Court , than is paid to others ; the time is not distant , in my opinion , when public opinion will unite , in considering the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Chief Magistrate , the best evidence of the law of the land . What lord Coke said of the civil law , in his time , may , with great truth , be applied to the constitution , in the present , and the glosses upon it " Upon the text of the civil law , there be so many glosses and ijiterpretations , and again , upon these , so many commentaries , and all these written by doctors of equal degree and authority , and therein BO many diversities of opinion , as they do rather increase , than resolve doubts and uncertainties ; and the professors of that noble science say , That it is like a sea full of waves . The difference , then , between those glosses , and commentaries , and this which we publish , is , that their glosses and commentaries , are written by doctors which he advocates , and so , in a manner , private interpretations . And our expositions , or commentaries upon magna charta , and other statutes , are the resolutions of judges , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related and reported in our books , or extant in judicial records , or in both ; and therefore , being collected together , shall , ( as we conceive , ) produce certainty , the mother and nurse of repose and quietness , and are not like to the waves of the sea , but satio benejida peritis , for judicia sunt tanquam jurisdicta ? 2 Co . Inst proeme /mis . What this judge would have said , had he lived in our time and country , and seen the glosses and commentaries which have been /z/ written within the present century here , and in England , upon the constitution and the common law , is not difficult to imagine . His motto was qui pattens qui prudens ; his patitnce and prudence would have been put to a severe trial , if he was compelled to undergo the infliction of listening to these glosses , which , like the waves of the sea , beat upon us in a constant flood , increasing in size with every foreign importation , or home production of books . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the mother and nurse of quietness and repose must be well ascertained : that it will be produced by looking into , and adhering to the decision of this Court on constitutional questions , I am well assured ; and have therefore referred to them as safe commentaries upon its text . There is another consideration of conclusive weight on my mind . By taking the constitution as the grant of the people of each state ; as the depositories of the absolute and unlimited powers of government , in their original sovereignty ; their grant conveys the same power which was in the grantor before its execution : of consequence , the powers of the federal government will have a supremacy proportioned to the supremacy of the grantor . It will bind the states by the sovereign power which they all acknowledge ; it will be their own voluntary act , their full and free cession of jurisdiction ; so that the more absolute the sovereignty is , which grants the power , the greater will be the strength of the grant , and the security from violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of the government to the people in the aggregate , the doctrine of consolidation is necessarily introduced as its foundation ; this is so repugnant to the constitution itself , and the universal opinion of the conventions which framed and the people who adopted it , that it will never be acquiesced in . The principle itself is so utterly repugnant to all American ideas of government , that it will be resisted and opposed even in theory ; when it is once made the foundation for the action of the government , and referred to as the source of its powers , and we must expect to witness the reality , of what has once threatened its existence . If the states of the Union were sovereign and independent states , before the adoption of the constitution , and the grant of legislative powers by it was not made by the several states who ratified it ; then they retain all their preexisting powers , and congress act by an usurped authority . On the theory then of the unity of political power in one people , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; under the pressure of which the government must fall . On the other hand , if the government is admitted to be the work of the separate people of each state , there can be no pretext for nullification : the sovereign power of the state has made the grant ; has declared it the law of the land , supreme in obligation over its own laws and constitution ; has commended its judges to obey it ; has appointed a tribunal to expound it ; and bound itself to abide by changes to be made by alterations or amendments . The people and the states will , like individuals , submit to the privation of those rights which /z/ they have granted to another ; but when any claim of property or power , is made under an adversary or paramount right , they will call for the exhibition of the muniments of original title , and its regular deduction to whoever claims its exercise ; if not produced , they may and will resist . No danger can assail the constitution , which will be so difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , renouncing and disclaiming a title perfect in itself , and endeavouring to place it upon a grant by a power which exists only in theory ; and from whom no title can be deduced by any visible or tangible act . /z/ I can not close this view of the constitution , without again referring to that clause of the instrument , which , connected with its exposition bylhis Court , I have said is the key to its meaning ; it is also the rule prescribed by its framers , whereby to ascertain the extent of the grant of territory or jurisdiction , the rights of soil , the powers of government , as well as the restrictions on the states . " The congress shall have power to dispose of , and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States ; " and nothing in this constitution shall he so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States or of any particular state . It has always seemed to me , that the latter part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important sentence in the whole instrument ; though it has received but little , if any attention . Its words are most comprehensive , extending to the whole constitution , as well as to every subject to which the United States , or any particular state , had any claim ; they must not be deemed senseless , but have some meaning and application , which will correspond with the preceding part of the clause ; the intention with which they were introduced , and the subject matter of reference . By this clause , a power was given to dispose of , and regulate the territory or other property belonging to the United States , acquired , as has been seen , by cession from the particular states of the Union , or foreign states ; and that regulation was but another word for legislation , and the power of creating territorial governments , or corporations . It has been also shown , that this Court have uniformly held , that the right to property and jurisdiction , or legislative power , are concomitant , and vested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory ; and that all the powers of congress , whether exclusive over their own property or territory , or limited over the several states ; is of the same nature and character , conferred by the same instrument , as one uniform law throughout the United States . To regulate , implies power over the thing to be regulated , 9 Wh. 209 ; to prescribe rules , to make laws ; it is exclusive over the ceded territories , because the cession of soil carries with it jurisdiction ; unless otherwise expressed . It is exclusive within this district , because the states in their cession made it so ; it is exclusive , concurrent , or /z/ federal only , over forts , arsenals , &c.,; according to the termd of the cession by a state , or its consent to the purchase ; it is federal over the states , its territory , or the property of its citizens , limited by the constitution to enumerated objects : but in whatever mode , or to whatever extent it is , or can be exercised , the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the constitution . This clause , therefore , of necessity refers to whatever power or property has been in any way granted to the United States by the constitution , or which had been previously , or should thereafter be ceded to them , so that it belonged to them ; and the proviso , limitation and prohibition , must have a reference as broad as its subject matter and express terms . It is a declaration , that the claims of the grantee to what is granted , shall not be prejudiced by any construction of any thing contained in the constitution ; so that in the language of this Court , the powers of the government shall not be construed and refined down to insignificance . It is also a declaration , that the claims of a grantor to what was ungranted and not prohibited , should remain unprejudiced by any broad construction of the grant , which would take away the reserved powers of the states or the people ; the intention of which is apparent , by recurring to the second article of the confederation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jurisdiction , not expressly delegated to the United States ; ' ' and to the ninth , which protected their territory . Such a clause would have defeated the great objects of the constitution , unless all powers intended to be granted had been enumerated in detail ; " the minor ingredients , " as well as " the great outlines ; " which would have made it a prolix code , unintelligible to those for whose regulation it was intended ; Vide 4 Wh. 407 . On the other hand , it would have been almost a hopeless eflfort , to have effected its adoption without some clause of limitation , by which a rule of interpretation should be laid down as fundamental . We know , as an historical fact , that it was not adopted by all the states , till after the amendments were made , among which the tenth was deemed the most important No men could better know , or more deeply feel the dangerous effects to the Union , of contests between particular states and the confederacy ; the danger of conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averted by cessions , by the states , made in the spirit of compromise . Six years of experience under the confederation , had taught them the necessity of cessions of legislative power , in the same spirit . During the revolution , the contest was for property , which was settled by the adoption of the articles of confederation , which prohibited the United States from depriving a state of territory for their benefit . It did not require the spirit of prophecy to foresee , that under the constitution , there would be a similar contest for power ; and it would have been strange if some endeavour had not been made to avoid it It was a most delicate effort to so frame a constitution , as to define the precise line by which the granted and reserved powers of government should be so separated , as to avoid any colli- /z/ sion ; the necessity of the case requires it to be on some point , between a delegation to congress by express words , and such general terms , as by construction might be held to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better term could not have been used , than the one adopted , to avoid both difficulties . " Shall be adjudged , is a parliamentary term of great significancy : a word of command that such a construction shall be given , as in the 12 Cor. 2 , prohibiting the king from granting land by any other than the tenure of soccage . . His grants must be so taken as to convey such tenure , whatever may be their words ; Vide ante , and 3 Ruff , 192 : " Shall not be construed is a term in the 11th amendment , the meaning and effect whereof has been settled by this Court , as before stated ; and must receive the same interpretation when it is found in the body of the instrument . When , therefore , we find a declaration , " nothing contained in this constitution shall he so construed ' * &c.,; it can have no meaning , unless it be to prohibit any interpretation of the grant , by which it shall operate to the prejudice of the grantor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the 10th amendment , such intention is apparent ; by reserving what is not granted or prohibited , that which is granted or prohibited , is not reserved ; whereby the grant must be interpreted according to the import of its language , without straining it beyond , or within its obvious meaning . This Court has carried out the rule prescribed by the constitution , according to its spirit and intention . " The powers actually granted must be such as . are expressly given , or given by necessary implication . " The instrument is to have a reasonable construction , according to the import of its terms . " " Where a power is given in general terms , it is not to be restrained to particular cases , unless that construction grow out of the context expressly , or by necessary implication ; " 1 Wh. 326 . Words which import a power should not be restricted by a forced construction ; 6 Wh. 423 . A similar rule is applied to cessions of property . A term used in connection with , and explained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a clear intention , will be considered as a part of , and explanatory of it , to carry the intention into effect . " But if no such coaclusion can be drawn , the term must receive its legal and appropriate interpretation ; " 10 Pet . 53 . " There must be something to take the term out of the strict , legal , and technical interpretation ; it must appear , in the instrument , to warrant any other construction ; " lb . These rules are those of the common law . An implication which necessarily results from the words used , is of the same effect as express words ; because they equally serve to show the intention of the grantor . Words are but the evidence of intention ; their import is their meaning , to be gathered from the context , and their connection with the subject matter . " It is proper to take a view of the liberal meaning of the words to be expounded , of their connection with other words , and the general object to be accomplished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 12 Wh. 437. /z/ In thus ascertaining the meaning of an instrument of writing , by the express words thereof , or their necessary implication , it is not mere construction ; it is following the intention apparent on its face , if not in words ; it is their plain meaning , taking the whole together . It wholly differs from that mode of construction which is resorted to in order to infer or imply the grant of one thing by the grant of another ; to raise an implication on the words of a grant , by matter extraneous , to which no reference is made in any part of it ; to seek , aliunde for an intention , which the words do not import That implication or construction which the law permits , is what the judicial eye can perceive , by inspection , to be the intention of the writing and the parties ; not that which can be gathered only from matter not contained in it , by assumption , supposition , ingenious reasoning , or conjecture , of motives , objects , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter is rejected , as mere parol evidence ; which the law repudiates whenever it is offered to contradict , explain , or control a writing . By keeping in view this distinction between the necessary implication apparent in the writing , or , as Blackstone expresses it , " the evident consequence , " 1 Bl . Com . 250 , or conclusion which results from its inspection , and . that which is made by construction alone , founded on extraneous matters , the meahing of the constitution and this Court is the same . One power , restriction , prohibition , or reservation , is not to be implied from another ; it is incompatible with a grant by enumeration of the things granted , and which " deals in general language . " If it is once a settled rule of construction , that any power can be infused into it , which on its face does not appear to be granted ; or any power restricted by mere construction , which is granted , the system becomes utterly deranged . Nothing can more clearly indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constructive powers , or constructive restraints , than the 17th clause of the 8th section of the 1st article . Not willing to leave to the congress , the exercise of any powers not enumerated , however indispensable to their efficient action , or to paralyse the legislative power , by withholding the power oif executing its laws , a distinct and express grant was made , " to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into effect the foregoing powers , " &c.; Not to extend the jurisdiction of congress , to any subject matter of legislation not enumerated in the grant , but to enable it to execute the laws it was authorized to pass . The great and incurable defect of the confederation was , the dependence of congress on state laws to execute and to carry into effect their resolutions and requisitions : generally speaking , the jurisdiction of the old and new congress was the same , except as to the regulation of ' commerce and a judicial system . The states would not delegate the power of execution to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the states granted this power , by the constitution , by which alone the federal government became efficient and com-/z/ petent to the objects of its creation . It has been said , that congress would have had this power without an express grant , according to the rule of law , that the grant of a thing is a grant of the means necessary for its enjoyment . But however true this may be , as a mere legal proposition , it never was a principle of American government , but a contrary rule applied to the powers delegated by the confederation ; it required the invocation of the sovereign power of the people of each state to change it , by making an express grant of a power , which no state would have permitted to be exercised within its limits but by its own consent . I am well aware that this clause has been viewed otherwise by this Court ; they have held it to be a grant , by its terms , of the means or the powers necessary and proper to carry the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct power , authorizing the use of instruments or subordinate agents , to effect the objects and purposes of the constitution . Herein they have , in my opinion , departed from their accustomed course : they have applied to this clause a construction which it does not admit , consistently with its terms , and their own settled rules of interpretation . That the power is express , and its objects definitely declared , is plain , " to carry into effect , ' to pass " such laws as may be necessary and proper , ' for the executing and enforcing the powers granted by the constitution to the federal government , its departments and officers ; and not by that of the states , as under the confederation . That it is the all-important and vital power of the federal government , which must exist in full vigour , and be exercised with firmness , in order to perpetuate its existence , is admitted by all . In my opinion , this power is weakened , by making it by construction , an implied , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those of execution ; and if it is so extended , there can be no limits assigned to its exercise , than the discretion and judgment of congress , as to the degree of necessity , or propriety , in the given case . No power is so dangerous as that which makes necessity its source ; for necessity will always be assumed , when a pretext is wanted . When the constitution gives a discretionary power , depending on the necessity of the case or its urgency , it does so in terms ; as suspending the writ of habeas corpus ; and a state laying duties on imports or exports , or engaging in war : but , this discretion differs , essentially , from that which is confided by the clause under consideration . , It is confined to the necessity of making a law , appropriate for the execution of specific powers , over the enumerated subject matters of legislation : whenever a new subject of jurisdiction is introduced , congress act by no legitimate authority . This Court has declared , that confidence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , 6 Wh. 388 , &c.; confidence in congress is equally unknown to its provisions , unless in those parts which expressly declare it , in certain cases which are exceptions , applied alike to the federal and state legislatures . There is another powerful objection to considering this clause in /z/ any other aspect than an express grant of legislative powers of execution . In referring it to the means of execution , by the assumption of jurisdiction over nonenumerated subjects , there necessarily arises a collision of opinions about the degree of necessity for using such means , which no reasoning can settle ; it is but opinion , the correctness of which can be tested by no fixed or determinate standard ' of authority . Those who think a power necessary , will exercise it ; those who think otherwise , will oppose it : hence we find that from the time of the adoption of the constitution , this clause has been , and yet continues to be , the debateable ground of contending parties , and remains as unsettled in public opinion , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction as will enlarge , the other construes it so as to contract , the powers of the government to the utmost possible extent to which plain language can be perverted , by refined , ingenious , and powerful minds , reasoning under the influence of political opinion , each overlooking the declared import , and necessary implication of the words . It can not be doubted that these contests for power were foreseen by the framers of the constitution , and I have always been satisfied , that they intended to guard against both constructions ; so as alike to prevent the powers of congress from being frittered down to inefficiency for the objects of the grant , or the reserved powers of the several states from being usurped  --  hy construction . No clause could be more appropriate to the purpose , and none could more clearly express the intention , than that " nothing in this constitution shall be so construed . " I do not feel at liberty to expunge one word from it , or to give it a more narrow application than it imports ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of grant or restriction , and prescribes for the interpretation of all its provisions , the only rule by which its true meaning can be ascertained , and the movements of the state and federal systems be preserved in harmony as one great whole . It ought , in my judgment , to receive the most liberal and benign interpretation which the words admit of ; and if so taken , will efiectuate the most salutary result  --  " certainty , the mother and nurse of the repose and quietness ' ' of the Union . These are my general views of the constitution , extracted from those sources of political and judicial authority which have been followed as safe guides ; for their prolixity or tediousness , I have no apology to ofier . to the profession , other than my sense of the necessity of resorting at large to some better mode of expounding the constitution than has been hitherto pursued . It was necessary to explain my own peculiar opinion , on the cases depending and decided at the last term , as well as in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other judges ; for which position , it was proper that my reasons should be understood by those who should desire to know them . Having now done this , I have only to show , that in combatting propositions and theories which I considered as unsound as dangerous , as repugnant to the provisions of the constitution , as the judicial exposition of its great principles , and the defi- /z/ nition of its terms , I have not made them from fancy ; and in such form as to enable me to put them down . In the following extracts will be found the antagonist propositions to those which I have endeavoured to establish . The exalted character and stations of the eminent persons who have given their expositions of the constitution , entitle them to the most grave consideration and profound respect ; and forbid the imputation of an intention to refer to nameSy and not to things . The following extracts from an able and learned commentary on the constitution , published in 1833 , thus defines a state constitution : " It is a fundamental law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the states , ( who are entitled to prescribe it , ) for the government and regulation of the whole people . It binds them as a supreme compact , ordained by the sovereign power ; and not merely as a voluntary contract , " &c.; 1 Story Com . 317 , 18 ; sec. 349 . He thus defines the constitution of the United States . " It is not a compact ; on the contrary , the preamble emphatically speaks of it as a solemn ordinance and establishment of government The language is , * We , the people of the United States , do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America . ' The people do ordain and establish , ( not contract , ) and stipulate with each other . The people of the United States , not the distinct people of a particular state , with the people of the other states . The people ordain and establish a constitution , not a confederation ; lb. 319 ; sec. 352 . " It was , nevertheless , in the solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assented to as a constitution ; ' ' lb. 323 ; sec. 356 . " But tliat it is , as the people have named and called it truly , a constitution ; and they properly said , We , the people , &c.; do ordain , &c.; and not we the people of each state ; " lb. 327 ; sec. 360 . " The doctrine then that the states are parties , is a gratuitous assumption . In the language of a most distinguished statesman , the constitution itself , in its very front , refutes that . It declares that it is ordained and established by the people of the United States . So far from saying that it is established by the governments of the several states , it does not even say that it is established by the people of the several states ; but it pronounces , that it is established by the people of the United States , in the aggregate . Doubtless the people of the several states , taken collectively , constitute the people of the United States . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all the people of the United States , that they establish the constitution ; " lb. 332 , 333 ; sec. 363 . These propositions are laid down in terms so explicit , as to be susceptible of no misunderstanding as to their meaning ; it is , therefore , unnecessary to pursue the remarks of the author any further , in order to develope his ideas as to the origin of the present governments . The learned commentator thus notices and defines the origin and nature of the two governments which preceded the present , as the correct conclusions drawn from the political history of the country , /z/ from the assembling of the first congress of the revolution , till the adoption of the articles of confederation , and thence till the adop-. tion of the constitution . *The congress of delegates ( calling themselves in their more formal acts , the delegates appointed by the good people of these colonies ) , assembled on the 4th of September , 1774 , and having chosen officers , they adopted certain fundamental rules for their proceedings . Thus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , acting directly in their primary sovereign capacity , and without the intervention of the functionaries to whom the ordinary powers of government were delegated in the colonies , the first general or national government ; which has been very aptly called the revolutionary government , since , in its origin and progress it was conducted upon revolutionary pririciples . The congress thus assembled , exercised de facto , and dejure , a sovereign authority ; not as the delegated agents of the governments , de facto , of the colonies , but in virtue of original powers derived from the people . The revolutionary government thus formed , terminated only when it was regularly superseded , by the confederated government , under the articles finally ratified , as we shall hereafter see in 1781 ; " 1 Story 's Com . 185 , 6 , sec. 200 , /z/ " In the first place , antecedent to the declaration of independence , none of the colonies were , or pretended to be , sovereign states , in the sense in which the term sovereign is sometimes applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strictly speaking , in our republican forms of government , the absolute sovereignty of the nation is in the people of the nation , and the residuary sovereignty of each state , not granted to any of the public functionaries , is in the people of the state ; ' ' lb. 195 , sec. 208 . " Now , it is apparent , that none of the colonies before the revolution , were in the most enlarged and general sense , independent or sovereign communities ; " lb. 196 , sec. 210 . " In the next place , the colonies did not severally act for themselves , and proclaim their independence ; " lb. 197 . " But the declaration of independence of all the colonies , was the united act of all ; it was a declaration by the representatives of the United States of America , in congress assembled , by the delegates appointed by the good people of the colonies , as in a prior declaration of rights they were called .

It was an act of original inherent sovereignty by the people themselves ; resulting from their right to change the form of government , and to institute a new government whenever necessary for their safety and happiness . So the declaration of independence treats it . No state had presumed , of itself , to form a new government , or /z/ to provide for the exigency of the times , without consulting congress on the subject ; and when they acted , it was in pursuance of the recommendation of congress . It was therefore the achievement of the whole , for the benefit of the whole .

" The same body , in 1776 , took bolder steps , and executed powers which can , in no other manner , be justified or accounted for , than upon the supposition , that a national union , for national purposes , already existed , and that the congress was invested with sovereign power over all the colonies , for the purpose of preserving the common rights and liberties of all . " " Whatever , then , may be the theories of ingenious men on the subject , it is historically true , that before the declaration of independence , these colonies were not in any absolute sense sovereign states ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that at the moment of their separation , they were under the dominion of a superior , controlling national government , whose powers were vested in and exercised by the general congress , with the consent of the people of all the states ; lb. 202 , sec. 214 . " From the moment of the declaration of independence , if not for most purposes at an antecedent period , the united colonies must be considered as being a nation de facto , having a general government over it , created and acting by the general consent of the people of all the colonies . The powers of that government were not , and could not be well defined ; but still its exclusive sovereignty in many cases was firmly established ; and its controlling power over the states , was in most , if not in all , national measures , universally admitted ; " lb. 203 , sec. 215 .

" In our colonial state , although dependent on another . power , we very early considered ourselves connected by common interest with each other . Leagues were formed for common defence ; and before the declaration of independence , we were known in our aggregate character as the United Colonies of America . That decisive and important step was taken jointly . We declared ourselves a nation , by a joint , not by several acts ; and when the terms of our confederation were reduced to form , it was in that of a solemn league of Ill several states , by which they agreed that they would , collectively , form one nation , for the purpose of conducting some domestic concerns , and all foreign relations .

Experience disappointed the expectations they had formed from it ; and the people , in their collective and national capacity , established the present constitution . It is remarkable , that in establishing it , the people exercised their own rights , and their own proper sovereignty ; andj conscious of the plenitude of it , they declared , with becoming dignity , we , the people of the United States do ordain and establish this * constitution . ' Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country : and , in the language of sovereignty , establishing a constitution , by which it was their will that the state governmetits should be bound , and to which the state constitutions should be made to conform .

The only difference of opinion between these two most learned jurists , is in the constitution being a compact ; it is , however , only a difference about a name ; they agree in the thing ; the power which created , the nature and origin of the federal government , those of the states , and the thing created ; a constitution , not a league . These extracts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary occasion ; in order to present a full view of the ground on which the doctrine of the unity of power , in the one people , of one nation , existing from the beginning of the revolution , is asserted ; and that no supreme sovereign power was in the people of the several states , competen ; to ordain and establish the constitution , is maintained ; so that there can be no misapprehension as to meaning or intention . /z/ It was intended to publish the preceding view , with the four opinions which follow , in an appendix to the eleventh volume of Mr. Peters Reports , which contains the opinions of the Court , and the judges who dissented . But it was found that , by so doing , the publication of the Reports would be delayed beyond the time at which they would otherwise have been before the public . Unwilling to be the cause of such delay , I have adopted this mode of submitting my views and opinions to the profession . /z/ Briscoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the only member of the Court , who composed one of the majority in the case of Craig v. Missouri , and now concurs with the majority in this case , in affirming the judgment of the court of appeals ; in this respect my situation is peculiar , as well as in another particular . After an argument in the former case , two of the judges had died ; of the remaining five , three were of opinion that the paper issued by the state of Missouri were bills of credit , and two of a contrary opinion ; on the argument in 1830 , there were two judges present who had not before sat in the cause , and on whose opinion the result depended . If they agreed with the minority , the judgment was of course confirmed ; if they divided , it was reversed ; so that the one who joined the three made the judgment of the Court : this was my case ; agreeing in opinion with the three who were for reversing , I concurred in the judgment and general course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion was formed on grounds somewhat different It was my intention to have assigned my reasons in a separate opinion , but as it was the first term of my sitting in the Court , the business was new and pressing , and want of time prevented it ; but at my suggestion a clause was added to the opinion prepared by the chief justice , which would enable me afterwards to show the reasons of my judgment should a similar question occur . In this case , too , I fully concur in the judgment rendered , yet not in the course of reasoning or the authority on which the opinion of the Court is based ; so that my position is as peculiar in this as it was in Craig v. Missouri ; and in one respect is in marked contrast with that of the other three judges who sat in that case . The judge who was in the majority then , and now dissents , was and is of opinion , that the paper emitted in both cases came within the restriction of tiie constitution as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the majority , were , and are of opinion that the papers in neither case are bills of credit , so that no imputation of inconsistency can rest upon them . With me it is /z/ Briscoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. different ; my judgment has led me to different results in the two cases , and therefore it can not be deemed improper for me to explain the reasons why , though forming one of the majority in both cases , I stand in some measure alone . A judge who now dissents , may find reasons therefor in the opinion delivered in Craig v. Missouri ; those who now concur , may rest on their dissenting opinions in that case ; but the same course of reasoning and deduction which shows the consistency of others , may lead to a very contrary conclusion as to mine . These considerations must be my apology for the course now taken . In Craig v. Missouri , the subject of controversy , were certificates signed and issued by the auditor and treasurer pursuant to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivable at the treasury for taxes and debts due the state , bearing interest at the rate of two per cent , per annum . One-tenth the amount of said certificates were directed to be withdrawn annually from circulation ; they were made a legal tender for all salaries and fees of office , in payment for salt to the lessee of the pubMc salt works at a price to be stipulated by law , and for all taxes due the state , or to any county , or town therein . They were to be loaned on personal security by joint and several bonds bearing interest ; the proceeds of the salt springs , the interest accruing on the bonds , all estates purchased under the law , aU debts due or to become due to the state , were pledged and constituted a fund for their redemption , and the faith of the state was also pledged for the same purpose . It seemed to a majority of the Court , to be impossible to disguise the character of this paper , or to change its nature or effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word hill ; the change was only in name , the thing was the same . Connected with the law under which the paper was issued , it was a bill , note , or obligation , emitted by the state , with the avowed purpose of circulating as money for all the purposes referred to in the law ; the funds and faith of the state were pledged for its payment with interest from its date , and it was made a legal tender in payment of certain debts to individuals , and of taxes to towns and counties . No member of the Court was more clearly of opinion , that these self-called certificates were bills of credit to all intents and purposes , and that that part of the constitution which declared , that no state should emit them , would be a dead letter if they were not held to be within it , than I was . On this subject , my opinion went to the full extent of that which was delivered by the chief justice , and has been fully confirmed by subsequent reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other difference of opinion , or in the reasons of our respective judgments , than in the definition of a bill of credit , which is thus giyen in the opinion , 4 Pet . 432 : " To emit bills of credit conveys to the mind the idea of issuing paper , intended to circulate through the oonunu- /z/ Briflcoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. nity , for its ordinary purposes as money , which paper is redeemable at a future day . This is the sense in which the ' terms have been always understood . If the prohibition means any thing ; if the words are not empty sounds , it must comprehend the emission of any paper medium by a state government for the purpose of common circulation . ' To this broad definition I could not assent ; in my opinion , no paper medium could be deemed a bill of credit emitted by a state , unless it contained on its face , or the law under which it was emitted gave a pledge of its faith or credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal tender in the payment of some debts to individuals . Though the opinion is silent as to the pledge of the faith of the state , being a requisite to constitute a bill of credit , and negatives the necessity of the paper being made a legal tender ; yet these matters entered into the character of the paper , and were a part of the case before the Court , as appears in the opinion , 4 Pet 432 , 3 . The first sentence in the latter page , shows the ground on which my opinion turned ; the paper was a tender , and the faith of the state was pledged . This last clause was added to the opinion at my request " It also pledges the faith and funds of the state for their redemption . ' ' Thus there was a perfect union of opinion between the judges who composed the majority , on the whole case presented for judgment , as well in the result as the course of reasoning which led to it ; the only variance was as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ' any paper medium emitted by a state government for the purpose of common circulation , " filled the constitutional definition of a bill of credit , while one judge held that there were two additional requisites ; that the emission should be on the credit of the state , and the paper declared a legal tender . But as the certificates or bills , taken in connection with the law directing their emission , contained all the requisites to constitute bills of credit , on the most limited construction which could be given to the constitution , there could be no other difference of opinion than in the reasons for judgment Had the opinion and reasoning been applied to the whole case , to paper not only emitted by a state for common circulation , but emitted on its faith and credit expressly pledged , and made a tender , the reasons would have been in perfect accordance with the views of the majority and their judgment But though this was requested by me , the opinion was confined to only a part of the case on the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pledge of the faith of the state in direct terms , or giving to it any declared effect in fixing the character of the paper . If this pledge had not appeared on the certificate or in the law , my opinion would have been for affirming the judgment of the state court ; and as three judges held that even with this pledge , the certificates were not bills of credit , it is evident that the judgment of this Court depended on this part of the law . /z/ Briscoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky . With this explanation , the case of Craig v. Missouri , so far from being an authority in favour of the proposition , that it is not necessary to constitute a bill of credit , that the faith of the stajte should be pledged for its payment , it must be taken as negativing it by the opinion of four judges . . On the other hand , four judges were of opinion , that it was not necessary that the certificates should have been made a legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills of credit . Thus understood , I adhere to the decision of the Court in that case , as it was judicially before it on the record ; and yet retaining the same opinion now , which I then expressed to the judges , I can not feel myself precluded from acting on it in this case , because the opinion of the Court , as delivered , did not take the same course as mine , in leading the majority to the conclusion they formed . To now abandon the deliberate result of my best judgment , formed and expressed in that case , which has been confirmed on the successive arguments in this , would look more like yielding to a train of reasoning on a part of a case , than respecting the judgment of the Court on the whole record . It would also place me in a position of inextricable difficulty , to now surrender my judgment to the same reasoning and illustrations , which failed to convince me seven years since , the more especially when the intervening investigations which it has been my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to the conclusion it first formed . With these remarks , the profession will understand the reason why I concurred in the judgment of the Court in this , and the former case , in that the faith of the state of Missouri was pledged for the payment of the paper which she emitted , and made a legal tender ; in this , Kentucky has not pledged her faith to redeem the notes of the bank , nor madp them a legal tender in payment of a debt . I also concur with the opinion of the Court in this case , that these notes can not be deemed to have been emitted by the state , and have no desire to add any views of my own on this part of the case , my object being to defend my own peculiar position as to the definition of a bill of credit , according to the true interpretation of the first sentence of the tenth section of the first article of the constitution . It is in these words  --  " No state shall enter into any treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , or ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or grant any title of nobility . " In analyzing this sentence , it is apparent that these restrictions on the states relate to three distinct subjects . 1 . To those on which the constitution had granted express powers to the federal government ; to make treaties , grant letters of marque and reprisal , coin money . 2 . To those on which the constitution made no grant of any power , by either express words , any necessary implication or /z/ Briscoe et al . y . The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. any reasonable interpretation ; to emit bills of credit , make any thing but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts , or pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts . 3 . To those subjects on which the 9th section of the first article had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the tenth section did on the separate states ; to pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or grant any title of nobility . On the last class of cases any comment is useless ; there has never been any difference of opinion as to the meaning of a bill of attainder , or a title of nobility ; and though there have been doubts as to the meaning of an ex post facto law , they have long since been settled , so that we can safely assume , that as to those parts of the ninth and tenth sections of the first article , the meaning of the constitution is as plain and definite as its language . By referring the terms to a standard of admitted authority , from which they have been adopted in the constitution , they become as intelligible as if their settled definition had been added by the convention which framed the instrument . What the standard of definition shall be , depends on the term used ; if it is one of common use in the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in its common ordinary acceptation by those who use the term ; if it relates to any particular art , science , or occupation , its meaning is its common understood sense , according to the usage and its acceptation among men so employed . If it is a term appropriate to the common , or statute law , or the law of nations , it must be taken as intended to be applied according to its established definition as a known legal term . Hence the term bill of attainder means the conviction of a person of a crime by legislative power ; an ex post facto law , is one which makes an act criminal which when committed was no offence ; a title of nobility is a term which defines itself . Thus the terms used as to the third class of cases , have been considered as defined by a reference to their understanding in a legal sense . In passing to the first class of cases , it will be found that the terms treaty J alliance , confederation and letters of marque and reprisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly defined ; so is the term coin money , when referred to the words in their common acceptation , or their legal sense . There is no ambiguity in the words ; taken separately or in connection , as a term or phrase , they require no other interpretation than is to be found in the known and universally received standard by which they are defined , nor can they be taken in any other sense , or by any other reference , unless there appears from the context or other parts of the same instrument , an obvious intention to use and apply them difierently from their ordinary or legal acceptation . These are the established unvarying rules of interpretation which assign a meaning to language , that requires explanation not contained in the words themselves ; the want of certainty is cured by a reference to that which is cer- /z/ Briscoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. tain , and when any word , term , or phrase , has acquired a definite meaning , its use without explanatory words , is always deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every statesman and jurist , the terms used in these two classes of cases in the tenth section , with the exception of an ex post facto law , have been received and taken according to their known definition , by municipal or na* tional law , and common understanding ; and there is now the same common assent to the meaning of an ex post facto law , as settled by the repeated adjudications of this Court . The same rules have also been applied to all other parts of the constitution , in which trms of known import are used , as the writ of habeas corpuSy trial hy jury J &c.; No man ever doubted that they were used according to their definition by the common law , or that the words taxes , com " Tnerccy money , coin , were used and must be taken in their ordinary meaning and acceptation . It is indeed an universal rule , applied to all laws supreme or subordinate , to all instruments of writing , all grants or reservations of power , property , franchise or immunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall be interpreted by such reference , accordingly as the subject matter is made certain by their legal or commonly received definition or acceptation . There is another rule of interpretation equally universal , that the whole instrument shall be examined , to ascertain the meaning of any particular part or sentence , so as to avoid any discrepancy , and the same standard be applied to all its terms , and every word which can bear upon its intention , referring each to the appropriate subject to which it relates , the standard is furnished for the interpretation . Thus the word bill has a meaning depending on the subject matter to which it is applied ; a bill cf credit refers to the payment of money ; a bill of attainder refers to the conviction of an offence by a legislature ; so of the word law , an ex post facto law refers to one which inflicts a punishment ; a law impairing the obligation of a contract , refers to money or property due or owned in virtue of a contract . Taking it then as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be applied to all parts of the tenth section , taken in connection with the whole constitution , as one instrument of writing , I shall endeavour to ascertain what is the meaning of the terms used in reference to the second class of cases . The first term is " No state shall emit bills of credit . ' * That by state is meant a state of this Union there can be no doubt . Next comes the word emit , which , referring to bills of credit , means an emission of paper ; a putting ofi " , putting out , putting forth , or issuing bills by a state , for the payment of money , at some time , by some person , and on credit The time of payment , the fund out of which it is payable , the faith or credit reposed in , or pledged by those who emit it , depends on the law under which the state made , or authorized the emission . /z/ Briscoe et al . t . The Commonwealth fiank of Kentucky . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or explanatory words ; but as it necessarily relates to the payment of ' money , the word bill must be taken as a paper , containing some evidence that a certain sum is due , to the person to whom it was emitted or issued , or by whom it is held . It is a word of legal import , as well defined as any in the English language , according to the subject matter to which it is applied . " A bill is a common engagement for money given by one man to another ; when with a penalty it is a penal bill , when without one it is a single bill ; ' ' Toml . L. D. 230 ; " and it is all one with an obligation , saving that it is commonly called a bill when in English , and an obligation when in Latin . But now by a bill , we ordinarily understand a single bond without a condition ; by an obligation , a bond with a penalty and condition ; " Cow . L. I. Tit Bill ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or according to the definition of C. B. Comyns , " a single bill is when a man is bound to another by bill or note , without a penalty ; ' ' ib. /z/ A bill of credit is also a well known term of the law ; ip its mercantile sense , it means a letter addressed by one merchant to another , to give credit to the bearer for money or goods , such letter being in the nature of a bill of exchange , is called a bill and so treated ; Beawes , L. M. 483 ; S. P. 5 , D. C. D. 131 ; Merchant , F. 3 . When the word bill refers to paper emitted by a bank , there will be found a most marked adherence to the distinction between an obligation and a bill , as appears in the clause of the original charter of the Bank of England , read by plaintiffs ' counsel , " That all and every bill or bills obligatory and of credit under the seal of the said corporation , made or given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereon , &c.; be assigned , " &c.,; 5 W. &; M. ch. 20 , sect. 29 ; 3 Ruff . 563 . So in the twenty-sixth section of the same act , " The corporation shall not borrow or give security by bill bond , covenant or agreement , under their common seal , " &c.; ib. ; the word bill denotes a sealed paper , either a bill obligatory which is an obligation , or a bill of crit which is a single bill ; or if they are taken as synonymous , the words of the act are expressly confined to sealed bills , which require endorsement to make them assignable . Taking the term bills obligatory and of credit , under the common seal of the corporation , to be what they are declared in the charter , they are in their legal sense , and in common acceptation , the bills of the banp or bank bills , issqed under their seal . This leads to another distinction between the different kinds of paper issued by the bank , worthy of all observation in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under its common seal ; they were payable to bearer on demand , and passed from hand to hand by delivery merely , without endorsement . They can , therefore , in no just sense be deemed bills of credit under seal , requiring a special act of parliament to make them assignable ; and so well was this known and fuUy understood , tiiat we find throughout the extended /z/ Briscoe et al . y . The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. charter to the bank in 8 and 9 W. 3 , bank bills and bank notes are referred to in the same marked contradistinction which exists between a sealed bill assignable only by endorsement , and an unsealed note payable to bearer and transferable by delivery only . In providing for enlarging the capital of the bank , the subscribers were authorized to pay one-fifth of their subscription " in bank bills or bank notes , which have so much money bona fide resting due thereupon , " &c.,; 3 Ruff 657 , sect. 23 . The same words , " in bank bills or bank notes are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the whole act . In the thirty-sixth section , the discrimination is too strongly marked to admit of any possible doubt ; in this section it is declared , " That the forging or counterfeiting of any sealed bank bill , made or given out in the name of the said governor and company for the payment of any sum of money ; or of any bank note , of any sort whatever , signed for the said governor and company , of the Bank of England , &c.,; shall be felony ; ' ib. 659 . The act of 3 &; 4 Ann , ch. 9 , is also most explicit in its provisions , which embrace all notes in writing , signed by any person , " or the servant or agent of any corporation , " payable to order or bearer , and puts them on the footing of inland bills of exchange , according to the custom of merchants , but neither in terms or by construction , can be applied to bills under seal ; 4 Ruff 180 ; or has ever been attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take the term bills of credit , when applied to the paper issued by a bank , to mean an instrument under its corporate seal , payable to some person , and assignable by endorsement , and not a note payable to order or bearer , and transferable as an inland bill of exchange , according to the universal acceptation of the term in England . There is another class of bills of credit in England , known by the name of exchequer bills , which are . issued by the officers of the exchequer when a temporary loan is necessary to meet the exigencies of government . They were first termed tallies of loan and orders of repayment , charged on the credit of the exchequer in general and made assignable from one person to another . 5 W. &; M. ch. 20 , sect. 39 ; 3 Ruff . 566 . By a subsequent act , the officers of the treasury were authorized to cause bills to be made forth at the receipt of the exchequer , in such manner and form as . they shall appoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , they were made receivable for all taxes and money due at the exchequer , bore an interest , a premium was given for giving them circulation , the nation was security for their payment . Vide 8 and 9 W. 3 , ch. 20 , sect 63 , 4,5 , 6 ; 3 Ruff 667 , 8 ; 7 Ann , ch. 7 , sect 22- , 4 Ruff . 345 ; 9 Ann , ch. 7 , passim ; 4 Ruff . 431 ; and they were called bills of credit , 3 Ruff . 679 . Such is the nature of the three classes of bills of credit in England , whether they are letters or bills of credit of merchants in the nature of a bill of exchange , the bills obligatory or of credit of a bank or exchequer bills ; they all partake of the same character , /z/ Briscoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. and are the bills of credit of the person , corporation , or government , which emits , makes forth , issues , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , its form or the mode of giving it currency or circulation is immaterial ; its substance consists in its being an engagement to pay money at a future day , and that its payment rests on the security , faith , credit or responsibility , of those who put it into circulation , pledged on the face of the bills of individuals and corporations , and the law of the nation which emits or issues them . Bills of credit were viewed in the United States in the same way , before the adoption of the constitution and immediately afterwards . That the definition of a bill by the common law and common acceptation , is the same here as in England , and has ever been so accepted , is a proposition which needs only to be asserted ; the sime reasoning also attaches to a letter of credit in a mercantile sensiiod the same distinction which has been shown to exist there , betwelen bank bills and bank notesy was in the most explicit manner recognised during the revolution .

In the proceedings of that day , we have the plan of the bank which was then approved ; in the twelfth article it is provided , " That the bank notes payable on demand shall by law be made receivable in every state for duties and taxes , and by the treasury of the United States as specie ; congress also resolved , that they should be received in payment of all debts due the United States , and recommended to the states to make the counterfeiting bank notes a capital felony ; 7 Journals Cong . 87 , 90 ; 26 May , 1781 .

In 1783 Delaware passed an act to punish the counterfeiting the bank bills , and bank notes of the bank ; 2 Laws D. 773 . But the law of Massachusetts passed the 8th March , 1782 , contains the most unequivocal evidence , that the distinction between bank bills and bank notes was well known and understood , for it copies the thirty-sixth section of the acts of 8 and 9 W. 3 , before referred to , " That if any person shall counterfeit any sealed bank bill or obligation made or given out for or in the name of the said P. D. &; Co. for the payment of any sum of money ; or any bank note of any sort whatsoever , signed for or in the name of the said P. D. &; C.o . " Thomas ' L. Mass. 187 . In all these acts the words notej bill or obligation , are put in the same contradistinction from each other , which the common law assfgns to them , and so are the acts of congrew for chartering the Bank of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky . States , which were patterned from the acts of parliament chartering the Bank of England . By the ninth fundamental article of the charter of 1791 , it is provided , that " The total amount of the debts which the said corporation shall at any time owe , whether by bond billy note , or other contract , shall not exceed , &c."; 1 Story L. 172 .

In the twelfth article of the charter of 1816 , there is this proviso , " That said corporation shall not make any bill obligatory , or of credit , or other obligation under its seal , for the payment of a less sum than five thousand dollars . ' * In the seventeenth section we find the paper issued by the bank placed in contradistinction no less than five times , by the denomination of bills , notes , or obligations , and the same distinction is made throughout the acts of 1791 , and 1816 . It is also carried into the acts of 1798 , ( omitting the word obligation , ) by which the counterfeiting of any bill , or note , issued by order of the president , directors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felony ; 1 Story , 518 ; the act of 1807 ; 2 Story , 1048 ; and the eighteenth and nineteenth sections of the act of 1816 ; 3 Story , 1557 , 8 , in each of which the words bill and note are used to refer to the two kinds of paper , the word bill being used in its comprehensive sense as a known legal term , embracing bills , bonds , obligations of all kinds , when under the corporate seal , according to their settled and unvaried acceptation . In considering the third species of bills of credit which are issued by the government , I will first refer to their definition by parliament , as the best evidence of the meaning and acceptation of the term in England , and as it was adopted in the United States . The authority for issuing tallies , orders , or bills , from the exchequer , and the manner of doing it , are pointed out in the acts of 5 W. &; M. ch. 20 ; 8 &; 9 W. 3 , ch. 20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ch. 28 ; 3 Ruff . 677 , 9 ; also in Gilbert Hist . Exch. 137 . When money is paid into the exchequer for debts due , or on a loan to the gjovernment , the teller who receives it gives a bill for the amount , which is an excheljuer bill , or a bill of credit ; a substantial definition of which will be found in the eleyenth section of the 8 &; 9 W. /z/ firiicoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky . 3 , ch. 28 ; 3 Ruff . 679 . " Provided also that this act , or any thing herein contained , shall not extend to alter or change any method of receipts or payments by bills of credit in the exchequer , allowed , or to be allowed by parliament , " referring evidently to two species of such bills which are issued from the exchequer , according to the prescribed mode of accounting for all moneys paid . . / bill of credit given to a debtor who pays his debt , is merely the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one who lends money on the credit of the exchequer , allowed to be pledged by act of parliament , is a bill made forth on the credit of the government , who is a debtor to the holder for the amount with interest thereon as directed by the law . It is evident that the constitution did not intend to prevent the emission by a state of a bill of credit of the first description , which in effect would be no more than a receipt for a debt due the state ; it clearly refers only to that class of bills of credit which were emitted by a state , for the purposes declared in the law authorizing them to be emitted and put into circulation . Taken in this sense , the term bill of credit , will be found to have been as well defined in the United States before the adoption of the constitution , as it was in England , or as the term bill of credit , in reference to bank bills , had been there and here from the time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth article of the confederation , congress were authorized " to borrow money or em , it bills on the credit of the United States ; ' but unless nine states consented , could not ' ' coin money , nor em , it bills , nor borrow money on the credit of the United States ? By article twelve , all bills of credit em , itted , moneys borrowed , and debts contracted , by or under the authority of congress , &c.; shall be deemed a charge against the United States ; for payment and satisfaction whereof , the said United States , and the public faith , are hereby solemnly pledged ; 1 Laws U. S. 18 , 19 . If there is certainty in language it would seem to be in this , as a definition of a " bill of credit , and was evidently copied in the tenth section of the first article of the constitution ; the prohibition against any less than nine in number of states acting on certain subjects is in the precise words , " nor coin money " nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what bills , the aiTswer is , " bills on the credit of the United States , bills of credit emitted by the authority of congress on a pledge of the public faith ? By substituting state for " United States in congress assembled , " the meaning of the words is identical , and can not be mistaken when they are transferred into the constitutional prohibition , " No state shall coin m , oney , emit bills of credit , means bills on the credit of the state . Plain words must be perverted by something inconsistent with reason , if they mean any thing else ; if they do not refer to bills emitted on the credit of the state , we must be informed on whose credit . It must be that of an individual , a corporation , or of the United States ; /z/ Briscoe et al . y . The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. those who assert such a propositioiii can have no respect for the constitution or its framers . Yet they can in no other way evade the obvious meaning of plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state from emitting bills on its own credit y and not on any other credit The prohibition is confined to a state , to an emission by a state , of bills of credit , emitted on the faith of a state , which can be pledged only by the law of a state , and no more exquisite torture can be inflicted on plain words , than in the endeavour to make them mean more , mean less , or mean any thing else than the credit of a state . When we look to the names aflSxed to the articles of confederation , and the constitution ; when we consider that the former , after being long discussed in congress , and approved by that body , was submitted to the state legislatures , who deliberated nearly four years before its adoption , and that every word , phrase , and sentence , was fully discussed and nK ) st anxiously considered , it can not be considered as a bold or rash assertion , that the framers of both instruments , comprehended the language they used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stamped upon their work an impress of intention , which they at least designed should be intelligible to all capacities . If the definition of a bill of credit , as given in both instruments , is not authoritative , I know of none higher to which to appeal as a more certain standard of political or judicial truth . In following such leaders in a path which they have plainly marked , I feel perfectly conscious of avoiding that disrespect for the solemn muniments of title on which the Union rests , which would be a cause of severe self-reproach , if in this tribunal I should rest my judgment on any contradictory authority . As however it can not derogate from the respect due to the framers of those instruments , or the instruments themselves , to refer to authority subordinate only to that of state legislatures who made the confederation , and the people of the several states who ordained the constitution , in affirmance of the definition of bills of credit , as given by all , I shall refer to the resolutions of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoption of the constitution . By the third section of the act of July , 1790 , making provision for the debt of the United States , * among other evidences of debt which were to be received as subscription to the proposed loan were the following : " Those issued by the commissioners of loans in the several states , including certificates given pursuant to the act of congress of the 2d January , 1779 , for bills of credit of the several emissions of 20th May , 1777 , and 11th April , 1778 . And in the bills of credit issued by the authority of the United States , at the rate of one hundred dollars in the said bills for one in specie. ' 1 Story , /z/ The general term bills of credit as used in the act of 1790 , are /z/ Briscoe et al . y . The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. defined in the resolutions of congress on the days respectively re ferred to . 20th May , 1770 . " Resolved , that the sum of 5,000,000 of dollars in bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emitted under the direction of the board of treasury . " 3 Journ. 194. 11th April , 1778 . " Resolved , that 5,000,000 of dollars be emitted in bills of credit , on the faith of the United States . ' * " That the thirteen United States be pledged for the redemption of the bills of credit now ordered to be emitted , ' 4 Journ. 149. 2d January , 1779 . In the preamble and resolutions of this day , bills of credit are thus referred to . The United States have " been under the necessity of emitting bills of credit , for the redemption of which the faith of the United States has been pledged . " " That any of the bills emitted by order df congress , &c."; " That the bills received on the said quotas , " &c.; " That the following bills be taken out of circulation ; namely , the whole emissions of 20th May , 1777 , and 11th April , 1778. " 5 Journ. 5 , 6 . When , therefore , we find , that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various terms are used as synonymous , all referring to the same species of paper , as well known and defined as the term coin , money , or any otJier term , could be , and the same term , bills of credit , used in the constitution , it is not a little strange that those who framed the instrument , should be supposed to have used it in a different sense , without adding some words denoting such intention . That the term being adopted without explanation , was intended to be taken with the same meaning which had been so long and universally accepted , would , on any other than a constitutional question , be deemed conclusive evidence of their intention , can not be doubted . If the term could admit of two interpretations , the members of the convention would adopt that which comported with the meaning given to the term by themselves , while members of congress , before , as well as after the adoption of the constitution , rather than any other standard of interpretation to be found elsewhere . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution , the terms of which are copied from the articles of confederation , as to coin money , regulate ' the value thereof , borrow money on the credit of the United States , fix the standard of weights and measures , and numerous others , apparent on inspection . As the constitution was intended to be a supreme fundamental law , and bond of union , for ages to come , it was of the last importance to use those terms in the grant , or prohibition of power , which had acquired a precisely defined meaning , either in common acceptation , or as terms known to the common , the statute , or the law of nations , and infused , by universal consent , into the most solemn acts of congress , and the alliance of the confederation , which expressed the sense in which the whole country understood words , terms , and language . The framers of the constitution did not speak in terms /z/ Briscoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentacky. known only in local history , laws or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expressions of historians , or the phraseology peculiar to the habits , institutions , or legislation of the several states . Speaking in language intended to be * uniform throughout the United States , " the terms used were such as had been long defined , well understood in polity , legislation , and jurisprudence , and capable of being referred to some authoritative standard meaning ; otherwise , the constitution would be open to such a construction of its terms as might be found in any history of a colony , a state , or their laws , however contradictory the mass might be in the aggregate . If we overlook the language of acts and instruments which express the sense in which it is understood by all the states , and seek for the true exposition of the constitution in those which speak only for one state , we have the highest assurance in the course and range of the argument in this case , that certainty can not be found in the almost infinite variety of laws which had been passed by the states in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there more certainty in referring to the opinions of statesmen and jurists , in debates in conventions , or legislative bodies , to political writers , or commentators on the constitution , among all of whom there is a most irreconcilable contradiction and discrepancy of views , on every debateable word and clause in the constitution , the result of which has been strongly exemplified in the argument of the cases at this term , depending on its true interpretation . Whether the remark made in the senate of the United States , by a profound and eminent jurist , in a debate on a most solemn constitutional question , is particularly applicable to the mass of what has been oiTered to the Court as authority in this case , or not , yet and then to lay down in its margin the contradictoiy commentaries which have been made , and which may be made , the whole page would be a polyglot , indeed . It would speak in as many tongues as the builders of Babel , and in dialects as much confused , and mutually as unintelligible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , with a reference only to those sources from which its words and terms have been adopted , I have always found certainty , and felt safety in adhering to it as the text of standard authority to guide my reasoning to a correct judgment In expounding it by opinion , or on the authority of names , there is , in my opinion , great danger of error ; for , when it is found that from the time of its proposition to the people , to the present , the wisest , and best men in the nation , have been , and yet are , placed foot to foot on all doubtful , and many plain propositions in relation to its construction , it is as difScult as it would be invidious , to select as a consulting oracle , any man , or class of statesmen or jurists , in preference to another . On the question involved in this case , of what are bills of credit , my judgment is conclusively formed on the authority herein referred /z/ Briscoe et al . v. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusive , I have neither found , or have been di ' rected to that which is paramount , or , in my judgment , at all coordinate , or to be compared with it . Resting on this authority , it was my deliberate opinion , that the certificates issued by a law of Missouri , pledging the faith of the state for their redemption , were bills of credit , prohibited by the constitution . On the same authority , and as the result of subsequent researches , it is now my most settled conviction , that the notes of the Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky , are not bills of credit emitted by the state of Kentucky , inasmuch as the state has pledged neither its faith , or credit , for their payment And the notes not being payable at a future day , or issued on any credit as to time , either on their face , or by the law under which they were issued , but directed to be paid on demand , in gold or silver , they were not emitted to obtain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can not be deemed its bills of credit . On a careful consideration of the mischiefs against the recurrence of which the constitution interposed this prohibition , of its language , the bearing of the three phrases on each other , their evident spiri and the meaning deducible therefrom , I can not abandon my first impression , that one requisite of a bill of credit is , that it be made a tender in payment of debts . The crying evils which arose from the issue of paper money by the states , can not be so well described as they are in the language of the constitution . The emission of bills of credit by the states , making them a tender in payment of debts , impaired and violated the obligation of contracts . The remedy is an appropriate one , reaching both the cause and effect , by three distinct prohibitions ; no state shall emit bills of credit , make any thing a tender but gold and silver , or pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts . Thus the remedy covers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its full extent ; the mere emission of bills of credit was no evil ; if no law coerced their circulation or reception by individuals , they are as harmless as certificates of stock , emitted on a voluntary loan to the state , which are admitted not to be the prohibited bills of credit . So long as they were not made a tender , they could produce no evils not common to all paper , whether of a state , a corporation , or individual , which by common consent , passes from hand to hand in the ordinary transactions of life . To prevent the circulation of such a medium , it was not necessary to call into action the high power of the constitution ; the evil would cure itself ; when the paper ceased to pass by consent , it would pay no debt , nor lead to the violation of any contract . The prohibition could not have been intended to prevent the people from taking as money , what would answer all the purposes of money in the interchanges of society , or-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , it was made to prevent the coercion of their free will by a tender law , and leave them free to enforce the obligation of their /z/ Briscoe ot al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. oontracts for the payment of money , and the enjoyment of their property . In the construction of all laws , we look to the old law , the mischief and the remedy , and so expound it as to suppress the mischief , and advance the remedy ; no just rule of interpretation requires a court to go further , by applying the remedy to a case not within the mischief , unless the words of the law are too imperative to admit of construction . I know no class of cases to which the rule is more appropriate , than those embraced within those prohibitions of the constitution on the exercise of powers reserved by the states , over subjects on which congress have no delegated power ; there can be no collision between the laws of a state and the laws of the Union , as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been confided to congress or any department of the federal government . Taking the first class of cases in the tenth section , relating to treaties , letters of marque and reprisal , and coining money , which are subjects over which the constitution grants express powers as an example , it is evident , that to make the prohibition eflfectual to the object in granting the powers , it must be total , so as to exclude the exercise of any power by a state over the subject matter . From the nature of these subjects , there can be no concurrent power in the two governments ; hence we find that the two first were , even by the article 6 , of confederation , expressly prohibited to the states , without the consent of the United States . The same reasons apply to the third , because the express power in congress to coin moneyj regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin coupled with the prohibition to a state to coin money , is a decisive expression of the intention , that it shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty , or a letter of marque and reprisal . The evils to be guarded against had not existed under the confederation ; the states separately had not made treaties , granted letters of marque or reprisal , or coined money , in violation of those articles ; the evils were wholly prospective , but were to be apprehended if any doubt whatever could be raised on the terms of grant of those powers . Hence the prohibition . Touching the third class of cases , bills of attainder , ex post facto laws , and titles of nobility , they were not subjects of any delegated powers to congress ; but as they were opposed to the whole spirit of the people , and the constitution , it annulled all power , state and federal , to do these things ; and the prohibition is , in its nature and object , absolute and illimitable . But the second class of prohibited cases , emitting bills of credit , tender laws , and those impairing the obligation of contracts , are widely different ; the evils had existed , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress could not legislate on these subjects , much less control the states , on whom the powers of parliament , in all their transcendency , as well as the prerogative of the crown , devolved by the revo- /z/ Briscoe et al . v. The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. lution ; 6 Wh. 651 ; 8 Wh. 584 . Each state had the power of emitting bills of credit , of passing tender laws , 4 Pet 435 , and exercised both , by annulling contracts and grants , the right to do which could not be contested by any authority ; 4 Wh. 643 , 651 . These were the acts which called aloud for the renjedy given by the prohibitions , to prevent their recurrence , which would have been certain if it had not been made . This Court has declared the intention of the constitution on the subject of contracts . " It was intended to correct the mischiefs of state laws , which had weakened the confidence between man and man , and embarrassed all transactions between individuals , by dispensing with a faithful performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been extensively abused , and to restrain the legislature in future from violating the rights of property . It protected contracts respecting property , under which some person could claim a right to something beneficial to himself ; and since the clause must , in construction , receive some limitation , it ought to be confined to the mischiefs it was intended to remedy . Not to authorize a vexatious interference with the internal concerns or civil institutions of a state ; to embarrass its legislation in the regulation of internal government , or to render immutable those institutions for these purposes , which ought to vary with varying circumstances . The term contract must be understood in a more limited sense , so as not to embrace other contracts than those which respect property , or some object of value , and confer rights which may be asserted in a court of justice ; " 4 Wh. 428 , 429 ; Dart College case . " The principle was the inviolability of contracts .

It does not extend to the remedy to enforce the obligation of a contract ; the distinction between them exists in the nature of things , so that without impairing the obligation , the remedy may be modified as the state may direct ; ' ' 4 Wh. 200 ; Sturgess V. Crowninshield . It is also a principle declared by this Court , that the prohibition does not extend to the passage of a state law , which does not affect contracts existing when the law was enacted , and which operates only on the obligation of posterior contracts ; 12 Wh. 369 ; Ogden v. Saunders ; and no exposition of the constitution is better settled , or commands more universal assent , than that the prohibition does not extend to the passage of retrospective , unjust , oppressive laws , or those which divest rights , antecedently vested , if they do not directly impair the obligation of a contract ; 2 Pet 411 , 13 ; 3 Pet 289 ; 8 Pet 110 ; and that " The interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its relations with its constituents , furnish the only security where there is no express contract , against unjust and exclusive taxation , as well as against unwise legislation generally ; " 4 Pet 563 . Let these principles of constitutional law be applied to the con-/z/ Briscoe et al . The Commonwealth Bank of Kentucky. struction of the clause against emitting bills of credit as they hare been applied to the clause concerning the obligation of contracts , the conclusion seems to me inevitable . That the same construction , which imposes a limitation to the corrective remedy against the future violation of the sanctity of contracts , which it was the great object of the prohibition to protect , should be extended with at least as much liberality , to limit the operation of that clause of the same article , which prohibits an evil which by no possibility could impair the obligation of a contract , without a tender law . The mischiefs of a mere emission of bills of credit , are trivial in their consequences , compared with the effect of tender laws ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restriction on a state , ought not to be construed more rigidly against an act , which can not of itself produce the mischief intended to be remedied , than a law which wholly annuls a contract If ach clause is taken according to an universal rule , that laws should be construed subjectam Tnateriam , the lesser evil requires the more gentle corrective ; but in assigning to the emission of bills of credit , without their being made a tender , a more restrictive meaning than to the direct violation of a contract , we act on the inverse rule . The protection is lessened in the same proportion as the danger is increased ; the greater the mischief the milder and less inefficient is the remedy : reason and established principles alike require , that a prohibition should be limited , as far as can be done , without producing the mischief intended to be remedied , and expanded so far as is necessary to correct it The construction must be according to the subject matter of the law , strict or liberal as the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be defeated or accomplished , ut resmagis valeat quampereat ; that which will eflfectuate all the objects of the prohibition can not be too narrow , that which goes beyond . the express word , or necessary implication , to effect an object not within the mischief , must be too broad . On the same rule which confines the prohibition as to contracts , to state laws passed affecting existing contracts , and excluding from the protection of the constitution , all posterior contracts ; a law making bank notes a legal tender in pannent of debts contracted after the passage of the law , would not be within the prohibition . On the same principle by which an unjust , oppressive , retrospective law , or one which divests vested rights , is held not to impair the obligation of a contract per se , it must be held that a mere emission of bills of credit is not within the mischiefs intended to be corrected .
