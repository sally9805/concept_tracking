txt IN a lower room of a large printing establishment in one of the most crowded streets in New-York , distracted by the countless duties and vexations to which the editor of a daily paper is exposed , and encompassed by the most unpoetical sights and sounds , the author of Thanatopsis may be seen , during the business hours of the day , by any of his admirers . He is a man , rather under the middle size than otherwise , with bright blue eyes and an ample forehead , but not very distinguished either in face or person . His manners are quiet and unassuming , and marked with a slight dash of diffidence ; and his conversation ( when he does converse , for he is more used to thinking than talking ) is remarkably free from pretension , and is characterized by good sense rather than genius . Would that Mr. Bryant was employed in writing poetry in the aforesaid room , and sending back his thoughts to the streams and mountains which his young eyes were familiar with , and from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is busied about far other things , and what he is writing is as little like poetry , as General Jackson is like Apollo . He is scrawling political paragraphs , and these , by no means favorable specimens of that kind of composition , with the same hand that wrote the " Lines to a Waterfowl . " He is burning incense to strange gods , to idols which the hands of men have fashioned , and offers no longer to Nature , upon her mountain altars , a sacrifice of song . The stillness , majesty , and repose of the outward world seem to have lost their old charm ; he is in love with the vulgar excitements , the senseless uproar and the empty triumphs of the solemn farce of politics , and delights to be elbowed and jostled in the worid 's great thoroughfare , and to breathe the hot atmosphere of party strife . The eyes of the muses are yet red with weeping at the apostacy of their favorite son , and they are calling him back to their arms , with an invocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ducite ab urbe doinum , mea carmina , Daphnin . " Mr. Bryant has been placed by common consent at the head of the list of American poets ; and in all matters which concern any of the *original instincts of humanity , of which the love of poetry is one , the decision of the majority is pretty sure to be correct . We are not disposed to enter our protest against it , but would even go a little farther , and claim for him a high rank among the living writers of English verse . And as he has not written a great deal , and as what he has , has been of the same character , it follows that he must have reached very great excellence in that department to which he has principally confined himself . Poets may be divided into three classes ; those who describe Nature , those who delineate men and manners , and those who draw their materials from the contemplation of both . We will not stop to consider that long agitated question , which Lord Byron and Mr. Bowles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford // the greater field for the display of poetical talent , but will merely remark that Mr. Bryant belongs to the first of the classes we have mentioned . His poetry is a translation of the language of Nature , which is audible only to the gifted ear . He is essentially undramatic . We do not mean by this to state the obvious truism , that he has written no plays , but that he has nothing to do with the actors of the great drama of life , or with the motives that operate upon them . He has never studied the morbid anatomy of the passions , nor unraveled the manycolored web of human character . He does not describe men as sustaining this or that relation , or swayed by this or that motive , as enslaved by that within them which is earthly , and ransomed by what is divine ; bmit regards them as one of the works of the Great Author of Nature , more interesting than woods and mountains , because presenting a far greater variety . Mr. Bryant had the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of being born and reared in a mountainous country . " He was born in the western part of Massachusetts , and in the midst of scenery worth a voyage across the Atlantic to see , and which , if it were across the Atlantic , would stand a chance of being visited by many who would never think of going to view what was only the journey of a day or two . He was brought up at the feet of Nature , and studied , with the rapt eye of inspiration , the ample page in which the lessons of the " mighty mother " are recorded . By this means , he formed not only a deep admiration for the beautiful and majestic . forms which ministered to his mind the materials of its growth , but , what is much more rare , a thorough and perfect acquaintance with them . Not content with the dim outline and the expression of the blended and combined whole , he studied each individual feature , and made himself familiar with every minute beauty and every secluded ' charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall . " He had watched the course of the stream from its birth among the hills , till it deepened and widened into a noble river , and had mused over the analogy which it presented to the progress of a human soul . Not a wild-flower bloomed unnoticed by him , and all the colors of autumn were known to his eyes . This intimate and familiar knowledge of Nature , gives to his poetry a distinctness* never found in those who describe from recollection or from superficial knowledge . He is so picturesque , that he illustrates himself as he goes along , and his scenes are imaged to the outward eye , without any effort on our own part . Almost all his writings might be cited in proof of the truth of our remarks ; there is one in particular , which occurs te* our memory , which is a really wonderful piece of painting . It is a winter-piece , originally published , we believe , in the Idle Man , but not having the book at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor quote its title accurately . It contains a description of that dazzling and glorious spectacle which meets our eyes , when a thawing rain has been suddenly succeeded by a sharp frost , when every twig , leaf and blade of grass , is enclosed with a covering of the purest crystal , which , when sparkling and flashing in the light of the morning sun , reminds us of Aladdin 's garden , in which the trees bore diamonds , and rubies , and emeralds . When we say that the description is as beautiful as its subject , we pay him the highest compliment that language can give . His // " Green River " and " Autumn Woods " will recur to those who have read them ( and who has not ? ) as admirable specimens of the picturesque in style . We would not have it inferred from any thing we have said , that we think Mr. Bryant merely an accurate painter of still life . He who with pure hands draws aside the veil of the temple of Nature , shall be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present not merely a form to the eye but a thought to the mind . There is a beautiful and mysterious connexion between the world within and the world without us , which every true poet feels , but which no one can in. telligibly describe , for it is of too airy and impalpable a nature to brook the chains of language . In this consists one of the greatest charms of Mr. Bryant 's poetry . He not only understands , but he feels , Nature . His mind has caught the sublimity of the mountain and the beauty of the pastoral vale . The stars have sent him feelings as well as rays ; and the summer wind has come to him , laden with tidings from a spirit-land , no less than with the scents of flowers . He has never mused an hour by a river side without bringing away thoughts and images as bright and as numerous as its glittering waves . His reflections upon the outward world have all the freshness and beauty of the objects which call them forth . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triteness . They are tinged with that pensiveness which seems peculiar to all poets who are more conversant with things than with men , but they are never defaced with mawkishness or misanthropy-for no genuine lover of nature was ever a hater of mankind . His manly simplicity , and freedom from affectation , prove him to have that true sense of the dignity of his noble art , without which no poet ever had the permanent respect of the reading public , however popular he might be for a time . All these excellencies are combined in what is probably the most popular of his productions , " Thanatopsis , " and deservedly so , for it is one of the most admirable specimens of high philosophical poetry that ever was written . The solemn grandeur and sort of choral majesty with which it begins , swell and deepen to the close . lie not only soars himself : , but he makes the reader soar with him . His own language is no imagination ; we seem to be listening to " Nature 's teachings , " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such natural succession that we are spared the pain of having the spell broken by an unpleasant start of surprise ; and the author 's train of reflection falls in so completely with our own , that it is only on a second or third perusal , that we feel its power and originality . As a mere piece of versification , it has not its superior in the language , always excepting the blank verse of Milton , which is altogether unlike that of any other English poet , either before or after him . There is also a little piece of his of the same character , which was originally published in the United States Literary Gazette , and which does not seem to be so great a favorite with the public as it is with us , or as it deserves to be . It is entitled " The Lapse of Time , " and is remarkable for its cheerful philosophy , and natural and religious feeling , expressed in his very happiest manner . Mr. Bryant is a natural poet as well as a poet of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pun . It is very possible for a man to // writo poetry , who is no poet , however paradoxical the assertion may seem . He may work his mind up into such a state of excitement as to feel for a time the true poetical a*stas , and a great deal of respectable poetry has been written in this way . But it is not so with Mr. Bryant . The natural habit of his mind is a poetical one , and it wears the trammels of verse as a man wears his ordinary garments . He could no more help being a poet than the violet seed can help bearing violets ; and , in being a political editor , he does the same violence to his nature , that his coadjutor of the Washington Globe would do if he should take it into his head to write a copy of verses to a water-fowl or the evening wind . To borrow a quaint idea from one of Coleridge 's early poems , the Muses dipped him , at his birth , into the " fount of Castalie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as by Thetis erst her warrior son , And with those recreant , unbaptized heels He 's flying from his bounden mysteries . " It would be doing Mr. Bryant injustice not to speak of the elevated tone of moral feeling , which runs through all his productions . He has never written a line which the most rigid virtue could wish to blot . He never forces our moral nature to enter its protest against the admiration which Genius , however exerted and however attended , must and will extort . We give our sensibilities unreservedly into his hands , for we know that he will not enlist them in any unholy cause . He appeals to those principles in man which are pure , spiritual and heavenly , and disdains any alliance with those which are of the earth , earthy . He never approaches the soul through the avenue of the senses . The tenderness and depth of feeling , the purity , the healthy tone of sentiment , and the strong and cheerful religious views , which pervade his writings , show him to be a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound to the core  --  to whom Nature has been a mirror , reflecting the countenance of its great Author . If he contemplate a landscape in the budding luxuriance of Spring , or the deeper glow of Summer , it is with a throb of gratitude to Him who has poured out all this beauty to gladden the eyes and the hearts of men . The woods of Autumn , while they fill him with thoughts as lovely as their own hues , teach him to prepare for the great change that is to come over the bloom and greenness of life . Even the blustering winds of March are welcome to him , because they are the heralds of better things . Much of his great popularity is owing to these excellencies . How many throbs of delight have they called forth from readers , to whom the poetry , as such , was quite a secondary affair , and perhaps even unfelt by them . He not only does not make us any worse , but he makes us better ; he purifies and refines us ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves of passion be still . We feel , after reading him , as if we had been walking through some beautiful and majestic scenery ; we are soothed and elevated ; the " eating cares " of life have an interval of rest ; we are more in unison with the Spirit of the Universe ; we feel a warmer glow of benevolence playing about our hearts , and the fire of devotion mounts into a purer and higher flame . We can not but think it highly creditable to our countrymen , that they have received , with so much favor , the productions of one who has 51 // never furnished any stimulants to the passions and appetites of men , but yho has constantly addressed their understanding and their moral nature in the language of Truth , Philosophy and Religion . Mr. Bryant is as skilful in the practice of his art as he is profoundly versed in its deepest mysteries . He writes pure and vigorous English , and never indulges himself in any freaks of style . He never seeks to attract attention by labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elevate into poetic dignity , words which belong to the kitchen and the barn-yard . His style is simple and translucent , and his meaning shines through , like light through glass . He is remarkably free from the common fault of verboseness ; we never see , in his pages , a poor little idea buried and smothered beneath a crowd of words , like the Roman virgin beneath the shields of the Sabines . He regards language merely as an instrument for transmitting thought , and employs it for nothing more . His versification has the ease and gracefulness , that are the result of care and attention , and of these only . It is free from disagreeable and cloying monotony ; the pauses and cadences do not recur continually at the same intervals ; and it adapts itself with easy flexibility to the subject he is discussing . As we have hinted before , Mr. Bryant has very little versatility of mind . We do not know that he has ever attempted any thing in the humorous or satirical line , and , if he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and somewhat pensive turn of his mind prevents his seeing objects in ludicrous combinations . His Muse is a matron form , whose pale brow of contemplation , and deep , soullighted eyes , reconcile us to the absence of the " wreathed smiles of Hebe 's cheek , " to which they would be so ill suited . " She walks in beauty , like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies : And all that s best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes* Thus mellowed to that tender light Which Heaven to gaudy day denies . He is not only entirely and exclusively a poet , but he has confined himself to one department of poetry . His writings breathe a philosophic and reflective strain , and are the emanations of a mind in that calm and meditative mood , in which it best communes with itself and with Nature . There is a deep repose brooding over them , like the stillness of a summer noon . His thoughts have been born and nursed in solitude . His mind is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , the mountains , and the clouds are imaged . He has never written any thing to kindle and excite-nothing to " stir the blood like the sound of a trumpet . " He has noiie of that versified eloquence , which is often mistaken for Poetry , but which is no more like it , than Champagne is like the water of Helicon , or exhilarating gas like common air . He soars on the wing of the " Cherub Contemplation . " He has none of that glow , fervidness and rapidity , which are the result of ardor of temperament , rather than of vividness of poetic feeling . He does not possess the power of concentrating the whole mind into one intense and burning point of passion , and making every thought and image supply fuel to the flame . He converses with Nature as Numa with Egeria ; in solitude and darkness , by the side of // babbling fountains , and in the shades of the over-arching forest ; and the lessons he learns are those of the highest wisdom and the purest reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , that he was deficient in fire . It is not his fault , but his peculiarity . His mind is as Nature made it , and some of its finest properties are owing , perhaps , to this very want , and those who make the objection are as unphilosophical as the boy who wanted to eat his cake and have it . Where there is much fire , there is also apt to be much smoke , and we will readily give up the " splendid conflagration , " for the sake of clearness of thought and distinctness of expression . Mr. Bryant is one of the very few poets , who have laid no offerings upon the altar of Love . The myrtle of Venus is almost always found growing by the laurels of Apollo , and the connexion between poetical genius and a peculiar sensibility to female charms seems so obvious , that he , who has the former , appears to be hardly worthy of his trust , unless he makes it the means of expressing his admiration of the latter . It is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his own hills , ( haud inexperti loquimur ) maidens lovely as his own loveliest dreams , and amply deserving an immortality in verse . Nor is it from a want of tenderness and sensibility , and an indifference to those pure and lasting pleasures , which man derives from the exercise of his social and sympathetic nature ; for his poetry exalts the common affections of life into their proper rank , and shows the power they have " to soothe and elevate and bless . " We presume he was a bashful boy , and made love to the trees and flowers , and viewed young ladies as Se many " bright particular stars , " that were to be worshiped and not wooed . But be the cause what it may , we do not in the least regret it , living as we do , in an age , in which every eyebrow has a ballad made for it , and young gentlemen amuse themselves with versifying and publishing their flirtations . It is very hard to point out any faults in Mr. Bryant 's poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gifts and powers of mind which he has not , but then he does not pretend to have them , and he claims to be judged by what he has done , not by what he has not . There are many poets on record who 1*ave more faults than he , but who are also men of more genius . He has never tried to climb to the " highest heaven of invention ; " but , knowing perfectly the extent of his powers , he has attempted nothing beyond them , and has succeeded perfectly in every instance . There are a very few poets that are like eagles and can fly any where , into the very lap of the sun , but the wings of most of them are constructed on a principle something like those of Icarus , in the old fable , and will melt if they approach too near the god of day . Mr. Bryant has had the sense never to fly too high . He has so much taste and judgement , and writes in such temperate blood , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetical style . There are many of his productions , in which , as it seems to us , it would be impossible to alter a word for the better . We can not close this notice without again expressing our sorrow at the nature of Mr. Bryant 's present occupation , and that a man capable of writing poetry to make so many hearts throb , and so many eyes glisten with delight , should be lending himself to an employment , in which the greater the success , the more occasion there is for regret ; for it // must arise from the exertion of those very qualities which we are least willing that a poet should possess . " T is strange , t is passing strange , t is pitiful , " that he should hang up his own cunning harp upon the willows , and take to blowing a brazen and discordant trumpet in the ranks of faction . He may plead the plea of necessity , and , sure enough , a poet must live ; and Parnassus never bore any thing but barren laurels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practising lawyer in Great-Barrington , if we mistake not , in this state , and was " making a decent living " by his profession , and we will leave it to an impartial jury , whether the " thorny path of jurisprudence " be not as pleasant a road to walk in , as the high-way of party politics , and a great deal cleaner . At any rate he was secure of the advantage of living in the country , and in communion with the fair forms of the outward world , which are at once the sources of his inspiration , and its most appropriate subjects . We have great faith in the influence of external objects upon the mind , and it may be mentioned in proof of it , that he has written but little poetry since he began to " coop himself in cities , " and that little has not been equal to his former productions . If he keep on , we fear he will die as prosaic as an alderman . We will take leave of him , with a word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
