Stephens , Ann S. ( Ann Sophia ) , 1810-1886 : THE WIDOWED BRIDE . from The widowed bride ( 1836 ) The Morn awoke in Hindostan , And blushing , left the couch of Night , While soon her rosy smiles began , To flood the dewy earth with light . While yet the sultry day was young , Came forth a happy bridal band , With sunny smiles and English tongue , Which spoke them of a distant land ; They gathered round an altar-stone , Erected to the one Most High , Standing in solitude alone , Mid signs of dark idolatry . Then two came slowly from the crowd ; He with a bearing bold and proud , A haughty smile and flashing eye , Darkling with love 's intensity ; While she , the high-born English bride , Drew closer to that one dear side ; Her eyelids drooped , her cheek grew pale As snow , beneath the bridal veil , As if the weight of her own bliss Were all too much of happiness , To thrill her heart and light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped with gold The youthful pair together bow ; Before that priest in surplice-fold They clasp their trembling fingers now ; A prayer is heard  --  the oath is said  --  That gentle creature lifts her head  --  A voice has thrilled into her heart , Like music breathed to it apart ,  --  To lie there an abiding spell , To haunt forever memory 's cell  --  To mingle with her latest breath And light the very wing of death . Her vow was uttered timidly  --  With half a murmur , half a sigh ; Yet the low faltering sound confessed The love that brooded in her breast . The golden ring is on her hand  --  She is pronounced a wedded bride ; Oh say , why does she lingering stand So long that altar-stone beside ? And whence the misty tears that dim The sunny azure of her eye ? Why leans her slender form on him ? Why does she sob so bitterly ? Well may she weep , that fair young bride ; For up the Ganges ' golden tide , Mid jungles deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the wild waters fiercest sweep , And serpents in their venom sleep , Beneath each dewy leaf and flower , That gentle bride must build her bower . In the cool shadow of the shore , With snowy streamers floating wide , To the light dipping of the oar , The budgerow swept o'er the tide ; The soft breeze ling'ring at her prow , Where many a garland graceful hung , In hues of purple , gold and snow , And on the rippling waters flung An odor sweet and delicate , As that which all imprisoned lies , Unknown to man as his own fate , Within the flowers of Paradise . Beneath an awning 's silken shade , Where the light breeze its music made , With woven fringe and silken cord , Sat the young bride with her brave lord . Her hand in his was ling'ring still , And every throb of his full heart Met her young pulses with a thrill , And sent the blood up with a start , To that round cheek but late so pale And blanched beneath the bridal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like dews that in the violet lie ; But breaking through its lovely sheen , The brightness of her soul was seen , Like light within the amethyst , Which told how truly she was blest ; Though as she met his ardent gaze , Like the veined petal of a flower Her eyelids drooped , as from the blaze Of some loved , high , but dreaded power . As bound by some subduing spell , In beauty at his side she bowed , The bridal robe around her fell , Like fragments of a summer cloud ; The loosened veil had backward swept , And deeply in her glossy hair , Like light , the orange blossoms slept , As if they sought new beauty there ; And pearls lay softly on her neck , Like hailstones melting over snow , Save when the blood , that dyed her cheek , Diffused abroad its rosy glow , And playing on her bosom-swell , With every heart-pulse rose or fell . Up went the sun ; his burning rays Broke o'er the stream like sparkling fire , Till the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spire Of some lone slender minaret , Threw its clear shadow on the stream , Or grove-like banian firmly set , Broke with its boughs the fiery gleam ; Or where a white pagoda shone Like snow-drift through the shadowy trees ; Or ancient mosque stood out alone , Where the wild creeper sought the breeze ; Or where some dark and gloomy rock Shot o'er the deep its ragged cliffs , Inhabited by many a flock Of vultures , and its yawning rifts Alive with lizards , glowing , bright , As if a prism 's changing light Within the gloomy depths were flung , Where like rich jewels newly strung , The sleeping serpent stretched its length , And nursed its venom into strength . Where the broad stream in shadow lay , The bridal barque kept on her way , While every breeze that swept them o'er , Brought loads of incense from the shore ; Where each luxuriant jungle lay A wilderness of tangled flowers , And budding vines in wanton play Fell from the trees in leafy showers , Flinging their graceful garlands o'er The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowy breast , Swayed its full anthers like a crest , And softly from its pearly swell , A shower of golden powder fell Among the humbler flowers that lay And blushed their fragrant lives away ; There oleanders lightly wreathed Their blossoms in a coronal , And the rich baubool softly breathed A perfume from its golden bell ; There flower and shrub and spicy tree Seemed struggling for sweet mastery ; And many a bird with gorgeous plume , Fluttered along the flowery gloom , Or on the spicy branches lay , Uttering a sleepy roundelay ; While insects rushing out like gems , Or showery sparks at random flung , Through ripening fruit and slender stems There to the breathing blossoms clung , Studded the glowing boughs and threw O'er the broad bank a brilliant hue . On  --  on they went ; a fanning breeze Came sighing through the balmy trees , And undulating o'er the stream Rose tiny wavelets , like the gleam Of molten gold , and crested all With a bright trembling coronal , Like that which Brahmins in their dream Lavish upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air Lay stagnant in the jungles there  --  The sun poured down his fervent heat ; The river lay a burnished sheet ; The floweret closed its withered bell ; From the parched leaf the insect fell ; The panting birds all tuneless clung To the still boughs , where late they sung ; The dying blossoms felt the calm , And the still air was thick with balm . All things grew faint in that hot noon , As Nature 's self lay in a swoon . And she , that gentle , loving fair , How brooks her form the sultry air ? Most patiently  --  but see her now ! What fear convulses her pale brow ? And why that half-averted eye , Watching his look so anxiously ? The scarlet burning in his cheek  --  Those lips all parched and motionless ? Oh ! do they fell disease bespeak ? Or only simple weariness ? One look ! the dreadful certainty Wrings from her heart a stifled cry ; And now half phrensied with despair , She rends the blossoms from her hair , And leaping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide ; Then to the cushions where he lay , Senseless and fevered with disease , Panting his very life away , She rushed , and sinking to her knees , Raised softly up his throbbing head , And pillowed it upon her breast  --  Then on his burning forehead laid The dripping flowers , and wildly pressed Her pallid mouth upon his brow , And drew him closer to her heart , As if she thought each trembling throe Could unto his , new life impart . Wildly to his she laid her cheek , And backward threw her loosened hair , That not a glossy curl might break From off his face the sluggish air . The noon swept by , and there was she Counting his pulses as they rose , Striving with broken melody To hush him to a short repose , Bathing his brow and twining still Her fingers in his burning hand , Her heart 's blood stopping with a chill Whene'er he could not understand , Nor answer to her gentle clasp ; But dashed that little hand away , Or crushed it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven ! and must he die ? She breathed in her heart 's agony , As up with every painful breath , Came to his lips the foam of death , And o'er his swollen forehead played , Like serpents by the sun betrayed , The corded veins whose purple swell , With his hot pulses rose and fell . Those drops upon his temple there , The rolling eye , the gloomy hair , The livid lip , the drooping chin , And the death-rattle deep within , That speechless one , so late thy pride  --  There lies thy answer , widowed bride ! Half conscious of her misery , Like something chiselled o'er a grave , She placed her small hand anxiously Upon the lifeless heart , and gave One cry  --  but one  --  of such despair , The jackall startled from his lair , And answered back that fearful knell , With a long , sharp and hungry yell . A slow and solemn hour swept by , And there , all still and motionless , With rigid limb and stony eye , The widow knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around the tearless mourner drew , And trembling strove to force away From her chill arms the senseless clay . Slowly she raised her awful head ; A slight convulsion stirr 'd her face ; Close to her heart she snatched the dead , And held him in a strong embrace ; Then drawing o'er his brow her veil , She turned her face as strangely wild , As if a fiend had mocked her wail , Parted her marble lips and smiled . Twice she essayed to speak , and then Her face drooped o'er the corpse again , While forth from the disshevelled hair A husky whisper stirred the air . ' Nay , bury him not here , ' it said , ' I would have prayers above my dead ; ' Then , one by one , the timid crew , From the infected barge withdrew : Helmsmen and servants , all were gone ; The wife was with her dead alone . With no propelling arm to guide , The barque turned slowly with the tide , And on the heavy current swept Its slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like gold along its morning track . The day threw out its dying gleam , Imbuing with its tints the stream , As if the mighty river rolled O'er beds of ruby  --  sands of gold . As if some seraph just had hung In the blue west his coronet , The timid moon came out and flung Her pearly smiles about  --  then set , As if she feared the stars would dim The silvery brightness of her rim ; Then in the blue and deepening skies The stars sprang out , like glowing eyes , And on the stream reflected lay , Like ingots down the watery way ; And softly streamed the starry light Down to the wet and gloomy trees , Where fiery flies were flashing bright , Afloat upon the evening breeze , Or like some fairy , tiny lamp , Glow 'd out among the stirring leaves , And down among the rushes damp , Where Pestilence her vapor weaves , Till shrub and reed , and slender stems , Seemed drooping with a shower of gems . The Widow raised her head once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted stream and broken shore ; Oh , God ! it was a mockery ,  --  The bridegroom  --  Death  --  upon her breast For aye possessing and possessed ! With the deep calmness of despair , The mourner raised his marble head , And on the silken cushions there , With icy hands , composed the dead ; Then tore her veil off for a shroud , And in her voiceless mourning bowed . That holy sorrow might have awed The very wind  --  but mockingly It flung his matted hair abroad , As trifling with her agony , And with a low and moaning wail Bore on its wings the bridal veil ; Then came a cold and starry ray , And on his marble forehead lay . Father of heaven ! she could not brook That floating hair , that rigid look . With one quick gasp she forward sprung , And to the helm in frenzy clung , Until the barque shot on its way Where a dense shadow darkest lay ; And there , as shrouded with a pall , The barge swept to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ear once more , And from the deep dark solitude She saw the hungry jackall creep , And whimper for his nightly food , Where many a monster lay asleep Just in the margin of the flood , As resting from a feast of blood . Around the corpse the widow flung Her snowy arms , and madly clung To that cold bosom , whence a chill Shot through her heart , and frantic still Her eyes in horror turned to seek That prowling beast , whose hungry jaws Worked fiercely and began to reek With eager foam , as with his paws He tore the turf impatiently , And howling snuffed the passing clay . It was not that she feared to die ; In the deep stillness of her heart , Her spirit prayed most fervently There with the dead to hold its part . The only boon she cared to crave , Was for them both a christian grave ; But oh ! the agonizing thought ! That in her madness she had brought That loved and lost one , for a feast , To vulture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild had come To howl a horrid requiem . But soon a stronger current bore The freight of death from off the shore ; Again the trembling starlight broke Above the still and changing clay , And with its pearly kisses woke The widow from her trance , who lay Convulsed and shivering with dread , Her white arms clinging to the dead ; For yet the stilly night wind bore The wild beasts ' disappointed roar . Within the far o'erhanging wood , A bulbul listening to her heart , Poured forth upon the air a flood Of gushing love ;  --  with lips apart The widow clasped her trembling hands , And bent her ear to catch the strain , As if a seraph 's low commands Were breathed into her soul ;  --  again , That heavenly sound came gushing out , Like waters in their leaping shout ; Over her heart 's deep frozen spring The gentle strain went lingering , And touched each icy tear that slept With sudden life , until she wept . Again the lovely morn awoke Upon that temple still and lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holy altar-stone Came down subduedly and dim , Through painted glass , o'er sculptured limb : Outstretched within that gorgeous gloom , Shaded by pall and sable plume , As chisseled from the very stone , The Bridegroom lay . A broken moan Rose up from where the Widow bowed , Her forehead buried in the pall , Her fingers grasping still the shroud , And every limb betraying all The agony that wrung her heart . It was a sad and fearful sight , That lifted head , those lips apart , When through the dim and purplish light Those who obeyed the bridal call Now gathered for the funeral ; A soft and solemn strain awoke The silence of that lofty dome , And through the fretted arches broke The music surging to its home ; Then with a firm and heavy tread The bearers slowly raised the dead ; She followed close , her trembling hand Still clenched upon the gloomy pall , In snowy robes and pearly band , As at her wedding festival ; And in her bright disshevelled hair A broken orange-blossom lay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridal day ; Thus onward to the tomb she passed , Her white robe swaying to the blast , And mingling at each stirring breath There with the drapery of death .
