View of the river  --  two ships and a sloop at anchor in the distance  --  on one side of the stage a hut  --  R. H.  --  composed of mats and reeds ; on the other rocks and cliffs . Indians on the cliffs , gazing at the shipping , and making signs to each other . Enter Matacoran and Selictaz , as from the chase ; Matacoran with a light hunting spear in his hand , Selictaz carrying his bow and game  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my prince , behold the great canoes . Have I not told thee truly ? Matac . Matacoran They are call 'd barques , and bear the adventurous English in search of their darling gold , the god they worship ! Away to Weorocomoco , and report this coming to the king . I will follow quickly on thy track . Fly with thy utmost speed  --  away .  --  ( Exit Selictan . ) Barclay ! English ! come forth . Striking with his spear against the hut . Enter Barclay . Barclay . Barclay Give you good morrow , Prince . So early return 'd from the chase ; yet , by your game , it would seem you have not drawn an idle bow . Matac . Matacoran Tell me , Englishman , are those the barques of thy country ; or those wild rovers of which I have heard thee speak , who , acknowledg 'd by no country , are consider 'd enemies by all ? Barc . Barclay ( Aside , with ecstacy . ) ' T is the flag of England . Prince , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony .  --  ( Aside . ) Alas ! they have come too late . Metac . Matacoran Why do they remain at rest ? why not approach the shore ? Barc . Barclay They await some signal of recognition from those they expect to find here . I have bethought me of the old pennon under which I sail 'd , when first leaving my native land to seek adventures in the New World . From amid the wreck of our misfortunes , I have preserv 'd the flag with the fondness of an old man 's treasure . An ' it please you . Prince , I will ascend the cliff , and waving the well-known signal of friendship , they of the ships will answer with their ordnance , and presently prepare to land . Matac . Matacoran Do as thou hast propos 'd , and with the least delay . Barclay enters the hut , then returns bearing a flag , ascends the cliff and waves it . A gun is fired from the ship ; Matacoran starts , Indians utter cries , and fly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and now , Englishman , hear me . The strangers , no doubt , will question thee as to the fate of thy comrades ; beware of thy speech in reply , lest they become alarm 'd at thy tale . Speak of the great King 's virtues and clemency ; how he sav 'd thy life , that thou might teach his people the arts of the white man ; and hath given thee lands and wives ; and how his favours have made thee forget that ever thou wert a native of countries beyond the sea . Barc . Barclay Since I have taken service with the great King , I have not much to complain of ; but all his favours , and his kingdom in the bargain , can never make me forget Old England , the land of my birth and affections ; and tho ' far distant from her , she is ever present to my sleeping and waking thoughts , while my heart , at sight of those vessels , yearns for the embrace of my countrymen . Surely , Prince Matacoran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favourite of his king , the friend of his country , must admire that patriotic feeling in another , which he himself possesses in no ordinary degree . ' T is one of the first of the virtues , and one of the last that will abandon the generous bosom . Matac . Matacoran You 're right ;  --  but if you English so love your own country , why cross the wide sea to deprive the poor Indian of his rude and savage forests ? But see , the smaller barques approach laden with the strangers ; hear me  --  look well to thyself . I must on to Weorocomoco , and report to the king . Be assur 'd of his favour , if thou prove faithful  --  but , if false , beware of his anger , for it is terrible . Barc . Barclay That , Prince , we can only judge of by imagination . No victims having ever surviv 'd , so as to be able to speak feelingly on that subject . Matac . Matacoran Look well to thyself , thou knowest Matacoran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value his friendship and protection ; and see , the spear of Matacoran is sharp . ( Exit Matacoran . ) Barc . Barclay Yes , and unsparing as ' t is keen . They come , my countrymen come ; I will retire , and observe them from a distance . ( Exit Barclay into the hut . ) Boats arrive with Smith , Percy , Rolfe , West , and Soldiers . Trumpet sounds  --  Smith draws his sword , and leaps ashore . Banner of Smith borne by Percy .  --  Three Turks ' heads on a field ; motto  --  Vincere est Vivere , Accordamus . Smith . Captain Smith God save the King ! Lieutenant , advance my banner  --  and now plant it deep , where nor force , nor fraud , shall ever root it out again . This goodly land , which the brave Raleigh nam 'd from the virgin Queen , we will possess for her successor , the royal James ; whom God preserve , and grant a long and prosperous reign over these fair realms . Welcome comrades , welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodly land it seemeth , but sadly deficient of inhabitants . We have only seen some fishers in light canoes , which at approach of our barques , and discharge of our ordnance , skimm 'd like dolphins o'er the waves , and soon vanish 'd from our sight . Rolfe . Master Rolfe It was surely no savage hand which hung the English pennon from the cliffs . Here seems to be a dwelling , and tho ' rude , is yet of better structure than the Indian native wigwam.  --  What ho ! there ! within . Enter Barclay .  --  R. H. Barc . Barclay Save ye , noble sirs . Smith . Captain Smith Thy tongue is English , but the freshness of health so mark 'd in the natives of Albion 's salubrious isle , is marvellously chang 'd in thy complexion , which is as tawney as a Morisco 's . How fares the world with thee , comrade ! wert thou of Weymouth 's or of Grenville 's crews ? Barc . Barclay Thou see'st , Sir Cavalier , the solitary remnant of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various times to settle and to perish in this inhospitable land . Mine is a tale of sorrow . Smith . Captain Smith Let it be a short one then ; for we have come not to mourn over past misfortunes , but to prevent future ones . To your tale . Barc . Barclay Soon after the departure of the ships , the colonists , divided amongst themselves , threw off all rule , and instead of fortifying the tower , and cultivating the soil , began to oppress and plunder the natives , who , in return , waylaid and slew them . The wily Powhattan , profiting by our disunions , and the weak state to which sickness had reduced us , surpris 'd and laid waste the settlement , ere a second harvest had ripen 'd for our use . I was alone preserv 'd by the influence of the powerful Prince Matacoran , the general and chief counsellor to the King . Smith . Captain Smith Thy tale is as sombre as thy visage . But come , thy condition shall be mended ; thou shalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . Thou canst materially aid us in our enterprise here , and the reward of thy fidelity shall be lands and privileges in this colony , which , trust me , profiting by the experience of those who have gone before us , we shall know how to conquer , aye , and to hold too ; or , if thou would'st rather seek thy guerdon in thy native land , thou shalt be recommended in our despatches to the royal James . Barc . Barclay My allegiance is due to my rightful sovereign , whom I will well and truly serve . But , Sir Cavalier , I am now old , and my long sojourn from my native land would make me a stranger and friendless there , while I have here much consideration from the grandees of the savage court . My children , altho ' the offspring of an aboriginal mother , are dear to me , and so may it please your gracious pleasure , I would prefer to end my days in Virginia . Smith . Captain Smith Be it so I understand thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain us what intelligence thou canst . Exit Barclay .  --  L. H. West . Master West I do not much like this renegado . Smith . Captain Smith By my faith , Master West , but we are of the condition of the host , who , having but one flaggon for the use of all his guests , must serve peer , and peasant alike ; now be our thirst for intelligence ever so great , we must drink from this renegado , our only cup . Percy . Percy The ruthless hand of Powhatan has indeed so lopp 'd the branches from the colonial tree , as to have left only this wasted and wither 'd stump . But let Esperance , the motto of the Percy , bear us out at every need . Rolfe . Master Rolfe From the tale of this renegade countryman of ours , I opine that in the King Powhatan we shall meet with a savage of no ordinary sort ; an ' he possess as much courage , as ' t is said he hath craft , he may prove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my part , having held warfare with wild Tartar and Hern , the savages of the Old World , I care not how soon I break a lance with his savage majesty of the New . But come , my masters , let 's to our muster , and prepare our array for the morrow 's pageant . ' T is fitting that we appear in our best harness , and that in its best burnish too , that we may strike upon the minds of the natives here , fair impressions of our might and grandeur . I pray of you , worthy sirs , that ye appear in all your braveries , for ye well know that first impressions are strongest , whether in love or warfare . Allons ! we will pitch our camp and array our forces , and to-morrow on to the savage court , where we will invest his heathen majesty with the crown and mantle sent to him by the Lord 's anointed ; then demand , in behalf of our gracious sovereign , dominion in and over the countries from the mountains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Dieu et mon droit  --  For God and our right . Exeunt omnes . SCENE II . The interior of the hut of Barclay .  --  Mantea mending a net . Enter Pocahontas and Omaya , with baskets of shells . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas The blessings of this fair morning upon you , Mantea , and good father Barclay . Do you know , that while with Omaya , gathering shells upon the beach , we heard a noise of thunder , and looking out upon the wide sea , we beheld those great canoes which bear the English , from one of which a white cloud arose ; it seem 'd as tho ' it contain 'd the spirit of sound , it floated awhile majestically in the air , and then dissolv 'd away ; and while we gaz 'd upon a spectacle so new and imposing , came to land the lesser canoes fill 'd with the gallant strangers . Oh , ' t was a rare sight to behold the chiefs as they leap 'd on shore , deck 'd in all their braveries ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of command , made them seem like beings from a higher world , sent here to amaze us with their glory . Mantea . Mantea The English , my princess , have indeed arriv 'd and Barclay has gone to join his countrymen , while I have been so lost in fear and wonder , as to remain without the power even to look abroad . Whether this coming may prove of ill or good to Virginia we shall soon determine . I fear we shall have sad times again . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Come good , come ill , Pocahontas will be the friend of the English . I know not how it is , but my attachments became fix 'd upon the strangers the first moment I beheld them . Barclay has told me much of his native isle , and I have listen 'd to his tale with all the admiration of a young untutor 'd mind . But now I can well believe all that I have heard of that fair land , when I see that it doth produce such noble creatures . Mantea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these strangers . Recollect you not , that your hand is destin 'd to reward Prince Matacoran for his exploits against the English in the late wars ? Powhatan so wills it . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Matacoran is the sworn enemy of the whites , and implacable in his hatred ; but sooner shall the sun cease to shine , and the waters to flow , than Pocahontas be the wife of Matacoran . Mantea . Mantea This powerful prince is the general and chief counsellor to the king , and first in his favor and affection , renown 'd in war , and wise in council . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Matacoran is brave , yet he lacks the best attribute of courage  --  mercy . Since the light of the Christian doctrine has shone on my before benighted soul , I have learn 'd that mercy is one of the attributes of the divinity I now adore . To good father Barclay I owe the knowledge which I have acquir 'd of the only true God , whose worship I in secret perform ; and rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would fly to the depths of the forests , and take up my abode with the panther . Enter Barclay and Namoutac . Barc . Barclay My princess  --  let me say my own good child , this poor hut is always made cheerful and happy by thy presence . Know you my companion ? Omaya . Omaya Ah ! it is , it is indeed Namoutac . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Thy love hath made thee sharp-sighted , girl ; thou hast the ' vantage of me . Barc . Barclay ' T is indeed Namoutac , tho ' scarcely to be recognized as the wild Indian boy who used to climb like a squirrel for birds nests , and dive in the rivers for shells . Namoutac can tell you much of his travels , and of the English who have just landed in Virginia . Omaya . Omaya Tell me , Namoutac , whether the English maidens wear their plumes as high as we do , and whether in painting they use most , the red or the yellow . Namou . Namoutac Indeed , girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full as lofty as ye do here , and they have quite as much red on their cheeks , tho ' the yellow is not admired . Barc . Barclay Can not you tell the princess somewhat of your adventures . Namou . Namoutac Were I to live to the age of Powhatan , I could not relate a thousandth part of the wonders I have seen , or the persons I have met with in that world of itself . Agreeably to the orders of my king , I commenc 'd notching a stick for every person I met , but soon threw it away in despair , as all the sticks in Virginia would not suffice to notch down the numbers in yon mighty realm . Omaya . Omaya Indeed , Namoutac , I do not think your travels abroad have much improv 'd your taste in dress ; I think you look 'd far handsomer when you were formerly plum 'd and painted among the young warriors in attendance on the king . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Do tell me truly , Indian , what effects have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Namou . Namoutac In good truth , lady , I can say , all which I have seen has impress 'd me with the most exalted ideas of the power and grandeur of a people , who are as gods are to men . Still amid all the splendours of the courts of Europe , I have never forgot my native land , but long 'd to re-visit even its poverty and nothingness ; while amid the pomp and pageantry of England , I sigh 'd for the sports of our rude forests , and the wild , free life of an Indian . I wish 'd to be away from the restraints of civiliz 'd society , to throw off the cumbrous dress which fetter 'd my limbs , and re-assume my primitive nakedness and liberty ; to enjoy the hunt and the dance , and again to become a son of Virginia . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas How call you the chiefs of the English lately arrived ? Namou . Namoutac The leader is Smith , a renown 'd chieftain in the three quarters of the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Werowance Northumberland , whose territory alone could produce more bowmen than the whole kingdom of Powhatan ; then Master West , related to the noble Lord de la War ; then Master Rolfe , of gentle blood , with others of lesser note . I must to the king . How my heart will throb as I revisit Weorocomoco and its well-remember 'd scenes , where the earliest and happiest days of my life have been pass 'd . Omaya . Omaya And so you have not forgot the Weorocomoco and the merry dances we us 'd to have there . I long to see you dress 'd and painted as becomes you ; for really Namoutac in these clothes you are hardly tolerable . Namou . Namoutac The sun shines for the last time upon Namoutac the English . It 's morning beams will cheer him while roaming in his native forests , seeking the favourite haunts of his youth , dress 'd in the garb of his country , his limbs will again become vigorous and elastic , he will be as swift as the deer of the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his plume ; such will soon be Namoutac the Indian . Namoutac the English , will be no more . Exit Namoutac . Barc . Barclay Behold the force of early habits , as exemplified in this young native . Princess , the strangers are bound to your father 's court , and soon as the presents are landed , will invest Powhatan with the regalia sent by the English monarch . It will be an imposing spectacle . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas But I must hasten to Weorocomoco , to prepare fitting entertainments for such noble guests . Omaya , we will take the near way path . Omaya . Omaya We shall soon overtake Namoutac , and then we will fly by him to shew our speed , while in his clumsy clothes he will come toiling after us . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Adieu , Mantea  --  adieu , good father Barclay  --  soon will I be here again ; for I am no where so happy as under this hospitable roof . Exit Pocahontas and Omaya . Barc . Barclay Come , Mantea , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This way ; be not alarm 'd . Exeunt both .  --  L. H. SCENE III . A Wood . Enter Rolfe . Rolfe . Master Rolfe I am completely lost amid the mazes of this interminable wood . My companions , intent on the pursuit of game , have left me to indulge in the contemplation of the sublime and beautiful , which is every where to be found in the wild and picturesque scenery of these interesting regions . What a vast and splendid park this savage king possesses here ; how insignificant appear our European pleasure grounds , where a few trees have been planted and train 'd by the hand of art , when compar 'd with these noble forests , planted by the hand of nature . Our pieces of water , too , as they are called , where a few small fishes are fed and fatten 'd to those magnificent rivers , which , rising in the mountains . traverse the country for some hundred miles , then rush with indescribable grandeur to the sea . And the contrast holds equally good with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tame stags lie lazily about the keeper 's lodge ; in the forests of Virginia , the wild buck arouses him from his leafy lair , flashes his bright eye indignant on his pursuers , and then bounds gracefully away over these interminable lawns . Verily , things are on a great scale in this New World . I will rest me awhile on this shady bank , till our hunter 's horn announces the conclusion of the chase . ( Reclines on a bank . ) Enter Pocahontas and Omaya . Omaya . Omaya Why , lady , you tire ; Namoutac can not be far before us . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Indeed , girl . I am not much us 'd to racing of late ; I would fain take breath awhile . Hereabouts is the shady bank and the old oak at which we us 'd to rest ; we will stop but for a moment , and then resume our chase of Namoutac . Come  --  ah ! ' t is occupied , and by a stranger . ( Discovers Rolfe . ) Rolfe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cheerfully relinquished , maidens , to your better use . ' T is a pleasant seat , and invites the weary to comfort and repose ; I pray you rest from your fatigue . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Thanks , courteous stranger ; altho ' our journey has been somewhat rapid , we have but little need of rest . Rolfe . Master Rolfe The duties of a Cavalier to your sex are the same whether in the Old World or the New ; I therefore pray ye accept my service . Say whither do ye roam thro ' these extensive forests ? Seek ye your friends , or is it in the mere wantonness of health and spirits attendant on the gay morning of life , that ye have come abroad to gather flowers in this wild garden of nature ? Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas We go , Sir Cavalier , to Weorocomoco , the abode of Powhatan , the sovereign of these countries ; where , if report speaks truth , we may soon expect the English . Rolfe . Master Rolfe I am greatly mistaken , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of the king , and the friend of Barclay . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Such is my name and character . Rolfe . Master Rolfe Again I tender my duteous service ; and tho ' I should be but a bad guide in the forest , yet I may afford ye protection on your way . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas The paths are well known to us whose feet so often traverse them , and ' ere the shadows of the trees are much more aslant , we shall reach the abode of Powhatan . Adieu , courteous stranger , at Weorocomoco , we shall meet again . Exeunt Pocahontas and Omaya.  --  L. H. Rolfe . Master Rolfe What gone ! why they have fitted away like the nimble fawns which start from the thicket to avoid the hunter 's aim . And see , they now hold on their light and rapid course , and are now hidden by the luxuriant foliage . How full of grace and courtesy is this princess  --  savage , should I say . By my faith , and such be the damsels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of our civilization when we appear before them . ( Horn sounds . ) Aha ! ' t is our wild gallants ; they have at length stricken the deer , and now blow a mort . Here they are . Enter Percy and West .  --  R. H. Percy . Percy Well , Master Rolfe , still given to meditation ! but if our eyes have not deceiv 'd us , thou art not solitary in thy musings  --  surely we saw something of the female form glide swiftly away , as tho ' alarmed at our coming . Perhaps some sylvan deity of these shades , who pitying thy forlorn and solitary state , came to amuse thee , and to sing wood notes wild , as a cure for thy melancholy . West . Master West Or rather say the driads of this wood , who finding him absorb 'd in dreamy musings on his absent love , came to console the hapless swain , and try if the tawney maidens of Virginia could not make him forget the fair dames of Europe . What say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my merry masters , I say that ye are bad woodsmen , and have shot wide of your mark ; an ' ye draw no better bow at the stag , your sorrow had as well remain 'd in its quiver . Percy . Percy We 'll guess no more . Master Rolfe , but are all attention to your story . Rolfe . Master Rolfe Well , you must know , that while resting on this bank , and listening for echoes from your horn , came tripping by no less a personage than the Princess Pocahonias , and a light-footed damsel , her hand-maiden , and after a few words of fair and courteous speech , they vanish 'd like fairies from a moon beam . Percy . Percy And so , Sir Knight of the Wood , a fair princess has form 'd thy adventure ; but , if I mistake not , thou wilt yet have to win by sword and lance , and not by soft and gentle dalliance of words . Our valiant captain doubts the sincerity of the friendship with which we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our arms . Now his experience of Turk , Tartar , and Hun , will make him keep a wary eye upon the proceedings of his savage majesty here , and at all events be prepar 'd for the worst . West . Master West Master Rolfe looks grave . My broider 'd doublet to a carman 's frock , but he is in love with this dark princess . Percy . Percy A match , I say , between Master Rolfe , and the tawney daughter of Virginia . West . Master West Agreed , agreed . Rolfe . Master Rolfe My meeting with the damsel was purely accidental ; still let me say , that tho ' of dark complexion , she is well favour 'd both in form and feature , of admir 'd carriage , courteous and discreet in discourse . West . Master West Excellently well describ 'd . A match , a match , I say : but hark'ee , Master Rolfe , an ' ye succeed your father-in-law Powhatan , who they say is well-stricken in years , and become king of these rearms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your master of the horse . Rolfe . Master Rolfe Well , my merry masters , here 's a hand to each of you , and right royally I swear , to grant all your wishes , and a thousand largesses beside , so soon as I wed the princess , succeed Powhatan , and become sovereign lord of these realms . The day I mount the throne of Paumunkee , thou , Master West , shalt mount the horse of state , thou Master Percy , the viceregal seat in the government of the gold mountains ; while our valiant captain , as commander of the forces , will march to the conquest of the Monecans , and tribes far westward toward the setting sun . Now , my bon comerados and merry wags , having dispos 'd of the gifts of royalty , I become plain Master Rolfe again , and propose that we burnish our harness for the morning 's pageant , as it is fitting we appear in proper knightly array where a princess is to be won . Lieutenant we wait thy leading . Percy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squires , know better our places than to precede the heir presumptive to a throne . Rolfe . Master Rolfe What ! at your waggeries again  --  well , ye shall be pleasur 'd . Allons , my noble vassals , allons . Exeunt omnes . ACT II . SCENE I. The palace of Powhatan at Weorocomoco . Powhatan seated on a throne which is covered with bear skins . Powhatan wearing a coronet of feathers , and a robe of skins , a spear in his hand ; on his right the Princess , on his left Omaya , with fans of feathers , double rows of guards with spears , bows and arrows . Enter Matacoran . Mata . Matacoran The English have arriv 'd ; is it the great King 's pleasure the strangers be brought before him ? Powha . Powhatan Bring they the presents ? Mata . Matacoran They do , great King . Powha . Powhatan And their guns ? Mata . Matacoran They have weighty guns in their boats , such as ten of the strongest of our warriors could not lift . Powha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matacoran They say these great pieces are brought to give salvos of welcome at thy coronation , such as is due at the coronation of a king . Powha .

Powha . Powhatan English ye are welcome to the dominions of Powhatan  --  welcome . Smith .

I also am a king : this is my land you must come to me , not I to you . Yet , Captain Smith many do inform me that your coming hither is to invade my people and possess my country . We fear your arms now lay them aside for they are useless in times of peace . Smith . Captain Smith Great King , thou art falsely inform 'd : we came not only to be friendly with thee , but to aid thee with our arms in thy wars with the Monecans . Powha . Powhatan It suiteth not with my greatness to have foreign aid in my wars . Captain Smith ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my people for three generations . I know the difference between peace and war better than any one in my country . I am old , and soon must die . This tale , that thou art come to destroy my country with thy arms , troubleth me , and affrighteth my people . What can ye gain by war , when we can fly to the woods , whereby ye must perish for want of food . Think ye that Powhatan is so simple as not to know that it is better to eat good meat , laugh , and receive presents from you , than to live in the woods , eat acorns , and be hunted by you , that if a twig break every one cryeth , there cometh Captain Smith ! thus ending my miserable life , and leaving my pleasures to you . Be assur 'd of our love , and come not with guns and swords , as if to invade your foes . Smith . Captain Smith King !  --  our arms are a part of our apparel ; had we intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent us ? View kindly as friends those who would be terrible to thee as foes . Powha . Powhatan Well , Captain Smith , ye are a great Werowance ; we will be kind to thee , and accept thy presents . But come , my favourite daughter hath entertainment for thee in a dance .  --  Come , the dance , I say , the dance . Smith , Percy , Rolfe , and West , are placed on stools in the centre of the stage .  --  Suddenly come dancing in from each side Indian girls with bows and arrows , then youths with spears ; they present the weapons us if to slay them , retire , and bring in pine branches , which they hold over the English in form of a canopy . The English rise , the dancers form in two lines , the King , having Pocahantas and Omaya on each side of him , leads the way , the English follow ; the Indians holding the pine branches over the train . Exeunt all but Matacoran , who , during these ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sternly on . He comes forward . Mata . Matacoran And lick we feet which soon will trample us in the dust , fold we to our bosoms those serpents which will soon entangle us in their coils , and then-sting us to the death . Why this idle pageantry of crowning him a king , who is a king already ! The coming of these pallid strangers bodes no good . Matacoran despises their friendship and disdains their gifts ; and swears , by the heroic fame of his fathers , eternal enmity to the invader , and devoted fidelity to his king and country . Exit Matacoran . SCENE II . Interior of Barclay 's hut . Enter Mantea and Rolfe.  --  R. H. Mantea . Mantea Be seated , good sir ; rest thee awhile , and such hospitality as this poor hut can afford , shall ever be at the service of Barclay 's countrymen . Rolfe . Master Rolfe Thank thee , good dame . I left thy husband but a little while ago . I came to expedite the landing of the stores and presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omaya . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Mother , I have hasten 'd to tell thee how we receiv 'd the noble strangers . ( Sees Rolfe . ) Ha ! the handsome Cavalier ! Rolfe . Master Rolfe Lady , you have made the English for ever your debtors , by the kind and flattering manner in which you receiv 'd them . Of a truth , we were all most happy and content while at Weorocomoco . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Our means were small compar 'd to the quality of our guests ; yet , such as they were , most freely offer 'd , and we hope most pleasingly receiv 'd . Rolfe . Master Rolfe May we not hope , Lady , that thou wilt not always bury thy rare qualities in these wilds ; thou should'st to England , where many will approve thy visit , and thou find much to admire . Omaya . Omaya Oh do , dear Lady ; we shall be so delighted . Namoutac has told us of the royal court , and of the great ladies there , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our king 's palace , and so laden with braveries that pages are employ 'd to carry them . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas I fear that a Virginian female would be but a poor personage where there is so much show and grandeur . Rolfe . Master Rolfe Pardon me , lady , thy worth and dignity will not be obscur 'd , even by the state and splendour of the English court ; the one is the genuine adornment of nature , the other the mere effect of art . An ' ye will go , I could hope to be your squire ; and trust me , lady , the kindness which you have shewn to my countrymen will be remember 'd to thee in England . Omaya . Omaya Oh , do , dear lady , go ; and we will carry with us our best plumes , and good store of red paint ; and when my lady is deck 'd in her armlets and blue beads , she will appear as royally as the best of them . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Good girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while thy long and faithful attachment to me , makes it sure , that if I go abroad , thou shalt accompany me . Omaya . Omaya Thank'ee , thankee , dear lady ; and when we come back , I shall take care to show Namoutac what it is to have travell 'd  --  I shall indeed . Enter an Indian , with fruit . Indian . Indian Barclay bade me give this fruit to an English Cavalier I should find here . He begs you will look to its seed immediately ; it hath a rare seed , and ye 'll find it worthy of your notice . Rolfe . Master Rolfe ( Opens the fruit and discovers a billet . ) Aha ! something in the wind . ( Aside. )  --  Indian , I find indeed it is a most pleasant fruit , and of a winning flavour ; tell Barclay the seed will be well car 'd for .  --  Away . Exit Indian . Rolfe . Master Rolfe ( Reads . ) " A panther lurks near the great oak , and will molest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard her on her way . "  --  How 's this , the princess menac 'd ; treachery abroad ! her safety be my care . Lady , it behoves thee to return to Weorocomoco without delay , but as a panther has been seen near the great oak , I will guard thee on thy way in safety to thy father 's palace . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Nay , good Sir Cavalier , we will not intrude so much upon thy courtesy . We have often tarried at the great oak , sometimes to enjoy the shade of its spreading branches , sometimes to shelter in its ample hollow from the summer shower , yet have we never seen beast other than the pretty deer that graze in the forest , or the nimble squirrel , leaping from tree to tree , chattering to its mates . Rolfe . Master Rolfe Not only duty and honour , but a warmer impulse , bids me be thy protector . I long to prove my sincerity : let 's away  --  an ' the panther spring , I will defend my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pocahontas , Omaya , and Rolfe . Mantea . Mantea The good Spirit guard them in safety .

Mantea Gone , and the cavalier gone with her . Barc . Barclay Heaven be prais 'd , then all is well . Hear me , Mantea  --  I have just discover 'd a horrible conspiracy to surprise and murder my countrymen ; and the Indians knowing the attachment of the princess to the English , have caus 'd Namoutac to lie in ambush at the oak , to seize the amiable girl and bear-her off , till the conspiracy is completed . Happily my billet has been read and understood , and the brave Cavalier will , I trust , defeat the plan , and protect the dear child from harm . Be secret on your life . Mant . Mantea Return yo to Weorocomoco to give the alarm to the English ? Barc . Barclay I dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd me to remain here in chargeof the presents ; altho ' no one would steal them , for they consist of a grindstone , of which the Indians know not the use , and two demiculverins , which twenty could not carry away . I have had no means of communication with my countrymen but by the billet  --  Heaven send them a safe deliverance . Mant . Mantea I think I have discover 'd that the princess and Cavalier are not indifferent to each other . Barc . Barclay ' T is well ; but let woman alone , whether savage or civiliz 'd , for finding out the secrets of her sex . Hear me , Mantea , be silent , be secret , if it is in the nature of a woman to keep a secret ; your life , your husband 's life , your children 's lives depend upon your prudence in the matter of this conspiracy . Come , take up the nets , and let 's to our fishing ; we must appear as if nothing had happen 'd a little while  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A wood , within which is a temple of matting and poles  --  an image of the Okee , or God  --  a Priest prostrate before it . Enter Powhatan . Powha . Powhatan Now , priest  --  what says Okee ; is he propitious ? Priest . Priest Great king , the god will indulge thy prayer , but demands a heavy sacrifice . Powha . Powhatan Well , fifteen youths , I suppose , will content the Okee . Priest . Priest Fifteen , my king ! Okee demands an hundred . Powha . Powhatan Enormous ! Why at that rate , I shall soon have none to offer ; my kingdom will be depopulated . Go , try if he will not be content with fifty . Priest . Priest I dare not provoke the god , he will not be question 'd a second time . Powha . Powhatan An hundred ! I never gave more than fifty in all my wars . Priest . Priest Thy wars were with Monocans  --  the English are not Monecans . Powha . Powhatan If I give an hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , priest ? Priest . Priest The entire discomfiture of all thy enemies . Powha . Powhatan But their guns  --  ? Priest . Priest Will become harmless as blunted arrows  --  their lightnings may flash , their thunders roll , but they will be no more than the rumbling and glare from the summer cloud , where no bolt descends to shiver the pine . Powha . Powhatan Ensure me the head of Captain Smith , and the hundred is granted . Go , select the youths , array them in their white vestments , our affairs admit of no delay . Priest . Priest All thy enemies shall be in thy power  --  so the god has promis 'd . Exit Priest . Powha . Powhatan But a little while , and these proud invaders will share the fate of their countrymen . They have brought me a crown , ' t were better to have been an hoe or a hatchet . They ask the lands from the mountains to the sea ; but will they be content with part , when their object is to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manner is that of command  --  and then their dreadful fire arms .

The great Oak in the centre  --  a hollow in its side . Enter Rolfe . Rolfe . Master Rolfe I have preceded my charge that I may reconnoitre the enemy , and see if the coast be clear . This is the spot alluded to in Barclay 's billet . What a giant of the forest is here ! Centuries have witness 'd its growth , centuries have witness 'd its prime , and centuries will elapse ere its final decay  --  within its vast hollow , a cavalier , arm 'd cap-a-pie , with lance in rest , might caraoole a steed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear footsteps approaching ; I will take ' vantage of the cover this mighty tree affords , and form my ambuscade .

Namoutac Hide ye in the adjoining thickets , and when ye shall hear my whoop , rush forth , seize the princess and Omaya , and bear them to the canoes , which shall convey them to Pawmunkee.  --  Down , down , they are coming . ( Indians hide . ) Enter Pocahontas and Omaya . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Here is the great oak . Omaya . Omaya And nothing seems to disturb the stillness of the scene , save the birds , which sing in joyous melody , and the playful squirrel , which pursues his gambols amid the limbs of this aged father of the forest . All is peace , and sure no cruel animal lurks hereabout to destroy two such harmless beings as we are . Whoop heard . Namoutac and Indians rush forth to seize Pocahontas and Omaya  --  at the same moment Rolfe comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Namou . Namoutac Aha ! Sir Cavalier , is it thou ? why you have really spoil 'd a pleasant frolic . Rolfe . Master Rolfe Villain ! confess thy treachery , or you die . ( Presents a pistol . ) Namou . Namoutac A love affair , Master Rolfe , nothing more . I wish 'd to surprize the damsels , and bear off Omaya , after the manner of love affairs , of which I have heard report in thy country ; nothing more , Master Rolfe  --  nothing more . Rolfe . Master Rolfe Rascal , in my country where love affairs are conducted by treachery and outrage to the female parties , they end in the death of the traitors . Now you have play 'd your part in this love affair , I shall play mine by shooting you thro ' the head . ( Presenting a pistol . ) Omaya . Omaya Oh , good Sir Cavalier , do spare poor Namoutac ; his travels have turn 'd his brain  --  he would not have behav 'd so when he was only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you next propose to alarm an innocent female , beware lest you find an English cavalier for her protector . ( Exit Namoutac. )  --  Thy guileless heart , my princess , knows not yet of the ways of treachery and deceit . This alarming affair happily ended , let us proceed . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Whatever may have been the intentions of those who surpris 'd us , thy gallant deliverance claims our gratitude and regards . Rolfe . Master Rolfe A regard , dear lady , which I hope will be mutually increas 'd on our further acquaintance . Yet speak not so favourably of a service which every cavalier is bound to render to thy sex . Come , let 's on with our journey ; and the gentle fawn of Virginia need fear no panther when the lion of England doth guard her on her way . Exeunt .  --  R. H. SCENE V. Wood . Distant view of Weorocomoco . Enter Matacoran and Selictaz . Mata . Matacoran Go , Selictaz , to all the tribes friendly to Powhatan , bid them muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounty at the hands of the king , and great rewards in the spoils of the English . Selictaz . Selictaz I go , my prince , but opine they will come in but tardily , the tribes do so much fear the arms of the English . Matac . Matacoran Bid them not fear those noisy weapons ; the thunder rolls not always , and in its pauses our arrows will enter our enemies ' bosoms , and our spears strike home . Tempt their avarice , Selictaz , by saying much of the riches of the strangers ; say the king will relieve his people from the burthens lately impos 'd  --  say every thing to induce the distant tribes to give their aid in driving these accurs 'd English into the sea . Selictaz . Selictaz You shall be obey 'd ; and I hope to return with many of these fierce and hardy warriors . Matac . Matacoran Yet stay , thou can'st not well be spar 'd ; we shall have need of thee in a daring enterprize that will be this night attempted . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee ; and say further , that Matacoran will lead in the war , and uphold the fame and manhood of the Indian .  --  Go . Exit Selictaz . Enter an Indian .  --  L. H. Indian . Indian The king awaits thee near the ancient tomb . Matac . Matacoran I come Exit Indian .  --  L. H. All now is prepar 'd , an ' if Powhatan do not shrink from the trial our success is certain ; and from the fate of Smith and his comrades these pallid adventurers will learn in future better to respect the courage and ability of the Indian , than with a few score of followers to expect to overcome and conquer a country inhabited by thousands of warlike men . The accepted moment is at hand , and ere another sun shall rise to cheer with its beams the too confident English , the spear of Matacoran will have drank deeply of their blood , or Matacoran be gather 'd to his fathers , to enjoy the happiness reserv 'd for the brave . Exit Matacoran . SCENE VI . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tomb , in large letters there on , Madoc. 1170 . Enter Pocahontas . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas ' T is superstitious awe gives privacy to this tomb , erected by the first conquerors of this country , and suppos 'd to contain the ashes of Madoc , their chief . What could have caus 'd Namoutac to lie in wait with arm 'd men to surprise us in the wood , when but for the brave Cavalier , what might not have been our fate ? All is not well .  --  Ah ! here comes the king , and with him Matacoran ; they are in deep conference , and seek this secluded spot to hold their councils . Could I but learn the subject of their debate , it might throw much light upon late events . Time was , I should have fear 'd to enter this sepulchre , but since the light of true faith dispell 'd the first darkness of my mind , this solemn place with all its wild tales have no terrors for me . The prince being engag 'd in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will retire into the tomb , and may learn that which will enable me to protect him who so late protected me . ( Pocahontas goes into the tomb . ) Enter Powhatan and Matacoran . Powhat . Powhatan To-night say'st thou ? and the plan so well arrang 'd that the English can not escape . I have order 'd the sacrifice of an hundred youths to the god ; Okee would not for less ensure me the destruction of my enemies , the possession of their riches , and the heads of their chiefs . Matac . Matacoran ' T is well to sacrifice to the gods ; but , believe me , king , the gods of the English are as much superior to our gods , as their guns are superior to our bows and arrows . But if we can not succeed by open force , we must resort to stratagem . Hear my plan . The feasts of the coronation being over , the English will return to the vicinity of their ships . I have selected for their guide Selictaz , who will conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river ; there supplied with good victuals , they will feast and carouse , for not like we do the English prepare for war , by fasting and hardihood ; they are a people who have much regard for the belly , and after eating they will sleep ; then , my king , we will approach and pin them to the soil they so greedily covet . Powhat . Powhatan A good plan ; but keep they no watch to alarm the sleepers of danger ? Matac . Matacoran Barclay has told me , that English warriors guard their camp by a charm 'd word , which , if spoken by a foe , makes that foe a friend . Now Selictaz is directed to obtain that charm 'd word , which is always given out when the guard is set . That obtain 'd , we proceed secure to the work of death . Powhat . Powhatan Brave and wise Matacoran , success to thee ; and the English once destroy 'd , name thy reward ; a still greater Werowance shalt thou be , and rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the head of Captain Smith , and thou shalt be second only to the king . Matac . Matacoran Since first I enter 'd the ranks of men , I have been in the service of my country ; how faithfully , how daringly I have serv 'd her , the renown of thy arms , O ! king , will best declare . Yet of all the spoils of war , what hath been the share of Matacoran ? None  --  for Matacoran fought not for wealth , but for glory and Pocahontas . Now he must fight for glory and his country . Powhat . Powhatan Nay , my prince , be of good heart ; the girl is young and knows not thy worth . Drive but the English from my shores , and the choicest of my gifts and my beloved daughter , shall be thy reward .  --  I swear it . Matac . Matacoran No  --  as an unwilling bride I would not receive even Pocahontas to my arms . She has seen the strangers . and no longer looks upon an Indian warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Matacoran must have done with love . Glory and his country must return and possess his soul . Talk not of reward , king ; thou hast often seen me return from the combat cover 'd with mine own and my enemy 's blood  --  say , did Matacoran ever ask reward ? Tho ' he hath added country to thy kingdom , and led many captives to thy feet , one boon alone he crav 'd and ' t was her whose image nerv 'd his arm in battle , and sooth 'd the agonies of his many wounds  --  her who inspir 'd the generous passion which bloom 'd in his boyhood , and ripen 'd in the man . Powhat . Powhatan Your long and constant attachment deserves the possession of its object . Poahontas shall be thine .  --  Again I swear it . Matac . Matacoran While I now bid adieu to a hopeless passion , the remembrance of once happy days clings in fondest twinings around my heart , and soothes me , as the mild radiance-of twilight continues to shed its comforts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gay morning of life I sought renown in all the manly games , that my brow might receive the wreath from the hand of Pocahontas . How oft have I launched my light canoe , when the angry waves had driven our boldest fishers to the land , and drenched with the spray , have gain 'd the distant shore to procure rare shells for the armlets of her I lov 'd . How oft have I plung 'd into the depths of the forests , and pierc 'd with my arrows the bird of many dyes , that with its beauteous feathers I might plume the coronet of Pocahontas . Aye , I have dar 'd death in an hundred battles , that , when returning victorious , Pocahontas might hail me with honour to the brave . Powhat . Powhatan My good and gallant prince I swear my daughter shall  --  Matac . Matacoran Enough , enough  --  ' t is the expiring struggle of love .

Powhatan How brave and noble is this prince ! and then that silly girl of mine to reject his love , and place her affections upon these pale-fac 'd strangers . But Namoutac has by this time remov 'd her afar , till the English are destroy 'd , and Matacoran returns victorious to claim her as his bride . This night , this eventful night , Powhatan , old king , thou hast need of all thy craft and energy , or soon thy white head will no longer wear the crown so lately plac 'd upon it . The sun which rises to-morrow will either behold thee a victorious king , or a humbled prisoner . Exit Powhatan . Pocahontas comes from the tomb . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas What have I heard ! treachery and massacre against those whom they so lately receiv 'd with every shew of hospitality and kindness . And Matacoran  --  he the brave and noble  --  and the reward of his achievement to be the hand of Pocahontas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be unmix 'd with treachery . Namoutac 's conduct is explain 'd . What is to be done ? Can I fly to the English whom Selictaz leads on to sacrifice . The bands of Matacoran beset the path on every side ; the river is the only hope . ( A flash of lightning . ) Ha ! a storm is brewing , and how will these little hands , us 'd only to guide the canoe in sportive race on a smooth and glassy surface , wage its struggling way , when raging billows uprear their foamy crests . Brave English , gallant , courteous Rolfe . ( Thunder . ) Night comes on apace  --  Oh , night of horror !

Surely thou hast held some revelry to-night , and supposing that we poor soldiers are but illy content , have tripp 'd down with thy light-footed damsels , and will again surprize us with a masquerade .

( Discharge of musketry heard  --  two Indians fall dead , the rest fly in disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! cowards , your general 's curse , the curse of your king and country attend your flight . What remains now to face the foe , nought but despair and Matacoran . English enter and attack Matacoran , who defends himself bravely  --  he is beaten down on one knee . Hugo enter and covers him with his buckler . Hugo . Hugo de Redmond Spare , comrades , spare the prince ; ' t is your father Hugo commands ye . ( English desist . Matacoran rises . ) Brave , generous chief , the fortune of war is against thee , but thy courage demands esteem from thy enemies . Matac . Matacoran I have fought to the last , courted death , and hop 'd to fall with my falling country . Hugo . Hugo de Redmond Prince , I now claim my old arms , and am happy that the act of their redemption has been in saving the life of a gallant enemy . Matac . Matacoran ( Giving up sword and buckler . ) There ! in my hands they have been unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redmond When I was thy prisoner , thou said'st that a brave man should never be without arms , restor 'd to me a part of mine ; I admir 'd thy courtesy then , and now offer thee in return a sword just flesh 'd in this its maiden battle . Look , Prince , when old Hugo 's wars are ended , and his last peace made , it will remind thee that honour and generosity could dwell in the bosom of so humble a being as a poor English man-at-arms . Matac . Matacoran Good old warrior , I accept thy gift , tho ' it comes too late ; for Matacoran has fought the last of his country 's battles . Thy countrymen I can never love ; but honour bids me say , they have about them much to admire . Lead on , lead your prisoner to your chief . Exeunt all . SCENE IV . Interior of Barclay 's hut . Enter Barclay  --  R. H.  --  meeting Mantea  --  L. H. Mantea . Mantea Hath the thunder ceas 'd  --  how fares the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pines . Three wounded English are just brought down to be embark 'd  --  they report that our leader , the valiant Smith , is taken and carried to Weorocomoco . It seems impossible to believe it . Mantea . Mantea Oh ! sad , sad day for us all . Barc . Barclay Do not so soon despond  --  tho ' a leader be slain , English soldiers are not long without another . The brave Percy may by this time have restor 'd the day . The daring valour of Smith led him too far in pursuit of the flying enemy , when slipping from a bank into the river , he was overpower 'd by numbers , and the hero , before whom hundreds had fled , was taken and carried captive to Powhatan. ( knocking at the door . ) Be still , on your life . Who 's there ?  --  ( without . ) Mowbray ! ( Barclay opens the door . ) Enter Mowbray . Barc . Barclay My dear friend and countryman , what news , what news ? Mowb . Mowbray Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallant Percy . Barc . Barclay And our leader  --  but I can see by thy looks  --  taken , Smith taken ? Mowb . Mowbray ' T is even so . His chivalric courage bore him head-long on the foe , when tired with slaying them , accident threw him into the water , where the weight of his armour , and the numbers who press 'd upon him , render 'd resistance vain , and he was borne off on the shoulders of the Indians . Barc . Barclay I trust the captain made his peace with God before the battle , for Powhatan allows his prisoners no time for prayer ; and ere this the gallant soul of Smith is join 'd to the souls of those made perfect in another and a better world . Mowb . Mowbray Let 's still indulge a hope . Percy , Rolfe , and West , learning the fate of their leader , furiously charg 'd the Indians sword in hand , routed , and pursued them towards the savage capital . Amid the route and carnage , one Indian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lion , disdaining to fly , till old Hugo'de Redmond , the father of our men , rush 'd to the rescue , cover 'd the chief with his buckler , bidding the soldiers spare so gallant an enemy . By this act of generosity calling forth shouts of admiration from our ranks . Barc . Barclay And the Prince  --  the brave , the stern Matacoran . Mowb . Mowbray Despoil 'd of his arms , he is led in chains , an hostage for the safety of the valiant Smith ; ' ere this our troops have reach 'd the savage capital , the soldiers rending the air with cries for their ador 'd commander . Barc . Barclay Come , Mantea , let 's on to Weorocomoco . An ' our leader lives , Virginia is ours . Mowb . Mowbray Aye , Virginia will be ours  --  Victory and Virginia ! Exeunt . SCENE V. The palace of Powhatan . Guards . &c.; Enter Powhatan , meeting Pocahontas and Omaya . Powha . Powhatan A strange tale this I hear of Namoutac and the Cavalier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserv 'd to be shot for his idle frolic . But , girl , something of greater moment claims attention . How comes it that ye continue to refuse the Prince as thy husband , the pride of my kingdom , the favourite of its king ? Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas I love not Matacoran , my affections are plac 'd on another . Powha . Powhatan Hear me , girl ! the Prince is now engaged in combat with the English , whom he expects to destroy or drive from Virginia . An ' he perform either of which good services thou shalt be his reward  --  aye , the bride of Matacoran . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas An ' the Prince conquer the English , he will find better reward in their spoils , than in me , an unloving wife . Powha . Powhatan He asks not reward , nay , refuses even thy ungrateful self ; but I have sworn , yea , solemnly sworn , thou shalt be his , so prepare yourself to obey my will . Enter Selictaz , in great haste . Powha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Prince ? how goes the battle ? speak , if thou canst gather as much breath . An ' thy news be great as thy haste , ' twill be worth relating . Selictaz . Selictaz Great King ! Smith ! the leader Smith  --  ( panting . ) Powha . Powhatan Well  --  Smith is not near Weorocomoco , I hope ! Selictaz . Selictaz Aye , great King , very near . Powha . Powhatan ( alarmed . ) Guards there ! say quickly thy say  --  Selictaz . Selictaz Smith is a prisoner , and will be here anon . Powha . Powhatan Ha ! prisoner ! Smith a prisoner ! and alive ! Smith a prisoner ! Selictaz . Selictaz ' T is even so  --  Smith is thy prisoner , and alive . Powha . Powhatan Far beyond my hopes , thanks to the gods , and the brave Matacoran . Aha ! girl , what say'st thou now to thy darling English , thy valiant Smith . Aha ! wilt thou not now be the bride of Matacoran , the victorious Matacoran . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victor of the world . Powhat . Powhatan Oh ! joy , joy ; say , Selictaz , how long before the remaining English are brought captives to my feet . Selictaz . Selictaz That , King , is a very doubtful matter ; for tho ' the leader is taken , the battle doth not abate . In truth , my King , there seemeth to be many Smiths in the field ; they fight as tho ' they were all Smiths . Powha . Powhatan How fares the Prince ? Selictaz . Selictaz I left him at his wonted place , the thickest of the battle . ( a yell . ) But hark , I hear the Indians who bear the captive Smith on their shoulders to make the greater haste to thy presence . Shall I usher them in ? Powha . Powhatan Wait yet a moment , while I ascend my throne , and put on the crown and mantle , that I may receive the prisoner in the royalty of his own making . Come girl , take thy place at any side  --  take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , father , I 'm not us 'd to such sights . I am not well . Powha . Powhatan Thou wilt be well when the English are destroy 'd . Take thy place . Pocahontas and Omaya take their places on the throne . Powhatan ascends and seats himself on the throne . Powha . Powhatan Now bring the captive to my feet . Take with thee my guard , Selictaz , lest he may escape . Selictaz and guard go out and return with Smith , his clothes stained and in disorder , his plumes broken . Indians bearing his arms . Powha . Powhatan Thou'rt welcome , Captain Smith , tho ' thou now com'st with not quite so gallant a train as when thou last did deign to visit my poor house . Smith . Captain Smith My train will be here anon . Powha . Powhatan Aye , as captives like thyself . Smith . Captain Smith No ! but as conquerors , to plant my banner in victory on the throne where thou now sittest . Powha . Powhatan How ! and their leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Percy does battle in my stead ; and were he to fall , I would say , as old King Hal said of the Percy who fell at Chevy Chase , good he was , but thank God I 've many as goods as he . Powha . Powhatan Captain Smith , the king admires thy boldness . What would'st thou give for thy ransom ? No doubt all the rich lading of thy barques ; but then , Captain Smith , I would not set thee at liberty ; for my people would fear thee , tho ' thou wert in chains . Smith . Captain Smith Not a rusty nail would I give for ransom . I tell thee again , old fool , ' t is not thee but we are the conquerors in this fray  --  that my banner , borne on the wings of victory , will soon be planted on thy throne  --  my war cry be heard in thy palace , and the royal James be sovereign of Virginia . Powha . Powhatan Bold man , thou speak'st as tho ' thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Smith Accident overcame me ; give me again but my sword and buckler , and see with what ease I 'll out my way thro ' thy guards  --  aye , and with their king to command them . Powha . Powhatan ' T is too much  --  thou shalt die , and that forthwith . Smith . Captain Smith ' T is well . Powha . Powhatan Yet the king is merciful  --  is there aught thou would wish to say ere the blow fall . ( a noise of musketry at a distance . ) Hah ! thy moments are few . Executioners bring forth the stone of sacrifice ; and hark'ee , see that ye provide your heaviest clubs ; and their heads be as hard as their hearts , ye will need your heaviest weapons . Executioners bring in the stone , and poise their clubs , as if prepared for sacrifice . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Oh ! father ! shew mercy to the brave unfortunate . Omaya . Omaya Spare , oh ! king , the noble prisoner ! Powha . Powhatan Silence both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till thou can'st hear more of the battle  --  spare , spare the gallant Smith , thy daughter , thy favourite ' t is who implores thee . Powha . Powhatan Hah ! thy tone is chang 'd . The prisoner shall die , and that anon . Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Only till one other messenger arrives . Mercy . mercy . Powha . Powhatan Guards ! take these silly girls away . Guards remove Pocahontas and Omaya to the rear of the throne  --  guarding them there . Powha . Powhatan Captain Smith if you have aught to say , be brief , for thine hour is come . Smith . Captain Smith Thanks for thy savage courtesy . Hear me . When the blow is struck , and Smith ceases to live , but in his fame , do with my senseless corse as thou listeth ; thou wilt find upon it many scars of honourable service . It matters not , whether it shall gorge the maws of thy cannibals , or be urn 'd in marble , to await the slower progress of the worm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be by him embalm 'd , and convey 'd to England . That England , for whose glory it did so truly beat in life , will give it place amid the cemeteries of her illustrious dead . Powha . Powhatan It shall be done , the king is merciful . Smith . Captain Smith Plant my banner on my grave , the three Turks ' heads , the cognizance of my achievement on the plains of Transylvania , that when the chivalry of Europe shall hereafter pass that way , they may lower pennon and lance in memory of Smith . Powha . Powhatan The king admires thy warlike fame ; that too shall be done . Smith . Captain Smith Give my gold chain to thy admirable daughter ; it was given me by Charitza , the most peerless lady of the Old World , and I now bestow it on Pocahontas , the most peerless of the New . I have done , proceed in thy bloody work . ( Noise of musketry nearer than before . ) Ah , ' t is the glorious sounds of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percy , good lieutenant , spare thy shot , and on them with sword and target . See my pennon , how gaily it flies above the smoke  --  look on it my veterans , and it will remind you of your lost commander . Hah ! they fly ! now , Percy , press them home . Give them not time to rally  --  well done . Now , comrades , shout my war cry in their despairing ears  --  Victory and Virginia ! aye , victory and Virginia . Smith exhausted sinks into the arms of the Indians , who bind him , and lay his head on the stone of sacrifice . Selictaz . Selictaz ( hastily , and in affright . ) From the height , O king , I beheld our army flying before the English like unto a herd of frighten 'd deer , while the smoke from the enemy 's guns can plainly be perceiv 'd as it curls amongst the tops of the loftiest pines . Powha . Powhatan Take with thee my chosen guard , and fly to the succour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Powha . Powhatan Executioners , I shall wave my fan of feathers thrice , and then cry strike . When you hear that word , let fall your weapons and with all thy force . Now attend  --  once , twice  --  ( Waves the fan of feathers , Pocahontas breaks from her guard , and rushes to the feet of the king . ) Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas King  --  father , if ever thy poor child found favour in thy sight , spare , O spare the noble prisoner ; ' t is Pocahontas , thy darling who intreats thee  --  her , whom from infancy thou hast cherished in thy bosom . Spare , spare ; here will I embrace thy feet , till thou shalt forget the king , and once again be the father . Powha . Powhatan Away girl  --  away . ( Noise of musketry still nearer . ) Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas Hark ! hear you not those dreadful arms ; think that ere long thou may have to ask that mercy thou now deny'st  --  Spare . Powha . Powhatan Hah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fan . ) The word alone remains  --  attend . ( Executioners raise their clubs ) Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas ( rising with dignity . ) Attend , but first to me . Cruel king , the ties of blood which bound me to thee are dissever 'd , as have been long those of thy sanguinary religion ; for know that I have abjur 'd thy senseless gods , and now worship the Supreme Being , the true Manitou , and the Father of the Universe ; ' t is his Almighty hand that sustains me , ' t is his divine spirit that breathes in my soul , and prompts Pocahontas to a deed which future ages will admire . She rushes down from the throne , throws herself on the body of Smith , raises her arms , and calls to the executioners to " Strike ; " they drop their weapons . Powhatan descends , raises up and embraces his daughter . Powha . Powhatan I am subdued , unbind the prisoner . My child . my child . Smith is unbound , and kneels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percy , Rolfe , West , and soldiers enter , sword in hand , driving Indians before them . Percy mounts the throne and plants the banner there . Percy . Percy Victory  --  victory and Virginia . God save King James , Sovereign of Virginia . Drums and trumpets . Soldiers shout . Percy , West , and Rolfe , embrace Smith . Matacoran is brought in , in chains , guarded . Percy . Percy Thanks to God , we have arriv 'd in time to the rescue of our noble commander . Smith . Captain Smith Nay , dear and valued friends , you must be content with victory . My rescue is due to her before whom I kneel in admiration and gratitude. ( kneels . ) Percy . Percy Thanks , noble mistress , thanks for the life of our belov 'd Captain . An ' we had not knowledge of thy excelling worth before this , thou would'st now amaze us with thy virtues .

Master Rolfe And love thanks thee . ( kneels . ) Hugo . Hugo de Redmond An old soldier 's thanks for preserving the life of a rever 'd commander . ( kneels . ) Mowb . Mowbray In behalf of all the veterans , who have grown grey under the command of Smith , thanks , noble lady , thanks .  --  Long live the flower of Virginia . ( shouts . ) Smith . Captain Smith And now let me place my gold chain , the symbol of the preux chevalier , and which I bequeath 'd to this lady at my death , around the neck of her who hath preserv 'd my life . Percy . Percy And bind two in thy golden shackle , the good and gallant Master Rolfe , and thou wilt unite the hands of those whose hearts have long since been united . Smith . Captain Smith Aha ! Master Rolfe , do ye plead guilty to the charge ? Rolfe . Master Rolfe Aye , and glory in the guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pocahon . Princess Pocahontas She will most cheerfully submit to wear the chain which binds her to the honour 'd master of her fate , even tho ' the chain were of iron instead of gold . Smith . Captain Smith May every happiness attend this union of virtue and honour . All . All Amen , amen . Percy . Percy So please ye , the prisoner . Enter Matacoran , guarded . Smith . Captain Smith Aye , true , unbind him ; the brave honour the brave alike in misfortune and prosperity . Hugo . Hugo de Redmond So please ye to favour your veteran Hugo , let this grateful task be mine . When I was a prisoner , this chief releas 'd me , and gave me a chance to redeem mine arms . and now old Hugo performs the most pleasing duty of all his long and arduous services  --  to relieve a fallen enemy . ( Takes off Matacoran ' : chains . ) Smith . Captain Smith Chief , our wars are ended ; thy noble bearing claims all our esteem . Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's in future be friends , and join in friendship those hands , which lately wielded the weapons of enmity . Matacoran shall be of power and influence in the country which he hath so gallantly defended , and shall hold of the royal James posts of honour and trust in the newly acquired colony of Virginia . Mata . Matacoran Hear me , chief . Know that Matacoran scorns thy friendship , and hates all thy kind . The fortune of war is on thy side ; thy gods are as much greater than the gods of the Indian , as thine arms are greater than his . But altho ' thy gods and thine arms have prevail 'd , say did dot Matacoran fight bravely in the last of his country 's battles ? and when his comrades fled , singly did he face the thunders of his foe . Now that he can no longer combat the invaders he will retire before them , even to where tradition says , there rolls a western wave . There , on the utmost verge of the land which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and his strength decay 'd , Matacoran will erect his tumulus , crawl into it and die . But when in a long distant day , posterity shall ask where rests that brave , who disdaining alliance with the usurpers of his country , nobly dar 'd to be wild and free , the finger of renown will point to the grave of Matacoran . Matacoran rushes out . Smith . Captain Smith Brave , wild , and unconquerable spirit , go whither thou wilt , the esteem of the English goes with thee . Powha . Powhatan Captain Smith , after what hath pass 'd , thou might well distrust my friendship for the future . But experience makes even an Indian wise . We can not resist thee as enemies , therefore it becomes us to be thy friends . In the name of Virginia I pledge friendship to the English , so long as grass grows and water runs . Smith . Captain Smith And dost consent to the union of thine admirable daughter with worthy Master Rolfe ? Powha . Powhatan Aye , and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and Virginia . Enter Barclay , Mantea and Namoutac . Powha . Powhatan And mine be the privilege of giving away the bride . And may the fruits of this union of virtue and honour , be a long line of descendants , inheriting those principles , gifted with rare talents , and the most exalted patriotism . Now it only remains for us to say , that looking thro ' a big vista of futurity , to the time when these wild regions shall become the ancient and honour 'd part of a great and glorious American Empire , may we hope that when the tales of early days are told from the nursery , the library , or the stage , that kindly will be receiv 'd the national story of Pocahontas , or the Settlement of Virginia . Curtain falls.
