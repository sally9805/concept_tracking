Fields , James Thomas , 1817-1881 : REMEMBERED MUSIC . from Songs and sketches ( 1838 ? ) " If I could hear that laughing voice again , But once again ! how oft it wanders by , In the still hours , like some remembered strain , Troubling the heart with its wild melody ! " The fragment of a pleasant song Is murmuring in our ears , And we would fain the sounds prolong , Though much they move our tears . They breathe a low and pensive lay , But one we love full well , For oh ! it sends our thoughts away To many a bright and happy day In that lone quiet dell . The simple voice that warbled then Is hushed , and all is still : And notes that echoed through the glen , Are dying on the hill ,  --  Yet sometimes Fancy wakes the strain , And floats on Memory 's waves The music of that voice again ,  --  But ah ! we linger all in vain Among the village graves ! Fields , James Thomas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Songs and sketches ( 1838 ? ) I 've lived upon thy memory  --  I knew that thou wert mine When first I took that trembling hand , And pressed those lips of thine ; And now I care not what my lot On life 's wide shore may be , So I may look upon thy face , And dwell , my love , with thee . I ' ve lived upon thy memory For many a long , long year , And though I loitered on the road , My heart was ever here ; Beneath another sky I 've slept  --  It was my fate to roam  --  But all my dreams of happiness Were made of thee and home . Oh ! I have wandered many miles Far o'er the beauteous earth , But never passed a sunnier land Than that which gave me birth  --  Where blooms the fairest rose of all Down in a quiet glen ; It is mine own  --  that little flower Hath called me back again . Fields , James Thomas , 1817-1881 : SLEIGHING SONG . from Songs and sketches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleecy snow , When moonbeams sparkle round ; When hoofs keep time to music 's chime , As merrily on we bound . On a winter 's night , when hearts are light , And health is on the wind , We loose the rein and sweep the plain , And leave our cares behind . With a laugh and song , we glide along Across the fleeting snow ; With friends beside , how swift we ride On the beautiful track below ! O ! the raging sea , has joy for me , When gale and tempests roar ; But give me the speed of a foaming steed , And I 'll ask for the waves no more . Fields , James Thomas , 1817-1881 : THE INDIAN BOYS . from Songs and sketches ( 1838 ? ) Shady and cool their home lay hid , Where first the violet weaves Its vernal beauty with the rose , Among the forest leaves . Where iris blossoms strew the sod , And kalmias bloom around , And where the green-sward meets the lake , They had their sporting ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafters hung ; And robins , building near the spot , Above their roof-tree sung . Each morn they woke to brush the dew From many a bush and lea , And all their noon-day paths sloped down Beside the chestnut tree . They sought the hiding squirrel 's nest , Far up the woody hill , And bathed their reeking foreheads cool In bubbling mountain rill . They watched the stars drop silently , On darkling bough and plain , And they loved to hear the merry chime Of summer evening rain ; They saw the early golden moon Rise from her wavy bower , And in her beams they chased the bat From out his leafy tower . They miss these haunts  --  the city air To them no music brings , They pine for brook and water-fall , Where Nature ever sings . They droop amid the noise and glare , They sigh for fount and glen ,  --  Oh , take them back , far , far away , To their own home again . Fields , James Thomas , 1817-1881 : TO A CHURCH STEEPLE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ancient friend ! Thrice welcome to my sight ; Where falls thy shadow I shall wend My willing steps to-night . Around thy base I played In childhood 's thoughtless glee , Old spire , again tow'rd thee I 've strayed  --  Dost thou remember me ? Pleasant the first faint ray Of morning light appears To those who wait the coming day , And watch through many tears ; And sweet the evening star Gleams from the shadowy sky , On mariners , who 've wandered far From land with weary eye . So breaks upon my path Thy tall familiar form , A cheering look to me it hath , Like sunshine after storm ; And quick as lives a thought , Or bird skims o'er the vane , My heart leaped up , when memory caught Thy slender top again . Welcome ! my ancient friend ! Thrice welcome to my sight , Where falls thy shadow , I shall wend My willing steps to-night . Thanks , thanks  --  out on the sea Thou wav'st a greeting home , I knew thou would'st remember me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , James Thomas , 1817-1881 : VESPER MELODIES. from Songs and sketches ( 1838 ? ) How dear to me that evening song , So gently rising o'er the lake ,  --  Nor harp , nor lute , nor minstrel-throng To me , can sweeter music make . If falters now ! ye rippling waves Float on your billowy breasts the strain , And rest not till the anthem laves The pebbles at my feet again . Oh , wind and wave but serve me fair , And bring Almeda 's song to shore  --  And ye may hold your revels there , In noise and foam till night is o'er ! Fields , James Thomas , 1817-1881 : TO THE DAUGHTER OF A FRIEND . from Songs and sketches ( 1838 ? ) I will not praise thy many virtues , Mary , Nor all that sparkles in thy fair young face ; Of themes like these a poet should be wary , Who lacks the skill to give such themes a grace . But I will wish thee to be like thy mother , Like her to sail life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary , and there breathes no other With purer heart , more closely bound to thee . Through every scene , a mother 's holy blessing , Unchanged , still lingers , though the world assail ,  --  Without that boon life were not worth possessing , Trust that friend , Mary , though all else should fail .
