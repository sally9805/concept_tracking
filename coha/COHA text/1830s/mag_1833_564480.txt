txt IN one *ff the principal streets of a great metropolis , whose borders enclose many a beautiful form and patriotic heart , and whose environs , graced with all that is lovely and enchanting in the natural world , have been long consecrated by deeds of valor and undying fame , there might be seen , some years ago , a long sign , nailed over the door of a large , old-fashioned building , bearing the name of " Timothy Folio , Printer &amp; Bookseller , " in large , antique characters . On one side of said sign was painted , what was probably intended for a folio Bible , which one would take to be as old as Faust . On the other was drawn an odd-looking volume , which , though one might fancy it was meant to represent no one book in particular , but all in general , like an algebraic quantity , yet looked , for all the world , like an old-fashioned psalm-book , with the leaves torn out . The counters and shelves within were laden with literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilt covers , in sheep , morocco , boards , and parti-colored paper . Here were to be seen 1iterary flowers , whose fragrance had been exhaled the moment they saw the light , blossoms and buds of native growth , and e , totics , whose fragrance and bloom became sweeter and inure beautiful , the more they were gazed at and examined . Wherever the eye wandered , it could discern nothing but perennials , annuals , and ephemerals , mingled with a few weeds and plants of a different character . In short , Mr. Foli6 's store , or rati*er Liter*ry Room , held the same rank at the period I allude to , that is now heW iii pus* city by Allen &amp; . Tic*iinr , Russell &amp; Odiorne , or any of the other prime bibliopolists of Washington-stieet . I never knew precisely what use was made of the apartment immediately over the store . It was never opened but in the night , when it was regularly once a week lit up at a very late hour . As several thin-looking and meagre personages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ st*irs , who appeared to live on spare diet , it was rumored that this room was devoted to the sittings of a conventicle of critics . Certain demoniac laughs , which were occasionally heard there , seem to confirm the supposition . I have myself frequently seen the names of unfortunate and condemned authors scratched on the walls , if that circumstance can be considered as throwing any light upon the matter . Such was the belief , however , of authors and writers , who declared that few books , which had seen the inside of this den , were ever favorably received by the public , and only left it to be consigned to the spiders of the attic . Immediately above this apartment , and on the third story , was a book.bindery and Mr. Folio 's large priating establishment . In the attic , with which we are more immediately concerned , were stowed away various publications , odd volumes , and supernumerary copies . Here were the last new poem . and the last year 's novel , on the same shelf witha volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supported by a gazetteer . Long-winded epics had been puffed into this receptacle of lost and forgotten books . Shelf-worn spelling-books and primers- " the cast-offs of a former generation " - which had been in the highest classes at school , were here turned back again to their own alphabets . New troops of words had driven old dictionaries into this gloomy retreat , and almanacs were here consigned to a darker and inure disastrous eclipse than any they had ever predicted . Arithmetics might be seen here figuring in darkness , adding up the sum total of their miseries , and listening to the dying croak of a song , or the long-drawn sigh of an amatory poem . A few stray volumes of some classic pined away in this place of literary ease and elegant leisure ; but it was used and known as the resting-place and tomb of all unsaleable books , " dead as soon as born , " which neither Mr. Folio nor any of his brethren could force into circulation . The cases and shelves actually groaned beneath their dead weight , and spiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break through their fetters . Mr. Folio , who was unanimously appointed by the public voice to usher these abortions of the press into their dark abode , would moetwillingly have enlarged his store below , to make room for them , if they had not been too weak to support themselves upon his counters . Mr. Folio was a business-man , and , what is more to the point , Mr. Folio was a peaceable man , a gentlemanly and a very polite man . He was something of a scholar withal , and , if it had depended upon himself , every volume in this attic would have found a purchaser . He was not supposed to have an enemy in the world , unless a few poor authors , whose works he had published , but which were lying snugly in his attic , could be termed such . He lost money to a considerable amount *hy // these literary adventurers ; and they complained that they had lost their fame and reputation through his means ; but , as they had none to lose , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bookseller &amp; Publisher . The adventure that befel this gentleman , whose memory I respect , which I am going to relate , will hardly be believed , 11 dare be sworn , amoug even the most credulous and superstitious of my readers ; and , had I not the best possible reasons for placing full confidence in its truth , I should set it down at once as an improbable fable ; for , although lEsop made birds and quadrupeds discourse as wisely as bipeds , I confess my belief in the eastern doctrine of metempsychosis is not so great as to suppose the soul of a defunct author could pass into , and animate , a book , which died before the moist earth was fairly over his remains . Towards the close of a summer afternoon , Mr. Folio , wearing a long gown and red slippers , was seated behind his counter , looking over the sheets of a new poem , that was to see the light in a few days . Owing either to the warmth of the atmosphere , or to some soporific quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he sat penciling the margin of the leaves in his hand . At length he was so far gone , that the pencil fell out of his hands upon the floor . He started , and heard , or thought he heard , a considerably loud noise somewhere , as if a large volume had fallen to the floor ; but as his clerks continued writing , lie supposed himself mistaken , and , taking up his pencil again , was soon . lost in a comfortable nap . It was not five minutes before the noise was repeated . He was on his feet in an instant . He thought at first that it was a gentle clap of thuiPier ; but , as something like the noise produced by paper blown over a floor by the wind caine to his ears , he supposed something was out of place in his bindery or printing-office . As he stood yawning and rubbing his eyes , he was certain he heard a sound over head somewhere , like the march . and tramp of a small army , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certainl**an unusual noise . The clerks , being over head and ears in writing and casting up figures , smiled , when lie asked them if they heard it , and were almost too busy to give him an answer . " Faith ! " thought Mr. Folio , " if the building were to tumble over their ears , they would never know it . Something s to pay up stairs 7the devil s in the attic among the books , for aught I know ; I must go up and close the windows . " As he did not remember ever to have heard such a noise before he was determined to give up his doze , and ascertain its cause I do not know why he directed his steps immediately to the attic-whether because he thought the wind was creeping into the windows and doing mischief there , or whether , from a lurking fear that , as the contents of that room had been the occasion of some malice and hard thoughts to himself , some disappointed author had found his way there to work mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brain , I know not ; but certain it is that Mr. Folio did not stop jill his hand was on the lock of the garret door . He entered in a moment , and the door closed after him . I question if ever a mortal was more astonished or put to his wit 's end , when he found himself fairly in the room . An enchanter , who had suddenly evoked a legion of devils , when he expected the appearance of good spirits , could not have been more confounded , amazed , and perplexed , than was the worthy bookseller . All the books in the room were in motion . They seemed to have legs and wings . They walked , ran , and flew , with as much ease and vigor as their unfortunate authors could ever have done in their best days . Mr. Folio , being weak in the eyes , put on his spectacles , to be sure he was not deceived . Contrary to his expectation , the windows were all closed , so that not a particle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was now more at a loss , and more confounded than before , and the sweat began to fall from hijn in large drops . If his hair did not stand on end , it was because the worthy man s head was bald , and him voice clung to the roof of his mouth , unless a few quick ejaculations --  " zounds ! " " faith ! "  --  " strange ! "  --  " whew ! "  --  " heaven and earth ! " can be considered as articulate speech . By degrees , he took a survey of the room . The bibles , poems , primers , dictionaries , almanacs , and novels , were dancing about , and hurrying from their lazy resting-places on the shelves , cases , and stands , as if they were all determined on one general and final circulation at least , to pay for their years of durance . What a clatter of leaves , what a strange and contemptuous hissing sound did these blind , maimed , and halt children of the brain send forth ! Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they went through all their motions so lightly and actively that the floor seemed hardly to feel their weight . They platooned , faced about , and wheeled round with apparently as much skill and science as if they had been drilled to it by ahundred re // views . As if bent cm circulation , Mr. Folio remarked that most of their motions were gyratory , which surprised him not a little , as he well knew they had never been in circulation at all . It seemed impossible for them to keep still a moment , as though they were anxious to convince him that they could show life an&amp;animation enough if they chose , and were not the dull , stupid , and inanimate things he took them for . And in truth their movements in circles were so dexterous , that if old Eternity himself , to whom they had been dedicated at their birth , had suddenly stepped in among them , to offer his protection , in his proper shape of a circle , he would have sworn they had been well drilled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circulation . Mr. Folio dodged about as well as he was able , and endeavored to stop their motions ; but slap followed slap so fast , and every inch of his body was so beset with blows , that he was fain to retreat , and sit ( Iowa on an old chest , as a mere looker-on , to see how this singular matter would end . lie hoped here to have a comfortable seat , upon which he might rest himself ; for , what between slaps , blows , and astonishment , the worthy gentleman was not a little exhausted . While he was endeavoring to account for this singular behavior , and to distinguish the identical volume which struck him on the nose , he heard a slight tick . beneath himself , and the chest , on which he was seated , sprang its cover , and , flying up , sent him a rod across the room , and threw him in contact with an old Epic in three volumes . He started round with his fist doubled , for he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed in it , and what was his surprise to behold , issuing from the chest , a troop of reviews and m*gazip*es in blue and yellow covers , who took up the line of march around the room , in which volume after volume fell in by degrees . He followed them round with his eyes , and , as he stood , was in the centre of a large circle , which was filling up every moment and in perpetual motion . They went round in single , double , treple , quadruple , and sextuple file , according to the number of volumes of each , while a few old newspapers hovered over the scene , as if playing the part of statidards . He was puzzled to ascertain who was the leader , so closely were they huddled together , and so rapid was their circulation . He found , however , that an old Epic , in three volumes , the identical one the chest had thrown him against , took the lead , as he seemed to look about , now and then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment . He immediately seized a limping dictionary , that stood on one leg on a shelf , a disabled but quiet observer of the manoeuvres of his able-bodied fellow-prisoners ,  --  -. - he seized this dictionary , I say , and let it fly at the body of the Epic that seesned to direct the movements of all the rest . The first volume fell down , but springing up again in an instant , endeavored to regain his former place ; but as his two assistants or co-volumes were some way ahead , he made an effort to squeeze himself in between two old psalm-books that were marching with the rest , double file . Finding it impossible to do this , he stepped aside , and was soon joined by a troop of light-reading , old almanacs and novels that left the circle , and came on with stitched covers in a smart trot . At last the two remaining volumes of the Epic , that had continued their march , missing their mate , suddenly halted ; upon which all the rest were huddled together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and all in the greatest confusion imaginable . They seemed to take very little notice of Mr. Folio , and showed no disposition to attack him , as he expected they would do , and he once more seated himself on the chest , ready to await any motion , and desirous of seeing what these crazed fellows would do next . At last a volume of old reviews sprang upon a table , and waved his hand in token of silence . He was a grim and savagelooking fellow , and cast his sharp eyes around , as if he considered himself a judge that had power to enforce any sentence he might think proper to pronounce . After stamping once or twice upon the table , he thus spoke in a sharp voice " Fellow-prisoners , Epics , Novels , Essays , Histories , Almanacs , Poems , and all ye men of letters , who have been held in durance together so many years , by whatever name ye are called , I demand the reason of these strange movements . Since my first entrance into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day . I was stationed here to keep you in order , and was sorry to see a disposition in you to revolt and break out of your prison . I have done all in my power to prevent it . Sentence of condemnation was passed upon you years ago , and I have in my pocket " - He was here interrupted by cries of " Down with him l ' " Pitch him over ! " - " Nail him down ! " He made several attempts to go on ; but nothing could be heard but a few broken sentences , such as- " Damned again and again " - " A pack of fools " - " If some of you had not strong covers , I would take fifty at once U ' - " Bacl* to your dens ! " He was finally obliged to get down ; // and clapping a miserable little poem that stood near , shivedng at the sound of his voice , between his covers , he mounted the hi best shelf in the room , and , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ence . The Epic in three volumes , before mentioned , called to order , and when all was quite still again , he walked up , limping on his poetical feet , to within a of Mr. Folio , while the rest were all ranged aroXind , and thus , with an air - of offer*1ed dignity , addressed him : - " Well may you be surprised at our proceedings , to-day , sir ! But we could bear it no longer . Here have we been imprisoned for years , mere dead weights upon your shelves in this old garret , while our more fortunate brethren are lying in every parlor in the country . We have determined to exercise our limbs , and change the postures in which we have been lying on your shelves , huried in dust , till a simultaneous spirit aroused us this d*iy . We feel persuaded that we shall yet have our turn in traveling through the city , and irisiting foreign nations . " - As he pronounced the last sentence , the idea it conveyed seemed too great for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eeemed about to rise . The dust flew about so much , that it greeted Mr. Folio 's nostrils , and he sneezed aloud three times . At this they all started upright , and took a menacing attitude . " Mr. Folio ! " continued the amazed Epic , " this is not a matter to be sneezed at . We have been most foully , cruelly , and unjustly treated ; and , in the name of the offended tenants of this attic around you , I call upon you to give us a conspicuous place on your counter below . Set your critics to work to give us a lift , and you may depend upon reaping your reward . " Here the Magazines and Reviews in stitched covers , which had issued from the chest , apprehensive that dangerous movements were on foot , protested by their gestures against this measure , and seemed almost in the act of flying into the face of the Epic . " Sir , " said one , " we have all damned you once , and should not disturb you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and esnp%*y boasts of your vain pretensions , by recalling to your recollection any unsavory passages . Here , " he continued , opening his leaves in the face of the Epic , " read this review and account of yourself on my fourth page . " " And mine , " said another . " And mine , and mine , " cried six Successive numbers . " Miserable drivelers cried the incensed Epic , " nothing but the contempt and oblivion , into which you have fallen , saves you from my anger . What would have been your circulation , had you not been upheld by the author of my being . Every line of intelligence in your distorted countenances , every mark of expression , and every thing about you , by the help of which you gained your short-lived reputation , you owe to my author and his brethren . Turn over some of your leaves and read those immortal verses , the very quintessence of his brain and fancy , which alone have given you vitality , and every hreath of life that yet keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , you are not worthy to review my . title-page . Review me , forsooth ! Heavens ! what presumption ! " The Epic shook himself , till they all bounced from the floor , none keeping their positions but the Magazines . Though there were a great many controversials and polemics in his attic , Mr. Folio did not look upon the tame , lifeless , and inanimate poems around him as belligerents . Their sensitiverwss , bravado , and menacing tone were to be expected from their irritable race ; but he began to fear that they would all fall to blows and fisticuffs , and pull each other by the ears . The Magazines and Reviews bristled up a little at first , upon hearing the retort of the Epic ; but , suddealy changing their aspect , they set up such a horrible laugh that Mr. Folio thought they would shake themselves to pieces , and that their leaves would actually fall from their covers . The whole assembly seemed to take this in great dudgeon . They huddled along , going this way arid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names in formidable array . They mounted each other 's shouldersf volume standing on volume , and presented a high wall to the eyes of the astonished bibliopolist , shaped like a pyramid . While they were in this position , a little imp of a Satire , perched on the very top of the whole , begged a moment 's hearing . " Mr. Folio , * he said , " I have the names of most of these gentlemen in my pocket , and am only sorry that I did not come into the world twenty years sooner , that I might have enrolled them all on my pages . Most of them have been immortalized by my efforts , and I am sorry to find myself in their company . I am an old bookworm , and am here only to shut their mouths , and keep them still . Whatever notice they have attracted has been owing to my humble self . They have often escaped , when my nails were upon them ; but I have got them once more , as you see , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old as // I am , if i do not *keep them quiet forever . " He grinned horribly , showed hi* teeth , and , in biting the ears of a novel under him , bit his own tongue , and fell to the floor . They all now dismounted , and , treading over the prostrate Satire , and on each other ' * heels , sprang into the window*seats , upon the book-cases , chests , and old chairs , and some of them stuck to the ceiling . A Novel , that straddled an old line , on which were hung some newspapers , demanded audjeuce . " It is a hard case that I , Mr. Folio , a gentleman ( if wit and elegant manners , a persoii* of figure and parts , though possessing , I own , but little bottom ,  --  it is hard , I say , . that I should be caged up here , and waste my precious moments in such vile company . I was born to live fbrever ; and my author 's brains were sqtieezed. into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , that one of my eonse*uence should not fulfil the expectations of my author . Really , sir , it is too bad .. I never had but one kind look in my life , and that was from a fashionable belle , , who once lifted me from your counter , cut open a few of my leaves , and gave me a sweet smile , as she threw me down again . I wish that old volume of Maga -- zines above , there , had pressed me a little more lightly , as I lay under hijn , forreally I led a most miserable life in his company . As he spoke , he cast his eyes upon the dead Satire upon the floor , and , missing his hold , fell down andga*ve up the ghost . A Poem , in small duodecimo , now arose , and breakiiag loose from the covers of ' a Review that held him , stood before his companions , with an air of great inspor. tance . He was evidently quite young , and acquainted with the fashionsof the age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title-page , shbw'edi hisanthor 's portrait , done in the best style of the art . " As to this old genflemen , " saAdhe , pointing to the Epic , " and these sentimental dandies in the world of ' lett*ts , " bowing to the Novels , " 1 confess I think they well deserve their confinement . For myself , I am content to remain here a little longer ; for , my life on it , the day is near when I shall go forth , and put to shame the critics and reviewers . I maintain that every one has a right to sing his own praises ; for the glory redounds not to us , hut to our authors . I was nursed with - the greatest care ; ; every foot , nay , every line of my body was perfumed with the sweetest fragrance of the brain . I was early taught to imitate the best masters of the schoo1 of poetry now in fashion . The graces presided at my birth , and I was christened . with the greatest ceremony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ' my title-page , to ornament my person , and to complete the number of my graces , . I was sent to my tailor 's , the book-binder 's , frneasured , arrayed in an elegant . court-dress , and then ushered into the world to gain my reputation . But , heavens ! what a fate did I experience ! I was sent to every editor in the city-I was advertised , but , miserable return for my author 's generosity ! not a single puff ' was bestowed upon me ; I was eet down every where as a dull and stupid : fellow , without strength or imagination . If I had been called cloven-footed , I ' could not have been inure positively damned . I had a mind to commit suicide ; , but , having more respect than others for the reputation and the feeiin*s of my author , I dragged out my existence on the counter , or was stuck up in the window for years , with my author 's portrait to the street , in the shop of Battledore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this miserable place . That ' * fiend , who sits grinning on the window-seat , gave me a mortal stab . That circumstance hastened my entrance into the attic , as well as the death of my parent . He pined away and died ; no one knew the reason ; but the manner lit which I was treated , no doubt , brought him to his end . He was found dead in his cham* ber , ' with the review in his hand , which had treated me so rascally . The jury , . , who sat on his body , gave in their verdict-Died of information in the brain . " ' He whined and whimpered a little , and then continued- " Thank Heaven , aad* my author ! I am not weak , hut strong , and shall live-forever , and I hope ere long , to show my strength . " While uttering the last word , he fell down from mere want of stamina , and , in the fall , spoilt his author 's picture . The speech of the Poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event with which it terminated , seemed to excite general sympathy and commiseration . Six or eight Pathetic Poems , and Sentimental Effusions , almost . wept themselves to tatters , bursting forth into sighs and tears in this obscure ' garret , such as they had in vain endeavored to draw from the eyes of their few ' solitary readers . There seemed to be a general condolence among the assembly ' with the sufferings and fate of the Poem and his author ; and even the Reviews ' and Magazines relaxed a very little in their grins , when the poor , exhausted Poem sunk down , and blasted his author 's picture . Another little Poem , who pretendedl // 1051 to be a smart , pert little gentleman , pricked up his ears a little , as he observed the calm that had settled over the assembly ; and , edging along between Psalmbooks , and a dozen tall and gaunt octavos , presented himself before the bookseller , and burst out into a loud and obstreperous laugh . This was received by some as mistimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ querulous state of feeling , when they saw him determined to obtain a hearing at any rate . He laughed again as loud as before , and , looking about in perfect good nature , thus . spake I am content with my situ tion , Mr. Folio , and heartily obliged to you for taking me from your counter and thrusting me in this place . Your kindness has saved me many feelings of shame and mortification . In a garret I was born , and , please Heaven in a garret will die , and give up what little life is within my body . I have no picture fronting my title-page , to show you , like the gentleman that has just touched us up so pathetically ; for , to tell you the truth , my author was so ugly that he could not relish his victuals . I have had all manner of assistance in my tinme* but never had a long run. ; in fact , I had no run at all . if puffs . could have helped me , I should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * lorio us , magnificent , grand , and even sublime . I was said to possess the fire of Homer , the sublimity of Milton , and the grace of Horace ; but I am persuaded my sublimity and my beauty were of a peculiar , unprofitable , and unpopular kind , for I could not become a favorite , notwithstanding all the exertions of editors , and of my author . I was hushed into silence , and finally every voice that was uplifted in my praise was put down , as if by general consent . It was in vain that my author sent me to his friends-in vain that he tore out my title-pages , one after another , putting new ones in their places , calling me the first , second , third , and even sixth edition . Heaven help my author ! for no mortal will : for my part , I know not what has become of him ; though it is not ten minutes since a little Drama strutted towards me , and claimed to be my brother . I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinherited me , and for five years has not opened my leaves . He declared I had disgraced him , and that he would disown me . Truly , I think this is no lie ; and I have no doubt there are twenty as brainless fellows as I am , in this company , who claim to be my brothers , and who have all shared the same fate with myself . " A great many voices were here heard , exclaiming- " Lost Beauty ! are you there ? poor fellow , poor fellow ! " The Lost Beauty retreated to his hiding-place , denying any relationship with the speakers . Several others now came forward , and made short speeches , of- a seditious character , declaring their intention of leaving this attic , and running their chance of immortality in the wide world without . An old Arithmetic stated the exact number of days , hours , minutes , and seconds of their confinement , and said a good deal about barter and exchange . An old Algebra hammered out a set speech upon the infinite series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geography grew eloquent in describing foreign countries . An Almanac talked of fine weather , who had ot seen the sun for a score of years , and actually declared that all his predictions and observations would answer fo the current year , though by no means for the meridian of a garret . An old Medical work thought the health of all the tenants of the attic required an immediate exposure to the air , but would by no means recommend blood-letting , as they were all so lean . and thin . The Singing-books were all for Psalm-tunes , and one actually went through with Old Hundred . A few old musty Quartos and Folios were for reposing forever on the shelves , where they had lain so long , and cursed the hour their rest had been disturbed . The Newspapers and Reviews were for maintaining quiet and order , and waiting patiently , till they were called to leave their present place of abode , and advised all the company to do the same , as they were evidently not lonmr for this world . They continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretensions to reputation so fast , and there were so many speakers at a time , that nothing could be heard but voice upon voice , crying out for immediate deliverence fm*om their prison-house . The whole seemed gradually to become one loud and boisterous chorus . Mr. Folio clapped his hands to his ears , and thrust forward his feet , for they seemed to be edging towards him , as if about to surround him . Their noise , however , grew fainter and fainter , as they became fainter and more exhausted , and finally an old Dictionary was heard crying out , that all they said was mere words , words , words , and that therein they were very like himself omily every word had not a meaning . An odd volume of Milton , that was lying on a sheW got up , shook off the dust from his cover , looked around him , and immediately lay down again , with his back to the company . The slight noise that he made drew all eyes . towards him , and , at sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mightily abashed and confounded . They held down their heads and were silent . Some skulked away , and others fell down prostrate before Mr. Folio 's feet . The old volume of Reviews , who had endeavored to restore order at the commencement of the uproar , thinking it a good time to complete his intention of sending the rebels to their shelves , left his high place of retreat , and , standing in the midst of the disheartened company , began to lay about him in good earnest . Some went up , and some went down . The Fugitive Pieces all took to their heels ; and as the old gentleman dealt his blows around him , volume fell on volume , squeaking and groaning , as if their last hour had arrived . He tore the covers from the backs of a great many , and seemed to aim at getting hold of those who had been speakers . in five minutes from the moment he began , they were all drawn up into a conical pile , upon the very pinnacle of which the Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got these insolent fellows under my thumb , and pray Heaven they may now sleep soundly forever . Their exercise this day has been too great for them , and they are now , as you may see , mere skeletons . Heavens methinks they grow smaller every moment . I at first thought it would be best to knock their brains out ; but I see they have fairly expended what little remained , in their vauntings this day . As for me , it is not my'nature to live long " So it seemed , for before he had finished his words , he fell down upon the pile , as dead as the rest of them . Mr. Folio arose , and called to one of his clerks to assist him in replacing the books upon the shelves . The clerk entered the attic , and was somewhat surprised to see Mr. Folio reclining on the chest , and yawning , as if he had been napping . He saw no books on the floor , but they were all neatly arranged on their shelves . Mr. Folio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books were on the floor a moment ago . It was suggested to him , that he might possibly have been dreaming . But he denied that he had ever been asleep , and then proceeded to relate all that had happened , just as he witnessed it . The clerk stared and looked the old gentleman in the face , as if he thought his head might be a very little deranged . Mr. Folio was angry at this incredulity , and declared he would not hear a word against its truth , concluding with the assertion , that he was ready to take his oath oC the truth of all he had uttered.
