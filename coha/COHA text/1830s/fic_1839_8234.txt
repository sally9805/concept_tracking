Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : GOING TO BATTLE . from Going to battle ( 1839 ) Calm in her love , the patriot wife , Beside her valiant husband stood ; And saw him , for the field of strife , Gird on his armour good . Her lustrous eyes with pride were wet  --  Her heart with feelings deep , was stirred ; For hostile hosts that day were met , Red sword to clash with sword : And to the stormy scene of war , The idol of her soul was bound : The stirring ordnance boomed afar  --  His charger pawed the ground . She placed her warm hand on his own  --  " Go , in thy country 's cause , " she said , " And may our God with glory crown The legions thou hast led ! " And as the battle-thunders roll Upon the gustful , wandering air , I to that God will pour my soul , Assured that HE is there . " There , where the blazoned banners wave , And death-shots hurtle through the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in victory ! " The field was sought  --  the field was won  --  The morrow saw the brave return ; But ah ! that morrow 's golden sun Saw countless thousands mourn ! Some , on the purple , deluged ground  --  Some faintly groaning as they died : Some , by no friends or kindred found  --  Drenched in their vital tide . Thus earthly wars invoke renown  --  Thus blood sustains the victor 's wreath : Far better , that " good fight , " and crown , Which triumph over Death ! Philadelphia .
