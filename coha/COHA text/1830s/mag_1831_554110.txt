txt The currency , which is always an important , is at this period a particularly interesting topic , in consequence of the discussions , to which the question of renewing the Charter of the Bank of the United States naturally leads . Though the act of incorporation does not expire till 1836 , the constitutionality and expediency of continuing a national institution of this nature , already occupy the serious attention of the Executive and Legislative departments of the Government . The President , in his Message at the opening of the First Session of the Twenty-first Congress , presented the subject to the deliberate consideration of the Legislature and the people ; ' declaring , that both the constitutionality and the expediency of the law creating this ( the present ) Bank , are well questioned by a large portion of our fellow citizens ; and ( that ) it must be admitted * In the article on the Bank , which appeared in our last number , it was intimated , that the subject would be resumed in a future one , by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , that the present article is by another hand . The sequel of the former one will probably be given in October . There is some divergence between the views of our two correspondents on particular points ; but their general objects , those of showing the utility of the Bank , and the expediency of continuing it , are substantially the same . // by all , that it has failed in the great end of establishing a uniform and sound currency . ' From the consideration of this Message , resulted the Report of Mr. McDuffie . The scope of the inquiry made by the Committee of the Senate was more extensive , as it embraced the general question of a national currency ; but the conclusion from both investigations was the same , viz , that the Bank had fulfilled the great end for which it was created , and that it furnished the country with a uniform and sound currency . On this point , the Legislature is consequently at issue with the Executive . The constitutionality of the Bank of the United States ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee of the Senate ,  --  is defended with great zeal and ability , by the Committee of Ways and Means ; and is established , not only by argument and judicial decisions , but by that authority , which often outweighs them both in the estimation of the community ,  --  the sanction of illustrious names . It is shown , that all or nearly all the distinguished statesmen of our country , not excepting Mr. Jefferson , have , at one time or another of their public career , either supported a national bank , or officially admitted the constitutional power of the General Government to incorporate such an institution . But though it is always satisfactory to have such testimony , that our fundamental charter has not been violated , we are far from deeming it necessary to adduce it on the present occasion . If there be any one circumstance , which pre-eminently characterizes our federal institutions , it is the power of the Supreme Court to determine , in the last resort , on the constitutionality of the acts of Congress and of the State Legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its action on individuals , without having recourse to the authority of separate States . This high tribunal , to which the decision appropriately belongs , has , after solemn argument , repeatedly established the validity of the law creating the Bank of the United States ; and its constitutionality can therefore no longer , without subverting our political system , be considered a doubtful question . The only points remaining for future discussion , are the expediency of such an institution , and the propriety of continuing it on its present basis . The business performed by the National Bank , may be viewed under several heads . It combines all the various functions of a bank of deposit , of discount and of circulation , deals largely // in foreign exchange , and at the same time facilitates the ordinary fiscal arrangements of the Government . 1 . The connexion which individuals have with the mother hank and its branches , as offices of discount and deposit , does not differ from that which exists between the numerous local institutions established throughout the Union , and their customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford safe and convenient places fqr the deposit of money , on which they allow no interest , and for taking charge of which they are compensated by the balances of the accounts of their dealers ; which , as well as their capital , are employed in the discounting of bills of exchange or promissory notes . As all these institutions , instead of confining themselves to the business of affording facilities to merchants to anticipate the payment of bills and notes created in the course of actual business , are in the habit of making permanent loans , in the form of renewable discounts of accommodation paper , it is evident , that it is not on account of any deficiency , that would otherwise exist in the banking capital , that a national institution is necessary . Receiving deposits and making discounts , are , however , convenient , though not essential auxiliaries , to the exercise of the important duty , with which the Bank is intrusted , of supplying a uniform and sound currency . 2 . As it is in its character of a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known to the public at large , we do not deem any apology necessary , for considering at some length the principles of money , and the rules which it is necessary to observe , in order that paper may retain an exchangeable value , equal to that of the coin which it represents . These are matters , which ought to be clearly understood by all , who are called upon to take a part in the delicate business of regulating the currency of the country ,  --  a subject second in importance to none , which can come before the national Legislature , and in discussing which , we shall also advert to the scheme offered by the Executive as a substitute for the existing bank . An invariable standard can not , in the nature of things , exist . A commodity may be selected , which will serve as a measure of value for other articles produced under the same circumstances . But , besides the variations arising from the quantity of labor necessary for production at different periods , and the unequal times required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed and circulating capital , and the various degrees of durability of fixed capital , cause great fluctuation in the value of commodities . It is true that , in ordinary cases , labor is the basis of value , and that it is the relative cost of production , which regulates the terms on which one commodity is exchanged for another . We , however , estimate an article , not only by the labor bestowed on it immediately , but by that also which has been expended on the various implements required to give effect to the particular labor to which they were applied . Regard must likewise be had to the greater or less rapidity , with which the returns for different commodities are received by the merchant or manufacturer . Utensils or machinery may not only have unequal quantities of labor realized in them , but they may be calculated to last almost indefinitely , or they may approach to the nature of circulating capital . The theory of rent has shown the extreme unfitness of corn , which Dr. Smith selected as a universal standard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agricultural produce is peculiarly subject to change , as its value must alter with every successive recourse to inferior soils , or application of capital to land with diminished returns . The want of an invariable standard is experienced when we attempt to estimate the relative prices of commodities at different penods ; but if the same article be uniformly employed as the medium of exchange , the real fluctuation in the cost of its production will rarely be sufficiently rapid to occasion any serious inconvenience in the currency of a particular country . The commodity chosen , should , in its intrinsic value , bear some relation to the labor realized in the ordinary subjects of exchange . Hence , where accumulation prevails only to an inconsiderable extent , the adoption of the baser metals in preference to gold and silver . The interdiction of the precious metals as a circulating medium , and the substitution of a cumbersome coinage of iron money , are enumerated among the wise enactments of Lycurgus . But , as the energies of the nation were diverted from the production of wealth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities possessed of great exchangeable value , the banishment of gold and silver was a necessary consequence of their institutions , independent of all positive legislation . Copper formed the basis of the Roman currency till five // years before the first Punic war , when silver coin came into use . Gold was not introduced till sixty-two years afterwards , or 204 years before Christ . In Russia , copper has always constituted a large portion of the metallic currency ; the amount of it coined in that Empire durir*g the last century having been , notwithstanding its great comparative bulk , in the proportion of two rubles of copper to three of gold and silver. * Many modern States have employed small quantities of copper as subsidiary coins ; and Sweden , Austria , and other powers , have sometimes resorted to a currency of this and other inferior metals , as a temporary financial expedient . Gold and silver , which possess many of the qualities required in an article of universal circulation , have been ordinarily used as the money of the civilized world . The copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mines of Siberia produce metal superior to the German . That of Sweden is better than the Russian ; while the copper of Japan is preferable to the Swedish . On the other hand , a pound of pure gold , which issues from the mines of America or the rivers of Africa , is exactly equal to a pound of pure gold from the mines of Europe . Neither the atmosphere nor time alters the quality , and the weight of every part of the metal is an exact measure of its quantity and value as compared with every other part . The precious metals are also ductile , malleable , and divisible into small parts . They are essentially articles of merchandise , the value of which is determined , like that of all other commodities , by the amount of labor requisite to produce them . As in the case of agricultural produce , it is the price of that portion of the metals which is brought to market under the least favorable circumstances , that determines the value of the whole . Owing to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the demand for them , they are exposed to fewer temporary fluctuations than any other commodities . The discovery of America , however , by presenting to the enterprise of Europe the mines of Peru and Mexico , produced , on the value of gold and silver in the markets of the world , effects similar to those which would result from adding to any particular country , where * The gold and silver coined in Russia between 1762 and 1811 , amounted to one hundred and thirty-seven millions of rubles ; the cop*er exceeded ninety millions . Storch . Cours d ' Economie Pol . Tom . p. 87* // recourse has been had to inferior soils , an indefinite supply of land of the first fertility . The whole amount of the precious metals throughout the world , in bullion , coin , and plate , has been supposed by Senior* and other English economists , to amount to ? 2,000,000,000 sterling , or about $9,000,000,000. t At the commencement of the nineteenth century , the whole annual product of the mines of North and South America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while those of Europe only furnished a fifteenth part of that quantity . In consequence of the civil wars , it has been conjectured , that the deficiency in the supply from the mines during the eight years preceding 1819 , exceeded two hundred millions of dollars . This sum must subsequently have been at least doubled . The difficulties growing out of the revolutionary struggles are not yet terminated , and the speculations of foreigners for obtaining the precious metals , by the application of improved machinery , have in a great degree proved abortive . In 1824 , there was actually an exportation of gold and silver from England to the mining countries . Whatever , therefore , may hereafter be the efficiency of the steam-engine , a long time must elapse before the vacuum occasioned by the diminished production of the last twenty years is supplied . A still longer period must also intervene , before these metals are sensibly depreciated in the markets of the world , in consequence of the increased demand occasioned-by the extension of civilization , and which even the falling-off in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the metals , as a medium of exchange , and to prevent the necessity of weighing and assaying them in ordinary transactions , a mark was early placed upon them , to denote their value .

W. Senior , A. M. Professor of Political Economy in the University of Oxford , p. 44. t A late writer in the American Quarterly Review considers these statements as grossly exaggerated , and estimates the gold and silver , now existing in Europe , at only four thousand five hundred millions of dollars in value , of which from one third to two fifths is used as currency , the remainder being worked up in plate , jewels , and other manufactured articles . // value . It requires no inconsiderable knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purity of the coins in circulation ; and this , in some instances , is impracticable , without the aid of chemical analysis . That the quantity of gold and silver , in the pieces which form the currency , should be ascertained by an authority in which general confidence is reposed , is of the first consequence in rendering the metals fit instruments of exchange . This office has been generally assumed as a prerogative of sovereignty , and by our Constitution is exclusively vested in the Federal Government . In England , Russia , and the United States , the same weight of pure metal , that is brought to the mint in bullion or foreign coin , is delivered in the coin of the country . This applies in England only to gold , the sole legal tender , silver not being , since 1816 , payable except in small sums , and a seignorage of 6.48 per cent . being imposed on its coinage . In the United States , both gold and silver are legal tenders for debts to any extent . Here , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been received but as a subsidiary currency , and has been greatly overvalued . The charges at the mints of France and Denmark , are inadequate to reimburse the expenses of these establishments ; but the greater part of the European States derive considerable revenues from coinage . A charge equivalent to the expense of fabrication seems to be supported by just principles . There is no more reason why those who use silver and gold as coin , should have the fashion of them furnished gratuitously , than that the Government should generously offer to convert bullion , free of all expense , into articles for domestic use . If the seignorage were only equal to the difference between the labor worked up in the same weight of coined and uncoined metal , it would always lead to the exportntion of bullion , in preference to the money of the country . The expense now wasted on the coining of gold and silver , which is merely taken from one mint to be sent to another , would then be , in a considerable degree , *av*d. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of value . If their relative prices be apportioned with the greatest accuracy , they must always be subject to fluctuations , both temporary and permanent . Gold is worth fifteen or sixteen times as much as silver , because it costs fifteen or sixteen times more labor to produce a given quantity of gold , than it does to procure the same weight of silver . Suppose , // however , that machinery should be applied to the extraction of one of the precious metals , which can not be used for obtaining the other , or that , by the discovery of new mines , an alteration should take place in the comparative abundance of gold and silver , is it not obvious that their relative value must be changed ? Nor are variations in the value of these metals altogether unknown . At the period of the discovery of our Continent , they were exchanged for each other at the rate of one for ten ; while , according to the existing regulations of Europe , gold , as compared with silver , varies in different States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fifteen and a half , and its market price is not far from one to sixteen . It has been already si*ated , that the United States have a double standard . This is also the case with France . In Great Britain , as we have seen , gold , with unimportant exceptions , is the only legal tender . In Russia , according to the system established in 1810 , the silver ruble is the standard by which all payments stipulated to be made in metallic money , must be regulated ; and the Government leaves it to individuals to settle for themselves the value of gold relatively to silver , which of course varies in the market from time to time . The experience of all countries , where gold and silver have been indifferently adopted as standards , has shown , that debtors will pay in the coin which has the highest legal value , compared with its market price as bullion ; and that the other , being estimated too low at the mint , will be driven from circulation . By the French law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half to one , that is to say , a debtor may indifferently discharge a debt contracted in francs , by paying to his creditor fifteen and a half ounces of silver , or one ounce of gold , they both being coined into money . But , as an ounce of gold is really worth a little more than fifteen and a half ounces of silver , payments are made in preference in the latter metal , which is generally employed in France as money . When , for convenience in travelling , or other purposes , gold is desired , a premium must be given for it . In our system , as their proportional values are fixed at fifteen for one , the advantage of employing silver is still greater , and however much gold might be coined , it would , unless the standard rates were altered , soon disappear from circulation . In looking into the history of money , we find , that a common error has pervaded the regulations which have been adopted // by governments . They have proceeded on the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of the metal , constituted the value of the coin . They have thus arbitrarily altered the amount of silver and gold contained in pieces of different denominations . They have conceived , that , if the name of the coin were retained , it would exchange for the same quantity of other commodities . In order to enable the State to discharge its debts by a less value than was originally stipulated , every private debtor has had legal permission given to him to defraud those by whom he has been trusted . The Roman as or pondo , which , in the reign of Servius Tullius , contained twelve ounces , was , 175 years before Christ , reduced to half an ounce . The currencies of most of the States of modern Europe present similar instances of degradation ; their pound , livre , or other coin , having been at first of the weight of metal corresponding with its denomination . Such , however , has been the effect of successive changes , that the French livre of 1103 was worth , in the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , a pound weight of gold , of the fineness of twenty-three carats , three and a half grains , was , in 1344 , coined into ? 13.3.4 . In 1816 , the same quantity of that metal , of the purity of twenty-two carats , made ? 46.14.6 of the standard coin . In Russia , from the year 1700 to 1762 , the money underwent a depreciation of more than fifty per cent . Before the time of Peter the Great , 100 copeks , containing 11 zolotniks and 40 dolis of pure silver , made a ruble . In 1704 , rubles were coined , containing but 5 zol. and 67 dolis of silver ; and this quantity was , in 1762 , reduced to 4 zol. 21 dolis . But it is not only by depreciating it , that governments have unjustly exercised their power over the currency . History informs us of a Roman emperor , who , when his subjects were bound to pay in taxes , not a determinate weight of gold , hut a certain number of aurei , increased the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without appearing to add to their contributions , assumed to himself a command over a much larger portion of the means of the people . The names given to money are altogether unimportant ; and when the alteration of the currency becomes known , and contracts are entered into with reference to the new state of things , it is productive neither of good nor evil . The temporary effects are , however , injurious to the last degree , as will // more fully appear , when we come to speak of a circulating medium , that is exposed to far greater variations than those to which coin can ever be subjected . In a commercial community , it would be more inconvenient to carry on exchanges by means of gold and silver , than we can possibly suppose it to have been to conduct the limited traffic of Sparta , by the intervention of iron money . Though money be used as the measure of relative value , transactions are constantly taking place , not only between merchants of different nations , but among the inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trader of the interior sends agricultural produce to New York or Boston , where his corn is estimated according to the market price , and he receives in exchan be dry goods and groceries , which are also valued in current money . The same thing may be supposed in relation to the trade between this country and England . Cotton is exported to Liverpool , where the American merchant is credited with the proceeds ; but instead of gold and silver , foreign fabrics are supplied in return . This is a statement of a more simple case than is likely to occur in practice . But the intervention of the various classes of commercial dealers , to which the division of labor has given rise , does not affect the principle . It would , indeed , ordinarily occur , that the corn of the interior would be forwarded to the sea-board , or the cotton shipped to Europe , by those who had the occasion to purchase any commodities from the correspondents to whom their property was consign6d ; and it might even happen , that they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had transmitted their produce . In such a case , it would be extremely convenient for a creditor to make an assignment of the debt to persons having occasion for funds abroad , or in a distant part of his own country , receiving an equivalent at the place of his residence . Hence the origin of bills of exchange , which is of high antiquity. * * Isocrates mentions particularly , that a stranger , who had brought some grain to Athens , delivered a draft of this nature to one Stratocles , for money due to him in some place by the Euxine Sea . It appears that the dangers of the sea in the first place , and afterwards , the dread of pirates , or declared enemies , induced the merchants of those days to adopt such practices . But as the credit of the Greeks was in little re // In the same place , articles are often bought , with a view of being re-sold , and in such cases , the first purchaser generally calculates on paying for them by what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanging at once money for commodities , a note is given , promising to pay the amount stipulated , at the expiration of sixty or ninety days . If this ) romise be made by a man of undoubted credit , it may be circulated among those , by whom the solvency of the maker is understood , as equivalent to the value which it represents . Foreign bills of exchange are universally considered a part of the general currency of the mercantile world ; but according to the habits of transacting business in this country , inland bills of exchange and promissory notes are discounted or purchased , with a view of obtaining interest for the use of capital , but do not , to any great degree , form part of what may be properly termed the circulating medium . In England , however , they are employed to no small extent as money , of which they perform many of the ordinary functionsA* The average amount of bills paid each day , at the clearinghouse in London , is estimated at four millions , and the average period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the gross amount of them in circulation can not fall short of three hundred millions ; and deducting those which , from the magnitude of the sums , or the length of time before the bills become due , are ineligible for performing the functions of currency , it may be considered , that a sum of one hundred and fifty millions of bills of exchange , ( payable in London ) is , in the ordinary course of affairs , at all times in circulation , representing the transfer of commodities as much as any other description of currency . ' One of the witnesses before the Committee of the House of Lords , on the Scotch and Irish pute , this Stratocles took very good precautions ; he insisted on having a banker of Athens responsible , in case the bill should be protested in the Crimea , because the drawer had no fixed habitation. ' - De Pauw on the Greeks , Vol . I. p. 234. * In the great manufacturing county of Lancashire , and in parts of Yorkshire , a bill on London at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the largest proportion of the currency consists either of the bills of bankers drawn on their correspondents , or those of the merchants and dealers scattered up and down the country . The same practice is followed , though to a less extent , in other districts , so that the aggregate amount of such bills afloat is enormous . ' - Smith 's Wealth of A'ktions* With supplementary A'otes by McGulloeh . Vol . IV . p. 293* // currency , in the session of 1826 , in answer to a question respecting the proportion which bills of exchange bear in value to the Bank of England notes and gold circulating in Lancashire , stated , that he should suppose , that on the 1st of December previous , those bills of the value of ? 10 and not exceeding ? 30 , amounted to four fifths of the whole ; and that , if he did not confine himself to bills under ? 30 , he should say that bills of exchange were to gold and Bank of England notes , in the proportion of more than twenty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fifty to one . Another witness , on being asked whether he had not seen bills of exchange of this nature , for the value of ? 10 , with fifty or sixty names upon them , Yes , ' replied he , with twice that number . I have seen slips of paper attached to a bill as long as a sheet of paper could go , and when that was filled , another attached to that . ' The necessity of having recourse to metallic money , was also in a degree obviated by the establishment of banks of deposit . Of these , the most celebrated were the banks of Venice , Amsterdam and Hamburgh . The oldest was that of Venice , which may be traced to the twelfth century . The other institutions were much more recent , not having been founded till the beginning of the seventeenth . One of the causes usually assigned for their creation , was the importance of preserving a currency of uniform value . Small States were much exposed to the introduction of clipped coin , and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was debased in quality , great embarrassments were experienced in determining the rates at which this money should be received in large transactions . The money of Venice , as well as that of Amsterdam and Hamburgh , afforded a regular standard of value , and the certificates of these banks maintained an agio , or premium , on the current coin of their respective States . As the bank money was only issued to the actual depositors of specie , it was regulated as to quantity ; but on the supposition that gold and silver existed in the vaults to the extent of the bank credits , according to the principles on which these institutions were formed , nothing could have been gained either to individuals or the public , in the liberation of unproductive capital . The same reasons , however , which would give circulation to the promissory notes of individuals , or to those private bills of exchange , to which we have referred , would cause the notes // of an institution or of a company of merchants , possessing sufficiently the confidence of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much more extensively received . Banks of circulation derive their profits from issuing paper money to an extent far beyond the amount of metallic capital , on which it is based , and as they generally unite the business of offices of discount and deposit with that of emitting notes , they are enabled to give their own paper , not hearing interest , for bills of exchange and the notes of individuals , which are not yet due , and from the amount of which the interest is deducted in advance . Experience soon shows , that where a bank enjoys undoubted credit , little apprehension need be entertained that it will be called on to redeem , in specie , the whole amount of its paper , before an opportunity is afforded of converting into gold and silver the securities on which the loans are negotiated . If , before the introduction of bank notes , there were forty millions of coin in circulation , and a paper , convertible at pleasure into gold and silver , had been substituted as the medium of exchange , twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller amount , would have been sufficient to meet every demand . An important saving might thus have been effected . Twenty millions of value would have been sent out of the country and replaced by productive capital , which would greatly augment the nation s command over the comforts and conveniences of life . The quantity of currency required in a business community is also greatly diminished by the habit of substituting for gold and silver , or paper money , drafts or checks on bankers , drawn against previous deposits . The whole amount , however , of bank deposits can not be considered as belonging to the circu .. lating medium ; for it often happens , that they are not made to be drawn out for further transactions or daily expenditures , but to await opportunities for permanent investments . The difficulty of ascertaining what portion of the deposits , and of the private bills of exchange , perform the functions of money , renders it , therefore , almost impossible to state with accuracy the aggregate of what may properly be termed the currency , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain from the issue of paper money was too tempting to be resisted by sovereigns , and we find that nearly every power of Christendom has had recourse to it as a financial arrangement . Unrestrained , however , by the checks // that may be applied to individuals only ,  --  the true rules that should regulate the quantity of the currency ,  --  they have made their own necessities the only limits of their issues . But , before illustrating this part of our subject by a reference to examples , it may be well to inquire how it happens , that paper money , altogether destitute of intrinsic value , exchanges for commodities , in which labor is realized . If the circulation of a country be , for example , $20,000,000 , the value of any part of which bears a definite relation to that of any given commodity , according to the amounts of labor respectively realized in the gold and silver , or in the merchandise for which it serves as a measure , and a paper money of the same precise amount and denomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result ? It is evident , that the whole quantity of the new currency being equal to the entire amount of the old , while the articles to be measured remain the same , each paper dollar must bear the same relation to any commodity , that the coin previously did . The currency becomes limited in amount , as in cases of monopoly ; and the principle of demand and supply governs , if so much paper be issued , as to increase the money of the country beyond the amount of the circulating medium , which would have been employed , had gold and silver continued to constitute the currency , it is equally apparent , that it will become degraded in value . On the other hand , if the paper money be less in amount than the metallic , which it replaces , every dollar of paper currency will exchange for more commodities than the gold or silver , which it replaces , previously did . If we refer to the monetary system of different States , we shall find , that the depreciation of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . Law , whose chimerical projects were adopted by the Government of Louis XV. , contended , that the augmentation of the currency had solely the effect of reducing the rate of interest , and that its increased amount would he absorbed by the new channels of industry , to which it would give rise . The attempt to carry these views into practice , soon drove from circulation all the gold and silver coin , and the excessive issues of paper degraded the notes so far below their nominal value , that the Government , in order to give them a forced currency , resorted , without effect , to the most arbitrary measures . By one decree , every person was prohibited from keeping in his possession // more than five hundred livres in specie , or any articles of gold and silver , under penalty of confiscation of the excess , and ten thousand livres . Making a payment of one hundred livres or upwards , except in notes , was also severely punished . After having put in circulation upwards of twenty-two hundred and thirty-five millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three times its former amount , the coin that had previously served as currency having only amounted to eight hundred millions of livres , the operation of Law 's schemes terminated in an almost universal bankruptcy . In the words of Sir James Stuart , a man with a hundred millions of bank notes might have starved in the street . ' The effects on public and private credit , which were produced at a later period , by the issue of the French assignats , were not less calamitous . Some idea may be formed of the consequences of the unlimited emission of this irredeemable paper , when it is recollected , that from the meeting of the Constituent Assembly to the adoption of the Constitution of 95 , assignats were put in circulation for the sum of forty-five thousand five hundred and eighty-one millions of livres , * and that such was their degradation in value , that at the latter period , a note for one hundred livres exchanged for three sous six deniers of metallic money . The effect of the depreciation on individuals , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , has been thus forcibly described by a continental writer . When the assignats had fallen more than fifty per cent. , when terror had got possession of the public , and when all hope had been abandoned of bringing the paper to par , the unfortunate creditors of the State saw themselves abandoned to all the horrors of constantly increasing misery . Every day their revenues became more and more inadequate to furnish the necessaries of life ; public charity was destroyed by the universal wretchedness . These unfortunate beings , with haggard eyes , with cheeks hollow from famine , wandered through the streets soliciting compassion ; and after vain efforts , threw themselves every evening into the Seine ; and escaped by suicide the most frightful of all calamities , - death from hunger . ' t The experiment in France did not stop with the assignats. * The present amount of the French currency is estimated at from two thousand to two thousand five hundred millions of francs . j Storch . Cours d ' Economnie Politique , Tom . IV . p. 163. // It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand four hundred millions of maudats territorieux , based upon the security of the royal and other confiscated domains , and a part of the old emissions was also absorbed by a forced loan from those who had any property left , to the amount of six hundred millions in coin ; in the subscription , one hundred francs in paper being received for one of metallic money . This expedient was the means of withdrawing fourteen thousand millions of francs from circulation . The new bills of credit , emitted without any reference to the principles which regulate the current value of money , soon shared the fate of the assignats , and in the course of a few months one hundred livres of paper fell to one livre , ten sous of coin . Such , indeed , has ever since been the feeling of the French nation with regard to paper morley , that the National Bank , which alone issues notes for circulation , is restricted to those of the denomination of five hundred and a thousand francs , and these are only current as money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cited from the history of the other continental powers ; but England and our own country afford sufficient instances of the various experiments that may be made to regulate the currency . The inconvertible , depreciated , and fluctuating currency , which , for the first quarter of the present century , served as the standard of value in Great Britain , was issued under the name of a commercial company ; hut the restriction on cash payments in 1797 , followed up , as it was , by the acts of Parliament , that made Bank of England notes virtually a legal tender for all debts , gave to them most of the defects of a government paper money . Though , for the reasons that will be hereafter mentioned , the depreciation was not contemporaneous with Mr. Pitt 's Order in Council , to that measure may be traced that degradation of the English currency , which , through the foreign exchanges , was felt in every part of the commercial world . But it is hardly necessary to have recourse to other nations for an illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our ancestors seem to have been as intent on the retention of specie , as any of the advocates of the mercantile theory . With this view , the colonists degraded the denomination of the coin , and made given quantities of tbose metals pass for greater sums than in the mother country . We have here the origin of the local currencies of the different // States , which the decimal money of the Union has not entirely driven from our books of account , and which are still employed in small transactions . As might have been expected , the result of this absurd expedient was , that the price of all goods from the mother country rose exactly in proportion , as they raised the denomination of their coin , so that their gold and silver were exported as fast as ever. ** Most of the Provincial Legislatures also issued notes , which were not payable on presentation , but only after the expiration of several years . This system , for which the expenses incurred by the war against the French in Canada was sometimes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cause of no inconsiderable disputes between the Assemblies and the Governors of the Colonies appointed by the Crown . The rate of exchange and the price of all commodities , ' says an American historian , soon disclosed the political truth , that however the quantity of the circulating medium might be augmented , its aggregate value could not he arbitrarily increased ; and that the effect of such a depreciating currency must necessarily be , to discourage the payment of debts , by holding out the hope of discharging contracts with less than the sum actually contracted for ; and to substitiiie a species of cunning and of speculation for honest and regular industry . ' t It is an ungrateful theme to trace the successive degrees of degradation which the money of our revolution , as well that of the States as of the General Congress , underwent , till it became so depreciated as not to bring in specie the hundredth part of its nominal value . If there be any case which would seem to justify the violation of private rights for the attainment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an effort for its independent existence . Many of the remarks , however , which have been made in reference to the assignats of France will apply to our continental money . Indeed , the sense of the people of the United States with respect to a paper currency , not based on any adequate security , may be observed in the extreme caution , that led to the provisions in our Constitution prohibiting the States to emit bills of credit , ' or make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in the payment of debts . ' * Smith 's Wealth of Nations , Vol . I. p. 232. t Marshall 's Life of Washington , Vol . I. p. 345. // We have dilated rather more on the evils incident to a gqveminent paper than xve should have considered necessary in the present state of public opinion , were it not for a proposition on this subject contained in the Executive Messages , alluded to at the commencement of this article . The President , in the first of these documents , after expressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of the United States , submits to the wisdom of the Legislature , whether a national one , founded upon the credit of the Government and its revenues , might not be devised , which would avoid all constitutional difficulties ; and , at the same time , secure all the advantages to the Government and country that were expected to result from the present bank . ' It has been already stated , that by the substitution of money without intrinsic value , for gold and silver , a gain accrues to the issuers of paper , equal to the amount of the difference between the expense of furnishing the one medium and of maintaining the other . A posthumous tract of Mr. Ricardo contains a plan of a currency , by which the profit of emitting paper-money would be received by the Government. * But , though convertibility into coin was made the security against over-issues , so sensible was this distinguished economist of the danger of abuses , that it was a fundamental principle in his project , that the commissioners , by whom it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The views of Mr. Ricardo , as far as xve can learn , were never brought forward by any member of Parliament ; and the power of making papermoney is one , which , in case of financiafembarrassrnents , could not safely be exercised by the Executive or Legislature of any country in the universe . We should consider the gain that might arise to the nation from the substitution of government paper for the whole of the existing currency , but a poor compensation for the risk that we should thereby incur , of seeing a renewal of the horrible catastrophes attendant on the French assign ats , or even on our own Continental paper . ' The inexpediency of adopting in the United States the measure under consideration , can not be better shown , than in the language of one of the Reports before us . The resort to the issue of a paper money , has been often the * Plan for the establishment of a National Bank , by David Ricardo , Esq . Al . P. London . 1824. // desperate expedient of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justification only in the necessity which created it ; yet such are its inevitable evils , that every prudent government has , the moment its pressing exigencies permitted , returned to the only safe basis of a circulating medium , the precious metals , and the private credits attached to the use of them . Such were the expedients of the Government of the United States during its two wars ; such its immediate abandonment of them at the return of peace . But , in the present condition of the Treasury of the United States , with a revenue far beyond its wants , with a debt almost nominal , and hastenin* to its entire extinguishment , such a measure is not needed by the interests of the Government , nor is there the slightest indication of its being demanded by the wants of the country . Of such an issue of paper-money , the Executive at Washington would be the natural fountain ,  --  the agents of the Executive , the natural channels . The individuals , and corporations , and States , who borrowed it , must become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , the creation of a monied engine of direct dependence on the officers of Government , at variance with the whole scheme of our institut*ons . The limit to which this currency should be issued , the persons to whom it should be lent , the securities taken for its repayment , the places where it should be redeemed , involve great complication and great hazard , regarding it merely in a financial point of view , while , on more enlarged considerations of political expediency , the objections to it are , in the opinion of the committee , insuperable and fatal . ' Jilir . Smith 's Report . XVe have hitherto considered the proposition of the President as referring merely to the issue of government paper . Supposing it , as Mr. MeDuffie does , to have been the intention of the Executive to sug* est the establishment of a bank of discount and deposit , founded on the credit and revenues of the Government , tho objections to the measure are infinitely multiplied . Without inquiring whether such an institution could afford the facilities now furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public , it may be remarked , that , while all the arguments against a paper currency remain in full force , the considerations of a political character , against such a course , are quite conclusive . On the increase of patronage , to which the proposed measure would lead , the Committee of Ways and T* ? enns remark : The Bank of the United tates now employs five hundred agents , in the various parts of the Union where its offices are // established . From this fact some idea may be formed of the very great addition which would be made to the patronage of the Executive Government by the establishment of such a bank as the one under consideration . But the patronage resulting from the appointinent ,  --  the annual appointment ,  --  of these agents , great as it would doubtless be , would be insignificant and harmless , when compared with that which would result from the dispensation of bank accommodations to the standing amount of at least fifty millions of , dollars . The mind almost instinctively shrinks from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government and the liberties of the people . No Government , of which the Committee have any knowledge , except perhaps the despotism of Russia , was ever invested with a patronage at once so prodigious in its influence and so dangerous in its character . In the most desperate financial extremities , no other European Government has ever ventured upon an experiment so perilous . If the whole patronage of the English monarchy were concentrated in the hands of the American Executive , it may be well doubted , whether the public liberty would be so much endangered by it as it would be by this vast pecuniary machine , which would place in the hands of every administration fifty millions of dollars , as a fund for rewarding political partisans . ' Mr. McDuJJie 's Report . Nor are the objections to the proposed measure materially diminished by the modifications , which it received in the Executive Message at the commencement of the second session of the last Congress . It is thought practicable , ' says the President , to organize such a bank , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on the public and individual deposits , without power to make loans or purchase property , which shall remit the funds of the Government ; and the expenses of which may be paid , if thought advisable , by allowing its officers to sell bills of exchange to private individuals at a moderate premium . ' The States , ' he proceeds to observe , would be strengthened , by having in their hands the means of furnishing the local paper currency through their own banks ; while the Bank of the United States , though issuing no paper , would check the issues of the State banks , by taking their notes in deposit and for exchange , only so long as they continue to be redeemed with specie . ' The power over the currency , delegated by the Constitution to Congress for xvise purposes , is here entirely abandoned . The new plan does not profess to hold out any preventive // 544 April , checks to the excessive issues ,  --  almost the sole possible cause of the insolvency ,  --  of local institutions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they continue to be redeemed with specie , and only to refuse them after the mischief is effected , and after the failure of the banks , accompanied by the ruin of thousands of innocent victims , has occurred . In the concluding clause of the paragraph from which we have quoted , it is said , that in times of public emergency , the capacities of such an institution might be enlarged by legislative provisions ; ' and we here find means reserved for the renewal of the scheme of the preceding year , with all its attendant consequences . Suppose a war to occur , or the Government on other accounts to be subjected to financial embarrassments , and we shall have at once an irredeemable paper-money , indefinite in quantity , and issued by a few officers ' of the Treasury ; who , it is to be feared , under every administration , will be selected more with reference to their qualities as political partisans , than because they possess the talents appropriate to their stations as Bank Directors . As to the profits which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the result of a similar experiment in the State of Tennessee , with which the President is immediately connected , furnishes abundant evidence . How far our merchants would relish a system of banking , which should intrust the dispensing of money accommodations to the postmasters and custom-house officers of their respective towns exclusively , we shall not here stop to inquire . In the course of the preceding remarks , it has been observed , that the only true means to keep paper-money at the same value with gold and silver , which it represents , is to limit its amount to that of the metallic money that would have otherwise circulated . How to do this practically , is an important question ; for as the demands of trade vary , what might be a proper quantity at one period , may be very improper *t another . Convertibility into gold and silver is the most effectual mode that can be devised . Agreeably to the principles established above , whenever the redundancy of paper money exceeds certain limits , it becomes the interest of the holder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one particular country , but of the world , has an exchangeable value , independent of that of the local currency . As convertibility is only a means to the attainment of an end , viz , that of regulating the quantity of the currency , it is not necessary that this money should be // exchanged for coin , in order to be free from all fluctuations , which are not incident to the standard itself . On the suggestion of Mr. Ricardo , it was therefore provided by the British act of 1819 , commonly called Mr. Peel 's bill , that the Bank of England should be required to deliver uncoined gold and silver at the mint standard and price , in exchange for their notes , instead of guineas ; and , on the other hand , to prevent the rise of bank paper above the value of bullion , the Bank was to be obliged to receive its paper in exchange for standard gold , at a price somewhat lower than that at which it was proposed to pay gold , when demanded for notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wear of the metals , which amount to a large annual sum , would have been in a great measure saved ; while the quantity of specie necessary to be retained unproductively , might be greatly diminished . In practice , ' says an able English economist , Mr. Ricardo 's plan worked extremely well . While the over-issue of paper was effectually prevented , only a very few bars were demanded of the Bank ; and it was generally supposed , that , instead of its operation being prematurely checked , it would have been rendered perpetual , and the farther circulation of gold coins prevented . ' But , whatever may be the mode by which it is effected , it is of the utmost importance , with a view of preventing ruinous fluctuations in the property of every individual in the community , that the circulating medium should have a counteracting principle within itself . ' The consequence of disregarding this necessary precaution , in the issue of government paper money , has been sufficiently discussed , and it is hoped , that enough has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replete as it is with the most serious evils , both political and economical , and now repudi*tted even by its author . The embarrassments growing out of a currency , inconvertible into the metals , of which it is the nominal representative , and unrestricted as to quantity , though issued on the credit of private corporations and individuals , formed , at the period of its establishment , one of the most efficient motives for chartering the present Bank of the United States . A recurrence to the monetary system of that day , and a comparison of the state of the currency in 1814-15 with its present condition , will best enable us to judge how far the anticipations of the founders of the institution have been accomplished . // The annals of the Bank of England , whose paper became in 1797 , as we have seen , by the interference of the Executive , and subsequently of the Legislature , a compulsory government paper currency , rather than a money of confidence , will show that , by restricting its quantity , it was kept for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , for three years its notes even bore a small premium over gold . Though the directors professed to be governed by principles , that would have authorized their discounting the notes of all solvent dealers , they seem for a long time to have disregarded the great gains that they might have obtained from issuing their inconvertible paper to an indefinite extent . But , as they did not keep in view the relation which the price of their paper bore to that of gold , they gradually extended their issues , so that between 1809 and 1814 , the notes of the Bank of England fell from ten to twenty-five per cent . discount , and they were at one time thirty per cent . below par . In 1810 , there were fortysix millions of paper-money in circulation in England , twentythree millions of which were notes of the National Bank , while in 1797 , the whole currency did not exceed thirty millions , of which ten millions were Bank of England notes , and twenty millions coin , there being then no country paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bank paper was of course apparent in the nominal prices of exchange in every part of the world . Being but imperfectly understood , it had a great influence on the currency of other countries , where paper-money served as the ordinary medium of exchange , and contributed to induce with us , in the absence of a National Bank to supply a salutary check , that improvident augmentation of bank notes , which resulted in 1813-14 , in the suspension of specie payments every where , except in the Eastern States . In the other parts of the Union , scarcely any two towns had the same currency . In the Southern and Western States , the depreciation in some instances even exceeded twenty-five per cent . Not only was an accurate knowledge of the nominal exchange of the day necessary , before making purchases at a distant place , but a traveller , proceeding from the South or West towards the North or East , even if be were so fortunate as to have his money received at all , could not adjust his reckoning at an inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which his bank notes were to be subjected , or till he had had recourse to the interposition of a broker . // In 1813 , when gold and silver were paid on demand , the currency of the United States , without including specie in the vaults , was about seventy millions , of which sixty-two millions were in bank notes . Such was its rapid increase after the withdrawing of the salutary check ,  --  the liability to pay gold and silver ,  --  that in 1815 , only two years afterwards , it amounted to one hundred and ten millions. * The currency was probably augmented during the ensuing year , and as , owing to the great demand for specie growing out of the general war , it rose in value relatively to these commodities , the redundancy of paper was even still greater than it nominally appears to have been . As in case of the derangement of the currency , the evil is two fold , viz. 1st. that arising from the depreciation , and , 2dly. the equally great one resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthful state is attended with nearly the same consequences as the first degradation , if , on account of the diminished value of the circulating medium , a creditor be compelled to accept one half of his debt ; when the fluctuations are of an opposite character , twice as much in value may be exacted from the debtor , as he ever received or promised to pay . We may , then , judge of the embarrassments , which must have been occasioned by the reduction of the currency of the United States in the three years between 1816 and 1819 , from one hundred and ten millions to forty-five millions.t As it was all important to debtors to pay in a depreciated currency , and was furthermore the interest of the local banks , as evinced by the high dividends *We have followed in our estimates the statements given by Mr. Crawford , in 1820 , and adopted as the basis of the calculations of the Committee of Ways and Means . It must , however , be admitted that the data furnished by the Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article , we have seen a paper drawn up by an authority whose accuracy can not well be questioned , in which the sums in the text are considerably diminished . Mr. Gallatin considers the bank notes in circulation in 1811 , to have been less than $30,000,000 , in 1816 , about 70,000,000 , and in 1820 , about $45,000,000 . It is also to be observed , that , in stating the amount of the currency at these several periods , we are to add to the first and third sums the coins which circulated concurrently with them , all of which were of course excluded from use , except in the Eastern States , during the depreciation of the bank notes . In adopting , however , even the lowest estimates , we assi*n ample cause for the depreciation of our paper currency . Or , according to Mr. Gallatia , from *370,000,000 to 45,000,000. // then made , to put in circulation as much paper as possible , for the redemption of which they felt themselves under no obligation to provide , it was very apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The stockholders , it is true , received their profits in a depreciated money , but when the dividends were raised from six to twenty per cent. , even the degradation of the currency to one half of its nominal value was , under that point of view , a minor consideration . Such indeed were the consequences to individuals , as well as to the institutions themselves , of the resumption of specie payments by the banks , that numerous schemes were suggested both here and in England for the establishment of permanent paper currencies . The House of Representatives called on the Secretary of the Treasury , by a resolution of March J st. 1819 , to report such a plan ; hut it is due to Mr. Crawford to state , that , although he complied with the directions referred to , and presented a view of the least obnoxious mode in which a paper-money could he issued , he conclusively showed the superiority of a metallic currency convertible at pleasure into specie . He also expressed his entire conviction , that a papermoney under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassments of that section of the country , which called most loudly for such a measure . Congress refused to interpose in the case , and thus left to the Bank of the United States , which they had incorporated in 1816 , and which , from the provisions of its charter and the expectation of the nation , was necessarily a specie-paying institution , the burden of raising a depreciated currency to the value of gold and silver . Many of the early measures of the Bank were not , it is hertam , of the wisest character ; but the stockholders themselves suffered severely by the improvidence and fraudulent conduct of their first agents , and at no time since this institution went into operation , have its notes been dishonored . The expense and difficulties incurred by the Bank of the United States in establishing and upholding a specie currency , are clearly shown in an Exposition , ' made by Mr. Cheves in 1822 , a short time before resigning the Presidency , of which we shall freely avail ourselves . When the National Bank went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency did not sustain an // equality with gold and silver . Its notes were every where received in payment of duties and taxes to the Government , without reference to the place of emission , and were redeemed in specie , at the banks , or any of its offices . It labored under the disadvantage , not only of issuing notes at a time when the currency in the specie-paying districts exceeded the coin , which would have circulated , and of being , therefore , constantly called on for gold and silver ; but it sustained the still greater inconvenience of circulating notes , 1 ) ayable at pleasure in gold and silver , at places where a large portion of the medium of exchange was composed of inconvertible paper . This constituted the foundation of the suspended debt in the States of Ohio and Kentucky , which , at one time , exceeded six millions of dollars ; though a considerable portion of it has been gradually liqnidated by the sale of real estate , taken as security . The notes issued in the Western States were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie was rapidly drawn from the Bank ; the Bank and the great Northern offices were constantly drained of their metallic capital , and only eighteen months after the institution began its operations , it was oblio'ed to commence a rapid and heavy curtailment ' of b its business . Thoi4gh the Bank enjoyed a government deposit of eight m illions ,  --  though specie had been imported at an expense exceeding half a million of dollars ,  --  though curtailments of upwards of six millions and a half were made , between the 30th of July , 1818 , and of April , 1819 ,  --  it was further obliged , in order to continue si ) ecie payments and maintain the metallic currency of the country , to sell hetween two and three millions of its public debt , and in various ways to attain the command of disposable means by reductions of its productive capital , within eight months , to the amount of upwards of eight millions of dollars . In addition to these financial difficulties , the curtailments at the West rendered the Bank unpopular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all those embarrassments , which the hostility of State authorities is capable of interposing . Yet , in spite of all the various obstacles with which it has had to contend , the Bank has , in the language of one of the Reports before us , actually furnished a circulating medium more un*forrn than specie . Funds may be removed from one part of the Union to another , through the aid which the Bank affords , at an expense not exceeding one half , and frequently // less than one quarter of the cost of carrying silver . While , by the discretion of its present managers , no inconsiderable portion of the property supposed to have been sacrificed by their predecessors has been secured for its stockholders , the benefits of the institution are now most fully appreciated in those States , where every expedient , a few years since , was resorted to in order to expel its offices from their territorial limits . In Ohio , Kentucky , Indiana , Illinois , and Missouri , the Bank of the United States enjoys , with unimportant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present prosperous situation , compared with the incessant bankruptcies attendant on their former condition , is , after the equalization of the currency , the best commentary on the good that the Bank has effected . Even since this institution has been placed under the ban of the Executive , Mississippi has repealed a law adverse to the National Bank , and invited a branch within the State , a course in which Tennessee had led the way . The natural rate of exchange between two places , is the expense of transporting specie from one to the other , and this would exist , supposing the circulation of both to be equally well supplied , and their currencies estimated at the true par . For the Bank to undertake to redeem indiscriminately , at all its offices , the notes issued by the mother Bank and its various branches , would be to assume the expense of transporting silver and gold from one point of the Union to another , for the accommodation , not of the Government or the public in general , but of any individual who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden , to which it is not subjected either by the tertns of its charter or the expectations of its founders , is supposed to have been the basis of the Executive charge against it . What it has accomplished on this head , however , may be learned from the statements of the Congressional Committees . These notes ( the notes of the National Bank ) are receivable for the Government , by the nine thousand receivers , scattered throughout every part of the country . They are in fact , in the course of business , paid in gold or silver , though they are not legaily , or necessarily so paid , by the branches of the Bank in every section of the Union . In all commercial places they are received , in all transactions , without any reduction in value , and never , under any circumstances , does the paper , from the remotest branches , vary beyond a quarter of one per cent . in its actual ex* // change for silver . Here , then , is a currency as safe as silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , through the whole Western and Southern , and interior parts of the Union , is eagerly sought in exchange for silver ; which in those sections , often bears a premium paid in silver ; which is throughout the Union equal to silver in payments to the Government and payments to individuals in business , and which , whenever silver is needed in any part of the country , will command it , without the charge of more than a slight fraction of a per percentage . By means of this currency , funds are transmitted at an expense less than in any other country . In no other country can a merchant do what every citizen of the United States can do-deposit , for instance , his silver at St. Louis , or Nashville , or New Orleans , and receive notes , which he can carry with him a thousand or fifteen hundred miles , to the Atlantic cities , and there receive for them an equivalent amount of silver , without any expense whatever ; and in no possible event , an expense beyond a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen does not wish to incur the anxiety of carrying these notes with him , or to run the hazard of the mail , he may , instead of them , receive a draft , payable to himself or his agent alone , so as to ensure the receipt of an equal amount , at an expense of not one half , and often not one fourth , of the actual cost of carrying the silver . The owner of funds , for instance , at St. Louis or Nashville , can transfer them to Philadelphia for one half per cent. ; from New Orleans , generally , without any charge at all-at most , one half per cent. ; from Mobile , from par to one half per cent. ; from Savannah , at one half per cent. ; and from Charleston , at from par to one quarter per cent . ' - Mr . Smith 's Report . If the whole circulating medium were specie , a planter of Louisiana , who should desire to purchase merchandise in Philadelphia , would be obliged to pay one per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for the transportation and insurance of his specie . His specie at New Orleans , where he had no present use for it , would be worth one per cent . less to him than it would be in Philadelphia , where he had a demand for it . But , by the aid of the Bank of the United States , one half of the expense of transporting specie is now saved to him . The Bank , for one half of one per cent . will give him a draft upon the mother Bank of Philadelphia , with which he can draw either the bills of that Bank , or specie , at his pleasure . In like manner , the Bank and its branches will give drafts from any point of the Union to any other where offices exist , at a per percentage greatly less than it would cost to transport specie , and in many instances at par . If the merchant or planter , however , does not choose to purchase a draft // from the Bank , but prefers transmitting the bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for commercial purposes , although these bills are not strictly redeemable at the point to which they are transmitted , yet , as they are receivable in payment of all dues to the Government , persons will be generally found willing to take them at par ; and if they should not , the Bank will receive them frequently at par , and always at a discount much less than would pay the expense of transporting specie . ' It may be confidently asserted , that no country in the world has a circulating medium of greater uniformity than the United States ; and that no country of any thing like the same geographical extent , has a currency at all comparable to that of the United States on the score of uniformity . The Committee have seen the statement of an intelligent traveller , who has visited almost every part of Europe , exhibiting the great variations of the currency in different parts of the same empire or kingdom . In Russia , the bills of the bank of St. Petersburgh have a very limited circulation . At Riga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern parts of the empire , the currency is exclusively of silver coins . In Denmark , the notes of the Bank of Copenhagen are current only in Zealand , the other islands , and Jutland , but will not pass at all in Sleswick and Holstein , which constitute the best portion of the kingdom . Since the Congress of Vienna , Germany has been divided into thirty-nine separate States , each having a distinct currency , though represented in the Diet at Frank fort . Out of the territory in which these several currencies are issued , they are mere articles of merchandise ; which circumstance has given rise in every town to a numerous and distinct class of tradesmen , called money-changers. how far those separate and unconnected currencies have a tendency to embarrass commerce , may be inferred from the fact , that a traveller going from St. Petersburgh to Calais will lose upon the unavoidable changes of money an average of six per cent . In France , the bills of the bank are of such large denominations as to be adapted only to the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers and extensive traders in Paris . The general currency is silver ; and to avoid the trouble of carrying this to distant parts of the kingdom , gold pieces , or bills of exchange , which are preferable , are purchased at a premium of from one and a half to four per cent . After this brief review of the currencies of Europe , the Committee will barely state , as a conclusive vindication of our currency from the imputation of unsoundness , that there is no point in the Union , at which a bill of the United States Bank , issued at the opposite extremity of the country , is at a discount of more than one fourth of one per cent . - Mr. *IcDuJJie 's Report . // It is within the recollection of the writer of this article , that even *t Havre , within a day 's journey of the capital and its principal port of entry , the notes of the Bank of Fibance are not received in ordinary transactions , but are sold at a discount . It can , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President , it is true , in 1 829 , considered the charge of a small commission for the transmission of the funds of individuals from one part of the Union to another , of sufficient importance to authorize him to declare , that the Bank had failed in the great end of establishing a uniform and sound currency ; ' but inasmuch as the sale of hills of exchange is made the most prominent feature of the Treasury Bank , as new modelled in 1830 , we have a right to conclude that the Executive has been convinced by the discussions of the last year , that he had previously fallen into an involuntary error respecting the naturc of such operations . The benefit , which we derive from the Bank , does not stop with its supplying a sound and uniform currency ; it exercises a most salutary influence in restraining the excessive issues of local institutions ,  --  the effect of whose overtrading must always recoil on their unfortunate dealers . A currency , it is true , can not he , for a long period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is convertible on demand into specie , it becomes the interest of the bullion-merchants to export the coin , whenever it has a higher value than the notes with which it is concurrently employed ; in the same way as when one metal is estimated higher than the other at the mint , the one which is comparatively underrated is withdrawn from use as money . It was from overlooking this principle , that Mr. McDuffie was induced* to suppose , that when paper money became so redundant as to expel gold and silver from circulation , the depreciation from the excessive issues would affect the specie as well as the inconvertible paper . It is obvious , that in the case stated , gold and silver are no more parts of the circulating medium than precious stones or other merchandise , and that their only connexion with it , is to serve as a measure of its depreciation . The consequences of an over-issue being the exportation of bullion , the banks are obliged , in order to avoid a drain of // their metallic capital , either to curtail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of the last war , in all the States South and West of Connecticut , shows that when there is a common agreement among the issuers of money , the power of demanding specie is but a dead letter . By law , most of our State institutions were liable to be called on for coin ; but what was the popular feeling towards those few individuals , who resorted to their rights and asked the banks to fulfil their promises ? The conduct pursued by these institutions , was , probably , unavoidable . No one of them possessing a controlling influence over the others , there was no means of regulating the quamity of paper put into circulation , and while every thing that purported to be money was indiscriminately received , the redundancy affected all notes alike , and even the specie , as long as it circulated concurrently with them . But , even when an over-issue does not lead to the extreme measure of suspending specie payments , the embarrassment , caused by an excessive curtailment to all commercial enterprises , is frequently of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities are exposed where paper circulates with coin , and such is the liability of all institutions of limited means to be destroyed by the panic , which is too likely to attend a reduction of discounts and a demand for specie , that it has ofien been made a question , whether the economy arising from a paper currency is not more than counterbalanced by the fluctuations in trade , which its use occasions . In illustration of the truth of this position , the greater stability of French commerce , as compared with that of England , has frequently been cited . But , without entering into an examination of this point , it may be confidently asserted , that to sustain a system of paper currency and afford relief for the imprudence of minor institutions , that salutary superintendence , which is virtually exercised by great banks like those of England and the United States , is essentially necessary . Of the benefit that resulted from the interposition of the Bank of England , we have an example in I 825 . The country hankers had engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . more paper in circulation than in 1823 . To this great redundancy , necessarily succeeded heavy drains of bullion , terminating in the failure of seventy establishments . How ruinous the reduction of the currency // attendant on these transactions would have been , without the application of the resources of a great institution , may he judged of by the fact , that the vacuum , caused by the withdrawal of these country notes , * absorbed from eight to ten millions of additional issues of the Bank . Had there not been such resources at hand , applied as well to the relief of the bankers themselves as of the merchants , the difficulty of procuring accommodation , under so extraordinary a contraction of the currency , must have ruined hundreds of commercial houses of the most undoubted- solvency . Similar instances of the judicious interposition of the Bank of the United States , by affording relief to State institutions in various parts of the Union , will readily occur to all , who are conversant with our banking operations . Not only has the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what is still more beneficial to the community , it has been applied , in innumerable cases , to prevent their occurrence . The statement of the mode in which the Bank regulates its dealings with the State institutions , as pointed out by the enlightened gentleman , now at the head of its concerns , has not been , as far as we are aware , questioned in any competent quarter . The great object , says Mr. Biddle , is to keep the State banks within proper limits ; to make them shape their business according to their means . For this purpose they are called upon to settle ; never forced to pay specie , if it can be avoided , but payment is taken in their bills of exchange , or suffered to lie occasionally until the bank can turn round ; no amount of debt is fixed , because the principle we wish to establish is , that every bank should always be ready to provide for its notes . ' That the banks in our principal cities , and even those of the Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the Bank of the United States should cease to exist , may well be admitted , without impairing the importance of that institution , as a check against the ruinous consequences of extravagant issues in those parts of the country , where the nature of paper-money is less perfectly understood . But not only have the rules , which control the monetary system , been disregarded in Tennessee and Kentucky , but we find in the // legislation of the largest arid most commercial State of the Union , a project , evincing scarcely less ignorance of banking , than the chimerical schemes of our fellow-citizens at the West , so often held up to general animadversion . Our readers will understand us as alluding to the Safety Fund , introduced in 1829 , in the State of New York , during the administration of Governor Van Buren . By the act referred to , all the banks are made , to a certain extent , partners and guarantees for one another , though in their management they are separate and independent . This system not only confounds frugality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contributions to the funds , on which insolvencies are chargeable , are regulated by the amount of the respective capitals , riot of the circulation of the banks , the scheme carries unfairness on its face . It is obvious that it is much less probable that a bank of one million , issuing paper to the extent of one hundred thousand dollars , will fail to meet its engagements , than a bank of one hundred thousand dollars issuing notes to the same amount , and yet the latter pays for the privilege ten times the tax of the former . The time has not yet arrived for the full developement of the effects of this measure . It may , however , be predicted , that , as it will give the same or nearly the same credit to the banks of the smallest capitals , as to those of the city of New York , the former institutions will be induced to issue their notes to an inordinate extent , not on regular business paper , the repayment of which would meet the calls for the redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of indefinite duration . But while these excessive issues will degrade the value of the whole currency , as well specie as paper , and by rendering the exchange unfavorable , lead to the exportation of gold and silver , the institutions in good credit will be afraid to apply the efficient corrective ,  --  a demand for specie , lest it should produce a declared insolvency , which they , not the culprit banks , would in the end be obliged to make good . Prudent banks finding that they are taxed for the improvidence of their neighbors , will also take the chance of profiting by fortunate speculations , the hazards of which they must , in any event , necessarily incur , and thus , especially if the United States Bank should not be rechartered , the whole monetary system may be thrown into inextricable confusion . This topic is here introduced , to show that , even where // there is apparently the least danger , we have much to apprehend from hasty and prejudiced legislation . What has occurred ( l in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reflect on the injury that may result from twenty-four districts and unconnected bodies operating through three hundred and fifty banks unchecked , on the currency , and varying its value , by incessantly altering its quantity , we may be disposed to admit the wisdom of placing it , even at the sacrifice of some State pride , under one general authority . 3 . The dealing in foreign exchange is a business , which has excited much hostility against the Bank in some of our commercial cities ; but , though transactions of this sort are not essentially requisite to enable the institution to support a uniform and sound currency , ' it is believed , that while they are powerful auxiliaries to that end , they are also productive of many direct benefits . We have already seen , that where paper is convertible into specie on demand , an excessive issue degrades not only the bank notes , but also the coin circulating concurrently with them , which leads to a drain of the metallic money and its exportation , till such time as , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , the occasional exportation of specie can not be prevented by the best regulations which can be adopted . Even when the quantity of the currency remains the same , the vicissitudes of harvests , and the political and other causes , which affect the state of the exchanges , must lead to the exportation of gold and silver , when they can be sent abroad more advantageously than other commodities . It is , therefore , evident that the metallic basis for the circulation , must vary according to the demands for specie to which a bank is liable . The statements made by many of the local institutions of our country , do not represent their specie as exceeding in amount the sixth or seventh part of their circulalion , and in many cases , it is even less than in the proportion of one to ten . The present entire circulation of the United States has been estimated by Mr. Gallatin , at $73,500,000 , including $10,000,000 in silver coins and bank drafts , issued by the United States Bank and its branches , and excluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sustained by specie in the vaults , and which is not comprised in the above calculations , to the amount of $22,000,000 . To an establishment , which , like the Banks of // England and the United States , is the ultimate regulator of the currency , and which , without possessing the monopoly of circulation , is liable to have specie demanded in consequence of the over-issues of other banks , a large amount of gold and silver is absolutely requisite . Even the Bank of France , which is exposed to but little inconvenience from the redundancy of the currency , as paper does not form a part of the ordinary circulating medium , had , in 1828 , a specie reserve of from one hundred and eighty to two hundred millions , to sustain an emission val ) *ing from one hundred and ninety to two hundred and thirty millions . The Bank of England generally retains specie in its vaults to one half the amount of the notes which it is liable to be called on to redeem , and when , in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced so as to be equal only to the one seventh part of the bills in circulation , a suspension of payments was deemed necessary . The published statements of the Bank of the United States will show a still greater proportion of specie , as compared with notes , than is possessed by the English institution . But as , when specie is drawn from the vaults , it must he because it is more in demand abroad than at home , our National Bank is enabled , by dealing in foreign exchange , to dispense with some portion of the gold and silver , which would otherwise be kept in an unproductive state . It appears from the papers before us , that the Bank had on April 1st , 1830 , $9,043,748 in specie , and funds in Europe to the extent of $2,789,498 , which are justly considered in the estimate as equivalent to specie ; for in case of a depreciation arising from a redundancy of the currency , no one wishing gold or silver for exportation , would refuse to take a draft from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paris ; nor would the relief from this source be limited to the mere extent of its actual balances abroad . Its credit would , and often has enabled it to draw bills vastly beyond the amount of its deposits with Baring &amp; ilottinguer , to the great . assistance of the commercial interest , when laboring under temporary embarrassments from overtrading . Thus a great amount of capital , otherwise necessarily unemployed in the vaults of the banks and its offices , is made efficient for the advantage of the institution , and of course for the increase of the productive resources of the country at large . // If it be important to have a sound and uniform domestic currency , it can not be immaterial to preserve something like stability in the bills of exchange , which form , in a certain sense , the general currency of the world . Merchants are thus enabled to make more accurate calculations as to the operations in which they engage , and are , in a great measure , relieved from the fluctuations in the price of the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though it be true , that the real exchange is ultimately regulated by the expense of transporting specie from one country to another , yet the greater or less demand and supply of bills produce considerable oscillations from this central point. * Not only are these variations restrained through the influence of the Bank in preventing an export of specie arising from a redundancy of currency , but that institution being always able to go , with its great resources , into the market both as a buyer and seller , the fluctuations are reduced within the smallest limits . From the peculiar situation of our country , the exports being to a very considerable extent made from the South , and the importations received at the Northern ports , this branch of business is attended with great convenience to the planters , who would otherwise be subjecteil to the expense and risk of circuitous transactions , accompanied with all the charges of double commissions . Again , as there is no re-exchange in Europe on this country , it contributes , in no small degree , to the convenience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Europe , to have an office to which they can apply , with the certainty of obtaining bills universally entitled to the same confidence as the precious metals . The only objection that we can conceive against the Bank 's continuing to deal in exchange , must arise from its interfering with the profits of a few capitalists in the large towns . But as they are the individuals who have the deepest interest in upholding a sound currency , we can hardly expect from them an opposition to those transactions of this national * It is important to distinguish the real from the nominal exchange . Owing to the errors in the original calculations at the Mint , and to the employment of silver practically as our standard , while gold is that of England , the true par is $4,75 to the pound sterling , instead of $4,44 , as assumed by law . Thus there is a difference of seven per cent . between the real and nominal exchange ; that is , exchange on London is really at par , when it is nominally at seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they promote the general convenience of the country , are particularly acceptable to that portion of the Union , which is dissatisfied , ( with what reason we shall not now inquire , ) with the legislation of Congress on another most important subject . But , though we do not go so far as to suppose with Mr. McDuffie , that the whole nominal exchange between two places , which during the last war sometimes amounted to twenty-five or thirty per cent. , is gained by the brokers ,  --  a mistake clearly pointed out in our last number ,  - -  we can not consent that the general good shall be sacrificed to the particular interest of the dealers in exchange . 4 . The advantages of the Bank in facilitating the fiscal operations of the State are either direct or indirect . Among the former , the most prominent are the receipt and disbursement of the public revenue ; and we have the testimony of the venerable Senator who presides over the Committee of Finance for saying , that , although nine thousand persons are employed in collecting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1830 , amounted to an aggregate of $230,068,855 , it was , through the agency of the Bank , received and distributed without an expense or loss to the Government of a single dollar . Besides transferring the public funds from place to place , without any allowance for commissions or exchange , its officers gratuitously perform the duties of Commissioners of Loans , and render services of the same nature with those , for which the Bank of England is paid by the Government of that country an annual sum of ? 270,000 sterling . But the benefit of the Bank does not stop here . From its capital and extensive resources , it is always able to afford Government any temporary loans , which the country may need , and on terms far more advantageous than individuals or private corporations can supply them . In time of war , by lending to the contractors on a pledge of public stock , until there is an opportunity for distributing it among the capitalists of the country , it extends the competition for government loans , and thus raises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . By frequently repeating this operation , it enables the State to borrow to an extent infinitely beyond the capital of the Bank* The benefit constantly derived by the Governmeat of England from its bank , though frequently managed on erroneous principles , is to be found in every page of the financial history of the last century . Without its aid , it is // hardly probable that England would have been able to cope , during a quarter of a century , single-handed , with the coalesced forces of the world . And it is here proper to remark , that , though modifications have been suggested in its charter , which will exI ) ire in 1833 , there is great unanimity among the statesmen of that country as to the importance of continuing it on a basis , not essentially different from that on which it at present exists . Even before the achievement of our independence , and under the imperfect confederacy of the revolution , a bank was established and rendered essential service to our embarrassed treasury . On the adoption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an institution of primary importance to the prosperous administration of the finances . ' One was accordingly formed under the sanction of Washington , and was not a little instrumental in relieving the country from the overwhelming embarrassments to which our credit had been subjected by the suspension of all regular industry during the revolutionary war , and the improvident issue of irredeemable paper money . Had not this bank been suffered to expire at the termination of the period for which it was originally chartered , we have the deliberate opinion of the able and experienced flnancier , * who presided over the Treasury department at the commencement of the war of 1812 , that it would have prevented the suspension of specie payments . ' Certain it is , that the facilities , which the capital of this institution might have given to the operations of Government and of those with whom the Government dealt , and which , necessarily , were but imperfectly supplied by the local banks , would have prevented the national credit from falling to the degraded condition , in which the treaty of Ghent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying on the operations of the Bank . There are two points , however , on which we would beg leave to make a few remarks before closing our article . 1 . If we suppose , with Mr. McDuffie , that the power to coin money , and regulate the value thereof , ' implies an au* thority to regulate the currency , even when it is composed wholly or * ) rincipally of paper , it is the duty of Congress not to omit to legislate on the subject . We do not mean to assert , that there can never be a concurrent authority vested in the // General and State Governments . But we are to remember , that , beside the power delegated to Congress by the clause of the Constitution already cited , there is an express prohibition on the States to emit bills of credit . ' By virtue of this provision , an act of Missouri , to authorize the issue of two hundred thousand dollars in certificates of denominations not exceeding ten dollars , nor less than fifty cents , and receivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not a legal tender , was last year declared unconstitutional. * We think that bank notes , not guarantied by a State , may be distinguished from the certificates under consideration ; but this was not the opinion of the judges who dissented from the majority ; and it is , at all events , evident that , consistently with the opinion of the Supreme Court , the States are not competent to furnish a sound currency , even if the other difficulties to which we have alluded , did not l ) resent insuperable obstacles . 2 . The other point , to which we would allude , is a suggestion that we have sometimes heard , that Congress would decline renewing the charter of the present Bank , with the intention of incorporating a new one on similar principles . In favor of such a proceeding , we can not discover a single valid argument ; while the destructive consequences to the dealers with the Bank , of the sudden withdrawing of the ordinary accommodations , must be obvious to all ; and as an interval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one institution and the commencement of the other , there will be sufficient opportunity for a recurrence of those derangements in the currency , of which the preceding pages furnish but too many illustrations . Our respect for the two houses of Congress forbids our entertaining , for a moment , the idea that the Legislature would sanction such a course , for the mere purpose of promoting speculation . It has , indeed , been stated , as a pretext for opposition to the Bank , that a large portion of the capital is owned abroad , and that neither the foreign nor other stockholders are entitled to a continued monopoly . This remark reminds us of the reasons usually assigned for rotation in public employments . It proceeds on the ground , that the Bank and the offices of Government are not established , because certain services are required to be performed for the good of the community , but are created for the sole benefit of the stockholders // or incumbents . But if we are to try the question of rechartering the Bank on the merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present proprietors are composed of original subscribers , and of persons who purchased stock at tl ) e market price of the day . When the hooks were first opened , no favor was shown , and , so far from any person 's being deprived of an opportunity to become a stockholder , there was not a subscription a ( lequate to the j ) roposed capital . Those who subsequently made themselves stockholders , gave for their shares a price which was fixed hy the probable profits , stability , and permanence of the institution . If Congress should decline to continue the Bank , there will be no violation of any contract , hut neither the original proprietors nor subsequent purchasers will have much cause to congratulate themselves on their investments . The average dividends of the United States Bank , from its establishment to the 1st of January , 1820 , were only 1,88-100 per cent . per annum ; while those of the Bank of England , excluding twenty-five per cent . added as capital in 1816 , and bonuses , which , between 1799 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1767 to 1781 , five and a half per cent. ; from 1781 to 1788 , six per cent. ; from 1788 to 1807 , seven per cent. ; from 1807 to 1823 , ten per cent. ; since 1823 , they have been eight per cent . With respect to the existence of a foreign interest , which has been urged against the Bank of the United States , we will only remark , that all persons , except citizens , are j ) rohibited from participating , even by their votes for directors , in the government of the institution ; and until we determine to proceed in opposition to the policy of every enlightened government that has ever existed , we can not consider it a serious objection to the National Bank , that it attracts to the country capital , to be employed in accommodations to our Government or its citizens , and thus liberates an equal amount of domestic resources , which may he directly appropriated to the promotion of the great interests of AGULCULTURE , MANUFAcTURES , and COMMERCE . // Language was printed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom we are indebted for it , the following note , which was accidentally omitted by him in making up the copy . The passage to which it refers , is on the 308th page . A controversy has existed in regard to the authenticity of the poems attributed to Citilde de Surville , which were published recently from manuscripts received as ancient , but supposed by some critics to be forgeries of the same description with those of Chatterton . The following remarks on the subject , are by the Editor of the Potes Fran*ois jusq:z ' a Mtlkerbe .

" Bouterwek thinks that there is " no well grounded presumption " against the authenticity of these poems . If they be forgeries , the author was considerate enough to imitate , not only the ancient orthography of the age in which Clotilde lived , but the orthography of the south of France , where she was born and educated . Her mother was attached to the court of Gaston Phinbus , Comte de Foix et de Warn ; ' and we find , on examination , that the orthography of Clotilde coincides precisely with that used in the poems of the abovenamed Gaston de Foix . They have pre-erninently the nasal g , which is seen also in the writings of Montaigne , and heard even at this day in the mouths of Southern Frenchmen . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. etc. occur in both these authors ; whereas Alain Chartier , who imputes to Clotilde a rustic air , and who was a Norman , and studied at Paris , has a very different orthography in this and other respects .
