To THE REVEREND ALEXANDER YOUNG , FORMERLY THE PASTOR AND ALWAYS THE FRIEND . THE FOLLOWING PAGES ARE RESPECTFULLY AND GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR . PREFACE . The following Sketch was begun in the summer of 1825 , and finished in the summer ensuing . It was commenced in the indulgence of an early propensity for beguiling leisure hours by the pen , and was completed for the entertainment of a small circle of friends . The author has been repeatedly urged to publish it ; but as it never formed any part of her plan to attempt a regular tragedy , and as she was fully aware of its deficiencies even as a dramatic poem , she has allowed it to slumber in the safe obscurity of manuscript for a longer period than is prescribed by Horatian authority . It is with great self-distrust that she is at last persuaded to submit it to the fearful ordeal of publication ; feeling that if neglect or severe criticism should decide the time spent in its composition to have been ill employed , she must henceforward conscientiously resign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solitary hour . The lapse of years has already cooled her imagination , and taught her that exertions whose tendency might be more practical and useful , would now interest her feelings more deeply . She gives this early effort to the press by the advice of those whose judgment ,  --  if unbiassed by friendship ,  --  she must highly respect . If warned by the result to abstain in future from similar attempts , she will submit with deference to the injunction . It may not be unnecessary to state , that although the characters in the following scenes are imaginary , the author aimed at an illustration of the state of things which actually existed when Christianity was struggling , almost for life , under the persecution of triumphant Heathenism . May 1st , 1837 . CHARACTERS . Thraseno , an aged Syrian  --  a Christian . Miriam , his daughter . Euphas , his son . Piso , a noble Roman , a persecutor of the Christians . Paulus , his son . Christians . Scene  --  Rome . Time  --  One night , from sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thraseno , at Rome . Thraseno , Euphas . EUPHAS . Euphas My father , markest thou ? alone the west The golden footsteps of departed day Are fading fast ; in yonder dusky sky , Yon far and boundless vault , one lonely star Is faintly twinkling forth . The perfum 'd air Of evening , sighing ' mid the drooping leaves And closing flowers , breathes fresh . It is the hour . At early nightfall were we bidden forth . THRASENO . Thraseno Aye ! in the dim and silent hour of dusk , As if to do some deed that conscious day Might blush to look upon , must we steal forth To bear the sacred dust of him we lov 'd To its ignoble rest . In some drear cave , Some dark and subterraneous abode , Hid from the common light and air of heav'n , Haunt of the barking wolf or coiling snake , Our temples and our sepulchres must rise ; And there , beneath the torches ' ghastly glare , Few , sad , and fearful must the pious meet To raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quivering lips the voice of prayer , And bend the trembling knee unto the One , The pure and living God ! and wildly start When sighs the breeze along the cavern 's roof , And sways the torch-light 's red and fitful blaze . Is this to worship thee , O God ! with thoughts That mount imperfect and are half weigh 'd down By dread of earthly dangers ? with stern eyes Glancing around , lest unawares the foe Burst on our simple rites , and quench in blood The flame just kindling on thine altars fit , Meek , holy hearts ! Enter Miriam . EUPHAS . Euphas Sister ! thy cheek is pale , Though all day long a deep and hectic tinge Hath sate in brightness on one crimson 'd spot , Lending unearthly radiance to thine eyes , But telling sadly of the waste within . Fair as thou wert , sweet sister , ne'er till late The rose hath glow 'd upon thy pure , pale cheek ; And I have watch 'd the strange and boding flush Mounting and kindling wildly there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Until I feel too well that not as yet Is it the bloom of health or happiness . And thy dark eyes that flash unwonted fires ! The glow  --  the flash  --  my sister , speak too plain A fever 'd blood , or bosom ill at ease ! MIRIAM . Miriam Has thy young eye , my brother , learnt so well To read the soul 's deep workings in the face ? And have thy sixteen summers taught thee thus To trace the secrets of a heart as pure , Though not perchance as open and as blest As thine ? THRASENO . Thraseno 5 4 My child ! how can there be a grief In that young heart of thine , a secret woe , Thy father and thy brother may not share ? Around thee I have mark 'd the shadow fall , And hourly gaz 'd upon thy wasting form , Until my heart grew sick  --  yet did not dream That other clouds than those which overhang Thine injur 'd sect , were brooding on thy soul , Once the pure mirror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is as if a cloud From the deep bosom of a peaceful lake Should rise and sullen hang upon its face , Hiding it from the bright and smiling skies . Oh say , my child , there is no secret grief , No canker sorrow eating at the core Of my sweet bud . MIRIAM . Miriam My father ! I am ill . A weight is on my spirits , and I feel The fountain of existence drying up , Shrinking I know not where , like waters lost Amid the desert sands . Nay ! grow not pale ! I have felt thus , and thought each secret spring Of life was failing fast within me . Then In saddest willingness I could have died . There have been hours I would have quitted you , And all that life hath dear and beautiful , Without one wish to linger in its smiles : My summons would have call 'd a weary soul Out of a heavy bondage . But this day A better hope hath dawn 'd upon my mind . A high and pure resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my breast That holy peace it hath not known so long . This night  --  aye ! in a few brief hours , perchance , It will know calm once more  --  ( or break at once ! ) Aside . THRASENO . Thraseno And is this all , my child ! all thou wilt trust To loving hearts , wherein thou art enshrin 'd The best , most precious of all earthly things , And second held to nothing  --  save our faith ? And must we look on thee as on a book Close seal 'd , yet full of hidden mysteries That may affect our dearest happiness ? Miriam ! it is not well . Dark mystery Doth hang round nothing pure  --  save God alone ! MIRIAM . Miriam Oh no ! it is not well . A voice within Full oft hath whisper 'd me , " it is not well . " And yet ,  --  THRASENO . Thraseno " And yet " !  --  I dare not question thee . A nameless fear is pressing on my soul . EUPHAS . Euphas Speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our father 's brow ?  --  oh speak ! although Each word in scorching flame should grave itself Upon the hearts that love thee ! MIRIAM . Miriam My brother ! Euphas ! what deemest thou I have to tell ? A wild and terrible suspicion sits Within thy troubled eye . And can it be That hearts so young and pure can dream of things So horrible ? My father ! yon bright stars Are o'er us with their quiet light ; the dews Are falling softly from the cloudless sky ; The cool and fragrant breath of evening waves Our rustling vine leaves ,  --  yet not one of these Is purer than the bosom of thy child . Father ! Brother !  --  ye do believe me ? EUPHAS . Euphas Do I not ? I could not live , and doubt thy truth . THRASENO . Thraseno I know , I know , my child , that thou art innocent , As native purity and steady faith Can make the heart of frail and erring man . But why should darkness hang around the steps Of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beams of day upon thy soul To mingle with the kindred brightness there ? MIRIAM . Miriam Urge me not now . I can not  --  can not yet . Have I not told you that a starlike gleam Was rising on my darken 'd mind ? When Hope Shall sit upon the tossing waves of thought , As broods the halcyon on the troubled deep , Then , if my spirit be not blighted , wreck 'd , Crush 'd  --  by the storm , I will unfold my griefs . But until then  --  and long it will not be !  --  Yet in that brief , brief time my soul must bear A fiercer , deadlier struggle still !  --  Dear ones ! Look not upon me thus , but in your thoughts , When ye go forth unto your evening prayers , Oh ! bear me up to Heav'n with all my grief . Pray that my holy courage may not fail . Mark ye my words ? THRASENO . Thraseno Miriam , come with us ! I have beheld thee sick , and sorrowful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not go . EUPHAS . Euphas Know'st thou last night the long-tried Stephen went Unto his peaceful rest ? and we this eve Are bidden to the humble burial , Shrouded in night , of him whose name might well Have graced a nation 's proudest chronicles . Sweet sister ! come thou forth with us . I know Thou wouldst not slight the poor remains of him Whose spotless life thou didst revere and love . MIRIAM . Miriam A ripe and goodly sheaf hath gently fall'n . Let peace be in the good man 's obsequies ; I will not carry there a troubled soul . THRASENO . Thraseno Where wouldst thou seek for peace or quietness If not beside the altar of thy God ? MIRIAM . Miriam Within these mighty walls of sceptred Rome A thousand temples rise unto her gods , Bearing their lofty domes unto the skies , Grac 'd with the proudest pomp of earth ; their shrines Glittering with gems , their stately colonnades , Their dreams of genius wrought into bright forms , Instinct with grace and godlike majesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride of gorgeous sacrifice . And yet these things are nought . Rome 's prayers ascend To greet th ' unconscious skies , in the blue void Lost like the floating breath of frankincense , And find no hearing or acceptance there . And yet there is an Eye that ever marks Where its own people pay their simple vows , Though to the rocks , the caves , the wilderness , Scourg 'd by a stern and ever-watchful foe ! There is an Ear that hears the voice of prayer Rising from lonely spots where Christians meet , Although it stir not more the sleeping air Than the soft waterfall , or forest breeze . Think'st thou , my father , this benignant God Will close his ear , and turn in wrath away From the poor sinful creature of his hand , Who breathes in solitude her humble prayer ? Think'st thou he will not hear me , should I kneel Here in the dust beneath his starry sky , And strive to raise my voiceless thoughts to Him , Making an altar of my broken heart ? THRASENO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt it , love . But yet  --  must then the funeral hymn arise , And thy melodious voice be wanting there ? Wilt thou alone of all our little band  --  Believe me , child , caprice and idle whim Are born of selfishness , and aptly nurs 'd In youthful minds , where sin of deeper dye Would shrink from entering at open gates , Aw 'd by the light of purity within . MIRIAM . Miriam That voice is chiding me ! that eye is stern ! Oh , Euphas ! EUPHAS . Euphas Yet his heart aches while he chides . MIRIAM . Miriam Dear father ! hear me then , since I must speak ! This evening hath its task , a task of tears , And strange and spirit-crushing agony ; And here , ev'n here , before yon stars have set , It must be wrought ! Wilt thou not leave me then ? Eyes such as thine , my father , must not see The strugglings of my soul with evil things . But they shall see me , and in triumph too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giv'n , I greet thee next in innocence and peace , And proudly tell thee how the battle went . Thou mayst not , canst not , aid me ; but alone  --  ( Nay , not alone , O God ! )  --  my spirit must Be disciplin 'd , and wrung , and exercis 'd , Until I am , my father , what I was ,  --  A child that had no secrets for thy ear . Wilt thou not go without me , this one night ? I tell thee on this boon my peace depends ; Peace ! nay , far more ! more than all earthly peace ! Wild as I seem , my sire , trust me this once , And when the dawn next gilds yon lofty shrine , Girt with its triple row of statues fair , It shall not greet one marble brow or cheek More tranquil or more pure than will be mine ! THRASENO . Thraseno Then on this promise , love , will I go forth . Thy bud of life hath blown beneath mine eye ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or guilt is on that lip , or in that heart . But with a saddened soul , and with a tear I can not check , my child , I thus impress My parting kiss upon thy brow . Farewell ! God reads thy mystery  --  though I may not . May He be with thee in thy solitude ! Exit . MIRIAM . Miriam Best , best of fathers !  --  fare thee well ! thy thoughts , Thy prayers I know are with me still , and may Bestead me in the trial which draws nigh . My brother ! must I turn to thee with tears To claim the one poor boon of solitude ? Look ! the bright west is fading ; in the east The rising moon uprears her blood-red disk , As if a distant city were in flames Upon yon dun horizon 's utmost verge . Why ling'rest thou ? why lookest thou on me With such a fix 'd , sad , monitory gaze ? EUPHAS . Euphas Sister ! I too go forth , but with a weight Pressing upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These strange and sad presentiments Are not the coinage of a sickly mind , An idle fancy , prone to dream of ill . Things that these eyes have seen , have left behind Their deep , enduring shadows on my soul . I could not quit thee now , were there not yet Within my heart an ever-springing hope , A confidence that hath grown slowly up , Ev'n from my birth around my heart-strings twined , Which whispers still of peace and purity , And will not let me think of aught but holiness Whene'er I gaze on thee . Slowly , alas ! Doubt and suspicion rise in brothers ' hearts . Thou weepest , Miriam ! wilt thou then relent , And let me bide with thee this dreadful eve ? If its dire task be good  --  MIRIAM . Miriam Euphas ! away ! And quickly too !  --  ( Great God ! my Paulus comes  --  And should they meet ! )  --  Oh ! I conjure thee , boy ! Aye , in the dust , and on my knees implore That thou wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aught in thy poor sister 's voice ,  --  Her supplication  --  that may win one boon ! EUPHAS . Euphas Sister , I go !  --  I would have warn 'd thee more , Thou wilful one !  --  but God be with thee now !  --  Temptations that are sought  --  nay , look not thus ! But oh ! be not too bold in innocence ! A young confiding heart at once lock 'd up  --  A self-reliance that rejects such aid As from a loving brother 's hand  --  Nay , then ! I can not answer tears !  --  Shouldst thou repent  --  Farewell ! Exit . MIRIAM . Miriam Repent ! not till my bleeding heart Forget the faith for which it yields its all !  --  Great God ! the hour is come , and how unfit Is in her native weakness thy poor worm To meet its agony ! I feel the peace , The holy resolution I had nurs 'd , Dying away within me , and my prayers I fear  --  I fear  --  have not been heard !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now Unto the sole support of human strength !  --  Was it my fancy ?  --  was it but the breeze , That sudden shower 'd the rose leaves in its sport ? Oh no !  --  he comes  --  and life seems failing me ! Enter Paulus . PAULUS . Paulus Chide me not , love , although the moon hath risen , And melts her way along those fleecy clouds , Climbing midway unto her zenith point .  --  My father gives this night a stately feast , Grac 'd with the presence of Rome 's proudest lords ; And there , within the long and lofty hall , O'ercanopied with silver tissue , lit By myriads of golden lamps , that fed With scented oils , pour light and fragrance round , Listless I lay , engarlanded with flowers ,  --  And roving , in my rapt and secret thoughts , Hither , where thou in perfect loveliness Sat'st like a Dryad , ' neath the open sky , Waiting thy truant lover : till at last , Weary and sick of all that met my gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And swifter than the young and untam 'd steed Flies with the wind across his own free plains , I sped to her  --  from whom alone I learn 'd All that my spirit ever knew of love . And what that love is  --  Miriam , thou canst tell , Since for thy sake I lay my laurels down To wreathe the myrtle round these unworn brows , Careless of warlike fame and earth 's renown .  --  But how ! thy cheeks  --  thy very lips  --  are pale ! By moonlight paler than yon marble nymph Reclining graceful o'er her streaming urn . Turn hither , love , and let thy Paulus read If grief or anger sit upon thy brow . Thy silence , thine averted glances , strike With dread unspeakable my inmost soul . No word of welcome  --  gods ! what meaneth this ? Never , except in dreams , have I beheld Such deep and dreadful meaning in thine eye , Such agony upon thy quivering lip ! Speak , Miriam ! breathe one blessed word of life ; For in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shadowy ghost Standing beneath the moon 's uncertain light , So mute  --  so motionless  --  so changed  --  and yet So like to thee ! MIRIAM . Miriam My Paulus ! PAULUS . Paulus ' T is thy voice ! Prais 'd be the gods ! it never seem 'd so sweet . Say on ! my spirit hangs upon thy words . What blight hath stricken thee since last we met ? MIRIAM . Miriam A blight that is contagious , and will fall Perchance upon thy fairest , dearest hopes , With no less deadly violence than now It hath on mine . Paulus ! is there no word These lips can utter , that may make thee wish Eternal silence there had stamp 'd her seal ? PAULUS . Paulus I know not , love ! thou startlest me !  --  No  --  none ! Unless it be of hatred  --  change  --  or death ! And these  --  it can be none of these ! MIRIAM . Miriam Why not ? PAULUS . Paulus Ye gods , my Miriam ! look not on me thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " saidst thou ? Because Thou art too young  --  too good  --  too beautiful To die ; and as for change or hatred , love , Not till I see yon clear and starry skies Raining down fire and pestilence on man , Turning the beauteous earth whereon we stand Into an arid , scath 'd and blackening waste ,  --  Miriam  --  will I believe that thou canst change . MIRIAM . Miriam Oh , thou art right ! the anguish of my soul , My spirit 's deep and rending agony , Tell me that though this heart may surely break , There is no change within it ! and through life , Fondly and wildly  --  though most hopelessly  --  With all its strong affections will it cleave To him for whom it nearly yielded all That makes life precious  --  peace and self-esteem , Friends upon earth , and hopes in heav'n above ! PAULUS . Paulus Mean'st thou  --  I know not what . My mind grows dark Amid a thousand ' wildering mazes lost . There is a wild and dreadful mystery Ev'n in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miriam Hear me  --  for with the holy faith that erst Made strong the shudd'ring patriarch 's heart and hand , When meek below the glitt'ring knife lay stretch 'd The boy whose smiles were sunshine to his age , This night I offer up a sacrifice Of life 's best hopes to the One Living God ! Yes , from this night , my Paulus , never more Mine eyes shall look upon thy form , mine ears Drink in the tones of thy beloved voice . PAULUS . Paulus Ye gods ! ye cruel gods ! let me awake And find this but a dream ! MIRIAM . Miriam Is it then said ? O God ! the words so fraught with bitterness So soon are utter 'd  --  and thy servant lives !  --  Aye , Paulus ; ever from that hour , when first My spirit knew that thine was wholly lost , And to its superstitions wedded fast , Shrouded in darkness , blind to every beam Streaming from Zion 's hill athwart the night That broods in horror o'er a heathen world , Ev'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathomless abyss yawn wide Between us two ! and o'er it gleam 'd alone One pale , dim-twinkling star ! the ling'ring hope That Grace descending from the Throne of Light Might fall in gentle dews upon that heart , And melt it into humble piety . Alas ! that hope hath faded ! and I see The fatal gulf of separation still Between us , love , and stretching on for aye Beyond the grave in which I feel that soon This clay with all its sorrows shall lie down . Union for us is none , in yonder sky : Then how on earth ?  --  so in my inmost soul , Nurtur 'd with midnight tears , with blighted hopes , With silent watchings and incessant prayers , A holy resolution hath ta'en root , And in its might at last springs proudly up . We part , my Paulus ! not in hate , but love , Yielding unto a stern necessity . And I along my sad , short pilgrimage , Will bear the memory of our sinless love , As mothers wear the image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had stamp 'd its spotless soul with good or ill , Pictur 'd in infant loveliness and smiles , Close to the heart 's fond core , to be drawn forth Ever in solitude , and bath 'd in tears .  --  But how ! with such unmanly grief struck down , Wither 'd , thou Roman knight ! PAULUS . Paulus My brain is pierc 'd ! Mine eyes with blindness smitten ! and mine ear Rings faintly with the echo of thy words ! Henceforth what man shall ever build his faith On woman 's love  --  on woman 's constancy ?  --  Maiden ! look up ! I would but gaze once more Upon that open brow and clear , dark eye , To read what aspect Perjury may wear , What garb of loveliness may Falsehood use , To lure the eye of guileless , manly love !  --  Cruel , cold-blooded , fickle that thou art , Dost thou not quail beneath thy lover 's eye ? How ! there is light within thy lofty glance , A flush upon thy cheek , a settled calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even so . A light  --  a flush  --  a calm  --  not of this earth ! For in this hour of bitterness and woe , The Grace of God is falling on my soul , Like dews upon the with'ring grass which late Red scorching flames have sear 'd . Again The consciousness of faith , of sins forgiven , Of wrath appeas 'd , of heavy guilt thrown off , Sheds on my breast its long-forgotten peace , And shining steadfast as the noonday sun , Lights me along the path that duty marks . Lover too dearly lov 'd ! a long farewell ! The banner 'd field  --  the glancing spear  --  the shout That bears the victor 's name unto the skies ,  --  The laurell 'd brow  --  be thine  --  PAULUS . Paulus Maid !  --  now hear me ! For by thine own false vows and broken faith , By thy deceitful lips , and dark , cold heart  --  MIRIAM . Miriam Great God , support me now !  --  It can not be That from my Paulus ' lips such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay , maiden , what were thine ? MIRIAM . Miriam Mine were not spoken , love , in heat or wrath , But in th ' uprightness of a heart that knew Its duty both to God and man , and sought Peace with its Maker  --  ere it broke . But thou  --  PAULUS . Paulus And I ?  --  thou false one ! am not I a man ? A Roman too ? and is a Roman 's heart A plaything made for girls to toy withal , And then to keep or idly fling away , As the light fancy of the moment prompts ? Have I then stoop 'd to win thy fickle love From my proud pinnacle of rank and fame , Wasting my youth 's best season on a dream , Forgetful of my name , my sire , my gods , To be thus trifled with and scorn 'd at last ? MIRIAM . Miriam Canst thou not learn to hate me ? PAULUS . Paulus O ye gods ! With what a look of calm despair  --  MIRIAM . Miriam Paulus ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours of dark presentiment In which my fancy often conjur 'd up This scene of trial  --  did my spirit dream Of bitterness like that which now thy hand Is pouring in my cup of life . Alas ! Must we then part in anger ? shall this hour , With harsh upbraidings marr 'd  --  PAULUS . Paulus Syren ! in vain  --  Would I could learn to hate thee ! trampling down The mem'ry of my fond and foolish love , As I would crush an adder ' neath my heel ! But no ! the poison rankles in my veins ;  --  It may not be ;  --  each look and tone of thine Tells me that yet thou art my bosom 's queen , And each vain , frantic struggle only draws Closer around my heart the woven toils . A pause . Miriam ! my pride is bow 'd  --  my wrath subdued  --  My heart attun 'd e'en to thy slightest will ,  --  So that thou yet will let me linger on , Hoping and dreaming that thou hat'st me not , Suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy loveliness , as if thou wert A Dian shrin 'd within her awful fane , Made to be look 'd upon and idoliz 'd , But in whose presence passion 's lightest pulse , Love 's gentlest whisper , were a deadly sin . Cast me not from thee , love ! send me not forth Blasted and wan into a heartless world , Amid its cold and glittering pageantry , To learn what utter loneliness of soul , What wordless , deep , and sick'ning misery , Is in the sense of unrequited love ! MIRIAM . Miriam I can not  --  must not hear thee . Even now A chord is touched within my soul .  --  Great God ! Where is the strength thou didst vouchsafe of late ? Anger  --  reproach  --  were better borne than this ! PAULUS . Paulus Why should thy gentler nature thus be crush 'd ? Is not the voice within thee far more just Than the harsh dictates of thy gloomy faith ? Thy stern and unrelenting Deity  --  MIRIAM . Miriam Youth ! thou remindest me  --  thou dost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Courage and strength return at once to nerve My trembling limbs , my weak and yielding soul . What wouldst thou have ? that I should yet drag on A life of dark and vile hypocrisy , Days full of fear and nights of vain remorse , And love , though sinless , yet not innocent ? For well I know that when thy sunny smiles Are on me , sternly frowning doth look down My Maker on our stolen interview ! It is a crime of dye too deep and dark To be wash 'd out but with a life of tears , And penitence , and utter abstinence . I never will behold thy face again ! My soul shall be unlock 'd and purified , And there the eyes of those that love me well Shall find no dark and sinful mystery , Shunning a tender father 's scrutiny , And weighing down my spirit to the dust .  --  Paulus !  --  again  --  farewell ! yet  --  yet in peace We part ! PAULUS . Paulus Maiden ! by all my perish 'd hopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembrance of that fatal hour When first I spake to thee of love  --  and thought That thou  --  Aye ! by the sacred gods , I swear , I will not yield thee thus ! In open day , Before my father 's eyes  --  and bearing too Perchance his malediction on my head  --  Before the face of all assembled Rome , Bann 'd though I be by all her priests and gods ,  --  Thee  --  thee will I lead forth  --  my Christian bride ! MIRIAM . Miriam Aye ! sayst thou so , my Paulus ? thou art bold , And generous . Meet bridal will it be  --  The stake  --  the slow red fire  --  perchance the den Of hungry lions , gnashing with white teeth In savage glee at sight of thy young bride , Their destin 'd prey ! for well thou know'st that these Are but the tend'rest mercies of thy sire To the scorn 'd sect , whose lofty faith my soul Holds fast through torments worse than aught that these Can offer to the clay wherein it dwells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nay  --  I have not done ; The dark cold waters of despair rise fast , But have not yet o'ertopped each resting-place . We will go forth upon the bounding sea , We two alone , and chase the god of day O'er the broad ocean , where each eve he dips His blazing chariot in the western wave , And seek some lonely isle of peace and love , Where ling'ring summer dwells the livelong year , Wasting the music of her happy birds , The unpluck 'd richness of her golden fruits , The fragrance of her blossoms o'er the land . And we will be the first to tread the turf , And raise our quiet hearts and voices there , And from sins fearless bow before the Cross , Praying unto what unknown God thou wilt , While I  --  MIRIAM . Miriam No more , my Paulus ! it is vain . Why should we thus unnerve our souls with dreams , With fancies wilder , idler far than dreams ? Our destiny is fix 'd ! the hour is come !

The foe hath burst upon th ' unfinished rites , Slaughtering some , and bearing off in bonds  --  Just Heav'n !  --  what man is this ? MIRIAM . Miriam Oh , answer me ! And say our father is unhurt ! EUPHAS . Euphas Miriam ! I will be answer 'd first ! what knight is this ? What doth he here ? A pause . Oh grief ! can this be so ? Would I had died among their glitt'ring swords , Pouring my life-blood from , pale girl ? Well may convulsion wring thy trembling lip !

Miriam Tell me in mercy first ,  --  where is our sire ? Why art thou here alone ? EUPHAS . Euphas Hast thou no fear To take that honor 'd name upon thy lips ?

Euphas They master 'd him  --  the ruthless slaves  --  while I , Lurking securely ' mid the copsewood near , With shudd'ring frame and half-averted eye Beheld them rudely bind his wither 'd hands , And mock his struggles impotent , and rend The decent silver locks upon his brow , While overhead the fair and quiet moon Sail 'd on , and lent her light to deeds so foul ! And then I saw him meekly led away Amid a throng of shrieking captives , men , Women , and babes , unto the dungeon drear , Whence he will never issue but to die A death of shame and cruel agony ! And yet I stirr 'd not  --  for I deem 'd there grew A spotless lily in the wilderness , Whose unprotected sweetness none but I Might shelter from the blast !

PAULUS . Paulus I hear  --  and I rejoice . EUPHAS . Euphas How ? ruffian ! Art thou still here ? I had forgotten thee ! But by the strength the God of justice gives , In this death-grapple thou shalt surely die ! PAULUS . Paulus Art thou so hot ? Unloose my throat , vain boy ! Beardless , unarm 'd , and nerveless as thou art , To risk thyself in desperate struggle thus , With one whose slightest effort masters thee As lightly as the bird of Jove bears off The panting dove !  --  Thou seest I harm him not .

Thou couldst not proffer a more worthless gift . Why should I live ? I look upon you girl Weeping her bitter grief and self-reproach In utter hopelessness  --  and pray thee take The life which thou hast made so valueless . PAULUS . Paulus Be still . Why pratest thou of misery To one on whose devoted head the gods Have pour 'd the cup of vengeance , long deferr 'd , With such a fierce and unrelenting wrath , That glory  --  riches  --  fame  --  and e'en the name I proudly bore  --  the hopes that rose this morn As if the fire that lit them were from heav'n  --  And life itself  --  are now no more to me Than last night 's dream .  --  One duty yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these features , boy . Hast thou not seen me on high festal days , Deck 'd with the tossing plume and snow-white robe , And bearing high my proud and knightly brow Amid the throng of Rome 's degenerate lords ? Or did the abject Syrian boy ne'er dare To lift his looks so high ? EUPHAS . Euphas I scan thy face , Proud youth ! the lightnings leaping from thine eye Avouch thee of a high and haughty race . But of the name thou bear'st I only know Thy deeds have steep 'd it in such infamy , That the pale statues of thy vaunted sires , Lining thy hall , will surely one day leap Forth from their niches in their living scorn , And crush thee into senseless , shapeless dust . I seek to know no more . PAULUS . Paulus Stripling ! beware ! The powerful magic hidden in that name Alone can bid thy father 's prison ope . I am the son of Piso . EUPHAS . Euphas Is it so ? Thou  --  the proud Paulus  --  lurking here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Where in her innocence there dwelt a maid Born and baptized in the Christian faith ! Thou Piso 's son ? Then by the God we serve , Thou'rt taken in the toils . Lo ! this way come Glittering in arms my father 's trusty friends , Whom I had summon 'd hither but to aid The orphans with their counsel  --  ere I dream 'd  --  Alas !  --  MIRIAM . Miriam I hear the tread of heavy feet ! And ' mid the trees I see their dusky forms ! Fly , Paulus , fly ! PAULUS . Paulus Am I so base , think'st thou ? MIRIAM . Miriam They come ! with vengeance on their lurid brows In mercy , fly ! and I will check pursuit , Flinging my worthless self before their steps , And bathing with my own heart 's blood the sword That thirsts for thine !  --  Oh God ! it is too late ! PAULUS . Paulus Is it thy madness or thy love that speaks ? What is to thee this foolish life of mine ? Thou in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart wherein it beats  --  ev'n yet  --  Too fondly beats for thee ! Wouldst thou that death Should not be wholly pangless ?  --  Spare thy words ; Thou lov'st me not ,  --  the mockery is ill-timed . EUPHAS . Euphas Hither , my friends , with speedier steps . Enter armed Christians . Ye come , Girt with no needless weapons , to the cot Of him who call 'd you to a gentler task . Lo ! in the dove 's own nest the serpent coil 'd ! So that ye ask not why he hither came , Do what ye list . It is the haughty son Of him whose myrmidons this night have snatch 'd Your own best treasures shrieking from your arms , Turning your hymns and holy prayers to groans , Drenching th ' unburied dust of him ye lov 'd With martyr 's blood , and waking in your hearts The stern , deep cry for vengeance ! MIRIAM . Miriam My brother ! How have such words a place on Christian lips ? Hear me , ye upright men ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend such dreadful eyes Is innocent of all  --  except the love , The world-forgetting love he bore  --  EUPHAS . Euphas Miriam ! Dumb be the shameless tongue that would proclaim What in a brother 's patient love I sought To hide from mortal eye ! MIRIAM . Miriam It is too much ! My innocence  --  Why do I grow so weak ? Wrongly and harshly dost thou judge of me ! Oh ! for one breeze of purer , fresher air , To sweep away the gath'ring mist that dims My failing sight ! EUPHAS . Euphas She faints ! Let me not look Upon her lifeless form , lest it awake Pity that were a sin ! PAULUS . Paulus How beautiful Ev'n in her deathlike paleness doth she lie ! Fairest ! from that kind swoon awake not yet . Thy words were love ?  --  one struggle then for life . Meantime , in blest unconsciousness , perchance Thou'lt ' scape a bloody sight .  --  Ye men of peace ! I wait my doom .

Thou stirrest not  --  I hear thy stifled sobs ! Did'st thou the deed thou dar'st not look upon ? EUPHAS . Euphas Let him not die ! FIRST CHRISTIAN . First Christian He must . EUPHAS . Euphas Oh no ! not thus Religion asks the service of our hands . The spirit of her mild and bloodless laws Requires not life for life . Let him go forth . PAULUS . Paulus Boy ! with that word thou hast undrawn the bolts That close the deep , dark dungeon on thy sire , And loos 'd the heavy shackles on his arms . For ev'ry idle drop of Piso 's blood Ye in your wrath and blind revenge had shed , One pang the more had wrung those aged limbs . But while I live , a blessed hope yet beams Upon the dire captivity ye mourn . EUPHAS . Euphas Thou silver-tongued deceiver ! Is it thus Thou wouldst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relented at the thought Of one lone , helpless victim 's blood pour 'd forth As water in revengeful sacrifice , I have become a weak , believing girl , All fond credulity and hope ?  --  Peace !  --  peace ! When thy deluding accents sound most sweet , Most do I dread thy deep hypocrisy . There is no hope ! PAULUS . Paulus Ye gods !  --  my Miriam ! To thee and thine how humbly croucheth down The lion thou hast tam 'd ! EUPHAS . Euphas Nay , let him go ! Hence in thy cruel treachery to thy sire ! Tell him that other Christians worship yet The one pure God within the walls of Rome . Bid him plant thick his stakes , to fury lash His howling monsters from the wilderness ; And , ere the dawn , be sure thy myrmidons Seize the forsaker of his helpless sire , And let him end his brief and blighted days , Withering for hours upon the welcome cross In pangs  --  scarce worse than those remembrance brings . Go , get thee hence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pour the utter scorn , The deep abhorrence of my soul ! PAULUS . Paulus Maiden ! Why is thy fearful swoon so long ? Alas ! Looking upon thy deathlike loveliness , I hear strange , scornful words , and heed them not ! EUPHAS . Euphas Mourneth the whirlwind o'er the broken flow'r ? Gaze not upon the ruin thou hast made . Go to thy sire , and tell him  --  PAULUS . Paulus Stripling ! hear ! That sire hath now no son ! I give myself A pledge and hostage for your father 's life ; And if the morrow 's sun bring not your friends Back from their dreary dungeon to your arms , Let the bright daggers gleaming round me now Drink the young blood of Piso 's only son ! Go thou , and tell my father this ! EUPHAS . Euphas Roman ! I take thee at thy word ! I go !  --  Perchance Thou wouldst but lead me to the lion 's den . But if thy words be craft , and thy designs Pregnant with direst mischief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at stake Would lead me on through fire and pestilence , Famine , and thirst , and keenest agony , Fearless and struggling still while hope remain 'd ! My father ! what hath earth to daunt mine eye , Seeking to gaze once more upon that brow I should have died to shield from violence ? No ! I have nought below the skies but thee , And too the wild beast 's lair I rush at once To save thee , or to die !  --  My sister !  --  nay ! Let me not look on her !  --  Oh , who could dream Falsehood had crept within a shrine so fair ? Let me turn from her , ere the memory Of what she was  --  My father 's friends ! bear ye The hostage of our kindred 's lives away Up to the lonely garden , by the wall Where we have sometimes met , and there await The answer I shall bring . If when the sun Wakes with his first red beam the matin birds , I come not yet , nor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , Deem that my father 's cell hath clos 'd on me , That in my youth I am held fit to wear The martyr 's glorious crown  --  and that no pow'r , No earthly pow'r , can save the friends ye love Out of the spoiler 's hand . Ye know the rest . Exit . PAULUS . Paulus The rest !  --  blood rudely shed  --  untimely death  --  And an ignoble grave  --  are in that word . Oh ! for one touch of that high energy , That eager spirit thrilling through each vein , That in my days of young renown and pride Bore me triumphant in the battle 's van , Where brightest flashed the swords and thickest flew The barbed javelins round my glitt'ring shield !  --  Christians ! ere we go hence , I would but look Once more upon her face ! I hear a voice Sighing her dirge among yon rustling leaves , And calling him whose spirit lived in her 's Away  --  away from worldly sin and woe . And I would learn from that calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ! A cloud crosses the moon . How ! doth the God she worshipped thus forbid The sinner 's eye to gaze on things so pure ? Pass  --  shadow  --  pass !  --  a holier light than thine , Fair orb ! falls on my dark and troubled soul , While thus I drink in peace and quietness Gazing upon my Miriam 's silent face !  --  Ye gods ! methought a sudden quivering ran O'er her pale lips and eyelids softly clos 'd ! She stirs !  --  she sighs !  --  she looks upon me now ! Life  --  life and light are waking in her eye ! MIRIAM . Miriam Methought once more in dear Judea 's land , A child by Siloe 's gushing fount I sat , Close by my angel-mother 's knee , and heard The holy hymns she sweetly sung each night Unto our God , while ever and anon The quiet murmur of the brook came in , Filling each pause with softest melody , Even as it was wont , years  --  years ago ! Was it an idle vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? whose dark bright eyes are these too well Gazing upon me thus ? Euphas ! my sire ! Where are ye both ? rising suddenly Alas ! alas !

I bade him say  --  MIRIAM . Miriam How ! was he sent ?  --  sent !  --  and by thee ?  --  Paulus ! I will not stay ! loose me ! the air grows thick  --  I can not breathe !  --  Alas ! betray 'd  --  betray 'd Even into the tyrant 's hand ! so young ! So good  --  so innocent  --  oh , my brother ! PAULUS . Paulus Hear me this once ! Weep , if thou wilt , but hear ! MIRIAM . Miriam I have no pow'r to move . The God who gave Hath ta'en away the sinner 's wasted strength . Say on . My brother ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him This night into my father 's stately halls . Think'st thou the unknown tyrant whom thou hat'st , He whom thy sire 's deep wrongs have bid thee curse , Will feel no shuddering when he hears the tale Told by thy brother 's lips  --  perchance ere now ? Knowing that by some dark , mysterious chance , Fierce Christian swords are closing round my breast , Ready with morn 's first beam to drink my blood  --  Thinks't thou , to save this young and much-priz 'd life , He would not give a thousand Christians back From their barr 'd cells ?  --  nay  --  from the lifted cross ? Thou know'st him not . MIRIAM . Miriam Paulus ! dost thou believe I shall again behold my father 's face ? Or that the noble boy , whom thou hast sent Up to the house of blood and cruel fraud , Will ever from that den return unharm 'd ? PAULUS . Paulus I am my father 's only son , and lov 'd As only sons alone are ever lov 'd . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh God !  --  thy hope ? Is it no more ?  --  Thou shouldst have been assur 'd , Ere thou hadst risk 'd a life I hold so dear . Oh , why doth trusting woman plant her hopes In the unknown quicksands of a stranger 's faith ? She should love none she hath not known from birth  --  Or look to be deceiv 'd  --  as I have been . Why dost thou stay me thus ? Lo ! I am call 'd ! I must be there to close their eyes !  --  Away ! PAULUS . Paulus Hear me , my Miriam ! MIRIAM . Miriam Nay ! it is past ! That voice was once a spell ;  --  it is all o'er ! Why dost thou call me thine ? I have no part In thee , nor thou in me ;  --  and we love not , Hate not , and worship not alike . How then Can I be thine ? I pray thee , let me go ! PAULUS . Paulus And whither then ? MIRIAM . Miriam I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will be here ere morn . MIRIAM . Miriam Thou think'st not so ! Youth ! thou hast learn 'd deceit . PAULUS .

Miriam Am I so pale ? It is thy work  --  and , for a gentle youth , Strange havoc hast thou caus 'd  --  much misery ! Say'st thou my looks are wild ? It is because I linger here with thee , when I should fly E'en to earth 's farthest bounds .  --  I will be gone ! Aye ! I am weak , but not in spirit , youth ! And the rous 'd soul hath strength to lift its clay .

Bursting from him Lo ! I am free ! PAULUS . Paulus Will ye not stay her ? I am powerless ; Her words have stricken from mine arms their force . FIRST CHRISTIAN . First Christian She hath her task ; strength will be given her . MIRIAM . Miriam Aye , ye say true . I am not wholly left ; And like a morning mist from gleaming lakes , The cloud is passing from my ' wilder 'd mind . Youth ! wert thou as they are , ev'n thus For thee would I risk all .  --  If there be hope Or consolation in those words , take thou One last , fond blessing with them !  --  this , at least , Will sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence may feel for sinning friends , A love made up of holy hopes , and prayers , And tears ! and , Paulus , ev'n such angel-love , Living or dying , will I bear to thee !  --  Farewell ! Exit . FIRST CHRISTIAN . First Christian Thou too must hence with us ! PAULUS . Paulus Not yet  --  not yet ! Let me but watch the fluttering of her robe !  --  Alas ! its last white gleam is gone  --  faded  --  And swallow 'd up in darkness , like my hopes , My happiness  --  like all things fair or bright , These eyes have ever lov 'd to look upon ! Lead where ye will . The clods beneath these feet Have scarce less life or consciousness than he Whose foot is pressing them , with a dull hope To share their utter senselessness ere long . Exeunt . SCENE II . A Hall in the Palace of Piso . Piso and Euphas . PISO . Piso Why ! thou hast trusted in thy youth and bloom , As if the eye whose lightnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn , fair boy , The mower in his earnest task spares not The wild-flower in his path . It moves my mirth That with such hope thou shouldst have sought my face , Intruding on my midnight privacy , To pour thine intercession in mine ear . Tell me , I pray , didst thou in sooth believe Thy boyish eloquence and raven curls Might move the settled purpose of my soul ? Or is thy life too bitter in the bud , That thou hast ta'en a way so sure and prompt To nip its blossoming ? EUPHAS . Euphas I know not which . But if I had a hope , and it prove false , Life were the sternest penalty thy wrath Could bid my spirit bear . PISO . Piso I doubt thee much . When the young blood runs bounding through the veins , And a strong thought is on the working soul , And death goes wandering far and heeds thee not , ' T is easy then to scorn thine absent foe . But if the monster turn upon thee fierce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful pulse with icy touch , Flinging an utter darkness on thy hopes , Boy ! in that shudd'ring hour  --  it draweth nigh !  --  I shall behold thy bright cheek blanch 'd with fear , And hear thee , in thine agony , implore One day  --  one hour of that same precious life Which now thou hold'st so cheap . How thou wilt rue And wonder at thine own presumption strange , And that insane and idle hope , which gave Thee , in thy youth and folly , to my hand . Ye gods ! it was most strange ! EUPHAS . Euphas To thee most strange , Who of all earthly things alone dost hold No sympathy with aught on earth . To thee There is no power in words that can unfold The steady faith and deep , absorbing love That brought me here .  --  I have not yet said all . PISO . Piso Not all ? Why , that is stranger still . Methought Thou hadst run through each supplicating phrase Our language knows ; and in good truth , although The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of pray'r and agony , Yet will I own mine ear hath never drunk Tones and entreaties eloquent as thine . Thou hast said much , fair lad , and said it well , And said it all  --  in vain .  --  Dost hear ? EUPHAS . Euphas I do . PISO . Piso Why ! thou art wondrous calm ! EUPHAS . Euphas Thou man of blood ! I have not yet said all ! PISO . Piso But by the gods , Thou hast ! for I will hear no more this night . To-morrow , if I 'm in an idle mood , I 'll hear thee  --  on the cross ! EUPHAS . Euphas I read thine eye , That doth not honor me with wrath or scorn , But marks me with a proud , cold weariness . Yet will I utter  --  what shall bid that eye Flash fire ! PISO . Piso Poor fool ! I marvel I have spent Ev'n thus much time upon thee . Take him hence ! Where are the daring slaves who marshall 'd thee ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piso My son !  --  my son ? saidst thou ? EUPHAS . Euphas Aye !  --  where is he ? thine only son ?  --  Paulus , I think , the name he nobly bears . PISO . Piso Gone forth Upon some reckless revel , haply ; I know not . Seekest thou time , that with such idle quest  --  EUPHAS . Euphas I seek thy vulnerable spot . If now I fail !  --  Know'st thou not aught  --  whither  --  or how  --  PISO . Piso I tell thee , no ! Read me thy riddle , boy ! The night wears on , and busy hours are mine Ere to my couch  --  EUPHAS . Euphas The couch unvisited By sleep this night ! Oh , were it not for those Whose lives hang on this chance , I could relent . How can I aim so near a father 's heart ? PISO . Piso This tardiness and would-be mystery Portend a mighty tale . Look it be such . Why ! what a knitted brow and troubled eye ! Say on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son , Whose life hangs on a word  --  a syllable  --  Breath 'd from thy lips ! PISO . Piso Well ! excellent ! go on . EUPHAS . Euphas He is a hostage ' mid an armed band , A pledge thou canst not sport with , for the lives We came to beg . Give me my father back , My father and his friends from yonder cells , And thou shalt have thy haughty son unseath 'd By Christian swords ! But if they bleed  --  PISO . Piso Say on I would hear all . EUPHAS . Euphas If to th ' appointed spot They come not all  --  age , youth , and woman  --  all  --  Ere the red sun shall look aslant the hills With its first beam , he dies ! PISO . Piso And is this all ? EUPHAS . Euphas Aye . Now have I said much  --  and well  --  and not , Perchance , in vain ! PISO . Piso Lad , were there but one chance Thou e'er might'st profit by the kind advice , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy life by trick and cunning tale , Make thou thy story probable !  --  Dost hear ? EUPHAS . Euphas How ! dost thou doubt me ? PISO . Piso Should I believe thee , If thou assertedst that the ocean waves Were dashing high around my palace gates ? Or that the thousand Christians I have slain Were seeking me along the silent streets , Moaning and glimmering in their phantom-shrouds , At this lone hour of midnight ?  --  Thou art pale : In the extremity of fear hast thou Devis 'd a tale so wild ? EUPHAS . Euphas I may be pale ; But re-peruse my brow , and see if there Is aught that tokens fear ! PISO . Piso Boy ! there is that Within thy pensive eye I can not meet ; I have beheld a face so like to thine . Else had our parley shorter been .  --  Away ! I will behold  --  will hear thy voice no more ! EUPHAS . Euphas Forth to the dungeon must I go ? PISO . Piso Aye ! lad ; The deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that My father shareth , I care not how dark . Darker will be to-morrow 's noon to thee , Thou childless sire ! PISO . Piso Can it be true ? I feel A cold and sudden shudd'ring in my veins . Tell me once more  --  I know ' t is mockery  --  Yet would I hear thy tale again , false boy ! My son , thou say'st  --  EUPHAS . Euphas Circled with Christian swords , Stands waiting thy behest ! for those , whose friends This night have fall'n within thy fatal grasp , Now hold thine own proud darling fast in bonds , Where rescue or protecting power of thine Can not avail him aught . Revenge thou may'st , But canst not save him  --  but by sparing those Whom thou didst purpose for a cruel death . PISO . Piso And where  --  in what dark nook  --  EUPHAS . Euphas Nay , tyrant ! but Thou canst not dream that I will answer thee . PISO . Piso I will send forth my soldiers  --  they shall search  --  It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and search each hiding-place In all this mighty city , till my son Be found ! EUPHAS . Euphas When he is found , that son will be  --  Knowest thou what ? Remember  --  at sunrise ! PISO . Piso Now by the great god Mars ! but thou shalt die For this , be thy tale false or true . Till now I never felt these firm knees tremble .  --  Speak ! How fell my noble Paulus in the gripe Of yonder rav'ning wolves ? EUPHAS . Euphas How came he there ? Alas !  --  that question hath a dagger 's point . Man ! I would rather die than answer it ! PISO . Piso But thou shalt speak , or I will have thy bones Wrench 'd from their sockets .  --  Silent still ?  --  Stripling ! Bethink thee , thou art young and delicate : Thy tender limbs have a keen sense of pain ! EUPHAS . Euphas In dark thoughts am I lost  --  but not of that ! PISO . Piso Answer me ! rouse thee from thy trance ; thou'lt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euphas It is a thought to search the very soul ! And yet  --  so young  --  she may repent .  --  Piso ! It is a short but melancholy tale , And if my heart break not the while , in brief Will I declare how fell thy haughty son Into the power of Christian foes .  --  He sought  --  I have a sister  --  she is beautiful  --  Touched by three summers more than I have seen Into the first young grace of womanhood  --  Lovely , yet thoughtful .  --  Oh , my God ! it comes Upon my soul too heavily !  --  Proud Roman ! Art thou not answer 'd ? PISO . Piso I am . He dies . EUPHAS . Euphas How ! PISO . Piso Ye shall all die . In my mighty wrath I have no words  --  no frenzy now ! ' T is deep , Too deep for outward show !  --  But he shall die , The base , degenerate boy ! EUPHAS . Euphas Thou speakest now In the first burst of fury . PISO . Piso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  foul disgrace ! Fury ! saidst thou ? I am calm . Look on me . EUPHAS . Euphas I see the tiger crouching ere he springs . I mark the livid cheek  --  the bloodshot eye  --  Hands firmly clench 'd and swollen veins  --  are these Tokens of inward calm ? PISO . Piso Now am I free ! My son hangs not upon my palsied arm , Checking the half-dealt blow ! EUPHAS . Euphas Dost thou exult ? Oh Heaven ! to think such spirits are !  --  Piso ! Wilt thou indeed forget  --  PISO . Piso Strange error thine To tell this secret , boy !  --  I lov 'd my son , And lov 'd nought else on earth . In him alone Center 'd the wild , blind fondness of a heart All adamant , except for him ! and thou  --  Thou , foolish youth , hast made me hate and scorn Him whom my pride and love  --  Knowest thou not Thou hast but sealed thy fate ? His life had been More precious to me than the air I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand Christian dogs from yonder dens To save one hair upon his head . But now  --  A Christian maid !  --  Were there none other ?  --  Gods ! Shame and a shameful death be his !  --  and thine ! EUPHAS . Euphas It is the will of God . My hopes burnt dim Ev'n from the first , and are extinguish 'd now . The thirst of blood hath rudely chok 'd at last The one affection which thy dark breast knew , And thou art man no more . Let me but die First of thy victims  --  PISO . Piso Would that among them  --  Where is the sorceress ? I fain would see The beauty that hath witch 'd Rome 's noblest youth . EUPHAS . Euphas Her 's is a face thou never wilt behold . PISO . Piso I will . On her  --  on her shall fall my worst revenge ; And I will know what foul and magic arts  --  Miriam glides in . A pause .

Go back , fair spirit , to thine own dim realms ! He whose young love thou didst reject on earth May tremble at this visitation strange , But never can know peace or virtue more ! Thou wert a Christian , and a Christian dog Did win thy precious love .  --  I have good cause To hate and scorn the whole detested race ; And till I meet that man , whom most of all My soul abhors , will I go on and slay ! Fade , vanish  --  shadow bright !  --  In vain that look ! That sweet , sad look !  --  My lot is cast in blood ! MIRIAM . Miriam Oh , say not so ! PISO .

What wouldst thou have ? MIRIAM . Miriam Oh , man of guilt and woe ! Thine own dark phantasies are busy now , Lending unearthly seeming to a thing Of earth , as thou art ! PISO . Piso How !

Although I dare not meet that eye , I hear thee . MIRIAM . Miriam He hath given me strength , And led me safely through the broad lone streets , Ev'n at the midnight hour ! My heart sunk not , My noiseless foot paced on unfaltering Through the long colonnades , where stood aloft Pale gods and goddesses on either hand , Bending their sightless eyes on me ! by cool founts , Waking with ceaseless plash the midnight air ! Through moonlit squares , where ever and anon Flash 'd from some dusky nook the red torchlight , Flung on my path by passing reveller . And He hath brought me here before thy face ; And it was He who smote thee even now With a strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . I deem 'd I look 'd on one , whose bright young face First glanc 'd upon me ' mid the shining leaves Of a green bower in sunny Palestine , In my youth 's prime ! I knew the dust , The grave 's corroding dust , had soiled That spotless brow long since .  --  A shadow fell Upon the soul that never yet knew fear . But it is past . Earth holds not what I dread ; And what the gods did make me , am I now . What seekest thou ? EUPHAS . Euphas Miriam ! go thou hence . Why shouldst thou die ? MIRIAM . Miriam Brother !  --  PISO . Piso Ha ! is this so ? Now , by the gods !  --  Bar  --  bar the gates , ye slaves ! If they escape me now  --  Why this is good ! I had not dream 'd of hap so glorious . His sister !  --  she that beguil 'd my son ! MIRIAM . Miriam Peace ! Name not with tongue unhallow 'd love like ours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery Confounds my purposes . Take other form , Foul sorceress , and I will baffle thee ! MIRIAM . Miriam I have no other form than this God gave ; And he already hath stretch 'd forth his hand And touch 'd it for the grave . PISO . Piso It is most strange . Is not the air around her full of spells ? Give me the son thou hast seduc 'd ! MIRIAM . Miriam Piso ! Thy son hath seen me  --  lov 'd me  --  and hath won A heart too prone to worship noble things , Although of earth  --  and he , alas ! was earth 's ! I strove  --  I pray 'd  --  in vain ! In all things else I might have stirr 'd his soul 's best purposes . But for the pure and cheering faith of Christ , There was no entrance in that iron soul . And I  --  Amid such hopes , despair arose , And laid a with'ring hand upon my heart . I feel it yet !  --  We parted ! Aye  --  this night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister ! my tears  --  They choke my words  --  else  --  MIRIAM . Miriam Euphas , thou wert wroth When there was little cause ;  --  I lov 'd thee more . Thy very frowns in such a holy cause Were beautiful . The scorn of virtuous youth , Looking on fancied sin , is noble . PISO . Piso Maid ! Hath then my son withstood thy witchery , And on this ground ye parted ? MIRIAM . Miriam It is so . Alas , that I rejoice to say it ! PISO . Piso Nay , Well thou may'st , for it hath wrought his pardon . That he had lov 'd thee would have been a sin Too full of degradation  --  infamy , Had not these cold and aged eyes themselves Beheld thee in thy loveliness ! And yet , bold girl ! Think not thy Jewish beauty is the spell That works on one grown old in deeds of blood . I have look 'd calmly on when eyes as bright Were drown 'd in tears of bitter agony , When forms as full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharpness of their pain , And cheeks as fair were mangled  --  EUPHAS . Euphas Tyrant ! cease . Wert thou a fiend , such brutal boasts as these Were not for ears like hers ! MIRIAM . Miriam I tremble not . He spake of pardon for his guiltless son , And that includeth life for those I love . What need I more ? EUPHAS . Euphas Let us go hence . Piso ! Bid thou thy myrmidons unbar the gates , That shut our friends from light and air . PISO . Piso Not yet , My haughty boy , for we have much to say , Ere you two pretty birds go free . Chafe not ! Ye are caged close , and can but flutter here Till I am satisfied . MIRIAM . Miriam How ! hast thou chang 'd  --  PISO . Piso Nay  --  but I must detain ye till I ask  --  MIRIAM . Miriam Detain us if thou wilt  --  But look ! PISO . Piso At what ? MIRIAM . Miriam There , through yon western arch ! the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . Methinks I feel the breeze of morn ev'n now . Know'st thou the hour ? PISO . Piso I do  --  but one thing more I fain would know ; for after this wild night Let me no more behold you . Why didst thou , Bold , dark-hair 'd boy , wear in those pleading eyes , When thou didst name thy boon , an earnest look That fell familiar on my soul ? And thou , The lofty , calm , and oh ! most beautiful ! Why are not only that soul-searching glance , But ev'n thy features and thy silver voice So like to her 's I lov 'd long years ago , Beneath Judea 's palms ? Whence do ye come ? MIRIAM . Miriam For me , I bear my own dear mother 's brow ; Her eye , her form , her very voice , are mine . So , in his tears , my father oft hath said . We liv 'd beneath Judea 's shady palms , Until that saintlike mother faded  --  drooped  --  And died . Then hither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worshipped faithfully The One , True , Living God , in secret peace . PISO . Piso Thou art her child ! I could not harm thee now . Oh wonderful ! that things so long forgot ,  --  A love I thought so crush 'd and trodden down Ev'n by the iron tread of passions wild  --  Ambition  --  pride  --  and worst of all , revenge  --  Revenge , that hath shed seas of Christian blood !  --  To think this heart was once so waxen soft , And then congeal 'd so hard , that nought of all Which hath been since could ever have the pow'r To wear away the image of that girl  --  That fair , young , Christian girl !  --  ' T was a wild love ! But I was young , a soldier in strange lands , And she , in very gentleness , said nay So timidly , I hoped  --  until , ye gods ! She lov 'd another !  --  Yet I slew him not ! I fled !  --  Oh , had I met him since ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PISO . Piso Ye shall go forth in joy , And take with you yon pris'ners . Send my son , Him whom she did not bear  --  home to these arms , And go ye out of Rome with all your train . I will shed blood no more ; for I have known What sort of peace deep-glutted vengeance brings . My son is brave , but of a gentler mind Than I have been . His eyes shall never more Be grieved with sight of sinless blood pour 'd forth From tortur 'd veins . Go forth , ye gentle two ! Children of her who might perhaps have pour 'd Her own meek spirit o'er my nature stern , Since the bare image of her buried charms , Soft gleaming from your youthful brows , hath pow'r To stir my spirit thus ! But go ye forth ! Ye leave an alter 'd and a milder man Than him ye sought . Tell Paulus this , To quicken his young steps . MIRIAM . Miriam Now may the peace That follows just and worthy deeds , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid thy remorse , In the recesses of thy soul , to make That soul ev'n yet a shrine of holiness . EUPHAS . Euphas Piso ! how shall we pass yon steel-clad men , Keeping stern vigil round the dungeon gate ? PISO . Piso Take ye my well-known ring  --  and here  --  the list  --  Aye , this is it , methinks : show these  --  Great gods ! EUPHAS . Euphas What is there on yon scroll which shakes him thus ? MIRIAM . Miriam A name , at which he points with stiff'ning hand , And eyeballs full of wrath !  --  Alas ! alas ! I guess too well .  --  My brother , droop thou not . PISO . Piso Your father , did ye say ? Was it his life Ye came to beg ? MIRIAM . Miriam His life ; but not alone The life so dear to us ; for he hath friends Sharing his fetters and his final doom . PISO . Piso Little reck I of them . Tell me his name ! A pause . Speak , boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam Stay ! Stern son of violence ! the name thou askest Is  --  Thraseno ! PISO . Piso Did I not know it , girl ? Now , by the gods , had I not been entranc 'd , I sooner had conjectur 'd this .  --  Foul name ! Thus do I tear thee out  --  and even thus Rend with my teeth .  --  Oh rage ! she wedded him , And ever since that hated name hath been The voice of serpents in mine ear !  --  But now  --  Why go ye not ? Here is your list ! and all , Aye , every one whose name is here set down , Will my good guards release to you ! MIRIAM . Miriam Piso ! In mercy mock us not ! children of her Whom thou didst love  --  PISO . Piso Aye , maid ! but ye are his Whom I do hate ! That chord is broken now  --  Its music hushed ! Is she not in her grave ,  --  And he  --  within my grasp ? MIRIAM . Miriam Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  a moon-beam brief Upon a stormy sea . That magic name Hath rous 'd the wild , loud winds again .  --  Begone ! Save whom ye may . MIRIAM . Miriam Piso ! I go not hence Until my father 's name be on this scroll . PISO . Piso Take root , then , where thou art ! for by dark Styx I swear  --  MIRIAM . Miriam Nay , swear thou not , till I am heard . Hast thou forgot thy son ? PISO . Piso No ! let him die , So that I have my long-deferr 'd revenge ! Thy lip grows pale !  --  Art thou not answer 'd now ? MIRIAM . Miriam Deep horror falls upon me ! Can it be Such demon spirits dwell on earth ? PISO . Piso Maiden ! While thou art safe , go hence ; for in his might The tiger wakes within me ! MIRIAM . Miriam Be it so . He can but rend me where I stand . And here , Living or dying , will I raise my voice In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is round me in the silent air . On me Falleth the influence of an unseen Eye ! And in the strength of secret , earnest pray'r , This awful consciousness doth nerve my frame . Thou man of evil and ungovern 'd soul ! My father thou mayst slay ! Flames will not fall From heaven to scorch and wither thee ! The earth Will ope not underneath thy feet ! and peace , Mock , hollow , seeming peace , may shadow still Thy home and hearth ! But deep within thy breast A fierce , consuming fire shall ever dwell . Each night shall ope a gulf of horrid dreams To swallow up thy soul . The livelong day That soul shall yearn for peace and quietness , As the hart panteth for the water brooks , And know that even in death  --  is no repose ! And this shall be thy life ! Then a dark hour Will surely come  --  PISO . Piso Maiden , be warned ! All this I know . It moves me not . MIRIAM . Miriam Nay , one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth  --  Full as it is of young and gentle hearts  --  One man alone that loves a wretch like thee ; And he , thou say'st , must die ! All other eyes Do greet thee with a cold or wrathful look , Or , in the baseness of their fear , shun thine ; And he whose loving glance alone spake peace , Thou say'st must die in youth ! Thou know'st not yet The deep and bitter sense of loneliness , The throes and achings of a childless heart , Which yet will all be thine ! Thou know'st not yet What ' t is to wander ' mid thy spacious halls , And find them desolate ! wildly to start From thy deep musings at the distant sound Of voice or step like his , and sink back sick  --  Aye ! sick at heart  --  with dark remembrances ! To dream thou seest him as in years gone by , When , in his bright and joyous infancy , His laughing eyes amid thick curls sought thine , And his soft arms were twin 'd around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd thy name  --  Yet feel in agony ' t is but a dream ! Thou know'st not yet what ' t is to lead the van Of armies hurrying on to victory , Yet , in the pomp and glory of that hour , Sadly to miss the well-known snowy plume , Whereon thine eyes were ever proudly fix 'd In battle-field !  --  to sit , at deep midnight , Alone within thy tent  --  all shuddering  --  When , as the curtain 'd door lets in the breeze , Thy fancy conjures up the gleaming arms And bright young hero-face of him who once Had been most welcome there !  --  and worst of all  --  PISO . Piso It is enough ! The gift of prophecy Is on thee , maid ! A pow'r that is not thine Looks out from that dilated , awful form  --  Those eyes deep flashing with unearthly light  --  And stills my soul .  --  My Paulus must not die ! And yet  --  to give up thus the boon !  --  MIRIAM . Miriam What boon ? A boon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Death is not terrible , but only seems A dark , short passage to a land of light , Where , ' mid high ecstasy , he shall behold Th ' unshrouded glories of his Maker 's face , And learn all mysteries , and gaze at last Upon th ' ascended Prince , and never more Know grief or pain , or part from those he loves ! Yet will his blood cry loudly from the dust , And bring deep vengeance on his murderer ! PISO . Piso My Paulus must not die !  --  Let me revolve  --  Maiden ! thy words have sunk into my soul ; Yet would I ponder ere I thus lay down A purpose cherish 'd in my inmost heart , That which hath been my dream by night ,  --  by day My life 's sole aim . Have I not deeply sworn , Long years ere thou wert born , that should the gods E'er give him to my rage  --  and yet I pause ?  --  Shall Christian vipers sting mine only son , And I not crush them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and powerless ? Work , busy brain ! thy cunning must not fail . Retires . EUPHAS . Euphas My sister ! thou art spent . MIRIAM . Miriam Not yet ; although The strange excitement of my spirit dies , And stern suspense is fretting fast away The ties which hold that spirit from its home , Yet shall I linger till my task be done . Look ! on that moody brow what dost thou read ? EUPHAS . Euphas Alas ! no hope . And yet methinks a smile Of inward exultation sudden gleams Athwart his features , like a distant flash Of lurid lightning ' mid thick clouds . Sister ! I like it not . MIRIAM . Miriam He marks us watching him , And with a bright'ning aspect draweth nigh . PISO . Piso Children ! go hence in peace , for I have held Communion with my own fierce , warring thoughts , And there is something there which pleads your cause . I can not live on this dark earth alone ; I can not die , if burden 'd with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son To buy the luxury of my revenge ! So ye have won your boon , and I must stake My Paulus too on your fidelity ! Ye might deceive me ; but I read you well Two young , high-minded souls ;  --  to you I trust All that I hold most dear . In peace and hope Go hence , and send him home . MIRIAM . Miriam Go hence ! and how ? Leaving behind us those for whom we came ? PISO . Piso Fear not , for they shall follow thee . This hour , This instant , will I take myself the way That leads down to their dwellings dark and drear , And set them free . MIRIAM . Miriam And we will cling to thee , Blessing the hand which breaks a father 's chains , And thou shalt see our meeting , and rejoice To think that thou hast caused such happiness . PISO . Piso Nay , maiden ! dost forget ? My Paulus stands In jeopardy , and ye may be too late ! Seek ye my son , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not sound the depths of guile Within that cold and crafty breast ;  --  but woe ! If we should trust , and be deceiv 'd ! PISO . Piso How ! do ye wrong me thus ? Can such distrust Spring up in youthful hearts ? MIRIAM . Miriam We have good cause To doubt a Pagan , when he talks of peace Or mercy for his Christian foes . And yet  --  PISO . Piso Ye will go forth  --  for ye can do nought else . It is your destiny . MIRIAM . Miriam We will not dream There can be perfidy so base . We trust , And by the confidence of innocence Will we disarm thy wrath . EUPHAS . Euphas Nay , sister , more . He can not mock us now , for we still hold Our pledge until his promise be redeem 'd . PISO . Piso Then go . If harm betide my son  --  I see A dull gray light along the east !  --  Begone ! MIRIAM . Miriam Swear to us first  --  PISO . Piso What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods and by the sacred Styx , And by the precious blood of that one son , That I will take your father and his friends From yonder cells , and send them where ye list , Before yon stars grow dim ! Is it enough ? MIRIAM . Miriam Alone too must they come . PISO . Piso Aye , girl , alone . MIRIAM . Miriam And tell them they must seek that lonely spot Where we all met three nights ago . PISO . Piso I will . Aught more ? MIRIAM . Miriam No , nought . And now , when we behold The glad procession drawing nigh , with joy Will we release brave Paulus from our thrall , And send him back to comfort thine old age . And he will shield us from all other harm , While we make haste to quit this bloody land , Some , for a calmer home on earth  --  and one , For yonder skies ! PISO . Piso Speed hence ! watch o'er my son , And by th ' appointed hour ev'n yet your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To loose him soon as ye descry their train ; And bid him borrow wings to fly and ease A heart that hath been rack 'd for him this night , A heart that can be touch 'd through him alone . EUPHAS . Euphas Let us depart , though fear and doubt still brood Upon our souls . MIRIAM . Miriam Euphas ! we will not leave Such words to rankle in a soften 'd heart . Piso ! the child of her whom thou once lov 'd Leaves thee a blessing for the kindly hope Thy words have given . Thine be a long old age Of calm and penitence  --  stayed by the arm Of him whom I shall see but once  --  once more ! Farewell ! I yield  --  Euphas ! uphold my steps . This palace shall be his abode , when I Am silent in my grave ! Will he forget That there was once a Miriam ?  --  Lead forth ; The air will give me strength ; and we will thank Him who hath bid a gladsome light shine in On hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PISO . Piso And I may be deceiv 'd ! Yet I do trust you .  --  Haste ! it is the dawn , Gleaming through yon arcade , that bids your cheeks Look pale , and dims my tapers thus . If ye should be too late , earth hath no cave To hide you from my wrath ! Exeunt . SCENE III . A rising Ground in a deserted Garden , near the City Walls . Paulus , and Christians keeping guard . PAULUS . Paulus I have gaz 'd upward on yon twinkling gems Until my eyes grew dim ; and then have turn 'd To look upon the starlit face of things , Obscure , yet beautiful , and watched the moon Redd'ning ' mid earthborn mists , and verging fast To yonder hilly west , each in its turn ,  --  Hoping the outward calm of things so fair Might sink , as erst , into a troubled breast , And breathe their own deep quiet o'er my soul . Such things have been  --  but not for hours like these . My brow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye drinks in a placid scene  --  yet fills , Fills to the brim with silent , blinding tears ! And my heart beats against my aching breast With throbs of agony !  --  My Miriam ! Thou in thine innocence wilt die !  --  aye , die By a most cruel death ! and I am here , Bound in a strange and vile captivity ! ' T was the sole hope  --  and now I feel , ' t was vain ! I have no power to thrust the image stern Out of my soul  --  thee , trembling , cold , and pale , Bowing thy gentle head with murmur 'd pray'rs Beneath rough hands that bind thee to the cross . Ye gods ! the rest  --  the rest !  --  let me go mad , Ye pitying gods , and so escape the worst , Knowledge of that I can not see , yet know . And if , with strength by thrilling horror giv'n , I call my wandering fancy home , and chain Thought to the present  --  What were death 's worst pangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waving on high my own red-flashing sword , Meeting my death-blow in the hottest strife , Dying with shouts of victory in mine ears , Frowns on my brow , proud smiles upon my lips ? Alas ! the death of brutes  --  vain struggles , groans , And butchery , await me here !  --  Ye stars ! I watch you in your silent march ! I mark How one by one ye kiss yon shadowy hills , And steal into the chambers of the west , Sinking for ever from my eyes !  --  Farewell ! I shall not see you rise !  --  A few brief hours , Ye , in your tranquil beauty , shall look down Once more upon the spot where now I stand , And there behold me not . But ye shall see Token of bloody deed  --  the pure turf stain 'd  --  The scabbard haply cast in haste away  --  And boughs strown rudely o'er the darkest spot That tells the foul , foul tale of violence ! And what of this ? or why , at such an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I know not  --  I hold not The clews that guide my spirit 's wanderings ; And when they list , wild , dark imaginings Arise unbidden !  --  How ! ye do grow dim , Fair stars ! The breeze that fans my cheek Freshens with morn ! and yonder glowing moon Rests her broad rim upon the distant hills , And I descry a cypress , tall and dark , Drawn with its spreading boughs against her disk . My hours ebb low ! and I will watch no more The heavens and earth with dim and aching eyes . There is no claim within  --  and that without Makes but a broken image on my soul  --  A faithful mirror once of all fair things ! Sits down on a rock and hides his face with his hands . A long pause . FIRST CHRISTIAN . First Christian Friends ! by which path think ye they will approach ? SECOND CHRISTIAN . Second Christian By this . We shall descry them from afar , Threading the trees that fringe the river 's bank . PAULUS . Paulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices woke me from vain dreams  --  Vain dreams of other days !  --  Ye gods , how light ! The sky is full of light ! and golden clouds Are floating softly in the crimson east  --  Fit homes for those pure , bright-wing 'd , angel forms Which , Miriam says , do serve her God in heav'n ! I hear the gentle stir of waking birds Among the boughs that rustle o'er my head ; And , motionless as rocks , I dimly see The forms of men beneath the shadowing trees , Leaning upon their swords  --  keeping stern guard O'er one poor unarm 'd wretch !  --  Oh , why have I No weapon in extremity like this ? A pause . What was that soft , sweet note ? The prelude faint To the full matin concert of glad hearts Joying to see the morn !  --  Aye , there thou go'st , Up to the skies , fair bird ! and cleaving swift The balmy air with soft and busy wing , Thou pourest forth thy soul in melody ! I envy thee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vexes me while thus I watch Thine upward flight ! But thou art gone  --  and I  --  I am on earth , dark earth  --  and have no wings To bear me up to yonder happy realms ! FIRST CHRISTIAN . First Christian Seest thou aught ? SECOND CHRISTIAN . Second Christian Nought but the willow boughs , Waving and whispering in the rising breeze . PAULUS . Paulus Ye watch in vain . They will not , can not come ! My own wild hope hath fled ; my heart is sick . I hear chains rattling on their youthful limbs ; I see them gasping ' mid the dungeon damps , Clos 'd in with dark strong walls ! They can not come ! FIRST CHRISTIAN . First Christian The hour draws nigh . PAULUS . Paulus Aye , on the river 's face Vanish the dull red specks , that all night long Glimmer 'd , in faint reflection of the lamps That lit the student 's task , the sick man 's couch . Life wakes throughout the city .  --  Rome , my home ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep veiling darkness of the night ,  --  A wilderness of gardens , palaces , And stately fanes !  --  I can not see the roof , The one proud roof I seek !

Such a death Would have no horrors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! what seest thou ? SECOND CHRISTIAN . Second Christian A wreath of mist that sails along the stream . PAULUS . Paulus I will be patient . Could I think of aught ,  --  No matter what  --  save her , and this vile death  --  Such death as cowards die !  --  Could I but pierce , Were it but with one brief and shudd'ring glance , The cloudy curtain hanging o'er the grave !  --  Oh ! new , and strange , and awful , are the thoughts , Dim forming in this whirling brain ! Her words Come thrilling back upon my soul with might , Most like the might of solemn truth , warring With blind and steadfast prejudice !  --  Ha ! look ! Two forms come gliding yonder ' mid the trees ! FIRST CHRISTIAN . First Christian They come !  --  What may this mean ? PAULUS . Paulus Alas !  --  alone ! FIRST CHRISTIAN .

PAULUS . Paulus Nay , the gods Are sometimes touched by rarest innocence , And do by miracle melt iron hearts . Slowly they mount  --  Ha ! hidden by thick boughs  --  Christian ! I do implore thee  --  do the deed ! Spare those mild youthful eyes the sight of blood , Forth following the dagger 's point ! Be quick , And so be merciful ! FIRST CHRISTIAN .

Miriam Indeed that foot is weary , And the frame weak ; and the inward striving Of hope , and fear , and haste , hath lit no fire Upon this cheek  --  and I stand hovering On the grave 's utmost verge . Yet glad , oh glad Are the faint throbbings of this heart ! PAULUS . Paulus How !  --  speak ! MIRIAM . Miriam Doth not my soul speak from my joyous eyes ? They come ! for God went with us , and his voice Spake to the tyrant 's heart . EUPHAS . Euphas Entering . Aye , they are sav 'd , And thou , young heathen , spar 'd for happier days .

Oh , what is that faith worth which thus forsakes Its votary in trial 's darkest hour ? It might have been that thou hadst softly sapp 'd My youth 's belief  --  and so it proudly stood Until the blast came by  --  and then it shook . My gods ! I could not bear to think of them ! Why is my brain so dizzy ? MIRIAM . Miriam Friends , watch still ! Soon as ye see our brethren drawing nigh , The Pagan must away .

Oh ! it must work  --  it will ! That memory Within thy soul will yet have mighty pow'r ! Thou wert not made for base idolatry ! PAULUS .

Joy  --  joy and triumph now  --  PAULUS . Paulus Oh , name not joy . MIRIAM . Miriam Why not ? If but one ray of light from Heav'n Hath reach 'd thy soul , I may indeed rejoice ! Ev'n thus , in coming days , from martyrs ' blood Shall earnest saints arise to do God 's work .
