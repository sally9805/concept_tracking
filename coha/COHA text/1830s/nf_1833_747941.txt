txt /q/f whose roots , and of whose triumph in its greenness over the lapse of ages , he gives a splendid description in the second book of his Georgics , bore fruit which was used as food . The Quercus ilex ( the evergreen oak ) , which is still common in Spam , in Italy , in Greece , in Syria , hi the south of France , and on the shores of the Mediterranean , bears a fruit which , in its agreeable flavour , resembles nuts . It is a slow-growing tree , and is always found single , and not in clumps . There is another evergreen oak , Quercus ballota , very common in Spain and Barbary , of which the acorns are most abundant and nutritive . During the late war in Spain , the French armies were fortunate in finding subsistence upon the ballota acorns , in the woods of Salamanca . We are often startled by the assertions of ancient writers , that the acorn , in the early periods of society , formed the principal food of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished between the common acorn , and that of the Ilex , Ballota , and Esculus oaks . Some of the classic authors speak of the fatness of the primitive inhabitants of Greece and southern Europe , who , living in the forests which were planted by the hand of nature , were supported almost wholly upon the fruit of the oak . The Grecian poets and historians called these people balanophagi ( eaters of acorns ) ; but then the Greek word balanos , /z/ which the Romans translated glans ( acorn ) , applied also to such fruits as dates , nuts , beech-mast , and olives . These all contain large quantities of oil , which renders them particularly nutritive . Whether the custom existed among the ancient Britons , or ( as is more probable ) was imported by the Saxons who came from the thick oak forests of Germany , it is certain that , during the time when they held sway in this country , the fattening of hogs upon acorns in the forests was accounted so important a branch of domestic economy , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Ina enacted the panage laws for its regulation . The fruit of the oak then formed gifts to kings , and part of the dowries of queens . So very important was it , indeed , that the failure of the acorn crop is recorded as one of the principal causes of famine . One of the most vexatious acts of William the Conqueror , in his passion for converting the whole of the forests into huntinggrounds , was that of restricting the people from fattening their hogs ; and this restriction was one of the grievances which King John was called upon to redress at the triumph of Runnemede , where his assembled subjects compelled him to sign Magna Charta . It is to be observed that swine 's flesh was the principal food of most nations in the earlier stages of civilization ; and this is to be attributed to the extreme rapidity with which the hog species multiply . Up to a recent period , large droves of hogs were fattened upon the acorns of the New Forest , in Hampshire , under the guidance of swineherds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of a horn . At the present time , the hogs of Estremadura are principally fed upon the acorns of the Ballota oak ; and to this cause is assigned the great delicacy of their flesh . The history of the importance of the oak as timber /z/ nearly keeps pace with that of ship-building ; and there is little doubt that , from the time of Alfred , who first gave England a navy capable of contending with her enemies upon the sea , to that of Nelson , ( about nine hundred years afterwards , ) in whom nautical skill appears to have been raised to the greatest possible height , the oak was the principal and essential material in ship-building . It is more than probable that the inferiority of some of our more recently built ships , and the ravages which the dry-rot is making among them , have arisen from the substitution of foreign oak for that of native growth . A writer in a recent number of the Quarterly Review has ascribed this evil to the substitution of a foreign species of oak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native tree . In the same way , the real Scotch fir has been gradually superseded by a very inferior species , bearing the same name ; and the reason in each case appears to have been , that the seed of the spurious kind is much more plentiful , and grows more easily , than that of the real species . We subjoin the passage to which we have alluded : " We may here notice a fact long known to botanists , but of which our planters and purveyors of timber appear to have had no suspicion , that there are two distinct species of oak in England , the Quercus robur , and the Quercus sessiliflora ; the former of which affords a close-grained , firm , solid timber , rarely subject to rot ; the other more loose and sappy , very liable to rot , and not half so durable . This difference was noticed so early as the time of Ray ; and Martyn , in his Flora Rustica , and Sir James Smith , in his Flora Britannica , have added their testimonies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been introduced , some two or three ages ago , from the continent , where the oaks are chiefly of this latter species , especially in the German forests , the timber /q/ of which is known to be very worthless . But what is of more importance to us is , that , de facto , the impostor abounds , and is propagated vigorously in the New Forest and other parts of Hampshire , in Norfolk , and the northern counties , and about London ; and there is but too much reason to believe that the numerous complaints that were heard about our ships being infested with what was called , improperly enough , dry-rot , were owing to the introduction of this species of oak into the naval dockyards , where , we understand , the distinction was not even suspected . It may thus be discriminated from the true old English oak : the acorn-stalks of the Robur are long and its leaves short , whereas the Sessiliflora has the acornstalks short and the leaves long ; the acorns of the former grow singly , or seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in clusters of two or three , close to the stem of the branch . We believe the Russian ships of the Baltic , that are not of larch or fir , are built of this species of oak ; but if this were not the case , their exposure on the stocks , without cover , to the heat of summer , which , though short , is excessive , and the lifts and chinks , which fill up with ice and snow in the long winter , are enough to destroy the stoutest oak , and quite sufficient to account for their short-lived duration . " When the oak stands alone , it is a spreading rather than an elevated tree : in that situation the timber is also said to be more compact and firm , and the crooked arms of the trees are better adapted for shipbuilding than when the trees are close together . In thickly planted groups , the oak will reach an elevation of eighty or a hundred feet before it begins to decay ; and in some of the choicer trees , forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a single lateral branch , and of such diameter that , even at the smaller extremity , they will square to eighteen inches or two feet . These are as well adapted for beams /z/ and planking as the others are for crooked timbers ; and , therefore , in order to secure a proper supply , not only for maritime , but for domestic purposes , it is desirable to have them in both situations . The trunk of the detached oak acquires by far the greater diameter ; some of the old hollow trees , most of which are of this description , having a diameter of as much as sixteen feet in the cavity , and still a shell of timber on the outside , sufficiently vigorous for producing leaves and even acorns . The age to which the oak can continue to vegetate , even after the core has decayed , has not been fully ascertained . But , in favourable situations , it must be very considerable . In the JVew Forest , Evelyn counted , in the sections of some trees , three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of which must have recorded a year 's growth . The same celebrated planter mentions oaks in Dennington Park , near INewbury , once the residence of Chaucer , which could not have arrived at the size which they possessed in a less period than about three hundred years ; and though he does not say upon what evidence the opinion is grounded , Gilpin notices , in his Forest Scenery , " a few venerable oaks in the New Forest , that chronicle upon their furrowed trunks ages before the Conquest . " Some out of the number of ancient oaks that are celebrated , it may not be uninteresting to mention : One of the three in Dennington Park , the King 's Oak , was fifty feet high before a bough or even a knot appeared , and the base of it squared five feet entirely solid ; the Queen 's Oak was straight as a line for forty feet , then divided into two immense arms , and the base of it squared to four feet ; and Chaucer 's Oak , said to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , was still a most stately tree . The Framhngham oak ( Suffolk ) , used in the construction of the Royal Sovereign , was four feet nine inches /q/ square , and yielded four square beams , each fortyfour feet in length . An oak felled at Withy Park , Shropshire , in 1697 , was nine feet in diameter , without the bark ; there were twenty-eight tons of timber in the body alone ; and the spread of the top , from bough to bough , was one hundred and fortyfour feet . In Holt Forest , Hampshire , there was an oak , which , at seven feet from the ground , was thirty-four feet in circumference in 1759 , and twenty years after , the circumference had not increased half an inch . Dr. Plott mentions an oak at Norbury , which was of the enormous circumference of fortyfive feet ; and when it was felled , and lying flat upon the ground , two horsemen , one on each side the trunk , were concealed from each other . The same author mentions an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand three hundred and seventy-four men had sufficient room to stand . The Boddington oak , in the Vale of Gloucester , was fifty-four feet in circumference at the base . The larger arms and branches were gone in 1783 ; and the hollow cavity was sixteen feet in its largest diameter , with the top formed into a regular dome ; while the young twigs on the decayed top had small leaves about the size of those of the hawthorn , and an abundant crop of acorns . The hollow had a door and one window ; and little labour might have converted the tree into a commodious , and rather a spacious room . The Fairlop oak in Essex , though inferior in dimensions to the last mentioned , was a tree of immense size , being between six and seven feet in diameter , at three feet from the ground . Damory 's oak in Dorsetshire was the largest oak of which mention is made . Its circumference was sixty-eight feet ; and the cavity of it , which was sixteen feet long and twenty feet high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an old man for the entertainment of travellers , as an ale-house . The dreadful storm in the third year of /z/ last century shattered this majestic tree ; and in 1755 the last vestiges of it were sold as firewood . An immense oak was dug out of Hatfield bog . It was a hundred and twenty feet in length , twelve in diameter at the base , ten in the middle , and six at the smaller end where broken off . Some oaks have been as celebrated for being the records of historical events , as others have been for their magnitude , although a part of the celebrity may no doubt be fabulous . Not a hundred years ago , the oak in the New Forest , against which the arrow of Sir William Tyrrel glanced , before it killed William Rufus , is said to have been standing , though in such a state of decay , that Lord Delaware erected a monument to indicate the spot . The Royal Oak at Boscobell , in which Charles the Second concealed himself after the defeat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised from its acorns , the race seems now to be lost to vegetable history . An oak of still more venerable pretensions now stands , or lately stood , at Torwood Wood , in Stirlingshire , under the shadow of which the Scottish patriot Wallace is reported to have convened his followers , and impressed upon them , not only the necessity of delivering their country from the thraldom of Edward , but their power of doing it , if they were so determined . Gilpin mentions one , more ancient even than this Alfred 's oak at Oxford , which was a sapling when that great monarch founded the University . This can not , of course , be implicitly credited ; but still the very mention of such things proves , that the oak can reach an age several times exceeding that of the longest lived of the human race . Since oak was so much in demand , it has become an object of great attention to planters ; and the plants are carefully reared by nurserymen from the acorns . If the saplings are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations , they are several times transplanted in the nursery . The deformed ones are cut down to the ground , and then a young , vigorous , straight shoot is made , instead of that which was deformed . Some of those who have paid considerable attention to the subject are , however , of opinion , that although transplanting probably accelerates the growth a little , the advantage thereby gained is more than compensated by the deterioration of the timber , which is neither so strong , nor so durable , as that sown by the hand of nature , or where it is to be allowed to remain without transplanting . Of the various European oaks , the Quercus pedunculata is the most esteemed on the continent . It is a magnificent tree , considerably taller than our native oak . In the forests of Fontainebleau and of Compiegne there are at this day many trees of this species , the trunks of which measure from thirty to thirty-six feet in circumference at the base , and rise to the height of forty feet without a single branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , timber very inferior to our Quercus robur . It is probable that the species which is indifferently designated by French botanists Quercus robur , and Quercus sessiliflora , is , as stated in pages 6 and 7 , a species entirely different from our real English oak ; for the wood of the Quercus pedunculata is described by these writers as harder and more compact than that of the robur or sessiliflora . The Quercus alba of North America very much resembles the Quercus pedunculata . It is found in all the countries of the United States , from Florida up to Canada . It is the species chiefly used in shipbuilding , and for houses ; and casks for liquors are principally made of it , as those of the red oak will only contain dry goods . Considerable quantities of this timber are imported into England . Parkinson /z/ relates that the Indians extracted an oil from the acorns of this species , with which they prepared their food . The quercitron ( Quercus tindoria ) is , after the white oak , commonly preferred for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this species affords a yellow dye , which is a considerable article of commerce ; it is used for dyeing silk and wool . The quercitron is employed by the Americans in tanning leather , chiefly on account of its abundance ; but the yellow colour which it imparts to skins is considered a defect , and is generally removed by a subsequent chemical process . In the United States , the bark of almost every sort of tree is used for tanning ; the abundance with which it is procured rendering selection less necessary . In England , oak bark is almost exclusively applied to this purpose , as it contains the largest quantity of tannin of any known substance . The leaves of some trees may be so applied . The Chinese use the coarser leaves of the tea-tree in the preparation of leather . A fine oak is one of the most picturesque of trees . It conveys to the mind associations of strength and duration , which are very impressive . The oak stands up against the ' blast , and does not take , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds . Except the cedar of Lebanon , no tree is so remarkable for the stoutness of its limbs : they do not exactly spring from the trunk , but divide from it ; and thus it is sometimes difficult to know which is stem and which is branch . The twisted branches of the oak , too , add greatly to its beauty ; and the horizontal direction of its boughs , spreading over a large surface , completes the idea of its sovereignty over all the trees of the forest . Even a decayed oak , " - ' dry and dead , Still clad with reliqtecf hs trophies old , Lifting to heaven its aged , hoary head , Whose foot on earth hath got but feeble hold " /q/ even such a tree as Spenser has thus described is strikingly beautiful ; decay in this case looks pleasing . To such an oak Lucan compared Pompey in his declining state . The CORK QAK ( Quercus suber is not so large a tree as the common-oak . There are several varieties : a broad leaved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties , which shed their leaves . The broad leaved evergreen is , however , the most common , and it is the one from which the cork of commerce is chiefly obtained . It is mentioned by Theophrastus , Pliny , and some other ancient naturalists as being well known in the days of the Greeks and Romans , the latter of whom used it for a variety of purposes , and among the rest for the stopping of bottles . They used , it for floats to their nets and fishing tackle ; for buoys to their anchors ; and when Camillus was sent to the Capitol , through the Tiber , during the siege by the Gauls , he had a lifepreserver of cork under , his dress . The Cork Oak is indigenous , or at least abundant , in Portugal , Spain , part of the south of France , and Italy ; on the opposite coast of the Mediterranean , and the Levant . Spain and Portugal supply the greater portion of the cork which is consumed in Europe . The cork is the bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all trees ; but here the outer bark is of larger quantity , and is more speedily renewed . When removed , there is a liber , or inner bark , below it , and from this the cork is reproduced in the course of a few years , while the tree is said to live longer , and grow more vigorously , than if the cork were not removed . The first time that the cork is taken off , is when the tree is about fifteen years old . That crop is thin , hard , full of fissures , and consequently of little value ; and the /q/ /z/ Cork Oak Quercus suber. second , which is removed about ten years after , is also of an inferior quality . After this , the operation is repeated once in eight or ten years , the produce being greater hi quantity , and superior in quality , each successive time . According to Duhamel , a corktree thus barked will live a hundred and fifty years . The months of July and August are those which are chosen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at certain intervals , down to the crown of the root , with an axe , of which the handle terminates in a wedge ; and a circular incision is then made from each extremity of the longitudinal cuts . The bark is then beaten , to detach it from the liber ; and it is lifted up by introducing the wedged handle , taking care to leave sufficient of the inner /z/ laminae upon the wood , without which precaution the tree would certainly die . The bark being thus removed , it is divided into convenient lengths ; and it is then flattened , and slightly charred , to contract the pores . This substance is the rough cork of commerce ; and it is thus fit to be cut into floats , stoppers , shoesoles , and other articles of domestic use , by the manufacturer . The cork of the best quality is firm , elastic , and of a slightly red colour . Two thousand five hundred tons of cork were imported into the United Kingdom in 1827 . Cork burned in vessels Cork Tree in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular construction gives the substance called Spanish black . The Oak from which the nut-galls of commerce are procured ( Quercus infectofia ) is minutely described by M. Olivier , in his travels . The species is very common in Asia-Minor ; but , . till the time of this traveller , Europeans had very little information on the subject , although the galls were a considerable article of commerce . It is a shrub , seldom exceeding six feet in height ; and it has not only been accurately described by M. Olivier , but was introduced by him into France , where it is cultivated as a garden shrub , and grows well in the open air . The gall is a morbid excrescence produced by the puncture of a winged insect , to which Olivier has given the name of DiploJepis Gallce Tinctoriae . This excrescence is of a globular form , with an unequal and tuberculous surface . It is developed on the young shoots of the tree , and contains within it the eggs which the insect has deposited . The best galls are gathered before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are heavier , and contain more of the tannin principle . When the insect has left them , they are pierced from the interior to the surface . The best galls come from Aleppo . The substance of which they are composed is peculiarly astringent ; of which , according to Sir Humphry Davy , five hundred parts contain a hundred and eighty parts of soluble matter , principally formed of tannin and gallic acid . One hundred and seventy-four tons of galls were imported into the United Kingdom in 1827 . The instinct by which certain insects choose for the nests of their future offspring the substance of various vegetable bodies , is one of the most curious provisions in the economy of nature . After having pierced those bodies , they deposite their eggs , which , being hatched , produce /arce , that are more or /q/ less fatal to the vegetable substance to which they are attached . According to Virey , an irritation is produced by the introduction of these insects , that resembles a tumour and inflammation in an animal body . The cellular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , become round ; and the flow of liquid matter produces a change of organization , from which results a complete change in the external form of the organ . In this way is the gall produced . The oak-apple is an excrescence of the same nature , though affected by a different species of insect . There are various insects possessing the instinct thus to deposite their eggs , that are furnished with an apparatus of the most curious construction , necessary for puncturing the branch , as is done by the parent ; and for piercing a way out of the gall , as is done by the insect produced , after it has passed its larva state . Each species of insect chooses not only the particular vegetable , but the part of that vegetable which is best adapted for the reception of its larvae ; and in this way the same plant , for instance the oak , sometimes receives the nests of twenty different species of insects . A gall sometimes contains a single larva , sometimes many , and it is thus either called simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given us some sensible observations on the subject of galls , and the instincts of the little creatures that produce them : " The insect that wounds the leaf of the oak , and occasions the formation of the gall-nut , and those which are likewise the cause of the apple rising on the sprays of the same tree , and those flower-like leaves on the buds , have performed very different operations , either by the instrument that inflicted the wound , or by the injection of some fluid to influence the action of the parts . That extraordinary hairy excrescence on the wild rose , likewise the result /z/ of the wounds of an insect ( Cynips rosee ) , resembles no other nidus required for such creatures that we know off ; and these red spines on the leaf of the maple are different again from others . It is useless to inquire into causes of which we probably can obtain no certain results ; but , judging by the effects produced by different agents , we must conclude , that , as particular birds require and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , and make choice of dissimilar materials , though each species has the same instruments to affect it , where , generally speaking , no sufficient reasons for such variety of forms and texture is obvious ; so is it fitting that insects should be furnished with a variety of powers and means to accomplish their requirements , having wants more urgent , their nests being at times to be so constructed as to resist the influence of seasons , to contain the young for much longer periods , even occasionally to furnish a supply of food , or be a storehouse to afford it . when wanted by the infant brood* . " Reaumur , the distinguished naturalist , in his Memoirs on Insects , has . a most minute and interesting account of the admirable mechanism by which the genus Cynips ( the insect which produces the gallnut ) conducts its remarkable operations . It is provided with a needle in a sheath , which has most surprising powers of extension , derived from the peculiar construction of the whole body of the insect , so much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the animal itself ; ' and thus , as we have seen , it forms a nest for its offspring , while the young , in the same manner , pierce their . way out of the vegetable shell which has been their protection . In Spain , in the southern provinces of France , and along the Mediterranean coasts of Africa , there is * Journal of a Naturalist , page 109. /q/ found in great plenty a small species of oak , called the Kermes ( Quercus cocci/era ) , which is remarkable for nourishing large quantities of a small insect ( Coccus ilicis ) , which , being gathered , forms an article of commerce called kermes . The declivities of the Sierra Morena are covered with the kermes oak ; and many of the inhabitants of the province of Murcia have no other mode of living than gathering the kermes . Latreille has united this insect to the cochineal family , which it resembles , not only in its form , but in producing a scarlet dye . Till the discovery of the cochineal insect upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kermes was the only substance used in dyeing scarlet , from the period of the disuse and loss of the Murex and Buccinum , the shell-fish that produced the Tyrian purple of the Romans . The people of Barbary employ the kermes for dyeing the scarlet caps used by the natives in the Levant , and they prefer that of Spain to their own produce . In England , and in other countries where manufactures are extensively carried on , the cochineal has almost entirely superseded the use of the insect scarlet dye of Europe . Though the TEAK TREE ( Tectona grandis be a tree of quite a different family from the oak , and a native of India , it is used in ship-building like the oak , and has some resemblance to it in its timber . It is a tree of- uncommon size , with leaves twenty inches long , and sixteen broad , and bears a hard nut . The country ships in India , as well as many very fine ones that trade between India and this country , are built of it . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sixty years ago ; but from the warmth of the climate of which it is a native , it can never become a forest-tree in this country . /z/ Besides its value as timber , the teak has great beauty as a tree . It is found more than two hundred feet high , and the stem , the branches , and the leaves are all very imposing . On the banks of the river Irrawaddy , in the Birman empire , the teak forests are unrivalled ; and they rise so far over the jungle or brushwood , by which tropical forests are usually rendered impenetrable , that they seem almost as if one forest were raised on gigantic poles over the top of another . The teak has not the broad strength of the oak , the cedar , and some other trees ; but there is a grace in its form which they do not possess Teak Teotona grandis . /z/ ALTHOUGH , " in all or- most ' of . its species , not next to the oak in the strength or the durability of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place among valuable trees . It is very abundant , its growth is comparatively rapid , and its wood is straight , elastic , and easily worked . Accordingly , as oak is the chief timber in building ships for the sea , pine is the principal one in the construction of houses upon land . It is " the Builder 's timber : " and as , when the carpenter wants a post or a beam of peculiar strength and durability , he has recourse to the oak ; so when the shipwright wishes to have a piece of timber that shall combine lightness with great length , as for a spar or mast , he makes use of the pine . The distinct species of pines enumerated by the botanists are about twenty-one . None of these bear flat leaves , but a sort of spines , which , however , are true leaves . They are mostly , though not all , evergreens ; but the appearance of the tree , as well as the quality of the timber , varies with the species , and also with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timber is the more hard and durable the colder the situation is , and the slower the tree grows ; and in peculiar positions it is not unusual to find the northern half of a common pine hard and red , while the southern half , though considerably thicker from the pith to the bark , is white , soft , and spongy . No account can be given of the first use of the different species of pines by the natives of the coun- /z/ tries where they are indigenous . The cedar of Lebanon appears to have been used from the earliest periods of Syrian history . The Romans , and after them the Venetians , made use of the larch for architectural and household purposes , as well as in the construction of their galleys and vessels . The Norwegians and Danes constructed their first ships of the pines of the Scandinavian mountains . Upon the Gulph of Bothnia , near the borders of Lapland , at the bottom of one of the forests sloping towards a bay , Dr. Clarke saw a pine-vessel of forty-six tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives upon one of the wildest scenes of the coast , without the aid of docks , or any other convenience required by marine architects. * The people of the northern parts of Britain still make their boats , and the rudest of them even their cordage , of the pine ; and though the timber of the pines of the New World be , upon the whole , less hard and durable than of those of Europe , it is employed for shipbuilding , as well as for domestic purposes . The pine found in the bogs of Ireland is of a very superior quality , and used by the inhabitants for many purposes . Some persons of rank in that country have halls and other apartments floored with bogpine ; while , in several districts , it is the only timber of the peasants , who make of it their wooden utensils , and also their cordage . It is perfectly proof against the worm ; and seems , in durability , almost to rival the cedar itself . From the greater ease with which it can be worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine is now chiefly employed in the roofs , floors , and internal finishing of houses ; the European sort , where it has to bear a strain , or is exposed to wearing , and the softer kinds , from America , for internal mouldings and ornaments . * Travels in Scandinavia . /q/ As is the case now with a great part of Canada , Norway , Sweden , the eastern shore of the Baltic , and some considerable tracts of the Highlands of Scotland , it is probable that , in very early ages , great part of Britain , with those islands towards the north , in which there is now hardly a shrub of any kind , were covered by pine forests . There has been much controversy amongst the learned whether the pine was indigenous to England . CaBsar expressly says that Britain had all the trees of Gaul , except the beech and fir . It is remarkable , however , that our names for the beech are derived from the Roman word fagus ; but the fir has three names , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tree was not introduced by the Romans , but was originally British. * The fir is perpetually discovered in such of our mosses as were certainly prior to the time of the Romans ; remains of the tree have been found , not only on the sides of Roman roads , but actually under them . But a more complete proof of the ancient existence of pine forests in England has been afforded by a minute examination of an extensive district called Hatfield Chase , in Yorkshire . This curious subject was investigated with great diligence by the Rev. A. De la Pryme , and the results of his researches were communicated to the Royal Society , in a paper published in their Transactions for 1701 . Of this paper the following is the substance ; and we have generally retained the author 's own expressions . The famous levels of Hatfield Chase were the largest chase of red deer that King Charles the First had in England , containing in all above 180,000 acres of land , about half of which was yearly drowned by vast quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vermuiden , a Dutchman , he at length effectually dischased , drained , and reduced it to constant arable and . pasture grounds , with immense labour , and at the - expense of about 400-,000/ . In the soil of all or mosof these 180,000 acres of land , of which 90,000 - were drained , even " in the bottom of the river Ohse , and in the ' bottom of the adventitious soil of all Marshland , and round about by the skirts of the Lincolnshire Wolds , unto Gainsbury , Bawtry , Doncaster , Bain , Snaith , and Holden , v. are found vast multitudes of the roots and trunks ' of frees , of all sizes , great and small , and of most of the sorts which this island either formerly did , or at present does , produce ; as fir , oak , birch , beech , yew , thorn , willow , ash , &c.,; the roots of all or most of which stand in the soil in their natural position , as thick as ever they could grow , as the trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the large trees lie along about a yard from their roots , ( to which they evidently belonged , both by , their situation and the sameness of the wood , ) with their tops commonly north-east , though , indeed , ' the smaller trees lie almost every way , across the former , some over , and others under them ; a third part of all being pitch trees , or firs , some of which are thirty yards in length or upwards , and sold for masts and keels of ships . Oaks have been found , of twenty , thirty , and thirty-five yards long , yet wanting many yards at the small end ; they are as black as ebony , and very durable in any service they are put to . It is very observable , and manifestly evident , that many of those trees of all sorts have been burnt , but especially the pitch or fir trees , some quite through , and some all on a side ; some have been found chopped and squared , some bored , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and broken axeheads , somewhat like sacrificing axes in shape ; and all /q/ this in such places and at such depths that they could never have been opened since the destruction of this forest till the time of the drainage . Near a large root , in the parish of Hatfield , were found eight or nine coins of some of the Roman emperors , but exceedingly consumed and defaced with time ; and it is very observable , that on the confines of this low country , between Burningham and Brumby in Lincolnshire , are several great hills of loose sand , under which , as they are yearly worn and blown away , are discovered many roots of large firs , with the marks of the axe as fresh upon them as if they had been cut down only a few weeks . Hazel-nuts and acorns have frequently been found at the bottom of the soil of those levels and moors , and whole bushes of fir-tree apples , or cones , in large quantities together . The author of this paper then goes on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cutting down the trees , and partly by burning them ; and that these fallen trees dammed up the rivers , which , forming a lake , gave origin to the large turfmoors of that part of the country . The Romans themselves mention cutting down the British forests , as well for the purpose of making roads through the country , as to drive the natives out of their fastnesses . In the peat-bogs of the bleakest districts of Scotland , the remains of pine trees are very abundant ; and such is their durability , in consequence of the quantity of turpentine they contain , that , where the birch is reduced to a pulp , and the oak cracks into splinters , as it dries , the heart of the pine remains fresh , and , embalmed in its own turpentine , is quite elastic , and used by the country people in place of candles . In England , too , subterraneous beds of pines have been found ; and though , in consequence of the greater warmth of the climate , these contain less turpentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cones , or /q/ /z/ seed-vessels , shew that they belong to the same species . One of the most singular changes to which any country can be subjected , is that which arises from the formation of extensive masses of peat-earth . They are common in most of the colder parts of the world ; and are known in Ireland ( where they occupy nearly one-tenth of the surface ) by the name of bogs , and in Scotland by the name of peat-mosses . These accumulations of a peculiar vegetable matter are a sort of natural chronicle of the countries in which they are found . In the northern parts of the island of Great Britain , and in many places of Ireland , especially in the central parts , between the Irish Sea and the Shannon , they point out that the soil and climate were once far superior to what the country now , in those situations , enjoys . The era of the first commencement of these bogs is not known ; but as in many of them , both in Ireland and Scotland , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live specimens now exist in the country , and have not been since the commencement of recorded history , their origin must be referred to very remote periods . Notwithstanding this , the formation of a peat-bog , under favourable circumstances , does not appear to be a very lengthened process ; for George Earl of Cromarty mentions ( Philosophical Transactions , No. 330 ) that near Loch Broaw , on the west of Rossshire , a considerable portion of ground had , between the years 1651 and 1699 , been changed from a forest of barked and leafless pines , to a peat-moss or bog , hi which the people were cutting turf for fuel . The process , according to the Earl 's description , which has been verified by the observations of others , is this : The pines , after having stood for some time deprived of their bark , and bleaching in the rains , * ' rv , /q/ which , in that country , are both heavy and frequent , are gradually rotted near their roots , and fall , generally , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent in the British isles . After the trees have fallen , and have been soaked by the rains , they are soon covered by various species of fungi . When these begin to decay , the rain washes the adhesive matter into which they are reduced between the fallen tree and the ground , and a dam is thus formed which collects and contains the water . Whenever this takes place , the surface of the stagnant pool , or the moist earth , becomes green with mosses , and these mosses further retain the water . It is a property of those species of moss which grow most readily in cold and moist districts , to keep decomposing at the roots while they continue to grow vigorously at the tops . Cold and humidity , as has been said , are the circumstances in which the mosses that rot and consolidate into peat are formed ; and when the mosses begin to grow , they have the power of augmenting those causes of their production . The mossy surface , from its spongy nature , and from the moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very worst conductors of heat ; and thus , even in the warmest summers , the surface of moss is always comparatively cold . Beside the spongy part of the moss , which retains its fibrous texture for many years , there is a portion of it , and especially of the small fungi and lichens with which it is mixed , that is every year reduced to the consistency of a very tough and retentive mould . That subsides , closes up the openings of the spongy roots of the moss , and renders the whole water-tight . The retention of the water is further favourable to the growth of the moss , both in itself , and by means of the additional cold which it produces in the summer . The following account of the conversion of forests /z/ into bogs is said to be from the pen of Sir Walter Scott , and it is certainly characterised by that accuracy of observation and felicity of expression for which he is so remarkable : " Extensive forests , occupying a long tract of tolerably level ground , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bogs . The wood which they might have produced was useless to the proprietors ; the state of the roads , as well as of the country in general not permitting so bulky and weighty an article to be carried from the place where it had grown , however valuable it might have proved had it been transported elsewhere . In this situation the trees of the natural forest pined and withered , and were thrown down with the wind , and it often necessarily happened that they fell into , or across , some little stream or rivulet , by the side of which they had flourished and decayed . The stream being stopt , saturated with standing water the soil around it ; and instead of being , as hitherto , the drain of the forest , the stagnation of the rivulet converted into a swamp what its current had formerly rendered dry . The loose bog earth , and the sour moisture with which it was impregnated , loosened and poisoned the roots of other neighbouring trees , which , at the next storm , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to impede the current of the water ; while the accumulating moss , as the bog earth is called in Scotland , went on increasing and heaving up , so as to bury the trunks of the trees which it had destroyed . In the counties of Inverness and Ross , instances may be seen , at the present day , where this melancholy process , of the conversion of a forest into a bog , is still going forward . " When a peat-bog or moss has begun to form , there is no limit to its increase , save the pressure of the water which it contains . In the part of /q/ Ireland that has been mentioned that is , from the county of Cavan to that of Kildare , a bog occupies the summit level instead of mountains , and is in some places at least fifty feet in thickness ; and though there be partial islands of more firm soil in the extent of it , the highest grounds are composed of peat . In many parts of Scotland , too , the bogs occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing from the one extremity to the eastern sea , and fronj the other to the western . When these bogs are situated high , and have their surfaces sloping , they are comparatively compact , though at a little distance from the surface they always contain a great deal of moisture . But when they are on less elevated situations , and the surface is partially covered with grass , they are often of very soft consistence below , while the grass forms a tough skin on the surface . In Ireland these are called moving-bogs , and in Scotland quaking mosses . They are very perilous to travellers , and can not in general be pastured by cattle . In seasons which are very rainy , those bogs are apt to imbibe a greater portion of moisture than the surface can retain ; but as the surface is not of a kind through which the water can percolate and escape quietly , a disruption takes place ; and when , which is by no means unfrequently the case , the bog is situated on a base higher than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a black deluge . These burstings , or motions of bogs , are by no means unfrequent in Ireland , where there have been some of very recent occurrence ; but one of the most singular is that of the disruption of the Solway Moss on the confines of England and Scotland , which took place on the 16th of December , 1772 . The Solway Moss occupied an extent of about /z/ thirteen hundred acres , had a comparatively tough surface , or covering , but was very soft beneath , and vibrated very much when trod upon . So dangerous was its surface , that a number of the army of Sinclair , in the time of Henry VIII. , were lost in it , more especially those who were on horseback ; and it is said that the skeleton of a trooper and his horse , and the armour of the rider , were found , not long before the disruption of the moss . The Solway Moss stretched along an eminence , varying in height from fifty to eighty feet above the fertile plain which lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface was comparatively flat , and consisted of very loose quagmires , interspersed with hummocks , or hassocks , of coarse grass . Previous to the 16th of December there had been very heavy rains , and the waters accumulated from their not being able to find vent . The surface rose , till the pressure of the water became too great for its strength , and then it burst with considerable noise , and descended into the plain , carrying ruin wherever it went . The time of the bursting was about eleven at night on the 15th , and the inhabitants of the farms and hamlets that were nearest to the moss were surprised in their beds by the unexpected visiter . In the rate of its progress the eruption of this moss resembled those of the lavas of Etna and Vesuvius , which , when in a half consolidated state , creep over the plains , and cover them with ruin . In consequence of the slowness of its motion no lives were lost , but many of the people escaped with difficulty . It is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the poor inhabitants of Eskdale were thrown by this event . They were a simple rustic people , not a little superstitious , and , therefore , when the dark and semi-fluid mass began to crawl along their plains , /q/ awakening them from their sleep by its invasion , they could not but be alarmed . The attempts to escape from the houses led to new alarms ; for when the door was opened a torrent was ready to enter : and they to whom the visitation first came were , both from that visitation itself , and from ignorance of its real cause , in very great consternation . They , however , spread the alarm ; and driving their cattle before them , and carrying their children and the most valuable and portable of their household articles , they roused their neighbours as they went . It was fortunate that the inhabitants were scattered over the country , for had they been collected into a village , there can be little doubt that the alarm and confusion would have occasioned the loss of many lives . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cattle escaped , they were , for the most part , obliged to leave their corn to be buried under the black deluge . When the morning dawned , the appearance of their homes was sadly changed . Instead of fields , and little hedge-rows , and cottage-gardens , with all the other interesting features of a rich and rural country , there was one black waste of peat earth . Some of the cottages had totally disappeared , others presented only the roof , the eaves of which were at least eight feet from the ground . When first seen , the extent that the moss covered was not less than two hundred acres . Successive torrents of rain that fell afterwards augmented the mischief , till ultimately the whole surface covered extended to at least four hundred acres . The highest parts of the moss had subsided to the depth of about twenty-five feet , and the height of the moss on the lowest parts of the country which it had invaded was , at least , fifteen feet . The bursting of the Solway Moss resembled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dam . Between it /z/ and the cultivated plain , the bottom of the moss was lower than the general level of a sort of ridge that formed the boundary between them . But in this ridge there was one depression , not unaptly called the " Gap ; " and through that the flood of moss and water descended . This gap was from 100 to 150 feet in width ; and there can be no question that the resistance which the fluid met with in it tended to the safety of the people : for had the whole come upon them in a continued sheet , the danger and difficulty of escape would have been much greater . Pine is not the only timber found in those bogs , though it be the kind most frequently met with in a mountainous country , more especially of those places where forests of pines are still growing , or which are favourable to their growth . Pines do not thrive in low situations , or by the banks of slowrunning rivers . The timber which grows best in those situations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently the timber most generally found in river-side peat ; though , in consequence of the warmth , peat is hot very apt to form in such situations . The greater accumulations of it are on higher grounds , and often on the summits of the mountains . In some places , which are of intermediate height , there often appears a singular stratification in the bogs , which indicates a succession of changes of climate , all for the worse ; and as the junctions of these strata are sometimes pretty well defined , it is difficult to account for them by any regular succession of seasons . We are thence led to conclude , that , after the one species was formed , a pause of some years at least must have taken place before the soil and climate were in a fit state for the production of the others . There may be exceptions ; but in so far as our observation has gone , the oak forms in /q/ those stratified bogs the lowermost timber . It is at the very bottom , reposing generally upon sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appears to have been absorbed by the mosses , or incorporated with them into the very hard peat in which the oak is contained . It may be proper also to mention , that the roots of the oak are wholly contained in the moss , and do not , in any instance that we have seen , penetrate into the sand or clay . Some of the oaks that have been found in the peat mosses of Scotland are of large dimensions , and they are often met with in situations where oaks now grow with difficulty , and never attain any size ; and hence , as the oak is not a native of very cold climates , we may conclude that the climate of those places must have been more genial at some former period than it is at present . Pines are not very generally found in the same bogs or mosses with oak ; but when they are so , they occur about the same apparent period of the formation , and are to be traced only on the more elevated parts of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peat in which the oak is contained is , as has been mentioned , of a compact texture , and some of it forms a fuel but little inferior to coal . About it there is often found a stratum , in which there is much more wood than that below ; but the kinds are different . Birch and hazel are the prevailing woods in that second stratum : the timber is in general decayed ; but the nuts of the hazel are in a state of considerable preservation ; and some of the seeds that have been found at this depth have vegetated , though they had probably lain for several centuries in the peat earth , in which their outer coats must have been literally tanned . When there is a third stratum of wood , which is not often the case , the timber which it contains is chiefly alder , with /z/ the twigs of the bog-myrtle ( Myrica Gale ) . After these , the peat becomes of a very spongy nature , and contains no vegetable substance of larger dimensions than the steam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller portions of peat which lie in dells , in countries not much elevated , contain in general only the twigs and the nuts of hazel . The fall of timber is not , however , essential to the formation of peat bogs , for , in many of them , the remains of trees have not been found . Scotch Fir . Pinus sylvestris- The pines found native in Britain , whether buried in the earth , or growing on its surface , are all of one species , the Pinus sylvestris , or wild pine in this country usually termed the Scotch fir . This pine is very generally diffused . It is found in all the northern regions , and in elevated ones considerably to the south . The timber which it produces is called red deal , or yellow deal , according to the colour ; and as deals are the form in which it is often conveniently imported /q/ from Norway and the Baltic , the word deal has become the common name for all sorts of pine timber . With the exception of cedar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces better timber than any of the pines . It is good , too , almost in proportion to the slowness of its growth . When it is cut directly to the centre , or right across the grain , as for breasts of violins , and the soundingboards of other musical instruments , it is very beautiful , the little stripes formed by the annual layers being small and delicate , and in perfectly straight lines . This pine very often , though not in trees completely matured , contains sap-wood next the bark ; and toward the pith it is a little spongy . The best part is that nearest the root ; and the roots themselves are excellent for any purpose that their size and shape will answer . It has been mentioned , that pine timber is best in cold situations ; it is also best on light soils , and when planted by nature . On strong clay it grows badly , and the timber is worth little ; and on rich loams , though it grows rapidly , the timber is of inferior quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune the sap-wood changes to durable wood has not been determined by very accurate observation ; although most writers on vegetable physiology conceive that the ligneous matter is deposited in the second year . We have counted four or five annual layers of sap upon some trees , more than a dozen on others ; and where trees have been much exposed to the mid-day sun , we have seen the whole southern half little better than sap-wood , while the northern half contained only a layer or two at the circumference . Pines , and this pine in particular , occur in much more extensive forests , and with a far less admixture of other trees , than any other genus whatever . Immense districts in North America are covered with /z/ them ; and so are the mountains of Sweden and Norway , and the sandy tracts near the Baltic . In Poland also , upon each side of the river JVIemel , they grow in great abundance , so that Memel fir is imported into this country hi large quantities . Though the pine is not the timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , as we ascend high mountains , or at the verge of vegetation as we approach the pole , yet , after a certain elevation , and north of the latitude of about 55 , it is by far the most abundant timber , in Europe , hi America , and in Asia . From the peculiar nature of the surface in Siberia , the country which occupies the north of Asia , from the intense cold , and lowness of the portion next to the sea , the forests in that part of the world are not very extensive , till we arrive at some distance from the Arctic ocean . In America , too , there are naked tracts between the sea , or the ice , or the polar land , or whatever may , on the part of the boundary that has not been explored , lie further north than discovery has yet reached . But , from the summit of the ridge that extends from the dreary shores of Labrador westward , across the country , till it subsides in the central marshes about Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estuary of the St. Lawrence , as far as the boundary of the United States , the land , before it began to be cleared by European settlers , was covered by one immense forest of pine ; and much of the clearing has been accomplished by burning , or otherwise destroying the trees . On the south side of the St. Lawrence , the forest reached down to the water along the whole shore , and upon the islands ; and advantage has been taken of this to send a great deal of the most accessible of the timber to the European market , and to distil into tar a good deal of that which was not so accessible . The pine forests ' of the north of Europe are , however , /q/ the most valuable , especially on account of the quality of their timber . Once they abounded over the greater part both of the continent and the islands , but in the latter situations they have been exhausted somewhat wantonly . Not much more than a century , or a century and a half ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , in that elevated part of the country which extends through the counties of Donegal and Tyrone , and separates the rivers that flow to the sea on the north , from those that flow south and east to Loughs Earn and Neagh . Hardly a vestige of that forest now remains , nor is there any very clear account of what became of it . In the lowlands and rich soils of Scotland there perhaps never was an extensive pine forest ; but there can be little doubt that upon the uplands the pine was once as general as it now is in the back settlements of Upper Canada . Of these forests many vestiges still remain . The fragment which lies farthest to the south-west is that of Rannoch , on the confines of the shires of Perth , Inverness and Argyle . The greater part of that forest has , however , been felled , and the timber was floated down the Tummel and the Tay , for a distance of at least sixty miles to Perth , from Rannoch . The roots that remain bleaching on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in sheltered situations , or in situations which are not accessible , afford evidence that the forest once extended eastward not only to the remaining woods of Mar , at the sources of the Dee and the Don , in the west part of Aberdeenshire , but to the shore of the sea along that bleak ridge in the northern part of the county of Mearns , which forms the southern boundary of the valley of the Dee , and in the very extensive peat moss , upon which pine is the submerged timber almost exclusively found . Further to the north , the pine forest appears once to have /q/ /z/ reached much nearer to the sea ; though in the lowlands of the shires of Aberdeen and Moray the chief evidence of it now is in the peat mosses or bogs : in these , however , it is abundant so much so , that it forms an article of commerce , not only in the villages near which it is found , but in the city of Aberdeen . The sapwood is altogether gone ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain a vast quantity of turpentine : this renders them much superior to any other wood for kindling fires ; and in the country districts slips of them are used as a substitute for candles . Along the shores of the Moray Firth , no remains of the forest are found above ground , on the slopes of the mountains that are nearest to the sea ; but at what may be considered as the highest summit of the Grampians , amidst the immense mountains of Cairngorm , Brae Riach , and Ben-mhuic-dhu , there are very extensive forests in the glens or valleys of the rivers that flow northward to the Spey . The estate of Rothiemurchus , in that part of Scotland , consists almost exclusively of natural pine forests . In places where it can be removed , the timber of this forest is of great value , and forms the chief revenue of the proprietor of the estate . The surface has , generally speaking , a northern aspect ; and , in consequence of the very high mountains which lie to the south , with at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the climate is very cold , so that the pine of Rothiemurchus is full of turpentine , and is of excellent quality . A considerable portion of the pine which is in the most accessible places has been cut down ; but , differing from many other parts of Scotland , a succession springs up , and that forest appears to have still the power of continuing itself , and is , perhaps , the only pine forest in the island which has that power . /q/ The Rothiemurchus pine is generally floated down the river Spey ; and when it is once brought to that river , the passage of a raft is a matter of little difficulty at any season . In times of drought there is , however , a good deal of difficulty in getting the timber to the Spey ; and , in order to accomplish that object , the workmen collect the trees in the dell , or den , build up a temporary dam , and wait the coming of a flood , which , in a country of so varied surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the temporary dam is full of water , they break down the dyke , and away go the whole contents , thundering down to the Spey . On the hills to the northward of the Spey , and just opposite to Rothiemurchus , there is a good deal of timber on the banks of the Dulnan ; but in that part of the country the forest is decreasing . The timber there , however , is of good quality , though , perhaps , not altogether equal to that of Rothiemurchus . The principal rivers by which timber is floated to the sea from the remains of the Sylva Caledonice , or Great Scottish Forest , beside the Tay and Spey , as has been mentioned , and the Dee , by which the timber of Mar is floated to Aberdeen , are the Ness and the Beauly , both in Inverness-shire . The pines on the Ness are to a considerable extent exhausted ; and the trees that are now found in the remote places are , when cut , thrown into the small rivers , and float to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive ; and there are regular saw-mills about midway between the forest and the sea , at which the trees are cut into scantlings . , To the mills the trees float down the river ; and at one place they have to descend a cascade of at least forty feet in height . This they sometimes do with so much violence , that they are split to /z/ threads . In that place , too , they have recourse to an artificial dam ; but the dam is made of the trees themselves , which are left in a heap till the swelling of the river carries them away . Pines have not been found in Scotland at an elevation of more than 1500 or 2000 feet ; and at even less than that , they are very stunted , if not sheltered in the ravines . The immense Scandinavian forest , which occupies the slopes of the mountains , and banks of the rivers and arms of the sea , in all the central parts of Sweden and Norway , is one of the most considerable on the Continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fir and spruce , the former yielding red or yellow deal , and the latter white . In very many places , both on the Swedish and the Norwegian side of the mountains , these forests are not accessible ; and they are of value only when situated near the banks of a lake , an arm of the sea , or a river . Dr. Clarke gives the following account of the extent of the pine-forests on the Swedish side of the Gulph of Bothnia : " At Helsinborg , some fir trees of an astonishing length were conducted , by wheel-axes , to the water side . A separate vehicle was employed for each tree , being drawn by horses which were driven by women . These long , white , and taper shafts of deal timber , divested of their bark , afforded the first specimens of the produce of those boundless forests of which we had then formed no conception . That the reader may therefore be better prepared than we were for the tract of country we are now to survey , it may be proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he cast his eyes upon the map of Sweden , and imagine the Gulp of Bothnia to be surrounded by one contiguous unbroken forest , as ancient as the world , consisting principally of pine trees , with a /q/ few mingling birch and juniper trees , he will have a general and tolerably correct notion of the real appearance of the country . If the sovereigns of Europe were to be designated each by some title characteristic of the nature of their dominions , we might call the Swedish monarch Lord of the Woods , because , in surveying his territories , he might travel over a great part of his kingdom , from sun-rise until sun-set , and find no other subjects than the trees of his forests . The population is everywhere small , because the whole country is covered with wood ; yet , in the nonsense that has been written about the Northern hive , whose swarms spread such consternation in the second century before Christ , it has been usual to maintain that vast armies issued from this land . The only region with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a land of wood and iron , with very few inhabitants , ' and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass ; ' but , like America , it is also as to society in a state of infancy . " Except that the mountains are of less elevation , and that the climate is more moist , the eastern side of the Gulph of Bothnia does not differ much from the western , as described by Dr. Clarke . The coast of Norway is more wild than that of Sweden , and the temperature is warmer in the same latitude , so that the pine forests extend rather farther to the north . Spruce is hardly found within the Arctic circle , but Scotch fir continues for nearly a degree more , even at considerable heights ; and beyond that , straggling trees are to be met with in very sheltered places . The summit of the mountains on the north of the Gulph of Bothnia may be taken as the limit of the Scandinavian pines , as from thence to North Cape there is nothing to be met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the pines* of the Scandinavian mountains are brought to the sea , westward , for the purposes of commerce , are the Gotha in Sweden , and the Glomm in Norway . The Gotha issues from the large lake of Wener , in the centre of the southern part of Sweden ; and the lake receives many streams from the mountains , some of which are of great length , and pass through forests of the finest pines . By means of these the pine trees are easily conveyed to the lake , and thence by the Gotha to Gottenburgh . In former times , the timber was allowed to noat down the cataract of Trollhaetta , by which many of the trees were spoiled , as there is a succession of falls , and some of them as high as thirty feet . Saw-mills are now erected at Trollhsetta , and the timber is conveyed to the river farther down , by a canal . The timber of the south of Norway is brought by the Glomm to the bay of Christiana , where a great quantity is exported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the banks of the Dal , westward of the Gulph of Bothnia ; and we believe it does not vary much all over Scandinavia : " Between Meheda and Elfskarleby , about two English miles before we reached the latter place , we were gratified by a sight of some cataracts of the Dal , which we thought far superior to those of Trollh &tta.; The display of colours in the roaring torrent was exceedingly fine ; rushing with a headlong force , it fell in many directions , and made the ground tremble with its impetuosity . The height of the fall is not forty feet , but the whole river being precipitated among dark , projecting rocks , gives it a grand effect ; a swelling surf continues foaming all the way to a bridge , where another cataract , meeting the raging tide , adds greatly to its fury . Such is the commotion excited , that a white mist , rising above the fall , and over the banks of the torrent , rendered /q/ it conspicuous long before we reached the river . Close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshot wheel , so situate as to be kept in motion by a stream of water diverted from its channel for this purpose . The remarkable situation of the sawing-mills , by the different cataracts , both in Sweden and Norway , are among the most extraordinary sights a traveller meets with . The mill here was as rude and as picturesque an object as it is possible to imagine . It was built with the unplaned trunks of large fir trees , as if brought down and heaped together by the force of the river . The saws are fixed in sets , parallel to each other ; the spaces between them in each set being adapted to the intended thickness for the planks . A whole tree is thus divided into planks , by a simultaneous operation , in the same time that a single plank would be cut by one of the saws . We found that ten planks , each ten feet in length , were sawed in five minutes , one set of saws working through two feet of timber in a single minute . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cataract , rested there upon a rock , which enabled us to take a station in the midst of the roaring waters . On all sides of the cataract , close to its fall , and high above it and far below it , and in the midst of the turbulent flood , tall pines waved their shadowy branches , wet with the rising dews . Some of these trees were actually thriving upon naked rocks , from which the dashing foam of the torrent was spreading in wide sheets of spray . " In some parts of Sweden there are accidental fires , and the pines are also sometimes burned , in order to clear the soil for agriculture . In the account of his journey from Stockholm , northward , Dr. Clarke says , " As we proceeded to Hamrange , we passed through noble avenues of trees , and saw some fine lakes on either side of the road . Some of the forests had been /z/ burned , by which the land was cleared for cultivation . The burning of a forest is a very common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the north of the Gulph of Bothnia . Sometimes a considerable part of the horizon glares with a fiery redness , owing to the conflagration of a whole district , which , for many leagues in extent , has been rendered a prey to the devouring flames . The cause is frequently attributed to lightning ; but it may be otherwise explained ; and we shall have to notice some remarkable instances of these fires in the sequel . " Again , Dr. Clarke mentions that in Lapland , beyond Tornea , " some forests were on fire near the river , and had been burning for a considerable time . Mr. Tipping informed us , that these fires were owing to the carelessness of the Laplanders and boatmen on the rivers , who , using the Boletus igniarius ( German tinder ) for kindling their tobacco-pipes , suffer it to fall in an ignited state among the dry leaves and moss . They also leave large fires burning in the midst of the woods , which they have kindled to drive away the mosquitoes from their cattle and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however extensively the flames may rage , is easily explained . Yet Linnaeus , with all his knowledge of the country and customs of the inhabitants , attributed the burning of the forests in the north of Sweden to the effects of lightning . During these tremendous fires , the bears , wolves , and foxes are driven from their retreats , and make terrible depredations among the cattle . A bear , having crossed the river , about a fortnight before we arrived , had killed in one night six cows and twelve sheep , the property of a farmer . We saw their former owner , and the place where all this slaughter had been committed , having landed to walk by the side of the river , while our boatmen were engaged in forcing the rapids . The fanner attributed /q/ his loss to the burning of the opposite forest , which had compelled the bear to pass the river for food . " On the southern shores of the Baltic there are also extensive pine-forests . These are chiefly situated to the east of the Vistula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich corn valley of that river and the flax and hemp valley of the Dwina , and stretches back into the central parts of Russia . The soil upon which this forest grows is almost wholly sand , and the surface is in consequence comparatively level , nor does any of it lie at a great elevation above the sea . The river Memel is the principal channel by which this timber is conducted to the sea , and Memel is the port at which it is chiefly disposed of . Much of the timber of Memel is exported in logs that are only squared by the axe ; and masts and spars of Memel timber are much esteemed . In the haafs or low-lands on those shores of the Baltic , amber is found in greater abundance than hi any other part of the world ; and it is considered that this substance may be the turpentine of decayed pines changed by the length of time it has been buried in the earth . The northern slopes of the Alps , and the secondary mountains in the south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danube ( the principal upper branches of the latter rise in the Alps ) are well adapted for conveying the timber to the lower districts , where it is valuable . The mode of conveying the timber on the Rhine in immense rafts is very curious . The following account of these rafts is by the Author of " An Autumn near the Rhine " : " A little below Andernach , the little village of Namedy appears on the left bank , under a wooded mountain . The Rhine here forms a little bay , where the pilots are accustomed to unite together the small rafts of timber floated down the tributary rivers into the Rhine , and to construct enormous floats , which /z/ are navigated to Dortrecht ( Dort ) , and sold . These machines have the appearance of a floating village , composed of twelve or fifteen little wooden huts , on a large platform of oak and deal timber . They are frequently eight or nine hundred feet long , and sixty or seventy in breadth . The rowers and workmen sometimes amount to seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor , whose habitation is superior in size and elegance to the rest . The raft is composed of several layers of trees , placed one on the other , and tied together ; a large raft draws not less than six or seven feet of water . Several smaller ones are attached to it , by way of protection , besides a string of boats , loaded with anchors and cables , and used for the purpose of sounding the river , and going on shore . The domestic economy of an East Indiaman is hardly more complete . Poultry , pigs , and other animals , are to be found on board , and several butchers are attached to the suite . A well-supplied boiler is at work night and day in the kitchen ; the dinner hour is announced by a basket stuck on a pole , at which signal the pilot gives the word of command , and the workmen run from all quarters to receive their messes . The consumption of provisions in the voyage to Holland is almost incredible , sometimes amounting to forty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh , besides a quantity of salted , meat , and butter , vegetables , &c.,; in proportion . The expenses are so great , that a capital of three or four hundred thousand florins ( about 35,000/. ) is considered necessary to undertake a raft . Their navigation is a matter of considerable skill , owing to the abrupt windings , the rocks , and shallows of the river ; and some years ago the secret was thought to be monopolized by a boatman of Riidesheim and his son . " These rafts are not of modern invention , and are /q/ not confined to Europe . Evelyn , on the authority of Le Compte , says , that the timber-merchants of China transport immense trees or floats , upon which they build huts and little cottages , where they live with their families . The following passage from Planche 's " Descent of the Danube , " gives a description of the method of floating timber on a branch of that river ; and the practice appears to be common in Germany : " At the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the wood collects that is floated down this stream from the forests in the neighbourhood of Maria-Zell , in the Steyermark , near which it takes its rise . It is customary in Germany to place one of these gratings at the mouth of any tributary stream , or in the bed of any river where a line of demarcation is drawn naturally or artificially between two kingdoms , two provinces , or even two parishes ; so that the branches and trunks of trees blown down by high winds , and swept away by inundations into the current , should not be carried beyond the frontiers , or boundaries , of the state or property to which they belong , and which derives from them no inconsiderable portion of its revenue . " The timber , also , regularly felled by the woodcutters , is thrown thus carelessly on the mountainstreams of Germany , and floats down to the Rechen or Grate , where it is afterwards collected by its owners , who are thus saved the trouble and expense of land carriage ; and the drifting property is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to it . " In many parts even of Europe , the timber of pine forests is useless for purposes of commerce , from their inaccessible situations , and the consequent difficulty of transport . The rugged flanks and deep gorges of Mount Pilatus , in Switzerland , for instance , had been /z/ covered with impenetrable forests for many centuries ; till an enterprising individual conceived the daring idea of conveying the pines from the top of the mountain to the Lake of Lucerne , a distance of nearly nine miles , by means of an inclined plane , extending the whole distance . This extraordinary contrivance , which was completed in 1812 , became an object of wonder to all Europe , and was called the Slide of Alpnach , from the name of the Commune in which it was situated . The Slide was a trough , formed of 25,000 pine trees , six feet broad , and from three to six feet deep ; this was kept moist . Its length was 44,000 English feet . It had to be conducted in an undeviating line over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in its construction . The perseverance of the engineer , M. Rupp , overcame all obstacles ; and in eighteen months his work was finished . The trees descended from the mountain into the lake with an incredible rapidity . The larger pines , which were about one hundred feet long , ran through the space of eight miles and a third , in about six minutes . A gentleman , who saw this great work , informed us , that such was the velocity with which a tree of the largest size passed any given point , that he could only strike it once with a stick as it rushed by , however quickly he attempted to repeat the blow . The markets of the Baltic being opened by the peace , the speculation was abandoned as unprofitable ; and the Slide of Alpnach fell into ruin. * The advantages derived from planting pines in those upland and heathy parts of the country , which can scarcely be turned to any other profitable purpose , are very many . They form a shelter to the little patches of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1S20. /q/ tion . The thinnings ( for pines should be planted very close together at first ) are well adapted for fuel , for palings , and many other domestic purposes . The leaves , as they fall off , destroy the heath and other hard plants , which are succeeded by mosses and grasses , the remains of which , when ploughed into the soil , make it susceptible of bearing crops either of grain or of green vegetables ; and the timber at last , after paying all its expenses by the repeated thinnings , furnishes a better rent than could be obtained by any other means . In order to secure these advantages , it is necessary that the soil should be properly chosen ; for we have seen instances in which , during thirty years , the average increase of the trees in height has hardly been an inch , while , in situations not particularly unfavourable , it might not be much less than thirty feet . It is fortunate , however , that those places which do not agree with the common pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very instances to which we have alluded , a row of larches , planted simultaneously with the pines , are now of more feet in height than the pines are of inches . So that if the planter finds his pines will not thrive , which he can soon do by observing the turpentine exuding through the leaves and buds , and covering them like hoar frost , he ought immediately to root them out and replace them with larches . In like manner , when the larch exhibits this appearance on the leaves , and especially on the branches , it will never come to maturity . Care must be taken , however , not to mistake the pollen for this disease . The pollen appears only when the male flowers are in bloom ; it has a tinge of yellow , and it seldom adheres to the leaves , and never to the branches ; whereas the turpentine is white and efflorescent , adheres to the twigs and leaves , and can not DC shaken off without difficulty . /q/ /z/ As an evidence of the advantages resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of Culloden Muir , near to the spot where the battle was fought , in 1746 . It slopes to the north-east , and is exposed to the cold blasts of the Moray Firth . The subsoil is a deep bed of clay-and-sand gravel ; and the surface , where not planted , very barren , with not more than an inch of mould , and that of the very worst quality . A portion was inclosed and planted , about seventy years ago , by the celebrated Lord President Forbes . The successive thinnings had more than repaid the enclosing and planting ; and when the timber was cut down , about twenty years since , it yielded several times as much rent per acre , for every year it had stood , as the unplanted part of the muir let for at the time when it was cut down . Large plantations of pines have been made in England during the last thirty years ; and thus , some of our barren lands , which were formerly utterly worthless , had become valuable additions to the national wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and through this , some species of fir , which are useless except for fuel , have been raised in large quantities . On the other hand , the properties of the several species have been accurately studied by some planters ; and experiments , upon a large scale , have been made to determine the relative value of the various sorts . At Dropmore , in Buckinghamshire , a place which , thirty years ago , was a most desolate and barren heath , Lord Grenville has formed the most valuable fir plantations ; and he has established a garden of the genus pinus , in which he has collected almost every known species from all quarters of the globe . The late Bishop Heber , who was honoured with the friendship of that justly venerated nobleman , had a commission from him to search out any new species of the pines of /q/ India ; and the following extract of a letter from this amiable prelate , addressed to his Lordship , giving an account of the pines of the Himalaya mountains , will show the solicitude with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I paid to those glorious mountains , in November and December last , was unfortunately too much limited by the short time at my disposal , and by the advanced season , to admit of my penetrating far into their recesses ; nor am I so fortunate as to be able to examine their productions with the eye of a botanist . But , though the woods are very noble , and the general scenery possesses a degree of magnificence such as I had never before either seen or ( I may say ) imagined , the species of pine which I was able to distinguish were not numerous . The most common is a tall and stately , but brittle , fir , in its general character not unlike the Scottish , but with a more branching head , which , in some degree , resembles that of the Italian pine . Another , and of less frequent occurrence , is a splendid tree , with gigantic arms and dark narrow leaves , which is accounted sacred , and chiefly seen in the neighbourhood of ancient Hindqo temples , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar of Lebanon . But these I found flourishing at near nine thousand feet above the level of the sea , and where the frost was as severe at night as is usually met with at the same season in England . But between this , which was the greatest height that I climbed , and the limit of perpetual snow , there is doubtless ample space for many other species of plants , to some of which a Dropmore winter must be a season of vernal mildness . " The pines of the Himalaya mountains were found at the height of nine thousand feet above the level of the sea . The elevation at which the pine grows in /z/ tropical countries is very remarkable . Humboldt describes the third zone of the Peak of Teneriffe , the region of firs , as at nine hundred toises of absolute height ( about five thousand seven hundred and sixty feet ) ; and he says that , in the Cordilleras of New Spain , under the torrid zone , the Mexican pines reach as high as two thousand toises ( about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pinus picea , so called from two lines of white on the under side of the leaves , is a majestic tree , and grows with great rapidity . It is a native of the south of Europe and the Levant , the silver firs upon mount Olympus being the most magnificent trees in that country . Requiring a richer soil and a warmer climate than the pine and the larch , it can not be so well cultivated in bleak situations as those species . The timber which it produces is softer and less durable than that of either of them ; and , therefore , it is not so well adapted for general purposes : but its lightness renders it a very fit material for boats , and planks made of it are said to have the property of not shrinking . It has been introduced into this country as an ornamental tree , for more than a century ; but it has not been hitherto , and probably never will be , extensively cultivated for profit . Nearly allied to the Silver Fir , though inferior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grilead Fir ( Pinus balsamea. t is a native of America ; but although it has been in this country for more than a century and a half , the only place where it has grown , even to moderate dimensions , is Woburn Abbey , /z/ Larch Pinus Jarix . THE more modern botanists divide the Pine family into three genera , Pinus , Jlbies , and Cedrus , to the last of which the larch belongs . The LARCH ( Pinus larix is , after the common pine , probably the most valuable of the tribe . Though a native of the mountains of more southern regions , it thrives uncommonly well in Britain ; and as it grows more rapidly , and also in more varied soils than the other , it is , perhaps , better adapted for general cultivation . In the south , it attains an immense height ; some single beams of larch , employed in the palaces /z/ and public buildings of Venice being said to be one hundred and twenty feet long . Even in the plantations of the Duke of Athol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one hundred feet high . The wild alternation of hill and valley in that county , with the general opening of the glens and exposure of the surface to the south , seem to afford the larch a situation something like its native locality in the Tyrolese and Dalmatian Alps : for though other trees , and some of them fast growing ones , such as the spruce , have been planted at the same time , the larch overtops them all ; and in summer , when it is in the full luxuriance of its leaves , ( which are a bright clover green , ) it rises over the dark forest like an obelisk of beryl . The larch sheds its leaves , and is probably by that means saved from those keen blasts of the very early spring that prove destructive to pines . Even when naked it is an ornamental tree . The trunk is generally straight , tapering gradually to a point ; the branches , which are rather small in proportion to the tree , taper up in the form of a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , streaked with a golden colour . A few larches are said to have been introduced into this country in the early part of the seventeenth century , as rarities ; but it only began to be cultivated as a forest-tree about the middle of the eighteenth century . Since that time it has been extensively planted , more especially in Scotland ; and the success has been far greater , and far more uniform , than in the case of any other tree , not a native of the country . It appears that the quality of larch timber does not depend so much upon the maturity of the tree , and the slowness of its growth , as that of the pine , as a fishing boat , built of larch only forty years old , has been found to last three times as long as one ot the best Norway pine . It is not so buoyant , how /q/ ever , nor so elastic ; and as it does not dry so completely as pine , boards of it are more apt to warp . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what are very valuable properties , it approaches nearly to being proof , not only against water , but against fire . If the external timbers , and the principal beams of houses , were made of larch , fires would not only be less frequent , but they would be far less destructive ; for , before a larch beam be even completely charred on the surface , a beam of pine , or of dry oak , will be in a blaze beyond the ordinary means of extinguishment . Larch , however , is heavier to transport and elevate , and also much harder to work , than pine ; and as these circumstances are all against the profits of the builder , they probably prevent the introduction of this most safe and durable timber . The Venetian houses constructed of it show no symptoms of decay ; and the complete preservation of some of the finest paintings of the great masters of Italy is , in some respects , owing to the panels of larch on which they are executed . The objects for which larch timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates , palings , posts of all kinds that are inserted either in the earth or in water , wooden buildings , many agricultural implements , cottage furniture , bridges and gangways , carriages for transporting stones and all hard and rough materials , barrows for builders and road-makers , lighters , fenders , and embanking piles , lock and dock gates for canals and harbours , coal and lime waggons , vessels for carrying lime , pit-props , and hop-poles of the smaller thinnings . For all these purposes , and many minor ones , larch would come considerably cheaper than any timber now in use ; and would , in the average of them , last at least thrice as long , the saving to the public would thus be immense ; and the lands upon which an abundant /z/ supply might be raised in every county , are at present lying idle . Spruce Pinta abies- The NORWAY SPRUCE FIR ( Pinus abies " ) is probably the loftiest of the pine tribe in Europe . Though it has not reached so great an elevation in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in height . The history of it in Britain reaches back for at least a hundred years ; and as it grows very rapidly , forms excellent shelter , has a majestic appearance , and is always in leaf , it has been introduced more generally perhaps than the quality of the timber deserves . The timber is white , soft , and far from durable . The American spruces are , the Hemlock Spruce , the white , the black , and the red , the colours of the latter referring to the bark , and not to the timber , that being of the same white colour in them all . The spruce which grows in this country is seldom used but for the coarsest purposes , in consequence of its /q/ inferior qualities , and its knotty appearance from its large branches . As pillars for rustic cottages and porticoes with the knobs of the branches left , and the bark on , or barked and painted green , the small trunks , or large branches of the spruce , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but their strength is by no means equal to their weight . The lofty and perfectly straight firs of Norway have long been celebrated throughout Europe , as furnishing masts for the largest ships . Milton , in his splendid description of Satan , in the First Book of Paradise Lost , alludes to this peculiar excellence : " His spear , to equal which the tallest pine Hewn on Norwegian hill ? , to be the mast Of some great ammiral , were but a wand . " The masts of our men of war are principally brought from Riga ; but " the White Pine " ( Pinus strobus of North America is exclusively used for the masts of American shipping ; and many fine trees are exported to this country for a similar purpose , principally from the district of Maine . Before the separation of her North American colonies from England , very severe ordinances were issued to prevent the cutting down of those firs adapted for masts , which were growing on the Crown Lands . These ordinances were issued as early as 1711 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pine was extensively planted in France , Pinus laricto , which has the peculiar property of growing well in a chalky soil . It is a very magnificent tree , but the timber is not so strong as that of the Pinus sylvestris . It has , however , been used in France for ship-building . The CEDAR OF LEBANON ( Pinus cedrus ) would , if the rapidity of its growth were at all correspondent /z/ Cedar of Lebanon Pinus cedrus. with its other qualities , be the most valuable tree in the forest . Its resistance to absolute wear is not indeed equal to that of the oak ; but it is so bitter , that no insect whatever will touch it , and it seems to be proof against Time himself . We are told that the timber in the temple of Apollo at Utica was found undecayed after the lapse of two thousand years ; and that a beam hi the oratory of Diana , at Saguntum* in Spain , was fetched from Zante , two centuries before the Trojan war . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Solomon raised a levy of thirty thousand men out of all Israel ; and he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month , by courses ; and he had threescore and ten thousand that bore burthens , and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains . And he covered the temple with beams and boards of cedar . And he built chambers against it , which rested on the house , with timber of cedar . And the cedar of the house * Murveirko. /q/ within was carved with knops and flowers : all was cedar , there was no stone seen . " Thus writes the sacred historian , who mentions that the same monarch had a palace of cedar in the forest of Lebanon . Ancient writers notice that the ships of Sesostris , the Egyptian conqueror , one of them two hundred and eighty cubits long , were formed of this timber ; as was also the gigantic statue of Diana in the temple at Ephesus . Some difficulty , no doubt , exists , with regard to the ancient history of this celebrated tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , though somewhat resembling them , do not belong to the pine family at all ; as the white cedar , which is a cypress ; and the red , which is a juniper . In addition to the durability of its timber , the cedar is , in its appearance , the most majestic of trees ; and when it stands alone in a situation worthy of it , it is hardly possible to conceive a finer vegetable ornament . Its height in this country has seldom equalled the taller of the larches , though it has nearly approached to it ; but the very air of the tree impresses one with the idea of its comparative immortality . There is a firmness in the bark and a stability in the trunk , in the mode in which that lays hold of the ground , and in the form of the branches and their insertion into the trunk , not found in any other pine , scarcely in any other tree . The foliage , too , is superior to that of any other of the tribe , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves spread upwards into beautiful little tufts ; and the whole upper surface of the branch , which droops in a graceful curve toward the extremity , having the semblance of velvet . The colour is also fine ; it is a rich green , wanting the bluish tint of the pine and fir , and the lurid and gloomy one of the cypress . The description of the cedar of Lebanon by the prophet Ezekiel is fine and true : " Behold the As- /z/ Syrian was a cedar in Lebanon , with fair branches , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs . His " boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long . The fir trees were not like his boughs , nor the chesnut trees like his branches ; nor any tree in the garden of God like unto him in beauty . " Whether the cedars of Lebanon were thinned to exhaustion by the fourscore thousand axes of the King of Israel , or whether they have decayed in consequence of some variation of climate , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ; but modern travellers represent that very few now exist , though some are of immense bulk about thirty-six feet in circumference , and quite undecayed . The cedar of Lebanon , though it has been introduced into many parts of England as an ornamental tree , and has thriven well , has not yet been planted in great numbers for the sake of its timber . No doubt it is more difficult to rear , and requires a far richer soil than the pine and the larch ; but the principal objection to it has been the supposed great slowness of its growth , although that does not appear to be very much greater than in the oak . Some cedars , which have been planted in a soil well adapted to them , at Lord Carnarvon 's , at Highclere , have grown with extraordinary rapidity . Of the cedars planted in the royal garden at Chelsea , in 1683 , two had , in eighty-three years , acquired a circumference of more than twelve feet , at two feet from the ground , while their branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven-andtwenty years afterwards the trunk of the largest one had increased more than half a foot in circumference ; which is probably more than most oaks of a similar age would do during an equal period . The surface soil in which the Chelsea cedars throve so well is /z/ not by any means rich ; but they seem to have been greatly nourished from a neighbouring pond , upon the filling up of which they wasted away . Cedar of Lebanon , in the Royal Garden at Chelsea . Various specimens of the cedar of Lebanon are mentioned as having attained a very great size in England . One planted by Dr. Uvedale , in the garden of the manor-house at Enfield , about the middle of the seventeenth century , had a girth of fourteen feet in 1789 ; eight feet of the top of it had been blown down by the great hurricane in 1703 , but still it was forty feet in height . At Whitton , in Middlesex , a remarkable cedar was blown down in 1779 . It had attained the height of seventy feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter ; the trunk was sixteen feet in circumference at seven feet from the ground , and twenty-one feet at the insertion of the great branches twelve feet above the surface . There were about ten principal branches VOL. n. 6 /z/ or limbs , and their average circumference was twelve feet . About the age and planter of this immense tree its historians are not agreed , some of them referring its origin to the days of Elizabeth , and even alleging that it was planted by her own hand . Another cedar , at Hillingdon , near Uxbridge , had , at the presumed age of 1 1 6 years , arrived at the following dimensions : its height was fifty-three feet , and the spread of the branches ninety-six feet from east to west , and eighty-nine from north to south . The circumference of the trunk , close to the ground , was thirteen feet and a half ; at seven feet it was twelve and a half ; and at thirteen feet , just under the branches , it was fifteen feet eight inches . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ten feet in girth . The first , after a length of eighteen inches , divided into two arms , one eight feet and a half , and the other seven feet ten . The other branch , soon after its insertion , was parted into two , of five feet and a half each . Michaux , in his splendid work on the Forest-trees of North America , has described fourteen species of pine , which are found in the extensive woods of that vast country . The most valuable of these are , the " Longleaved Pine " ( Pinus Jlustralis , from which the turpentine and tar of America are principally produced ; the " White Pine , " much used in ship-building ; the " Hemlock Spruce " ( Mies Canadensis ) , the timber of which is not good , but which affords bark nearly as excellent for tanning as that of the oak ; and the " American Silver Fir " ( Mies balsamifera ) , from which is procured the resinous substance known as Canada balsam . The principal exportation of deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West India colonies , is of the timber of the white pine . Extensive as are /q/ the woods of the United States , this species of timber has been almost entirely consumed in the thicklypeopled districts ; so that those who are engaged in the business of cutting down the trees have to pass the greater part of their time in remote forests , where the white pine is still found . United in small bands , they penetrate into the woods in the depth of winter , having previously in the summer visited the same places to prepare a stock of hay for their oxen . They build themselves huts , roofed with bark ; and though the ground is covered five or six feet deep with snow , and the mercury in the thermometer is sometimes eighteen or twenty degrees below the freezing point , they apply themselves with the utmost courage and perseverance to felling the trees . Cutting them into logs about eighteen teet long , they convey them , in the district of Maine , by means of their oxen , which are admirably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they roll them upon the ice . Before the spring , when the frost breaks up , many thousands of these logs are thus collected . They are then carried down the current to Wenslow , about one hundred miles from the sea , at which place , the logs being previously marked , the owners are enabled to select the produce of their respective labours . The timber is here sold to the proprietors of numerous saw-mills established on the Kennebeck , between Wenslow and the coast ; and from this point comes most of the American white deal which we use in England. * A great quantity of fir timber is brought to Great Britain from our North American colony of New Brunswick . The timber trade with this thriving colony has been somewhat forced , and is now very dull . In 1824 , the exports of timber from New Brunswick to England , and the ships built at St. John 's , amounted in value to more than half a mile See Michaux , vol. i. , Art . Pinus strobus. /z/ lion sterling . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Brunswick is very curious , and is well described in a little work , entitled , " Sketches of the Maritime Colonies of British America , " by J. M'Gregor , published in 1828 . " The timber trade , which , in a commercial as well as political point of view , is of more importance in employing our ships and seamen , than it is generally considered to be , employs also a vast number of people in the British colonies , whose manner of living , owing to the nature of the business they follow , is entirely different from that of the other inhabitants of North America . " Several of these people form what is termed a ' lumbering party , ' composed of persons who are all either hired by a master lumberer , who pays them wages , and finds them in provisions , or of individuals who enter into an understanding with each other , to have a joint interest in the proceeds of their labour . The necessary supplies of provisions , clothing , &c.,; are generally obtained from the merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lumberers are to bring down the rivers the following summer . The stock deemed requisite for a ' lumbering party " 1 consists of axes , a cross cut saw , cooking utensils , a cask of rum , tobacco and pipes , a sufficient quantity of biscuit , pork , beef , and fish ; peas and pearl barley for soup , with a cask of molasses to sweeten a decoction usually made of shrubs , or of the tops of the hemlock tree , and taken as tea . Two or three yokes of oxen , with sufficient hay to feed them , are also required to haul the timber out of the woods . " When thus prepared , these people proceed up the rivers , with the provisions , &c.,; to the place fixed on for their winter establishment ; which is selected as near a stream of water , and in the midst of as much pine timber , as possible . They commence by /q/ clearing away a few of the surrounding trees , and building a camp of round logs , the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ; the roof is covered with birch bark or boards . A pit is dug under the camp to preserve any thing liable to injury from the frost . The fire is either in the middle or at one end : the smoke goes out through the roof ; hay , straw , or fir branches are spread across or along the whole length of this habitation , on which they all lie down together at night to sleep , with their feet next the fire . When the fire gets low , he who first awakes , or feels cold , springs up and throws on five or six billets ; and in this way , they manage to have a large fire all night . One person is hired as cook , whose duty it is to have breakfast ready before daylight ; at which time all the party rise , when each takes his ' morning or the indispensable dram of raw rum immediately before breakfast . This meal consists of bread , or occasionally potatoes , with boiled beef , pork , or fish , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with pease-soup in place of tea ; and the supper resembles breakfast . These men are enormous eaters , and they also drink great quantities of rum , which they scarcely ever dilute . Immediately atter breakfast , they divide into three gangs : one of which cuts down the trees , another hews them , and the third is employed with the oxen in hauling . the timber , either to one general road leading to the banks of the nearest stream , or at once to the stream itself ; fallen trees and other impediments in the way of the oxen are cut away with an axe . " The whole winter is thus spent in unremitting labour : the snow covers the ground from two to three feet from the setting in of winter until April ; and in the middle of fir forests , often till the middle of May . When the snow begins to dissolve in VOL. n. 6* /z/ April , the rivers swell , or , according to the lumberer 's phrase , the ' freshets come down . ' 1 At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water , and floated down until the river becomes sufficiently wide to make the whole into one or more rafts . The water at this period is exceedingly cold ; yet for weeks the lumberers are in it from morning till night , and it is seldom less than a month and a half , from the time that floating the timber down the streams commences , until the rafts are delivered to the merchants . No course of life can undermine the constitution more than that of a lumberer and raftsman . The winter snow and frost , although severe , are nothing to endure in comparison to the extreme coldness of the snow water of the freshets ; in which the lumberer is , day after day , wet up to the middle and often immersed from head to foot . The very vitals are thus chilled and sapped ; and the intense heat of the summer sun , a transition which almost immediately follows , must further weaken and reduce the whole frame . To stimulate the organs , in order to sustain the cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of drunkenness are the usual consequence . Their moral character , with few exceptions , is dishonest and worthless . I believe there are few people in the world on whose promises less faith can be placed than on those of a lumberer . In Canada , where they are longer bringing down their rafts , and have more idle time , their character , if possible , is of a still more shuffling and rascally description . Premature old age , and shortness of days , form the inevitable fate of a lumberer . Should he even save a little money , which is very seldom the case , and be enabled for the last few years of life to exist without incessant labour , he becomes the victim of rheumatisms and all the miseries of a broken constitution . /z/ But , notwithstanding all the toils of such a pursuit , those who once adopt the life of a lumberer seem fond of it . They are in a great measure as independent , in their own way , as the Indians . In New Brunswick , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered synonimous with a character of spendthrift , and villainous and vagabond principles . After selling and delivering up their rafts , they pass some weeks in idle indulgence ; drinking , smoking and dashing off , in a long coat , flashy waistcoat and trowsers , Wellington or Hessian boots , a handkerchief of many colours round the neck , a watch with a long tinsel chain and numberless brass seals , and an umbrella . Before winter they return again to the woods , and resume the pursuits of the preceding year . Some exceptions , however , I have known to this generally true character of lumberers . Many young men of steady habits , who went from Prince Edward 's Island , and other places , to Miramichi , for the express purpose of making money , have joined the lumbering parties for two or three years , and , after saving their earnings , returned and purchased lands , &c.,; on which they now live very comfortably . " The ' lumberers ' of New Brunswick , and those who cut down the timber of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper girth and quality with especial care . It is stated by Mr. McGregor , that not one tree in ten thousand is fit for purposes of commerce . These thinnings , therefore , of the woods of North America do not produce the destruction of timber which now forms a subject of complaint in that country of forest-trees . The indiscriminate clearings of the agricultural settlers , and the conflagrations which occasionally take place , are the causes which , in a few centuries , may render North America no longer an exporting country for timber . /z/ Sometimes the forests are injudiciously set on fire by the settlers , to save the labour of cutting and partially burning ; but by such indiscriminate conflagration , the land is not properly cleared , and a very strong and noxious plant , called the fire-weed , instantly springs up , exhausting all the fertility of the ground . Sometimes these conflagrations extend over the whole face of a country , producing the most fearful destruction of life and property . The spectacle of a burning forest , according to the accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flames leap from tree to tree , and rushing up to their tops , throw out immense volumes of fire from the thick clouds of smoke that hang over the burning mass , while the falling trees come down with the most tremendous crash . One of the most destructive of these fires took place a few years ago in New Brunswick . We extract an account of this calamity from Mr. M'Gregor 's work : " In October 1825 , upwards of a hundred miles of the country , on the north side of Miramichi river , became a scene of the most dreadful conflagration that has perhaps ever occurred in the history of the world . In Europe , we can scarcely form a conception of the fury and rapidity with which the fires rage through the American forests during a dry hot season ; at which time the underwood , decayed vegetable substances , fallen branches , bark , and withered trees are as inflammable as a total absence of moisture can render them . When these tremendous fires are once in motion , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest , the surrounding air becomes highly rarefied , and the wind naturally increases to a hurricane . It appears that the woods had been , on both sides of the north-west branch , partially on fire for some time , but not to an alarming extent , until the 7th of October , when it came on /q/ to blow furiously from the north-west , and the inhabitants on the banks of the river were suddenly alarmed by a tremendous roaring in the woods , resembling the incessant rolling of thunder ; while , at the same time , the atmosphere became thickly darkened with smoke . They had scarcely time to ascertain the cause of this phenomenon , before all the surrounding woods appeared in one vast blaze , the flames ascending more than a hundred feet above the tops of the loftiest trees , and the fire , like agulph in flames , rolling forward with inconceivable celerity . In less than an hour , Douglastown and Newcastle were enveloped in one vast blaze , and many of the wretched inhabitants , unable to escape , perished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miramichi paper , published on the llth of October , at the scene of this fearful conflagration , contains some interesting particulars , from which it appears that several hundred lives were lost in Newcastle , Douglastown , and Fredericton ; that nearly all the ' lumberers ' in the woods perished ; that in many parts of the country the cattle were all destroyed ; and that the loss of property in the towns was immense , as the fire rushed upon the inhabitants with such inconceivable rapidity , that the preservation of their lives could be their only care . Two new species of pine , of more gigantic dimensions than any that have hitherto been described in Europe or America , have been found by Mr. David Douglas , a most enterprising botanist , who was sent out by the Horticultural Society of London in 1825 , to explore the west coast of North America . He returned from that country in the autumn of 1827 , bringing with him a rich addition to the known catalogue of plants . These pines are : 1 . Pinus Douglasii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and thirty feet , and is upwards of fifty feet in circumference at the base . It has a rough corky bark , from an inch to twelve inches thick . The leaves resemble those of the spruce , and the cones are small . The timber is of good quality , and very heavy . This pine was found by Mr. Douglas on the banks of the Columbia , where it forms extensive forests , extending from the shores of the Pacific to the Stoney Mountains . 2 . Pinus Lambertiana* . This species of pine was discovered in Northern California , where it is dispersed over large tracts of country , but does not form dense forests like most of the other pines . It is a very majestic tree ; and one specimen which , in consequence of its having been blown down , Mr. Douglas was enabled to measure , was two hundred and fifteen feet in length , fifty-seven feet nine inches in circumference at three feet from the root , and seventeen feet five inches at one hundred and thirty-four feet . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured by man , though some of the growing specimens of the same pine were evidently of greater elevation . The trunk of the Lambertiana is straight , and clear of branches for about twothirds of the height . The bark is uncommonly smooth , and the whole tree has a most graceful appearance . The cones resemble those of the Weymouth pine , but are much larger , being on an average at least sixteen inches in length . The seeds are eaten roasted , or pounded into cakes . The tree bears a considerable resemblance to the spruces ; and , as is the case with them , its turpentine is of a pure amber colour , and the timber soft , white , and light . One singular property of this tree is , that /q/ when the timber is partly burned , the turpentine loses its peculiar flavour , and acquires a sweetish taste . It is used by the natives as a substitute for sugar . /z/ The principal of these are the Yew , the Cypress , the Juniper , and the Jlrbor mice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural order of Coniferce , or cone-bearing trees ; and they have the common characters of being mostly evergreens , and the wood being resinous or bitter : but there are some distinctions the pine , the cypress , the juniper , and the arbor vitse , are inonazcius or one-housed that is , have the male and female flower on the same plant ; while the juniper and the yew are dicecius or twohoused have the male flowers on one tree and the females on another . The YEW TREE ( called Taxus ) is a tree of no little celebrity , both in the military and the superstitious history of England . The common yew is a native of Europe , of North America , and of the Japanese Isles . It used to be very plentiful in England and Ireland , and probably also in Scot- /z/ land . Caesar mentions it as having been abundant , in Gaul ; and much of it is found in Ireland , imbedded in the earth . The trunk and branches grow very straight ; the bark is cast annually ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic . It is , therefore , of great use in every branch of the arts in which firm and durable timber is required ; and , before the general use of fire-arms , it was in high request for bows : so much of it was required for the latter purpose , that ships trading to Venice were obliged to bring ten bow staves along with every butt of Malmsey . The yew was also consecrated a large tree , or more , being in every churchyard ; and they were held sacred . In funeral processions the branches were carried over the dead by mourners , and thrown under the coffin in the grave . The following extract from the ancient laws of Wales will show the value that was there set upon these trees , and also how the consecrated yew of the priests had risen in value over the reputed sacred misletoe of the Druids : ' A consecrated yew , its value is a pound . ' A misletoe branch , threescore pence . ' An oak , sixscore pence . ' Principal branch of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( not consecrated ) fifteen pence . ' A sweet apple , threescore pence . ' A sour apple , thirty pence . ' A thorn tree , seven pence halfpenny . Every tree after that , fourpence . " By a statute made in the 5th year of Edward IV . every Englishman , and Irishman , dwelling with Englishmen , was directed to have a bow of his own height made of yew , wych-hazel , ash , or awburne that is , laburnum , which is still styled " awburne saugh , " or awburne willow , in many parts of Scotland . His skill in the use of the long bow was the proud /q/ distinction of the English yeoman , and it was his boast that none but an Englishman could bend that powerful weapon . It seems that there was a peculiar art in the English use of this bow ; for our archers did not employ all their muscular strength in drawing the string with the right hand , but thrust the whole weight of the body into the horns of the bow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mighty bo we ; " and the " cloth-yard shaft , " which was discharged from this engine , is often mentioned by our old poets and chroniclers . The command of Richard III . at the battle which was fatal to him , was this : " Draw , archers , draw your arrows to the head . " The bowmen were the chief reliance of the English leaders in those bloody battles which attended our unjust contests for the succession to the crown of France . Some of these scenes are graphically described by Froissart . In the account of the battle of Blanchetacque ( the passage of the Somme ) , just before the battle of Crecy , Froissart says : " The Frenchmen defended so well the passage at the issuing out of the water , that they ( the English ) had much to do . The Genoese did them great trouble with their cross-bows . On the other side , the archers of England shot so wholly together that the Frenchmen were fain to give place to the Englishmen . " * At Crecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , but they were so weary of going a foot that day , a six leagues , armed with their-cross bows , that they said to their constables , /z/ we have more need of rest . ' The words came to the Count d'Alen$on , who said , ' A man is well at ease to be charged with such a sort of rascals , to be faint and fail now at most need . ' ' : A storm then ensues , which , and its passing away , are described in Froissart 's own singular style . He then continues thus : " When the Genoese were assembled together , and began to approach , they made a great leap and cry to abash the Englishmen ; but they stood still , and stirred not for all that . Then the Genoese again the second time made another leap and a fell cry , and stepped forward a little ; and the Englishmen removed not one foot . Thirdly , again they leapt and cried , and went forth till they came within shot . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stept forth one pace , and let fly their arrows so wholly , and so thick , that it seemed snow . When the Genoese felt the arrows piercing through heads , arms , and breasts , many of them cast down their cross-bows , and did cut their strings , and returned discomfited . When the French king saw them fly away , he said , ' Slay these rascals , for they shall lett and trouble us without reason . ' Then ye should have seen the men of arms dash in among them , and killed a great number of them ; and ever still the Englishmen shot where as they saw thickest press . The sharp arrows ran into the men of arms , and into their horses ; and many fell , horse and men , in the midst of the Genoese ; and when they were down , they could not relieve again , the press was so thick that one overthrew another . " * At Poitiers " Then the battle began orance apand the battlesf of the Marshals of Fpointed to proached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of the archers . They entered a horse- * Lord Berners ' Froissart : Ed. 1812 . Vol. i. chap . ISO . i Corps de bataille. /q/ back into the way where the great hedges were on both sides , set full of archers . As soon as the men of arms entered , the archers began to shoot on both sides , and did slay and hurt horses and knights ; so that the horses , when they felt the sharp arrows , they would in no wise go forward , but drew aback , and flang and took on so fiercely that many of them fell on their masters , so that for press they could not rise again , in so much that the Marshals ' battle could never come at the prince . .... True to say , the archers did their company that day great advantage ; for they shot so thick that the Frenchman wist not on what side to take heed . " * At the battle of Aljabarota , in Portugal , fought in the early part of Richard the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the former aided by John of Gaunt , with an English force , and the latter by volunteers from France and Beam , the English archers distinguished themselves greatly : indeed they chiefly contributed to win the battle , one of the bloodiest even of that time , by the total impossibility of bringing the horses to advance , or even stand fast under the arrows . Thus Froissart describes the encounter : " The same Saturday was a fair day , and the sun was turned towards even-song . Then the first battle ( of the Spaniards ) came before Aljabarota , where the King of Portugal and his men were ready to receive them . Of these French Knights there were a two thousand spears , as fresh and well ordered men as could be devised ; and , as soon as they saw their enemies , they joined together like men of war , and approached in good order till they came within a bow-shot ; and , at their first coming , there was a hard rencounter , for such as desired to assail , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where /z/ the Englishmen by their policy had fortified them . And , because the entry was so narrow , there was great press , and great mischief to the assailants ; for such English archers as were there shot so wholly together that their arrows pierced men and horses , and when the horses were full of arrows they fell upon one another There were many of the Lords and Knights of France and Beam taken and slain , and all their companies that were entered within the strait ; their horses were so hurt with the archers that they fell on their masters , and one upon another . There these Frenchmen were in great danger , for they could not help one another , for they had no room to enlarge themselves or to fight at their will . " * It is to be observed that long after the introduction of fire-arms hi the fourteenth century , the bow continued to be a principal instrument of war . The bow was used at Agincourt and at Flodden . The use of the bow as a weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country ; but archery is still followed as an amusement ; and though some of the foreign woods have more elasticity , the best bows of native growth are certainly those made of the yew-tree . The yew has often attained a very great size in each of the three kingdoms , though the specimens now remaining in Scotland and Ireland be but few . In the first of those countries , Queen Mary 's yew at Crookstone was much celebrated , though probably more on account of the princess with whose history it was connected , than any peculiarity in its own magnitude . The trunk of a large yew , found by * Lord Berners ' Froissart : Ed. 1812 . Vol. ii . chap . 34 . It is singular that Mariana does not notice the presence of an English or French force , but states the negociation with John of Gaunt to have been subsequent to the battle . Historia de Espana , lib. xviii . cap . 9. /q/ Pennant in the churchyard of Fortingal , in Perthshire , though wasted to the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , is quoted by him as being fifty-six feet and a half in circumference , or about eighteen feet in diameter . The yew tree at Mucruss abbey , in Ireland , has a trunk about six feet and a half in circumference , and fourteen feet high , which terminates in a head that fills the area of the cloisters . In England and Wales , some very large specimens are mentioned . According to Evelyn , the Crowhurst yew was thirty feet in circumference ; that at Braburne churchyard , in Kent , was nearly twenty feet diameter , although it had been dismantled by storms ; and at Sutton , near Winchester , there was , as Evelyn quaintly says , " such another monster . " At Hedsor , in Buckinghamshire , there was lately , if there be not still , one in health and vigour , full twenty-seven feet in diameter . In the woods of Cliefden , near Hedsor , there are some extraordinary remains of these trees , whose roots , apparently of vast age , twine about the chalk rocks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the yew grows , and the strength , durability , and even beauty of its timber , one can not help regretting that , when those great trees shall have yielded , as yield they must , to the destructive power of time , there should not be a succession . It is true that , in consequence of the great improvement of the iron manufacture , and the cheapness of that article , it can be applied to many purposes for which the great strength of the yew was well adapted . The custom of clipping yews into fantastic shapes was much practised in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . Some of our churchyards still have their yew-trees thus cut into the pretended likenesses /z/ of birds and beasts . At Bedfont , in Middlesex , there are two celebrated trees , whose branches are annually shaped into something like the form of a peacock , with a date shewing when this piece of useless labour was first performed . We think it is 1708 . The Romans , as we learn from Pliny 's letters , cut their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Bacon , with his wonted good sense , protested against this practice , which was the fashion of his time . " I , for my part , " he says in his Essays , " do not like images cut out in juniper and other garden stuff ; they be for children . " Cypress Cuprums sempervircm Of the CYPRESS , of which there are twenty-two species , it will be necessary to mention only two , the Evergreen Cypress ( Cupressus semperrirens ) , and the White Cedar ( Cupressus thyoides ) . Of the first , there are two varieties , the upright and the spreading , the last growing to the larger size , and being consequently the more valuable , as a timber tree . It /q/ @#@ &; - Hf* ' is a native of the south eastern countries of Europe , of the Levant , of China , and of several other parts of Asia . It thrives best in a warm , sandy , or gravelly soil ; and though it has not been much cultivated in England as a timber tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern parts of the kingdom . It is true that , in the early stages of its growth , it has been supposed to fall a victim to the keen frosts of our climate ; yet Evelyn says , that he had upwards of a thousand cypress trees in his garden , and did not lose more than three or four of them during the uncommonly severe winters of 1663 and 1665 . Of all timber , that of the cypress is generally supposed to be the most durable , superior even to that of the cedar itself . The doors of St. Peter 's Church at Rome , which had been formed of this material in the time of Constantine , shewed no sign of decay when , after the lapse of eleven hundred years , Pope Eugenius IV . took them down to replace them by gates of brass . In order to preserve the remains of their heroes , the Athenians buried them in coffins of cypress ; and the chests or coffins in which the Egyptian mummies are found are usually of the same material . Cypress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic ; and , therefore , would answer well for musical instruments . For furniture , it would be equal even to mahogany ; for , though not so beautiful in its colour , it is stronger , resists the worm equally , and its odour repels insects from whatever may be contained in a cabinet or chest made of it . For building , there is no timber superior to the cypress , which lasts almost as long as stone itself ; accordingly , where it is found in great abundance , it is very much used for that purpose . The cypress is reputed to live to a great age ; and , though the precise period has not been ascertained , the fact of its being planted over the graves of the dead , and carried in funeral processions , as an emblem of im- /z/ White Cedar Cupres sus thyoides. mortality , is a proof that its duration must be very considerable . The White Cedar is a native of America , where it grows to a considerable size ; but it grows slowly , being eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even then , though it answers well for hoops , small boats , roofing , and some other purposes , it does not appear very worthy of cultivation as a timber tree . But it is hardy , and forms a good variety in clumps of evergreens . Of the Juniper , there are twenty-two species , of which only the Barbadoes juniper , Barbadoes cedar , the Bermuda cedar , and the Red cedar , rise to be large trees . The Barbadoes Cedar ( Juniperus Barbadensis ) grows to be a large tree , and is used for ship-building and other purposes ; but , being a native of the tropical regions , it can not be cultivated with profit as a forest tree in England . The Bermuda juniper also attains a considerable size ; its timber is more red than that of the former ; and , as it is a native of /q/ colder regions , it thrives better in England . It is very abundant in the islands after which it is named , and forms there one of the most valuable timber trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , highly offensive to insects ; it is , therefore , well adapted for furniture in warm climates . The Red Cedar ( Juniperus Virginiana ) is a native of North America , the West India islands , and Japan . In Jamaica , it grows to a very large size , and forms one of the best timber trees in the island . It is close and firm , though easily split ; the internal wood is dark red , and the odour of it is very strong , so that it answers well for the internal parts of cabinet-work , as well as for the wainscoting of rooms . The common juniper is a shrub found in most of the cold parts of Europe . It seldom ( with the exception of a variety found in Sweden ) deserves to be called a tree ; but the wood that it does produce is compact and fragrant ; and the berries , which , take two years to grow , are employed in the arts . /z/ There are very few of this numerous order of trees that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable to man . The common pine yields turpentine by incision into the living tree ; and tar is made by distilling billets of the wood in an oven . This tar , being boiled to evaporate the water , forms pitch . The goodness of the timber determines the goodness of the extract ; that of Norway being better than that of Scotland or of Canada , although , from the inferior value of the timber in the latter place , tar may be procured much cheaper . It is probable that tar and pitch may be obtained from the whole family of the pines , /z/ for they are nothing more than the turpentine mixed with a certain quantity of charcoal and empyreumatic oil and acid , formed during the process of distillation . The collection of turpentine forms an important operation in North America , and this produce of the pine is a considerable article of commerce . In the United States the business is confided principally to negroes , and each slave has the charge of from three to four thousand trees . The process lasts all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees till the middle of March , and the flow of the turpentine generally ceases about the end of October . The first operation is that called ' boxing ; ' which is to form a hole or sort of cup at the root of the tree , holding about a pint and a half . An incision is then made in the trunk ; and the liquid which flows into the box is turpentine , called in commerce pure dipping . These boxes are emptied five or six times during the season ; and it is estimated that 250 boxes will produce a barrel weighing 320 pounds . Scraping , an inferior species of turpentine , is the deposite made by the sap on the bark of the tree , as it trickles down into the box . This is collected in the autumn . The British imports of turpentine amounted , in 1827 , to 12,000 tons . In the United States tar is manufactured from the dead wood of the Pinus Jlmtralis . The tar of the north of Europe is , as we have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commerce , in Norway , is thus described by Dr. Clark : " The inlets of the Gulph ( of Bothnia ) every where appeared of the grandest character ; surrounded by noble forests , whose tall trees , flourishing luxuriantly , covered the soil quite down to the water 's edge . From the most southern parts of Westro-Bothnia , to the northern extremity of the gulph , the inhabitants are occupied in the manufacture /q/ of tar ; proofs of which are visible in the whole extent of the coast . The process by which the tar is obtained is very simple : and as we often witnessed it , we shall now describe it , from a tar-work which we halted to inspect upon the spot . The situation most favourable for this process is in a forest near to a marsh or bog ; because the roots of the fir , from which tar is principally extracted , are always the most productive in such places . A conical cavity is then made in the ground ( generally in the side of a bank or sloping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with logs or billets of the same , being neatly trussed into a stack of the same conical shape , are let into this cavity . The whole is then covered with turf , to prevent the volatile parts from being dissipated , which , by means of a heavy wooden mallet , and a wooden stamper , worked separately by two men , is beaten down and rendered as firm as possible above the wood . The stack of billets is then kindled , and a slow combustion of the fir takes place , without flame , as in making charcoal . During this combustion , the tar exudes ; and a cast-iron pan being at the bottom of the funnel , with a spout , which projects through the side of the bank , barrels are placed beneath this spout , to collect the fluid as it comes away . As fast as the barrels are filled , they are bunged and ready for immediate exportation . From this description , it will be evident that the mode of obtaining tar is by a kind of distillation per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sap and juices of the fir , while the wood itself , becoming charred , is converted into charcoal . The most curious part of the story is , that this simple method of extracting tar is precisely that which is described by Theophrastus and Dioscorides ; and there is not the smallest difference between a tar-work in the forests of Westro-Bothnia , and those of ancient Greece . The Greeks made stacks /z/ of pine ; and , having covered them with turf , they were suffered to burn in the same smothered manner ; while the tar , melting , fell to the bottom of the stack , and ran out by a small channel cut for the purpose . " From the larch is obtained what is called Venice turpentine : it is procured by incision into the tree ; and from it the transparent oil of turpentine is distilled . The larch yields a gum and a manna ; and a species of fungus that grows upon it in Siberia has a rind which the natives make use of in dyeing red ; while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The common , or Strasburgh turpentine is obtained chiefly from the silver fir ; Burgundy pitch from the spruce ; and Canada balsam , the purest of all the pine turpentines , from the balm of Gilead fir . Turpentine of highly aromatic flavour , called in commerce Chian turpentine , is also derived from the turpentine-tree , ( Pistacia terebinthus , ) a native of Barbary and the south of Europe , which is a tree belonging to another family , and quite different in appearance from the pines . Turpentine , from what species soever of the pine it is derived , can be dissolved in rectified spirit or pure alcohol ; and , by distillation , they all give similar oils , which , from their being distilled , ( and not from any resemblance to alcohol , or spirits properly so called , ) are vulgalarly termed spirits of turpentine . If the distillation be performed with water , the product is an essential oil , the common spirit of turpentine ; and , if the distillation be carried on in a retort , without water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were , and is called the etherial spirit of turpentine . The residuum that is left , in both cases , is a brownish resinous mass , brittle , capable of being melted , highly inflammable , insoluble in water , but mixing freely with oils : it is the common rosin of commerce . Beside producing these resins and oils , there are /q/ some further uses of parts of the pine species . The bark of the larch tree contains a considerable portion of the astringent bitter called tannin , which , by being mixed with the mucilaginous , or gluey part of the skins of animals , changes that into a substance not soluble in water ; and thus it is useful in the operation of tanning , or converting the raw hides of animals into leather . Portions also are edible : the young shoots of the common fir , stripped of the leaves when these just begin to appear , are sought for with avidity , in some places , by the children of the peasants , and there is no doubt that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wholesome salad in the spring . In young and vigorous trees , too , the liber , or part of the bark nearest the wood , is pleasant in the early part of the year ; and the milky juice upon it , which is the new layer of wood in an incipient state , is very sweet , and without any of the pungent bitterness of turpentine . The inner bark of the spruce has these qualities , though in an inferior degree ; but the young shoots of it are bitter , astringent , and disagreeable . The inhabitants of the cold and uncomfortable regions of Lapland contrive to convert the inner bark into a kind of bread : for this purpose , they dry it at the fire till it becomes brittle ; next they grind it ; then they macerate it in water ; and , after this , they knead it into thin cakes , which they bake in the usual manner . These cakes are , however , more insipid than the recent bark , probably because the sugar , or manna , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed by the maceration , in addition to the pungent taste of the turpentine , to get rid of which is the object of that operation . Ropes made of this bark are pretty generally used among the fishermen of the north , and they have considerable strength , as well as elasticity . From the different VOL. n. 8 /z/ species of the spruce an extract is taken , which is used in flavouring a very wholesome beer . No useful extract is , so far as we know , taken from the yew , the cypress , or the arbor vitae . The first of these is usually reckoned a poisonous tree , destructive to some animals , though not to others . From the junipers are derived very powerful ingredients . The spirit ( essential oil ) of the common juniper is employed in medicine ; and also in giving to ardent spirits that peculiar flavour which distinguishes the Geneva , or gin of Holland . The Dutch are understood to distil the juniper berries along with the other ingredients , by which means the more caustic particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less deleterious ; while the British distillers not only use the oil of juniper in its most caustic state , but often substitute for it the more pernicious oil of turpentine , on account of its greater cheapness . The quantity of juniper berries annually imported into the United Kingdom is about 800 tons . Old junipers exude a resin called Guin Sandrach , which , under the name of pounce , is employed to prevent the ink from spreading upon parchment and improperly-sized writing paper . A decoction of the berries of the common juniper yields a considerable quantity of sugar . From one species , Lycian Cedar ( Juniperus Lycia ) a native of France , the Levant , and Siberia , ( a shrub of considerable size , ) there is obtained the resin called Olibanum , which was much used by the ancients , and is still used by the Roman Catholics in their incense offerings . It has a bitter taste , and a strong smell ; and , when it is burned , the fumes of it diffuse very considerable fragrance . /z/ THESE are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firmness and durability of its timber when exposed to the air ; and the second for the many purposes to which it is applied , and its durability in water . The Chesnut tree ( Fagus castanea ) is generally understood to be a native of Asia , in many parts of which it is to be found in situations where it is not very likely to have been planted . Tradition says that it was brought from Asia Minor , and that it soon spread all over the warmer parts of Europe . At present , it is very abundant , as a native tree , in the mountainous parts of the south of Europe ; and it is also found in North America , from New York to Carolina . The Castagno del cento cavalli , or criesnut of the hundred horses , upon Mount Etna , is probably the largest tree in Europe , being more than two hundred feet in circumference . Brydone , a traveller who wrote about fifty years ago , has given a particular description of this celebrated tree : " From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great chesnut trees , through forests growing out of the lava , in several places almost impassable . Of these trees there are many of an enormous size , but the Castagno dei cento cavalli is by much the most celebrated . I have even found it marked in an old map of Sicily j published near an hundred years ago ; and in all the maps of Etna and its en- /z/ virons , it makes a very conspicuous figure . I own I was by no means struck with its appearance , as it does not seem to be one tree , but a bush of five large Chesnut Fagus castanea. trees growing together . We complained to our guides of the imposition ; when they unanimously assured us , that by the universal tradition , and even testimony /q/ of the country , all these were once united in one stem ; that their grandfathers once remembered this , when it was looked upon as the glory of the forest , and visited from all quarters ; that for many years past , it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine it with more attention , and found that there is an appearance that these five trees were really once united in one . The opening in the middle is at present prodigious ; and it does , indeed , require faith to believe that so vast a space was once occupied by solid timber . But there is no appearance of bark on the inside of any of the stumps , nor on the sides that are opposite to one another . Mr. Glover and I measured it separately , and brought it exactly to the same size , viz. two hundred and four feet round . If this was once united in one solid stem , it must with justice , indeed , have been looked upon as a very wonderful phenomenon in the vegetable world , and deservedly styled the glory of the forest . I have since been told by the Canonico Recupero , an ingenious ecclesiastic of this place , that he was at the expense of carrying up peasants with tools to dig round the Castagno dei cento cavalli and he assures me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united below ground in one root . I alleged that so extraordinary an object must have been celebrated by many of their writers ; he told me that it had , and produced several examples . " In most parts of Britain the chesnut thrives well , there being authenticated anecdotes of many very large ones , in various parts of England and Ireland . Nor is it confined to the southern parts of the islands , for there is one in the garden at Castle Leod , in Rossshire , which measures at least fifteen feet in circumference , and which , only a few years ago , shewed no signs of decay . Nor is it by any means a slow-growing tree ; for in Kensington Gardens , and other places , /z/ where it has been planted along with elms and other trees of very inferior timber , it equals them both in height and diameter . If the symptoms of decay that are apparent in some of those trees , of which the age is known not much to exceed a hundred years , are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not of its being hi a situation indifferently adapted for it , we should be led to question the great antiquity which has been assigned to some of the chesnut trees in England . The lives of trees must , however , like those of animals , vary with the situations in which they are placed ; and the immense - size of the celebrated chesnuts must lead us to assign to them a much longer duration than belongs to some others of the same species . Though none of the English chesnuts rival the great one on Mount Etna , yet this country possesses immense trees . That at Hitchin Priory , hi Hertfordshire , had , in 1789 , a circumference of more than fourteen yards at five feet from the ground , and though the internal part was decayed and hollowed by time , the external part and the leaves were vigorous . Grose found one of four chesnuts in the garden at Great Cranford Park , Dorset , thirty-seven feet in circumference ; and though shattered and decayed , it still bore good crops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hollow of which was " a pretty wainscoted room , enlightened with windows , and furnished with seats ; " and the great chesnut at Tortworth , in the same county , had dimensions , and a reputed age , belonging to no other English tree . In 1720 , it measured fifty-one feet at six feet from the ground ; but Lysons , by a later mensuration , 1791 , made it only forty-five feet three inches . It bore fruit abundantly in 1788 ; and tradition carries its origin back to the days of the Saxon Egbert. /q/ The chesnut tree is very ornamental when growing ; and it makes excellent timber In extreme age , too , its timber is not so valuable as when of a moderate size . One advantage of chesnut is , that there is very little sap-wood ; and thus , in the growing state , it contains much more timber of a durable quality than an oak of the same dimensions . In the Transactions of the Society of Arts for 1789 , there is an account of the comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Posts of chesnut , and others of oak , had been put down at Wellington , in Somersetshire , previous to 1745 . About 1763 , when they had to undergo repair , the oak posts were found to be unserviceable , but the chesnut were very little worn . Accordingly , the oak ones were re- ? laced by new , and the chesnut allowed to remain , n twenty-five years , ( 1788 ) the chesnut posts which had stood about twice as long as the oak , were found in much better condition than tnose . In 1772 , a fence was made , partly of oak posts and rails , and partly of chesnut . The trees made use of were of the same age , and they were what may be termed young trees . In nineteen years , the oak posts had so decayed at the surface as to need to be , strengthened by spurs , while the chesnut ones required no such support . A gate-post of chesnut , on which the gate had swung fifty-two years , was found quite sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chesnut in 1743 , was found sound in every part in 1792 . It should seem , therefore , that young chesnut is superior to young oak , for all manner of wood work that has to be partly in the ground . We have not heard of any case in which it has been tried against larch . Chesnut trees of full growth were more abundant in England than they are now ; the timber was used /z/ indiscriminately with oak , in the construction of houses , in mill-work , and in household furniture . Many plantations of it have been formed since the proprietors of land began to turn their wastes to profit , in the production of trees . It makes also excellent underwood , and is quick growing . The fruit of the chesnut in England is inferior to the produce of the . trees of the south of France , and of Spain . In some provinces of France , and in Corsica , this fruit constitutes the principal food of the poorer people . The inhabitants of Limousin , a province of France covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a peculiar manner , which deprives them of all their astringent and bitter properties , and , thus prepared , they make them into bread . The chesnut is the tree with which Salvator Rosa delighted to adorn his bold and rugged landscapes . It flourished in ffte mountains of Calabria , which furnished the scenes of many of this great artist 's pictures . It grows not unlike the ash , except that its branches are more straggling . The Beech ( Fagus sylvatica is more generally diffused , and more abundant in Britain than the chesnut . Like the chesnut , it thrives best in rich soils and sheltered situations ; and , when planted in places that agree well with it , it is a beautiful as well as a valuable tree . The close texture of the beech renders it a very fit timber for machinery , for the stocks and handles of tools , and for many other purposes . It is not proof against the worm , however ; and when exposed to alternate drought and moisture it soon decays . Against a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grained timbers , and that , with the comparative shortness of its duration , makes it but little used in building . Although easily /z/ Beech Fagus sylvatica . turned , it is not well adapted for bowls and hollow vessels , as it is apt to split when suddenly dried after being wet . It has been doubted whether the beech be a native of Britain . If it be the fagus of the Romans , this is not probable . Cfesar , who was an acute observer , mentions that he did not find it in the country ; and as he was in the warmest and richest parts of it , he was exactly in those in which the beech was the most likely to be found . It is possible , however , that the fagus of the Romans , which obviously got its name from the edible quality of its fruit , may have been either the Italian oak or the chesnut ; or the phegos of the Greeks may have been the former , and that of the Romans the latter . Whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its introduction has been prior to the . commencement of the written or traditionary history of British trees . When sheltered , the beech grows to a great height , /z/ and as it lasts long when kept constantly wet , it is well adapted for the sills and floors of locks , for the keels of vessels , and for the planking in the parts constantly kept under water . The small timber of it makes excellent charcoal ; the mast or fruit is eaten by hogs ; and the poor in Silesia extract from it an oil , which they use as a substitute for butter . The nut is sometimes burnt , for the purpose of making an infusion , which somewhat resembles coffee . Virgil chose the beech for its shade , for no tree forms so complete a roof . But its bushy head is any thing but beautiful ; and its branches have neither the firmness of the oak , nor the elegance of the ash . The hue of the bark is of an agreeable olive ; and its trunk , often studded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are particularly beautiful . /z/ Of this tree there are about fifteen species . The Common Elm ( Ulmus campestris is generally understood to ' be indigenous in the south part of the island ; and , at any rate , it must have been in England in the time of the Saxons , as many compound names of places , of which the word " elm " forms a part , are to be met with in " Domesday Book , " the drawing up of which was finished in 1086 . Elm is a tough and strong timber ; but it is coarse and open in the grain , more especially when it has grown upon very rich land . That which grows in the more fertile parts of England is far inferior to the produce of the midland counties of Scotland ; the latter being much closer in the grain , harder , more handsome , and taking a finer polish . Of the one , chairs and other articles of furniture are made , while the other is seldom used but for coarse purposes casks , coffins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the /z/ Elm Ulmus campestris . Mountain Elm ( Ulmus montana ) , called wych-hazel , or wych-elm in some parts of England , and corrupted to " witch elm . " The timber of this is sometimes described as being inferior to that of the elm of the plains in closeness and strength ; but the ancient statute enjoining the use of bows , in which the wych-hazel is mentioned , and the elm not , is against that hypothesis . The elm attains a large size , and lives to a great age . Mention is made of one planted by Henry IV . of France , which was standing at the Luxembourg at the commencement of the French Revolution . One at the upper end of Church-lane , Chelsea , ( said to have been planted by Queen Elizabeth , ) was felled in 1745 . It was thirteen feet in circumference at the bottom , and one hundred and ten feet high . Piffes ' elm , near the Boddington Oak , in the vale of Gloucester , was , in 1783 , about eighty feet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen feet . From the planting of Sir Francis Bacon 's elms , in Gray 's Inn walks , in 1600 , and their decay about 1720 , one would be disposed to assign the /z/ healthy period of the elm to about one hundred and twenty years . The health of these must have been , however , affected in some degree by the smoke of London . The superb avenue called " The Long Walk " at Windsor , was planted at the beginning of the last century . Most of the trees have evidently passed their prime . The most profitable age of elms , both for quantity and quality of timber , is , probably about fifty or sixty years . The central parts of a tree get indurated , lose their natural sap , and are apt to absorb moisture , by which they soon rot on exposure to the air , long before the dry rot consumes them , shielded as they are by the external parts . The predominance of resin insoluble in water , and not liable to be acted on by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine and the larch are more durable than the silver fir and the spruce . It is possible that the elm is injured by too much humidity in the soil upon which it grows ; and that the Dutch elm , which is usually classed as a different species from the common elm , and of which the timber is good for nothing , may be merely the common one debased in the humid soil of Holland . The elm rises to a greater height than the generality of English forest trees , with a foliage at once full and hanging loosely , and thus capable of receiving great masses of light , and of producing " the chequered shade , " which imparts such a sparkling beauty to woodland scenes . It is the first tree which salutes the spring with its light and cheerful green ; and sometimes very early in the season the branches are dark with innumerable small purple flowers , often as full as the subsequent leafy foliage . At this time ( April ) , the common elms in Hyde-park present this singular and beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual . /q/ The elm has been always considered as one of the trees which can be most safely transplanted after attaining considerable size . Evelyn gives several accounts of trees of this species being thus removed into other soils . Upon this subject we may properly enter into some detail , as the public attention has been recently much fixed on a practical plan for the transplantation of large trees . Though timber trees be among the most delightful ornaments with which any country can be graced , they are ornaments which , generally speaking , a man can not procure for himself . If they be raised from seed , or planted as saplings , the grandson of the planter is probably the first that can enjoy their beauty , and walk under their shade . Hence a method of transplanting full-grown timber is a very desirable art . Nor is it desirable only for merely ornamental purposes , for the shelter which trees afford to the soil is one of the surest means of increasing the warmth and fertility of a country ; and many districts have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by plantations of timber . This is particularly the case where the wind blows over those cold surfaces of heath and morass , which occur in the northern parts of the island of Great Britain . The subject has not been investigated with that attention which its importance merits , but appearances render it highly probable that the spawn of mosses and lichens are wafted by the winds ; and that if these winds are not purified from the pestilent spawn , they spread a noxious vegetable growth over what would otherwise be fertile land . In many places we have seen belts of plantations act as a sort of filter for the winds . The trees next to a marshy heath have been covered with lichens , so that no part of the bark was visible ; while in the interior of the belt , and on the side most distant from the barren /q/ /z/ track , the bark has been free from these parasites . Further , after the trees have attained sufficient size to shelter the land , the moss has disappeared from it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops . Nor is it on trees alone that this effect of winds , from cold and watery tracks , may be perceived ; for those sides of ancient and elevated buildings which are opposed to them , are incrusted with moss and lichen , while the other sides are comparatively clean . To any one who has paid much attention to the more sterile districts of the country , it is matter of every-day notice , that nothing tends so much to confine within bounds the plants which are hostile to the grasses and cultivated crops , as timber ; and this being the case , it follows that the means of procuring an instantaneous shelter of grown timber are , at the same time , the surest means of procuring , comparatively , instantaneous fertility . In very many instances that we have seen , the land , when not sheltered by timber , has returned to its original sterility , whenever it has been allowed to lie in grass ; but when so sheltered , the pastures have retained their greenness for years , and , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years out of tillage . The transplantation of grown timber-trees appears , indeed , to be the only way , by which shelter can be restored to cold , bleak , and exposed districts . The remains of large trees , which are found in the mosses and bogs of such districts , prove that once both the soil and climate have been adapted to the production of wood . This is true not only of those countries where timber is still to be found in warm and sheltered places , but in those dreary climes where now hardly a shrub is to be found , and where , although young timber be planted , it will not grow , as in the /q/ counties of Sutherland and Caithness , the Orkney and Shetland Isles , and even in Iceland itself . The latitude has not altered since the trees which are found in the peat-bogs of those regions were green and flourishing upon the surface ; and if the soil and the climate have been deteriorated , it must have been by exposure to the damp and bleaching winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal to young trees ; but it is probable that , if grown timber , of the more hardy sorts , could be introduced as a shelter , the land would recover its former fertility , and the landscape its ancient beauty . The observations of philosophical travellers and inquirers , with regard to the whole of the northern countries of the world , whether in the eastern continent or the western , confirm these remarks . Sir Hans Sloane , in his account of the bogs of Ireland , mentions that a great part of those districts which are now covered by that unprofitable substance , must have been once clothed with forests of trees . Broke , in his " Winter in Lapland and Sweden , " notices the same change as having taken place in the north of Lapland and the islands . Sir George Mackenzie and others observe the same as being the case in Iceland ; and Hearne mentions that large tracts of the northern parts of America , which at his visit were covered with moss and swamp , were forests in the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the Highlands and western islands of Scotland , where there is now hardly a tree , or , at most , only coppice , along the shores of the lochs , ( arms of the sea , ) there are found not only the trunks and roots of trees in the soil of the bogs , but the roots of oaks of large dimensions standing on the surface ; nor can the period at which they were growing have been very remote , for , in some of the wild and almost inaccessible glens ( especially in the /z/ district of Morven , ) we have met with very large trunks , lying mouldering and neglected . Indeed , all the evidence that we have been able to collect tends to prove , that the general climate of the north has been deteriorated by the destruction of timber , whether that destruction has been produced by natural or by artificial means ; and though farming may do much , it must carry on an extensive warfare against the bleak and blasting wind from the bogs and heaths , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carries , by passing through forests of trees . The transplanting of grown timber is by no means a modern art . Theophrastus , the Greek writer upon rural economy , mentions that the Greeks not only replanted the plane tree when uprooted by the winds , but were in the habit of removing other large trees . The Romans , too , according to Pliny , transplanted , when they were twenty feet high , the elms which they used in their vineyards , as poles upon which to train their vines . These were planted in regular rows , nine feet asunder . Seneca the younger mentions , that an entire orchard of full-grown trees was removed from one place to another , near the villa of Scipio Africanus , and that after a season or two they flourished and bore fruit as well as ever . It appears , however , that in the ancient method of transplanting grown trees , whether by the Greeks or the Romans , it was the practice to cut off all the spray and smaller branches , and even the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , from the way in which they cut both the top and the roots , it is evident that though the trunks of the trees were old , the whole of the vegetation was new . During the middle ages , this art was neglected , along with most of the other arts ; but it was revived in modern times . Among the early instances of it , one /q/ of the most remarkable is that mentioned by Gasper Barkeus , as having been affected by Count Maurice of Nassau , when he was governor of Brazil , in 1636 . Like most Dutch colonists ( for Brazil was then a . Dutch colony ) , Count Maurice fixed his abode on the shore , or rather upon an island , at the confluence of two rivers . The place was naturally as naked as Holland itself , but the taste and spirit of the Count soon erected a palace , and surrounded it by a garden of the most extensive and luxuriant character . Pineapples , citrons , and oranges were quickly found in abundance , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in height , were transplanted . These trees were seventy or eighty years old , and they had to be carried four miles , partly on wheel-carriages by land , and partly on rafts by water ; but skill and perseverance overcame every difficulty , and this magnificent artificial forest flourished , and bore abundance of fruit the very first season . That , however , was to be expected ; for if a large fruit-tree which is transplanted lives , it always at least forms fruit the first year , although it may not bear again for several years after . About the middle of the seventeenth century , there were some operations of a similar kind in Europe . The Elector Palatine removed some large lime-trees from the forest of Heidelberg to a slope in sight of his palace . These were removed at midsummer , when in the full strength of vegetation , and the heads of them all were cut down ; but there are , probably , few trees , except the lime , that could bear to be so treated . About the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , as Evelyn says , " huge oaks , " at the Chateau de Fiat ; and , on the same authority , we are told that " a great person in Devon planted oaks as big as twelve oxen could draw , to supply some defects in an avenue to his house ; " and /z/ Lord Fitzharding " likewise practised the removing of great oaks , by a particular address , extremely ingenious , and worthy of communication . " * The most extensive of the continental transplanters was Louis XIV. , who removed an entire forest , the Bois de Boulogne , from Versailles to its present site , a distance of more than seven miles . But these were efforts of power rather than of science , for the trees were much torn and mutilated by the operation . The great transplanting machine which was made use of in these extraordinary experiments remained at Versailles till , probably , about the time of the French revolution . Le Notre was the artist employed in those operations the same who laid out the gardens of Versailles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Nor were the undertakings of Louis , in the removing of timber , confined to the vicinity of the French capital ; for many of them were performed in the provinces ; and of these one of the most remarkable was effected at Mont-Louis , a small chateau near the foot of the Pyrenees , where , in the course of a few weeks , a scene previously naked was clothed with forests and groves of great magnificence . Evelyn informs us that the example of the French was soon followed in this country ; and that he himself had " frequently removed elms as big as his waist . " He describes the elm as bearing removal better than any other species ; but the instance of the lime-trees moved by the Elector Palatine shows how well that tree can bear transplantation , even in the most dangerous season . The methods at first used for the transporting of trees , if not very scientific , were extremely ingenious . The object was to raise them with a large ball of earth , and move them along in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter , i. 102. /q/ Sometimes they called in the aid of frost , by cutting a trench and removing the earth round the tree before the autumnal rains . When the frost set in , the bulb was consolidated , and could be cut out in one mass , along with the tree . But in the case of large trees , the weight of these bulbs was very great ; and they could be raised only by powerful cranes , which were also necessary to move the tree to and from the platform on which it was transported . The platform was made low , and with small wheels , which further augmented the force necessary for its removal ; and thus the transportation of even a moderate tree for a short distance , required a great deal of animal power . Many trees were , however , moved about Blenheim , and some of the other seats of the nobility . About sixty years after the time of Evelyn , the " transplanting machine " was invented by Brown , the celebrated landscape-gardener , and the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two very high wheels , an axle , and a pole ; and when the trees were large , a truck- wheel was used at the end of the pole . The tree was considerably lopped , the earth loosened from the roots , the pole set erect and lashed to the stem ; and then a purchase being made fast to the upper part of the pole , the whole was pulled at once , and drawn horizontally along . Still , though this machine , and the mode of using it , were great improvements upon the methods recommended by Evelyn , yet the trees were subjected to much mutilation ; and they did not recover their beauty and vigour till some time had elapsed . In the year 1816 , a much improved mode of transplanting grown timber was introduced by Sir Henry Stuart , of Allanton . By the practice of that mode , he , in the course of five years , and at an expense remarkably moderate , converted his park , from a cold /z/ and naked field , to a rich scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so complete , that his example has been followed by many other proprietors in the uplands or central part of the south of Scotland . Generally speaking , that part of the island is remarkably destitute of timber ; and as the country is pastured by sheep , which require fences more elevated and also more close than cattle , the rearing of wood , in the common way of planting , is very expensive . The nakedness of that part of Scotland is severely felt in the violence of the winds , which are certainly more tempestuous , and attended by more intense cold , than in some places of the country much further to the north , the snows never falling to the same depth , or being accompanied by the same violence on the Grampians in Perthshire , as upon the naked mountains in the counties of Selkirk and Peebles . In this part of the country , therefore , the invention by Sir Henry Stuart is of the utmost value . Nor is its value confined to those districts in which wood is wanted ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as respects beauty , but as regards usefulness ; and by Sir Henry 's plan growing timber may be moved , at no very great expense , from one place to another , and that without almost the least interruption of its growth . According to this method , there is no mutilation of the tree , not a branch is lopped off ; and at the time of the removal , not a root is broken : the trees are prepared before they are begun to be removed . This preparation consists in cutting all the roots at some distance from the tree . It is well known that such an operation , instead of being hurtful to trees , is often of advantage . When the long lateral roots are cut , the stumps , if they have not been rendered too short , put out a number of young fibres , which appear to draw and convey the nourishment with /z/ more effect than those fibres that are connected with the more extended roots . The most handsome and thriving trees are selected , as those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lateral roots being divided , as has been stated , the stumps are covered with fresh mould , in which they are left for two or three years , in order that they may put out new fibres for the absorption of nourishment . This preparation of the tree actually improves it ; as the fibres have to fetch the nourishment from a shorter distance . The tree , being thus prepared , can be moved not only without mutilating the top , but also without tearing up the root ; and thus the transplanting , if performed with skill , becomes a healthful rather than a dangerous operation . The pits for the reception of the trees are , in the mean time , got ready ; and for trees of about thirty feet in height ( the diameter of the trunk of such a tree may average about a foot ) , the diameter of these pits is about eighteen feet . The earth of the pits is trenched to the depth of about two feet , and in the course of the trenching , it is well mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the soil ; and the ground thus prepared is the better if it lie for a year or more , in order that the component parts of the soil may be properly mixed and mellowed . When that has been done , the planting is accomplished , by removing the earth to a proper depth , placing the tree in the pit thus made for it , adjusting the roots as nearly as possible to their natural order , and then covering them with earth . This being properly accomplished , the firmness which the trees have is much greater than would at first sight be suspected . Though the trees hi Allanton park are a good deal exposed to the violence of the winds , yet they do not require to be much propped . The expense of this system of transplantation is /z/ comparatively trifling ; and if there be a supply of trees at not too great a distance , there is no question that a park may be ornamented , or land sheltered , by this means , much more cheaply than by any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . After the ground has been prepared , the whole expense of removing and replanting the trees is not more than from ten to thirteen shillings each , for trees of from twenty-five to thirty feet in height ; about half that sum for smaller ones ; and not above two shillings or eighteen pence for shrubs or brushwood . The following is Sir Henry 's account of his park , extracted from his " Planter 's Guide " : " There was in this park originally no water , and scarcely a tree or a bush on the banks and promontories of the present lake and river , for the water partakes of both these characters . During the summer of 1820 the water was executed ; and in that and the following year , the grounds immediately adjoining were abundantly covered with wood , by means of the transplanting machine . Groups and single trees , grove and underwood , were introduced , in every style of disposition , which the subject seemed to admit . Where the turf recedes from , or approaches the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking features of any sort ; yet the profusion of wood , scattered over a surface of moderate limits , in every form and variety , gave it an intricacy and an expression which it had never possessed before . " By the autumn of the third year only after the execution , namely 1823 , when the Committee of the Highland Society honoured the place with their inspection , the different parts seemed to harmonize with one another , and the intended effects were nearly produced . What it was wished to bring forward appeared already prominent what was to be concealed , or /q/ thrown into the back-ground , began to assume that station . The fore-ground trees , the best that could be procured , placed on the eastern bank , above the water , broke it into parts with their spreading branches , and formed combinations which were extremely pleasing . The copse or underwood , which covers an island in the lake , and two promontories , as also an adjoining bank that terminates the distance , was seen coining down nearly to the water 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both trees and underwood had obtained a full and deepcoloured leaf , and health and vigour were restored to them . In a word , the whole appeared like a spot at least forty years planted . " /z/ There are about forty species of the Ash : the Common Jlsh ( Fraxinus excelsior ) is one of the most valuable of trees . It has been known from the remotest period of history , and it is very generally diffused . The Ash agrees with a greater variety of soil and situation than , perhaps , any other tree producing timber of equal value ; and , differing from many other trees , its value is increased rather than diminished by the rapidity of its growth . On very poor soils , where it grows stunted , it is brittle , and soon affected by the rot ; but , where the growth has been vigorous , the compact part of the several layers bears a greater proportion to the spongy , and the timber is very tough , elastic , and durable . In elasticity it is far superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be broken by a cross strain ; but it is much more fibrous , and more easily split . The ash is , by way of eminence , called " the Husbandman 's tree , " nothing being equal to it for agricultural implements , and for all sorts of poles , ladders , long handles , and /z/ other purposes which require strength and elasticity combined with comparative lightness . At all ages the growth of the ash is of value : the thinnings of young plantations , and the suckers that spring up from the roots of grown trees , or from the stools of trees that have been cut down , are excellent for hoops , hop-poles , and every other purpose where clean , light , and strong rods are wanted at small expense . The leaves and even the twigs are eaten by cattle with great avidity ; the bark is useful in tanning ; and the wood yields , when burnt , a considerable quantity of potash . The drip of the ash is injurious to most other plants , and , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round it is unproductive ; but , in marshy situations , the roots of it , which run a long way at a considerable depth , act as underdrains . Hence the proverb , in some parts of the country , " May your foot-fall be by the root of an ash " may you get a firm footing . Some idea of the change of times and opinions may be formed from the value set upon the ash , in the extract given from the laws of Howel Dda , in the preceding notice of the yew-tree , wherein , while a branch of misletoe is reckoned at thirty shillings , an ash , not being named , must be classed with " trees after a thorn , " and therefore be rated at fourpence ! In the useful arts , one good ash is worth all the misletoe that ever grew , or ever will grow . It is true that , since the Druids were succeeded by a more rational priesthood , and the misletoe was changed from sacred to profane use , it has been used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doubted whether any one was ever engaged in using that article whose time could not have been better employed . Such was the veneration of some of the ancients for the ash , that /z/ Fraxima excelsior . Hesiod derives his brazen men from it ; and the Edda , or sacred book of the Northmen , gives the same origin to all the human race . From one species of the ash , which grows wild in the mountains of Calabria , and does not attain to a great size , manna is gathered . It is procured by cutting the trunk toward the end of July , and collecting the juice which exudes . The ash does not grow to such thickness as some of the other forest-trees . Dr. Plot mentions one eight feet in diameter ; Mr. Marsham another , at Dumbarton , nearly seventeen feet in girth ; Arthur Young mentions one in Ireland that had reached the height of nearly eighty feet in thirty-five years ; and /q/ /z/ one is spoken of in the county of Galway , a district not remarkable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from the ground . Instances of so great dimensions are not numerous , however ; and it is not desirable that the ash should be left for such a growth , as trees of fewer years , and inferior scantling , are invariably better timber . Gilpin , in his work on Forest Scenery , calls the oak the Hercules of the Forest , and the ash the Venus . The chief characteristic of the one is strength ; of the other , elegance . The ash carries its principal stem higher than the oak ; its whole appearance is that of lightness , and the looseness of the leaves corresponds with the lightness of the spray . Its bloom is one of the most beautiful appearances of vegetation . The ash , however , drops its leaves very early ; and , instead of contributing its tint to the many-coloured foliage of the autumnal woods , it presents wide blanks of desolated boughs . In old age , too , it loses that grandeur and beauty which the oak preserves . Though the name be in part the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leaves , the ash must not be confounded with the mountain ash ( Pyrus aucuparia , ) which is quite a different tree The two species have this in common , that the wood is tough , and the suckers , which spring plentifully from the roots of both , are fit for hoops and other purposes ; but the mountain ash is a slow growing-tree , never attains any very valuable size , and the timber is soft and not durable . It is a hardy tree , growing anywhere ; and its bright red berries , as well as its white flowers , make it rather an ornamental plant in a shrubbery ; but it is seldom if ever planted as a timber-tree , though , in the days of superstition and folly , it was in some repute as a spell against witchcraft . The mountain ash is a beautiful object intermingled THE SERVICE . Ill with the dark pines and waving birch , which cast a solemn gloom over the hills of the north . In summer , the light green tint of its foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , in autumn , its glowing berries sparkle amidst the dark brown cones of the larch and the spruce . Service Pyrus domeitica . The True Service ( Pyrus domestica ) is a native of the south of Europe . It is generally cultivated here as a shrub , but in time , though a very long time , it becomes a tree of considerable size . The wood is compact and strong , and often made into weavers ' shuttles , and the wooden parts of other small tools and implements . Notwithstanding the goodness of its timber , the service tree could never be profitably cultivated in this country , in consequence of the slowness of its growth . The fruits of the service remain on the tree during a part of the winter : they have cathartic properties ; but the people of Kamchatka use them as food when they have been mellowed by frost . In some parts of the North an ardent spirit is produced from them by distillation. /z/ IN situations where better sorts can be had , the birch and alder are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrive in many situations where no other tree , save the pine , will grow , and where even that is stunted and unprofitable , they are deserving of some consideration . The birch is a native of cold and inhospitable climates ; and the dwarf birch is the last tree that is found as we approach the snow in elevated regions . At the island of Hammerfest , lat. 70 40 ' , the dwarfbirch , in the sheltered hollows between the mountains , rises to about the height of a man ; and in the low branches which creep along the ground , the ptarmigan finds a summer shelter , where it breeds in security . Naturalists affirm that the birch-tree constitutes the principal attraction to the birds which are found in such plenty in high northern latitudes ; the catkins affording them food in the spring , and the seeds during the remainder of the year . The Common Birch ( Betula alba is a graceful tree , and throws out a pretty strong and very agreeable fragrance . When it arrives at a considerable size , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are sometimes thirty or forty feet long , and not thicker than a common packthread , they are very beautiful , especially when the points of them are laved in a clear mountain-stream . Coleridge calls the Weeping Birch " the lady of the woods . " /z/ Though the people of more favoured places rather despise the birch-tree , and leave it to the turner , out of which to make some of the smaller of his wares , or employ the shoots as mop-handles and the twigs as brooms , there are situations in which it is among the most valued and valuable productions of nature . Birch Betula alba . In those parts of the highlands of Scotland where pine is not to be had , the birch is a timber for all uses . The stronger stems are the rafters of the cabin ; wattles of the boughs are the walls and the door ; even the chests and boxes are of this rude basket-work . To the Highlander , it forms his spade , his plough , and , if he happen to have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials are used , the cordage is still withies of twisted birch . These birch ropes are far more durable than ropes of hemp ; and the only preparation is to bark the twig , and twist it while green . In ancient times , both in Britain and other parts of Europe , strong and light canoes were made of the VOL. ii . 10* /z/ tough bark of the birch ; and it is still used for the same purposes in the northern parts of America . The species used for canoes by the Indians and French Canadians , is called the canoe-birch ( Betula papyracea or Betula nigra ) . In good soils it reaches an elevation of seventy feet . The weight of a canoe that will hold four persons does not exceed fifty pounds . The peasantry in some parts of Northern Europe thatch their houses with the birch , weave the long fibres into mats and twist them into ropes , and even grind the inner bark to mix with their bread . The bark is used in the simple dyes , and also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rein-deer skins ; and in Russia the hides which are so esteemed for binding books are prepared with the empyreumatic oil of the birch . A weak but not unpleasant wine may be obtained by draining the sap in March , boiling it , and then fermenting it . The Northern people also make very neat baskets and boxes of the bark , the Laplanders carving the large knots which the trees put forth , into vases , which , although fashioned with their rude knives , have much of the beauty of turnery . In Kamchatka also it is formed into drinking cups . The wood of the birch on the banks of the Gariy , in Glengarry , Scotland , is cut into staves , with which herring barrels are made . It is an excellent wood for the turner , being light , compact , and easily worked ; and for undressed palings and gates , such as are used in the sheep countries , few timbers are superior to it . It is not very durable , however , but very cheap , as it thrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sows itself without any assistance from art . It grows upon rocks which one would think absolutely bare ; and such is the power of its roots , that we have seen them separate stones several /z/ tons in weight , to reach the soil . The black birch of America has been imported into this country . It is compact and rather handsome , but it soon decays . Birch makes very good charcoal . Alder Alnus glutinota . The Jllder ( Jllnus glutinosa ) is not so handsome a tree as the birch , and the timber is not applicable to so many useful purposes . The alder is a native of almost every part of . Europe . It thrives best in marshy situations , and by the margins of lakes and rivers , where it is generally a large shrub rather than a tree . As its shade rather improves than injures the grass , coppices of it afford good wintering for the out-door stock on mountain grazings . The bark of the alder contains a good deal of tannin ; and the young shoots dye a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the catkins of the flowers a green . The twigs of the alder are brittle , and so is the stem when green . In that state it is more easily worked than any other timber . When of considerable size , the timber of one of the varieties /z/ ( there are several of them ) is red , and often so finely streaked , that it is called Scotch mahogany in the north , and furniture is made of it . That which is got out of the bogs , in an undecayed state , ( and though it be not so durable in the air as birch , it lasts much longer in water , ) has the colour , if not the consistency of ebony . Of birch or holly , which are very white , of jumper , which has a slight cinnamon tinge , and of the bog alder or the bog oak , both of which are black , the coopers in the north of Scotland form variegated cups , some of which are very handsome . In moist situations alder does very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it can be perforated when green , and from its not being liable to split , it is well adapted for wooden pipes . On the banks of the Mole , in Surrey , the alder grows very luxuriantly ; and it adds great beauty to the landscape in the neighbourhood of Dorking and Esher . /z/ Of the Maple ( Acer there are about thirty-six species , natives of various countries . SLx are indigenous to Europe , about twelve to America , and the remainder to various parts of Asia . Most of them are deciduous trees , but one is an evergreen shrub . It will be necessary to notice only two the Grreat Maple , or Mock-plane ( Acer psendo-platanus ) ; and the American Sugar Maple ( Acer saccharinum ) the first on account of its timber , and the last on account of its sap . The Great Maple , called also the sycamore and the plane-tree , is hardy ; stands the salt spray of the sea better than most trees ; grows rapidly , and to a great height . The timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not liable either to splinter or to warp . Sometimes it is of uniform colour , and sometimes it is /z/ Great Maple Acer pscudo-platanus. very beautifully curled and mottled . In the latter state , as it takes a fine polish , and bears varnishing well , it is much used for certain parts of musical instruments . Maple contains none of those hard particles which are injurious to tools , and is therefore employed for cutting-boards ; and not being apt to warp , either with variations of heat or of moisture , it is an eligible material for saddle-trees , wooden dishes , founders ' patterns , and many other articles both of furniture and of machinery . Before the general introduction of pottery ware , it was the common material for bowls and platters of all sorts ; and many are still made of it . As the juice of the maple , both in the leaves and in the tree , is sweet , it attracts numbers of insects . At certain seasons , the wild bees and wasps may be seen about it in crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allowed to // Sugar Maple Acer taccharinum. settle upon it , it is speedily attacked by the worm . When kept dry , and free from this attack , it will last a considerable time ; but exposed to humidity , it is one of the most perishable of trees . The maple forms a very pleasing shade , from the largeness of its leaves ; but the twisting of its branches is injurious to its picturesque effect . The constant excoriation of its bark produces a variety of hues , which give colour to any landscape in which the tree is introduced . The sugar maple grows plentifully in the United States ; and from the sap of it the inhabitants make a considerable quantity of sugar , which , though inferior both in the grain and in strength to that which is produced by the cane , granulates better than that of the beet root , or any other vegetable , the cane excepted . The sugar maple is a smaller tree than the maple of this country ; and it is not much in repute as timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in America , the wood , for domestic /q/ purposes , and the bark , as a blue dye , and as an ingredient in the manufacture of ink . February , March , or April , according to the state of the season , is the time when the maple is tapped for the preparation of sugar . A perforation is made by an auger , about two inches into the tree , slanting upwards ; into this a eane or wooden pipe is inserted , and a vessel placed to receive the sap . The quantity afforded by a tree varies both with the tree and the season ; the most favourable season being when there is the greatest difference between the heat of the day and that of the night . From two to three gallons may be about the daily average afforded by a single tree ; but some trees have yielded more than twenty gallons in a day , and others not above a pint . The process by which maple juice is boiled and clarified into sugar , does not differ materially from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice should be as recently drawn as possible ; for if it stand more than twenty-four hours , it is apt to undergo the vinous and the acetous fermentation ; by which processes , the saccharine quality of the juice being destroyed , sugar can no longer be extracted . From the quantity of saccharine matter in the juice of this maple , there is no doubt that it could be fermented into wine , and that a spirit could be distilled from it . There is saccharine matter in the sap of the common maple , but it does not granulate well , and would not repay the expense of extraction. /z/ Of the Lime Tree ( Tilia there are ten species , six of which are natives of Europe the others being Americans ; though they have been all introduced as objects of curiosity . Of the European Lime ( Tilia Europcea ) there are six varieties ; but the most valuable , and the one which is most frequently met with , is the Common /z/ Lime Tilia Europaa . Lime Tree ( communis ) . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very great size . It is not supposed to be a native of England , but mention is made of its growing here , as early as the middle of the sixteenth century . In Switzerland and Germany there are lime trees of an enormous size ; and one , in the county of Norfolk , is mentioned by Sir Thomas Brown as being ninety feet high , with a trunk forty-eight feet in circumference , at a foot and a half from the ground . The lime bears the smoke of cities better than any other tall-growing forest tree ; and for this reason the shaded walks about the cities on the Continent , more especially in Germany , are planted with it . It has other advantages : the trunk is smooth ; the leaves are of a most beautifully delicate green ; the flowers throw out a very agreeable fragrance ; and it is not so liable to get unsightly , from wounds and decayed branches , as almost any other tree . But its leaves come late in the spring , and they begin to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though a soft and weak timber , the lime is valuable /q/ for many purposes . It is delicately white , and of an uniform colour , and therefore it is admirably adapted for all light works that are to be partially painted , and then varnished . Though it is very close in the gram , it blunts the tool less than any other timber ; and as it has the same property as maple , of not warping , and even in a higher degree , it is used for cutting-boards and for the keys of musical instruments . It also stands the tool well , and is called , by way of eminence , " the carver 's tree , " being used by the carvers and gilders for most parts of their wooden ornaments . At iron foundries , the ornaments for the fronts of stoves and other purposes are all first , cut in lime-tree , and some of them are moulded from the carving , though casts be more generally taken in lead , as being more durable , and admitting of a smoother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of the churches and palaces in England , in the time of Charles II. , are all executed in lime-tree . Lime , though softer and more easily cut than beech or maple , is not so much affected either by the worm or by rot . The bark of the lime-tree is an article of commerce . As the trunk of the tree is tall and free from knots , the bark may be stripped off in long pieces . These are macerated in water till the fibrous layers separate ; and are then divided into narrow slips , called bast , which , in the northern parts of Europe , are plaited into ropes , and worked into mats . The mats in which flax and hemp are imported from the Baltic , and which , in this country , are in constant use by gardeners for covering plants from the weather , and tying them up , and also for market and tool baskets , are made of bast , or the bark of the lime tree . Though the lime be not so great a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may very fairly be doubted whether the pop- /q/ /z/ lars , and other soft , fast-growing trees that have been substituted for it , are a change for the better . The lime is not a tree for bleak and cold lands . It thrives best in rich loam , and in warm and rather moist situations ; and though the average age to which it will grow has not been accurately determined , yet , from the healthy nature of the tree , and the great size that it has arrived at , it must be considerable upwards of a hundred years . /z/ Horse ChesnutJEsculus hippocnstanum . The Common Horse Chesnut ( JEsculus hippocastanum ) is a natjve of the northern or central parts of Asia , from which it was introduced into Europe about the middle of the sixteenth century . Its progress can be traced from parts of Northern Asia to Constantinople , thence to Vienna , and thence to Paris , where the first tree was planted in 1 6 1 5 . It is very beautiful in the arrangement of its branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shape of its leaves ; and in /q/ its pyramids of large white flowers , delicately marked with red and yellow . It grows very rapidly , and to a great height ; but the timber is soft , spongy , and not durable , and therefore of little value . It is white , but every way inferior to the lime , as it does not stand the tool , and almost any thing will scratch it . It has sometimes been used by the turner , and also for pipes ; but though it is cheap , the advantage of using it is very questionable . As it requires a good soil , it is not worth cultivating but as an ornamental tree . The Turks are said to grind the nuts , and mix them with the food of their horses ( whence the common name ) : they devour them with avidity , and they are stated to be eaten whole by sheep and by poultry when boiled ; but hogs refuse them both raw and prepared . The bark of the horsechesnut has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop off early in the season , and then the appearance of the tree is rather unsightly . /z/ Of the Poplar ( Populus ) there are about fifteen species described ; but it is necessary to mention only two as timber trees : the white poplar , or spreading poplar ( Populus canescens ) ; and the Lombardy poplar , or poplar of the valley of the Po ( Populus dilatata ) , which is spire-shaped , has its branches at very small angles with the trunk , and runs up to a great height . The abele tree ( Populus - alba ) is distinguished by its broad leaves . All the poplars are fond of moisture , and may be planted near marshy places , where few other trees , save the alder , will grow . The small-leaved white poplar is a native of most parts of Europe ; but it is doubtful whether the largeleaved one , the abele , be a native of England , at all events , the plants of it were obtained chiefly from /z/ Flanders in the seventeenth century . The poplar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots three inches in diameter , and sixteen feet long , in the course of a single season . The loppings of the poplar are not very inflammable , and thus they are superior to those of the elm , and many other trees , for heating ovens , and for other purposes in which the loppings of trees are used . WKitt Poplm Popultu caneicens . The wood of the poplar is soft , and it is far from durable ; but it is not apt either to swell and shrink , or to warp , and it is very light , so that it is employed for butchers ' trays , hogs ' troughs , and other articles , in which lightness and cheapness are preferred to durability . It is possible , in consequence of the rapidity with which the poplar grows , and the ease with which it can be worked , that , on the spot where it is produced , it may be more economical for common household purposes , and for casks and packages for dry goods , than more durable timber . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well adapted to their moist soil and climate . On the /q/ Continent a species of poplar is manufactured into thin slices , called sparterie , which is made up into ladies ' bonnets . The seeds of the white poplar , also , are surrounded with a sort of cotton , of which it has been attempted to manufacture paper and even cloth . Pallas , in his travels , attempted to show that the cotton of the Populus alba was as valuable as that of America ; but no experiments upon it have yet been . successful . In Holland , the black poplar is also much cultivated . It grows rapidly , is cut down at about twentyfour years old , and made into wooden shoes , and other articles . . The timber is of nearly the same quality as that of the white poplar , perhaps a little better ; and it is used for almost the same purposes . The trembling poplar , or aspen , is singular on account of the agitation of its leaves by the slightest breeze that can stir . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it does not attain quite the same size , is applied to the same purposes . The leaves of almost all the poplars are of a pale or silver colour on the under sides , and the twigs are flexible , which gives them an agreeable variegation of colour when agitated by the wind . The susceptibility of motion is one of the accidental beauties of trees ; and the motion of the poplar is peculiarly graceful , for it waves in one simple sweep from the top to the bottom , and the least breath of wind stirs it , when other trees are at rest . The Lombardy poplar grows rapidly , and shoots in a compact spire to a great height . It is not so hardy as the others ; but when planted in a favourable soil , it will grow at the rate of four or five feet in height annually . The timber of the Lombardy poplar is even worse than that of the other poplars ; but for temporary purposes the rapidity of its growth is some compen- /z/ Liombardy Poplar Populus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of timber , and , therefore , well calculated for packing-cases ; and though soft , it will bear some strain without breaking . The vessels in which the people of Lombardy carry and squeeze their grapes are all made of this poplar ; and they also frequently train their vines to the tree . In England it is chiefly used as an ornamental tree . The Lombardy poplar is , so far as has been observed , the only spiry tree that is deciduous , or sheds its leaves : the tree which it most nearly resembles in its form , though not in its foliage , is the cypress . WILLOW , &c.; Of the willow , called Salix , from the Latin word which signifies " to spring up , " and so denominated on account of the great rapidity of its growth , there are many species , of which not fewer than one hundred and forty-one have been enumerated by Sir James Smith . Some of these , however , very much resemble each other , so that the species of willows are not so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great number , it will be necessary to mention /z/ only four two , which are chiefly used in the manufacture of baskets , one which is a timber tree , and another which is used principally as an ornament . The basket-making willows at least , those most generally and frequently used for that purpose ( for baskets may be made of the twigs of many others ) are the Osier ( Salix mminalis ) ; and the Yellow Willoiu ( Salix mtellina ) ; the timber-tree is the White Willow ( Salix alba ) ; and the ornamental one , the Weeping Willow ( Salix Babylonica ) . Osier Snlix viminalis . The osier is a native of most parts of Europe , and grows spontaneously in fenny places . When allowed , it becomes a small tree , but it is generally cut down for basket-work . The osier grows very rapidly ; and is used only for the coarser basket-work , unless when split into pieces . On the banks of large rivers , osier beds may be planted with great advantage ; and the osier will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cuttings of osiers take root very readily , and /z/ it is not of much consequence which end of them be put into the ground . They are of great use in giving consistency to banks and embankments , which are in danger of being washed away . There are many osier-beds in the Thames , which are generally cut about once in three years , and are very profitable to their proprietors . The shoots of the yellow willow are much more slender than those of the osier : they are very tough ; and on that account- they are well adapted for the finer kinds of basket-work . In common language , osier is used for almost any willow-tree , while of that which botanists call the osier there are many varieties . White Willow- Salix alba . The white arborescent willow grows to a large size by the sides of rivers ; and when the wind agitates its twigs , and turns up the silvery sides of its leaves , it has a fine appearance . It is a native of most parts of Europe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ Salix babylonica. it thrives very well in England , if the situation be not too cold for it , and if it be near water . It runs to a considerable height , and no tree can be more graceful on the margin of a lake or stream . The twigs , which hang down so beautifully , are tough , as well as long and slender ; and there can be no doubt that they would answer well for basket-making ; but this tree is chiefly introduced on account of the beauty of its appearance . It has been said , that the first willow was planted in England by the celebrated Alexander Pope . According to the account of this circumstance , the poet having received a present of figs from Turkey , observed a twig of the basket in which they were packed putting out a shoot . He planted this twig in his garden , and it soon became a fine tree ; from which stock all the weeping-willows in England have sprung . This tree , so remarkable on every account , was cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been noticed , but employed /z/ in basket-work in this country from a very early period , and there is some probability that the Britons taught the art to the Romans at least , from the mention of a basket brought to Rome by painted Britons , in Martial , we should be led to infer that baskets of British manufacture were esteemed in the capital of the world . The timber of the willow is applicable to many purposes similar to those in which the poplar is employed , and in toughness it is far superior . The ancient Britons sometimes made their boats of basketwork of willow , and covered them with'the skins of animals : they were remarkably light and buoyant . Willow bark may be used in tanning and in dyeing . The willow is used extensively in the manufacture of charcoal ; and it has been found to be superior to most other woods in producing charcoal for gunpowder A good deal depends , however , upon the manufacture . In the ordinary modes of making charcoal , by building the wood up in a pyramidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaving a few air holes , which are closed as soon as the mass is well lighted , combustion is imperfectly performed . For charcoal to be used in the manufacture of gunpowder , the wood should be ignited in iron cylinders , so that every portion of vinegar and tar which it produces should be suffered to escape . In India , charcoal is manufactured by a particular caste , who dwell entirely in the woods , and have neither intermarriage nor intercourse with the Hindoo inhabitants of the open country . They bring down their loads of charcoal to particular spots , whence it is carried away by the latter people , who deposit rice , clothing , and iron tools , a payment settled by custom . The benevolent Bishop Heber wished to mitigate the condition of these unfortunate people , but he found that he could not break through the Hindoo prejudice against them . /z/ Evelyn , in his Sylva , fears that the progress of our iron manufacture would lead to the destruction of all our timber , in the preparation of charcoal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substitute , by charring pit-coal into coke . In .1788 , there were eighty-six iron furnaces in England , of which twenty-six were heated by charcoal of wood ; in 1826 , there were three hundred and five , all served by coke . Good charcoal is also made from Dog Wood ( Cornus sanguined , which is , however , a tree , or rather a shrub , very different from the willow in its appearance and habits . The Dogwood is firm and compact ; grows naturally in hedges upon chalky soils , and bears berries that have a purple juice , out of which a red colouring matter of considerable brightness may be extracted . It is very common in Kent and Sussex ; and as there are many powder-mills there , coppices of it are reared for supplying them with charcoal . Hazel Corylus avellana . Another shrub which is applied to the same uses as the willow , namely , making baskets and hoops , but chiefly the latter , is the Hazel ( Corylus avellana ) . Of /z/ that there are several varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the filbert . The first is a native of every part of Britain , the shells of the " nuts being found in the bogs even in the coldest parts . The filbert , again , is supposed to be a native of Asia to have been imported first into Italy , and thence to the rest of Europe . The filbert grows more upright , is more tree like , and bears larger and better flavoured nuts than the hazel ; but the wood of the hazel is the tougher , and the better adapted for hoops , though both make excellent charcoal . There is an American species ; and there is also one growing in the vicinity of Constantinople , which bears a nut nearly double the size of the filbert . More than a hundred thousand bushels of foreign nuts are annually consumed in this country . /z/ The Laburnum ( Cytisus does not appear to be so much cultivated in England , as a timber tree , as its merits deserve . There are about thirty species of the Cytisus , properly so called , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable . In England the laburnum is principally cultivated as an ornamental shrub , and when in bloom its numerous and long branches of yellow flowers have a very shewy appearance . Laburnum is , however , exceedingly useful as a tree ; and wherever very hard and compact timber is required in small pieces , there are few superior to it . The Romans reckoned it next to ebony ; though not so hard , or so perfectly free from grain , it is much more tough and elastic . Its ' natural colour , too , is good , and it may be rendered almost black by the application of lime water . It is also a very hardy tree , and will grow in almost any soil ; but hares and rabbits , which abound in many parts of England , and are preserved to the destruction , not merely of trees , but of the grain crops of /z/ Laburnum Cytisus. the farmer , spoil the young laburnums by gnawing the bark in winter . Even of the small size to which it is permitted to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulleys , pegs , the handles of knives , and other instruments . When of larger dimensions , no timber is fitter for cabinet work of all kinds . It takes a fine polish , it looks well , and it is durable . Chairs made of it are far stronger than any mahogany . It may , however , be doubted whether laburnum holds glue as well , because it contains an oil , which never dries out ; and it is harder to work than mahogany . This oily property fits it well for pins of blocks , and cogs in mill-work , as its unctuous nature prevents it from VOL n. 12 /z/ being abraded . Many of the purposes for which it was once used are now supplied by lignum vitae , which is a harder wood , and still more unctuous ; but lignumvitse is more splintery . For tables laburnum wood is not so well adapted , being seldom of sufficient breadth for a fold , and not standing well when glued ; but for pillars , bed-posts , feet of tables , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laburnum have very powerful medicinal effects upon the human system , and a garland of the flowers , if worn for some time , is said to occasion head-ache . Some of the largest trees that we remember to have seen are in Athol , by the way side between Dunkeld and Blair . Nearly allied to the laburnum , though not of the same family , or growing to the same dimensions , is Broom , the wood of the Common Broom ( Spartium scoparium ) very much resembling that of laburnum in everything but colour . The wood , when of sufficient size , is applicable to the same purposes as laburnum . For one purpose pins for pulleys , it is superior to any other wood . Common broom is so hardy that , instead of requiring any care in cultivation , it is extirpated as a weed . In some places , however , it is sown close , and after two or three years , cut for thatching barns and cottages . Though the brooms be in general evergreens , and the laburnum deciduous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genista , and Cytisus . When the Scotch snuff-boxes were first made by Mr. Steven , of Laurencekirk , they were formed of the roots of broom , steeped for a long time in water ; but when the demand became great , and other persons engaged in the manufacture , inferior materials were used , and the quality of the boxes was deteriorated . The flowers of the ' Dyer 's broom ' ( Genista tinctoria afford a bright colouring /z/ matter , which is used in dyeing wool yellow , or preparing it for being dyed green with woad . The Broom of Spain ( Genista juncea ) is a beautiful shrub , with very fragrant flowers . In countries where the soil is too dry for the growth of flax and hemp , the bark of the Spanish broom is prepared in a peculiar way , and from the threads which it produces very excellent linen is manufactured . Broom Sp artium *cV arium . /z/ BEFORE the introduction of mahogany , the walnut was " the cabinet-maker 's tree " in England , and it was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to its weight , beautifully variegated , admitting of a fine polish , durable , and obtained in sizes sufficiently large . In many parts of the continent , where the expense of the carriage of mahogany is great , the walnut is still extensively used in the manufacture of furniture ; and , perhaps , there is no native tree which bears the climate of England well , that is better adapted for the purpose . Oak , though abundantly durable , can not be finely polished without great expense , and it is heavier in proportion to its strength . Of the Walnut-tree , ( called by the Romans Juglans , or the nut of Jove , ) there are very many species enumerated , which have been divided by modern botanists into three genera . Of these species it is necessary to mention only two as timber trees , the Common Walnut-tree ( Juglans regia ) and the White Walnut , or hickery-tree ( Juglans alba ) . The first of these is a native of the warmer parts of Europe , or perhaps of Asia ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common walnut is a very handsome and a very useful tree . It is true that the fruit does not come to maturity in the northern parts of this island ; and that in the southern , nay in countries much farther south , it is apt to be injured by the frosts of /q/ spring . In many parts of this country , it thrives well as a tree , and wherever it thrives it is valuable . As is the case with all trees and plants that have been long known , esteemed , and cultivated by man , the original country of the walnut is not recorded . Some are of opinion that it is the " Persian nut " mentioned by Theophrastus ; and that , therefore , Persia is the country from which it was first intro WalnutJuglans regia. duced into Europe . It is found indigenous in the more northern parts of that country , toward the mountains of Caucasus ; sometimes , though more rarely , in the Russian territory on the north of those mountains ; and in China . In all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a state of nature , and continues itself without cultivation . In the east of France , the south of Germany , and Switzerland , it is very abundant , more especially in Germany ; in many parts of which , such as the plains of the Bergstrasse , which run parallel to the Rhine , beVOL. /z/ tween the Neckar and Mayn , there is hardly any other timber. * In England there are still a good many trees scattered over the country ; but the timber is not so great as it was formerly , the partiality for the woods of the colonies and other foreign countries having diminished the value of this , as well as of most other species of domestic timber used for finer purposes . There is still , however , one use to which the walnut-tree is applied , in preference to any other timber , and this use demands the qualities of beauty , durabi lity , and strength : walnut-tree is employed for the stocks of all manner of fire-arms . Before it is used , however , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent it is very apt to shrink , a disadvantage which is completely got rid of by seasoning . The walnut grows rapidly till it attains a considerable size , which is even valuable as timber . The absolute duration of the tree has not been ascertained with accuracy ; but , probably , the most profitable age for cutting it is the average of hard-wood trees , about fifty or sixty years . The demand for musket and pistol stocks during the late war thinned England of its walnut trees ; and the deficiency should be made up by fresh planting . At that period the timber was so much in demand , that a fine tree has often been sold for several hundred pounds . Beside the value of its timber , the walnut-tree hastnany other uses . The ripe nuts are well known as a fruit ; the green ones make an agreeable and wholesome pickle ; and the oil is used for delicate colours in painting , and for smoothing and polishing wood work : sometimes , also , for frying meats , and * The spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergstrasse , and the neighbouring parts of Germany , where the walnut is extensively cultivated for the oil . Many thousand trees were killed , and nearly all the branches of the rest were destroyed . /q/ for burning in lamps . When the leaves and recent husks , in their green state , are macerated in warm water , the extract , which is bitter and astringent , is used to destroy insects ; and it is a very permanent dye , imparting to wool , hair , or the skin and nails of the living body , a dingy greenish yellow , which can not be obliterated without a great deal of labour . On this latter account , it is said to have been used by gypsies , in staining the complexions of stolen children , that they may appear to be their own offspring . The quantity of oil in fresh walnuts is very considerable , being about equal to half the weight of the kernels . There are several varieties of the common walnut , as the thick shelled , which afford the best timber ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yield most oil . These , however , are mere varieties ; for , as is the case with the oak , and many other trees , in which we find a variation in the colour and shape of the leaves , and in the fruit , all the varieties may be obtained by sowing the nuts of the same tree . In cultivated vegetables , indeed , there is a confusion of varieties which is not met with in animals . The animal mules , whether quadruped , as between the horse , and the ass or the zebra , or birds , as the cross of the goldfinch and canary-bird , are all barren : but the new varieties of plants , though apparently accidental , are generally productive ; and thus , by the seeds alone , varieties may be produced almost without end . Many trees of more full growth , in which forced cultivation has destroyed the faculty of perfecting seeds , may be propagated by cuttings or layers . The form which the branches of the walnut-tree assume is generally beautiful . In May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast with other trees ; but it opens its leaves late and drops them early . /z/ The white walnut , or Hickery , is a native of North America , where it grows to be a timber tree of considerable dimensions . The nut is rather smaller than that of the common walnut ; it is lighter hi the colour , and not furrowed in the shell . The kernel is edible , and yields an oil similar to that of the walnut . One part of the wood is more porous than that of the walnut , but the other is more compact : this gives the grain of the wood something the appearance of that of ash ; and where it abounds , it is used for similar purposes , the small shoots for hoops , and the grown trees for agricultural instruments . Hickery is very tough and elastic ; and therefore it answers remarkably well for fishing rods , the shafts and poles of carriages , and other purposes where a slender substance of timber has to resist sudden jerks or strains . In favourable situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the arboretum of the Royal Botanical Garden at Kew are of great size for their age , and very handsome trees . The trunk rises to a considerable height , of nearly uniform thickness , as straight as a line , and without any lateral branches ; and it is thus very probable that , if the tree were more generally cultivated , it would make one of the most valuable in the country . There are two other descriptions of foreign trees , which , though they belong not to the same genus with hickery , are applied to purposes almost similar in the arts ; and therefore this is the proper place in which to notice them . They are Lance wood , and the Hassagay wood , of which the natives of Southern Africa make the stems of their spears . Lance wood ( Guaiteria virgata ) is a native of the island of Jamaica ; and though it does not grow ot a very great size , it is perhaps one of the most valuable timber-trees in the island . No timber possesses , /q/ in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and therefore none can be better for the shafts of light carriages , and every other purpose where a small body and weight of timber is required to stand a great strain . The very best ash , the toughest of our native timber , is greatly inferior to lance wood , both in strength and elasticity ; and in consequence of ash being open and varied in the grain , while lance wood is close and uniform , it does not carve so well into ornaments , take so smooth a polish , or admit of being varnished with so little labour . The Hassagay Tree ( Curtisia faginea ) is a larger growing tree than the lance wood , being one of the largest timber trees in Africa . Its leaves resemble those of the birch ; the timber is compact , firm , and very stiff . It is not so much used in this country as the former . /z/ The mulberry is a tree of singular and varied uses to man , not so much on account of its timber ( for though the timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree is rather a slow grower ) as for its leaves and its bark , and the dye that is obtained from the wood of at least one of the species . Of the mulberry ( Morus ) there are many species ; and though none of them are natives of England , or probably of Europe , some are sufficiently hardy to thrive in most , and bear fruit in many , parts of Britain . The white mulberry ( Morus alba ) is rather a delicate tree , though it grows very well in Spain , Italy , and the south of France . The berries of it are light coloured and insipid . The black mulberry ( Morus nigra is a larger and more hardy tree ; the fruit is a blackish red , and has much more taste than that of the other . The timber of both these species is very durable : it will last as /z/ long in water as the best oak ; and the bark is tough and fibrous , and may be made into strong and durable mats and baskets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its being the favourite food of the silkworm . That insect , and this use of the mulberrytree , were both unknown to the Greeks and Romans ; though there is every reason to believe that they Blade Mulberry Morus nigra. were then , and perhaps earlier , known to the Chinese , and possibly to some of the other inhabitants of central and southern Asia . The rearing of silk-worms , and the manufacture of silk , are said to have been introduced into the Western world in the sixth century of the Christian era . About the year 550 , two monks , natives of Persia , while employed as missionaries to the Christian churches in India , are said to have penetrated as far as China , where they acquired a knowledge of the rearing of the silk- worm , and the working of silk . Upon their return , they explained to the Greek emperor at Constantinople the nature and importance of those operations , and undertook to bring to that capital as many silk-worms as should suffice for estaWishing /q/ and supplying the manufacture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the eggs of the silk-worm concealed and preserved in a hollow cane : these eggs were hatched by the heat of a dunghill . The attempt succeeded ; the worms were fed with the leaves of wild mulberry trees ; they multiplied rapidly ; and the produce of their labours proved to be as good silk as that which had been made in the East . The animal by which silk is originally made is a species of moth ( Phalccna Mori . When perfect , or in the winged state , it is of a whitish colour , with a pale brown line across the upper wings , and displays in itself none of that lustre which its labours produce . The caterpillar , in which state it spins the silk , and is thence called the silk- worm , is about three-quarters of an inch long , of a yellowish gray colour ; it feeds very voraciously on the leaves of the black and white mulberry tree indiscriminately ; and it will also feed upon lettuce and some other plants . For about six weeks , the silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its skin four times during that period , and ceasing to feed for a short tune previous to each change . When full grown , it eats no more , but , chooshlg a convenient place , begins to envelop itself in silken fibres ; and it continues this operation till it has spun an oval case or ball of yellowish silk , about the size of a pigeon 's egg , in which it remains as a chrysalis for about fifteen days , at the end of which it gnaws through the end of the silken ball , and comes out a winged moth , to deposit its eggs for a fresh generation , and very soon after to die . Those who cultivate the worm for silk do not suffer it to reach this last stage , because the silken fibre would be cut into small pieces by the opening at which the moth escapes . When the whole ouantitv of silk /z/ is formed , they destroy the chrysalis by means ot heat . Previous to the time when the two missionaries brought the eggs of the silk-worm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantinople , silk was a very costly article , the price in Rome being an equal weight of gold . But the number of worms augmented rapidly , and Greece , more especially the Morea , produced an abundant supply . The conquest of Constantinople by the Venetians , in 1204 , led to the introduction of the article into Venice , from which , in the course of a short time , it extended to Genoa , and other parts of Italy . Henry IV . was anxious to introduce the silk-worm into France , and he took some very efficient measures to advance that object ; but his success was not equal to his wish . Colbert , in the reign of Louis XIV. , was the first who added it to the productive wealth of that country , upon a large scale . James I. was desirous of introducing it into England , and there have been many trials since ; but , though these have promised to be successful , they have not been prosecuted , probably because the culture is better adapted to warmer skies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rearing of silk-worms , it is not allowed to grow to a timber-tree . The young shoots are preferred for that purpose ; and , therefore , in China , the trees are either cut down altogether every third year , or they are kept low by pruning . When the leaves of the mulberry fail , or are deficient , in China , those of the ash are said to make no bad substitute . Some varieties of the ash have certainly this much in common with the mulberry , that they do not expand their leaves till the season be far advanced , seldom till the middle of May , and very often not till the end of that month . It is stated that the Chinese dry the mulberry leaves in the sun , /q/ and keep them in close-stopped vessels , for the food of the silk-worm , if it he produced before the young leaves of the tree are ready for its support . When cultivated for its fruit , the mulberry , unlike most other fruit-trees , produces fruit in greater abundance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its dense and dark foliage forms a fine contrast with trees of more airy form and lighter hue , it is a very ornamental tree . The Paper Mulberry ( Bronssonetia papyrifera ) , is a native of China and Japan , the South Sea Islands , and some parts of America . It does not attain a very great height , but it shoots vigorously , and is a very branchy tree . Its fruit is black , purple , and sweet , but small not larger , in general , than a common pea . It is cultivated in Japan for the manufacture of paper ; and from this circumstance it gets its specific name . For this purpose it is raised in beds , as osiers are cultivated with us for the use of the basket-maker and the cooper . When the leaves have fallen off , that is , about the month of December , the shoots are cut down , divided into lengths of . about three feet , bound into bundles , placed upright and close together in a copper , and boiled till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be dry before being subjected to boiling , they are prepared for that operation by maceration hi water for twenty-four hours . After the rods are cold , the bark is divided lengthwise by a knife , stripped off , and dried for use . When to be used , it is put into water till it is so much soaked that the external and coloured part of the bark can be separated . That being done , the bark is sorted , the strongest being set apart for the best and whitest paper , and the weaker for that of inferior quality ; while of the refuse they make a very coarse brown paper . The sorted bark is /q/ /z/ then boiled till it becomes tender , that is , till it easily separates with the fingers ; and then it is washed for a longer or shorter time , according to the quality of paper wanted . If strong writing paper , the washing must be moderate ; but if the colour is to be very delicate , and the texture soft and silky , the washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken to a table , and there reduced to a pulp , by beating with wooden mallets . When sufficiently reduced , it is brought to the requisite consistency with water ; rice-starch , and the mucilaginous infusion of manihot-root ( Hibiscus manihot ) , are added by way of size ; and then the sheets of paper are formed one by one upon a table , collected into heaps , and pressed by a weight . The same bark is used by the people of many of the South Sea Islands in the manufacture of their finer cloths , more especially those that are to be dyed . They make a coarser but stronger cloth of the bark of the bread-fruit tree , and also of that of another tree resembling the wild-fig of the West Indies . The paper mulberry will grow in England , but the cultivation of it would not , probably , be attended with much profit . There can be no doubt , however , that if proper attention were paid to the subject , excellent paper might be made of the inner bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is now used merely for fuel , or thrown away . The fustic mulberry ( Moms tinctoria ) is a native of many parts of South America ( especially Brazil ) and the West India Islands . It grows to be a very large and handsome tree ; and the timber , though like most other dye-woods , brittle , or at least easily splintered , is hard and strong . It is , however , chiefly used as an ingredient in dyeing yellow ; and a great deal of it is imported into Europe for that purpose under the name of fustic. /q/ /z/ Though the Mahogany is a native of too warm a climate to allow of its cultivation as a timber-tree in this country , yet it is applied to so many uses , and is so well adapted for most of them , that some notice of it is required . There are three species of mahogany : Common mahogany ( Swietenia mahagom ) , Swietenia febrifuga , and Swietenia chloroxijlon : the first being a native of the West India Islands and the central parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East Indies . They all grow to be trees of considerable magnitude the first and second being among the largest trees known . They are all excellent timber . Swietenia mahagoni is , perhaps , the most majestic of trees ; for though some rise to a greater height , this tree , like the oak and the cedar , impresses the spectator with the strongest feelings of its firmness and duration . In the rich valleys among the mountains of Cuba , and those that open upon the bay of Honduras , the mahogany expands to so giant a trunk , divides into so many massy arms , and throws the shade of its shining green leaves , spotted with tufts of pearly flowers , over so vast an extent of surface , that it is difficult to imagine a vegetable production combining in such a degree the qualities of elegance and strength , of beauty and sublimity . The precise period of its growth is not accurately known ; but as , when large , it changes but little during the life of a man , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred years . Some idea of its size , and also of its commercial value , may be formed from the fact that a single log , imported at Liverpool , weighed nearly seven tons ; was , in the first instance , sold for 3181. ; resold for 525Z. ; and would , had the dealers /z/ been certain of its quality , have been worth WOOL Mahogany of remarkable fineness is very costly , as we shall shew when we come to speak of fancy-woods . As is the case with much other timber , the finest mahogany trees , both for size and quality , are not in the most accessible situations ; and as it is always imported in large masses , the transportation of it for any distance overland is so difficult , that the very best trees , both on the islands and on the main land those that grow in the rich inland vallies defy the means of removal possessed by the natives . Masses of from six to eight tons are not very easily moved in any country ; and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid to mechanical power , to move them is impossible . In Cuba , the inhabitants have neither enterprise nor skill adequate to felling the mahogany trees , and transporting them to the shore ; and thus the finest timber remains unused . The discovery of this beautiful timber was accidental , and its introduction into notice was slow . The first mention of it is that it was used in the repair of some of Sir Walter Raleigh 's ships , at Trinidad , in 1597 . Its finely variegated tints were admired ; but in that age the dream of El Dorado caused matters of more " value to be neglected . The first that was brought to England was about the beginning of last century ; a few planks having been sent to Dr. Gibbons , of London , by a brother who was a West India captain . The Doctor was erecting a house in Kingstreet , Covent Garden , and gave the planks to the workmen , who rejected it as being too hard . The Doctor 's cabinet-maker , named Wollaston , was employed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sawing up the plank he also complained of the hardness of the timber . But when the candle-box was finished , it outshone hi beauty all the Doctor 's other furniture , and /q/ became an object of curiosity and exhibition . The wood was then taken into favour : Dr. Gibbons had a bureau made of it , and the Duchess of Buckingham another ; and the despised mahogany now became a prominent article of luxury , and at the same time raised the fortunes of the cabinet-maker by whom it had been at first so little regarded . Mahogany Swietenia mahagoni . The mahogany-tree is found in great quantities on the low and woody lands , and even upon the rocks in the countries on the western shores of the Caribbean J sea , about Honduras and Campeachy . It is also abundant in the Islands of Cuba and Hayti , and it used to be plentiful in Jamaica , where it was of excellent quality ; but most of the larger trees have been cut down . It was formerly abundant on the Bahamas , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and four feet in diameter . In the earliest periods it was much used by the Spaniards in ship-building . When first introduced by them it was very dark and hard , and without much of that VOL. n. 13* /z/ beautiful variety of colour which now renders it superior to all other timber for cabinet-work ; but it was more durable , and took a higher polish with less labour . Of course it was wholly unknown to the ancients . It was first introduced in the sixteenth century , but it was not generally used in England till the eighteenth . The mahogany is a graceful tree , with many branches that form a very handsome head . The leafets are in pairs , mostly four , and sometimes three , but very rarely five ; the pair opposite , and without any odd leafet at the point ; they are smooth and shining , lance-shaped , entire at the edges like those of the laurel , and bent back ; each leafet is about two inches and a half long , and the whole leaf is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the seed-vessel has some resemblance to that of the Barbadoes cedar : hence some botanists have given the name of cedar to the tree . This tree so far corresponds with the pine tribe , that the timber is best upon the coldest soils and in the most exposed situations . When it grows upon moist soils and warm lands , it is soft , coarse , spongy , and contains sap-wood , into which some worms will eat . That which is most accessible at Honduras is of this description ; and therefore it is only used for coarser works , or for a ground on which to lay veneers of the choicer sorts . For the latter purpose it is well adapted , as it holds glue better than deal , and , when properly seasoned , is not so apt to warp or to be eaten by insects . When it grows in favourable situations , where it has room to spread , it is of much better quality and puts out large branches , the junctions of which with the stem furnish those beautifully curled pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks and much exposed , the size is inferior , and there is not /q/ so much breadth or variety of shading ; but the timber is far superior , and the colour is more rich . The last description is by far the strongest , and is therefore the best adapted for chairs , the legs of tables , and other purposes in which a moderate size has to bear a considerable strain . Since the produce of Jamaica has been nearly exhausted , there are only two kinds known in the market . Bay wood , or that which is got from the continent of America , and Spanish wood , or the produce of the islands chiefly of Cuba and Hayti . Though the Bay wood is inferior to the other both in value and in price , it is often very beautiful , and may be obtained in logs as large as six feet square . It is , however , not nearly so compact as the other ; the grain is apt to rise in polishing , and , if it be not covered by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gives to the tool in carving , and is not well adapted for ornaments . Spanish wood cuts well , takes a fine polish , resists scratches , stains , and fractures much better , and is generally the only sort upon which much or delicate workmanship should be expended . The colours of mahogany do not come well out without the application of oil or varnish ; and if the best sorts be often washed with water , or long macerated in it , they lose their beauty , and become of a dingy brown . The red is deepened by alkaline applications , especially lime-water ; but strong acids destroy the colour . When the surface is covered by a colourless varnish , which displays the natural tints without altering any of them , good mahogany appears to the greatest advantage . The Febrifuga , or East India mahogany , is a very large tree . It grows in the mountainous parts of central Hindostan , rises to a great height with a straight trunk , which , towards the upper part , throws out many branches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some resemblance to those of the American species . The wood is of a dull red colour , not so beautiful as common mahogany , but much harder , heavier , and more durable . The natives of India account it the most lasting timber that their country produces , and therefore they employ it in their sacred edifices , and upon every occasion where they wish to combine strength with durability . Swietenia cUoroxylon . The Chloroxylon is chiefly found in the mountains of the Sircars , that run parallel to the bay of Bengal , to the N.E. of the mouth of the River Godovery . The tree does not attain the same size as either of the former , and the appearance of the wood is different . It is of a deep yellow , nearly of the same colour as box , from which it does not differ much in durability ; and it could be applied to the same purposes . /z/ NOT to multiply too much the subdivisions of this brief sketch , it will not be amiss to class under one head a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , though they have no botanical relationship ; though they are natives of different countries ; and though some are deciduous , and others evergreens . 1 . THORN . Of the thorn ( Cratcegus the botanists enumerate many species , which they class into several genera . Some of these species are natives of America . They are mostly hardy and deciduous , and , when planted singly , grow up to be large shrubs , or small trees . Most of them thrive well in this country ; though they are stunted and poor , on very bad soils , in exposed situations . The White Beam ( Pyrus aria is a beautiful tree rising to the height of thirty or forty feet . The trunk is large , and divides into many branches . The leaves are light green on the upper sides , and white on the under . It is a native of many parts of Europe , growing upon dry and rather warm soils , such as those over gravel , chalk , and limestone . The wood is very firm and tough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other things are made of it . It is close and takes a smooth polish ; but , like most of the thorns , it requires to be well seasoned , otherwise it is apt to warp and split . The Wild Service ( Pyrus torminalis grows to a /z/ considerable size , and requires a stronger soil than the former . The flowers are in large bunches , and are succeeded by brown berries in the shape of haws , but larger , which are often to be met with in the London markets , in autumn . The timber is compact , hard , tough , and white ; and answers very well for cogs of wheels , and other working parts of wooden machinery . The Indian Hawthorn ( Raphiolipis Indica ) is a native of the East Indies . It has been said , but the statement is somewhat doubtful , that it is of larger size than most of the other thorns ; without spines ; and yielding a tough , red timber , fit for oars , handspikes , and similar purposes . Whitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( C. oxycantha ) , is valuable both as a hedge shrub , and as a tree . Few plants exceed it in beauty , when in bloom ; the season of which is usually May , on which account the name of May , or " May-blossom , " is , in some places , given to the tree . There is one variety however , the Glastonbury thorn ( to which the monks of the dark ages attached a popular legend ) , that /q/ flowers in January or February , and in favourable seasons and situations , as early as Christmas . Gilpin mentions that " one of its progeny , which grew in the gardens at Bulstrode , had its flower-buds perfectly formed so early as the 21st December . " In the arboretum at the Royal Gardens , Kew , a similar thorn flowers at the same season . The belief that certain trees put forth their flowers on Christmasday , was not confined to the Glastonbury thorn . In the JVew Forest , at Cadenham , near Lyndhurst , an oak used to bud about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believed that it never budded all the year , except on Old Christmas-day . The superstition was destroyed by careful investigation ; and the circumstance is thus recorded in the Salisbury newspaper of January 10,1786 : " Inconsequence of a report that has prevailed in this county for upwards of two centuries , and which , by many , has been considered as a matter of faith , that the oak at Cadenham , in the New Forest , shoots forth leaves on every Old Christmas-day , and that no leaf is ever to be seen on it either before or after that day , during the winter , a lady , who is now on a visit in this city , and who is attentively curious in every thing relative to art or nature , made a journey to Cadenham , on Monday the 3d instant , purposely fo inquire on the spot , about the production of this famous tree . On her arrival near it , the usual guide was ready to attend her ; but , on his being desired to climb the oak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said it would be to no purpose ; but that if she would come on the Wednesday following , ( Christmas day , ) she might certainly see thousands . However , he was prevailed upon to ascend , and on the first branch which he gathered appeared several fair new leaves , fresh sprouted from the buds , and nearly an inch and a half in length . It may be imagined that the guide was more amazed at this premature /z/ production than the lady , for , so strong was his belief in the truth of the whole tradition , that he would have pledged his life that not a leaf was to have been discovered on any part of the tree before the usual hour . " When young , the hawthorn grows rapidly , a shoot of a single year being sufficient for a walking stick ; but when it stands to be a tree , it makes wood very slowly , and lives to a great age . The wood is remarkably durable : there is ( or was , a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the county of JVairn , which has been without leaves or bark for more than a century , and which , tradition says , has been in its present situation , and of its present size , ever since the castle ( which is a very old one ) was founded . The trunk of an old hawthorn is more gnarled and rough than , perhaps , that of any other tree ; and this , with its hoary appearance , and its fragrance , renders it a favourite tree with pastoral and rustic poets , and with those to whom they address their songs . Milton , in his L'Allegro , has not forgotten this favourite of the village : " Every shepherd tells his tale liader the hawthorn in the dale . " When Burns , with equal force and delicacy , delineates the pure and unsophisticated affection of young , intelligent , and innocent country people , as the most enchanting of human feelings , he gives additional sweetness to the picture by placing his lovers " Beneath the milk-white thorn , that scents the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one bred in the country can not soon forget , and which a visitor learns , perhaps , sooner than any association of placid delight connected with rural scenery . When , too , the traveller , or the man of the world , after a life spent in other pursuits returns to the village of his nativity , the /z/ old hawthorn is the only playfellow of his boyhood that has not changed . His seniors are in the grave ; his contemporaries are scattered ; the hearths at which he found a welcome are in the possession of those who know him not ; the roads are altered ; the houses rebuilt , and the common trees have grown out of his knowledge : but be it half a century or more , if man spare the old hawthorn , it is just the same not a limb , hardly a twig , has altered from the picture that memory traces of his early years . The timber of the hawthorn is remarkably hard and durable , and fit for very many purposes ; but a supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree grows so very slowly after attaining some size . There are several varieties of the hawthorn , all natives of Europe . Of these the double-flowering has great beauty as a shrub . // species , and the varieties produced , distinguished chiefly by the leaves , are very numerous . /z/ Ilex aquifolium . /z/ The Common Holly ( Ilex aquifolium ) is very abundantly diffused , being found in . warm climates , and in cold , in most countries of Europe , and in many of Asia and America . Hollies are abundant in some of the uncultivated parts of the southern counties of England ; and they are also to be met with in the Highlands of Scotland , in places where one could hardly suppose they had been planted . Were it not that the holly grows very slowly when young , and can not be safely transplanted when it has attained a considerable size , it would make better hedge-rows than the hawthorn . When allowed time r and not destroyed by shortening the top-shoot , the holly grows up to a large tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surrey , are mentioned by Bradley , as having grown to the height of sixty feet ; and old hollies of thirty and forty feet , with clean trunks of considerable diameter , are to be met with in many parts of the country . A holly hedge is a pleasing object , though it is too often clipped into formal shapes . Evelyn had a magnificent hedge of this sort , at his gardens at Say 's Court , which he planted at the suggestion of Peter the Great , who resided in his house when he worked in the dock-yards at Deptford . He thus rapturously speaks of this fine fence : " Is there under heaven a more glorious and refreshing object of the kind than an impregnable hedge , of about four hundred feet in length , nine feet high , and five in diameter , which I can shew in my new raised gardens at Say 's Court ( thanks to the Czar of Muscovy ) at any time of the year , glittering with its armed and varnished leaves , the taller standards , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The timber of the holly is very white and compact , which adapts it well for many purposes in the arts ; though , as it is very retentive of its sap , and warps in /q/ consequence , it requires to be well dried and seasoned before being used . It takes a durable colour , black , or almost any other ; and . hence , it is much used by cabinet-makers in forming what are technically called strings and borders , in ornamental works . When properly stained black , its colour and lustre are not much inferior to those of ebony . For various purposes of the turner , and for the manufacture of what is called Tunb ridge ware , it is also much used ; and , next to box and pear-tree , it is the best wood for engraving upon , as it is close and stands the tool well .

The wood of the box is of considerable size , though we generally meet with a small species in this country , in the state of a shrub , forming borders , where the largest stem is not thicker than a packthread , or , when not in this state , still as a little shrub often tastelessly cut into fantastic shapes . Only two species of box are mentioned by botanists ; but there are several varieties , and one of them , the Dwarf Box ( Buxus suffruticosa ) ought , perhaps , to be considered as a distinct species from the Common Box ( Buxus sempervirens , and not merely a variety , as no art has been able to rear the former to the size of the latter . The seeds of the one were never observed by Miller to produce plants of the other , as is the case with most varieties of species in the vegetable kingdom , more especially of trees and shrubs . When allowed to arrive at its full growth , the box attains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies in diameter from three to six inches , which it sometimes , though rarely , exceeds . /z/ Bums scmpervirens . It is a native of all the middle and southern parts of Europe ; and it is found in greater abundance and of a larger size in the countries on the west of Asia , to the south of the mountains of Caucasus . In many parts of France it is also plentiful , though generally in the character of a shrub . In early times it flourished upon many of the barren hills of England . Evelyn found it upon some of the higher hills in Surrey , displaying its myrtle-shaped leaves and its bright green in the depth of winter ; and , till very recently , it gave to Boxhill , in that county , the charms of a delightful and perennial verdure . The trees have now been destroyed , and the name , as at other places called after the box , has become the monument of its former beauty . Yet no tree so well merits cultivation though its growth be slow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are not found existing together in any other . It is as close and heavy as ebony ; not very much softer than lignutnvit ( Kj it cuts better than any other wood ; and when an edge is made of the ends of the fibres , it stands better than lead or tin , nay almost as well as brass . Like holly , the box is very retentive of its sap , and /z/ warps when not properly dried , though when sufficiently seasoned it stands well . Hence , for the wooden pait of the finer tools , for everything that requires strength , beauty , and polish in timber , there is nothing equal to it . There is one purpose for which box , and box alone , is properly adapted , and that is the forming of wood-cuts , for scientific or other illustrations in books . These reduce the price considerably in the first engraving , and also in the printing ; while the wood-cut in box admits of as high and sharp a finish as any metal , and takes the ink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the cut be not exposed to alternate moisture or heat , so as to warp or crush it , the number of thousands that it will print is almost incredible . England is the country where this economical mode of illustration is performed in the greatest perfection ; and just when a constant demand for box was thus created , the trees available for the purpose had vanished from the island . Permanent figures and ornaments are often impressed upon boxj by a much more cheap and simple process than that of carving . For this purpose the wood is softened by the application of heat and moisture ; and the die being strongly pressed upon it when in that state , the impression comes off , and is retained with considerable sharpness . Snuff-boxes of this description are extensively made in France , Switzerland , and Germany , and the material used is principally the root of the box . // those who treat of and classify plants are not wholly agreed , though it is usually referred either to one or more species of the date plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the adjoining islands , or to that which is a native of Jamaica ; though the former ( Diospyrus Ebenus is , by the best judges , considered as the true ebony . The /z/ fact is , that the name ebony is applied to trees of various genera , producing wood of different colours , and only agreeing in the common qualities of great compactness , weight , and durability . Ebony was much more in use and esteem formerly than it is now . When good , it is very valuable for the purposes to which it is applied , not being liable to shrink or warp . It does not , however , hold glue so well as mahogany ; and it is apt to be imitated by less valuable woods stained black . In his Journal , Bishop Heber describes the Ebony tree of Ceylon as a magnificent forest tree , with a tall , black , slender stem , spotted with white . A great deal of the furniture in Ceylon is made of ebony . At Fonthill Abbey there were some splendid ebony chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigious weight , which were said to have belonged to Cardinal Wolsey ; and there were formerly some similar chairs in the Round Tower of Windsor Castle . Litrnumvita. /q/ // ( Guaiacum Officinale ' ) is a dark-looking evergreen , and grows to a great size in the West India Islands , of which it is a native . It bears blue flowers , which are succeeded by roundish capsules . In its native climate the Lignumvita ? is a very hardy tree , and retains its greenness in the dryest weather . It strikes its roots deep into the ground , and thus defies the hurricane as well as the drought . The bark is hard , smooth , and brittle ; and the wood is of a yellowish , or , rather , olive colour , with the grain crossing in a sort of irregular lozenge-work . Lignumvitae is the weightiest timber with which we are acquainted , and it is the most difficult to work . It can hardly be split , but breaks into pieces like a stone or chrystalized metal . It is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it ; and it is , therefore , proof against decay . Its weight and hardness make it the very best timber for stampers and mallets of all sorts ; and its resinous matter fits it the best for the sheaves or pulleys of blocks , and for friction rollers and castors . A sheave of lignumvitae cuts a wooden pin less , and is less cut by- a metal one , than a sheave of any other timber ; while its own sap makes it work as smoothly as other timber even when smeared with grease , black-lead , or any other antiattrition application . Lignumvitae is much used in our dock-yards for sheaves ; and its application may be seen upon a grand scale , hi the beautiful blockmachinery at Portsmouth . When full grown , the largest lignumvitse trees are from forty to fifty feet in height , and from fourteen to eighteen inches in diameter . Like the other resinous trees , it contains sapwood , which is of lighter colour than the heart ; but , though not so hard , the light part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate from the other . The resin of the Iignumvita3 , Gum Guaiacwn of /z/ the shops , may be obtained by bleeding the live tree , and also by boiling the chips and sawdust of the wood . It is aromatic , slightly bitter , and prescribed in chronic rheumatisms , and other diseases . The capsules and also the bark are aperient , and used in medicine , the former being the more powerful . The lignumvitce has been reared by artificial heat in this country ; but , as it grows slowly even in the West Indies , its growth here must of course be still slower , and therefore it does not admit of being cultivated , except in botanical collections , or as a curiosity . // though armed with spines , or prickles , like the other thorns , is yet a very different genus of tree . It is a plum , though one in a state of nature , and not much regarded as fruit . It is the Primus spinosa of botanists .

The leaves have sometimes been used for tea ; and it is alleged that the " rough-flavoured teas " of cheap dealers are more indebted for their roughness to the sloe , than to any ingredient from China or elsewhere . It is also understood that the berries of the sloe enter pretty largely into the composition of much of the wine that is miscalled Port . The wood , which is very tough and hard , answers well for walking-sticks , pegs , and other small purposes . // mains ' ) is found native in many parts of this country , where it rises to the height of a considerable tree . When the soil is very rich , the fruit attains the size of a small apple , and is used in feeding hogs . The timber is hard and compact , answers remarkably well for turning , and for the working parts of machinery , while the shoots make excellent walking-sticks . Near the bottoms of the eastern slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both singly /q/ and in the hedge-rows , that produce a great deal of fruit . The sour juice of the crab , previously to the introduction of the modern methods of obtaining vegetable acids , was in considerable request under the name of verjuice. /z/ The varieties of trees of this description are almost innumerable ; and so much has been done by cultivation , grafting , inoculating , and mixing of sorts , that the knowledge of these sorts has become almost a science in itself . The original varieties and even species are lost and confounded ; and man contests with nature in the production of the varied fruits that appear in our markets , not only as respects the sorts , but as regards the times at which they are brought to market . Considered merely as timber-trees , they are much more simple . They may be divided into two classes , stone-fruits , or those that have a hard kernel enclosed in a soft pulp ; and fruits that have seeds or pips , and the pulp of a firmer consistency . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almond , which form the genus Jlmygdalus , the whole of the stone-fruits are contained in the genus Prunus , and the seeded fruits in the genus Pyrus or Mespilus . None of the genus Amygdalus are reared as timber- trees in any part of this country : it will , therefore , suffice to confine the few observations that are to be made to the others . The wood of these two genera is close and compact , and takes a good polish ; that of the wild sorts being better than that of the cultivated , and the deterioration being in proportion to the highness of the cultivation . In this they follow the general law , that selfplanted trees yield the best timber ; and , in addition to /z/ this , their powers of vegetation are exhausted by the quantity of fruit that they are , as it were , forced to bear . C/je7Tt'es , in a wild state , are very plentifully diffused , being met with in most temperate countries , and even in those that may be considered as cold . The wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sorts , of a beautiful colour , and well adapted for handles of tools . It takes a fine polish , and is not liable to split . Some of the bird cherries are beautifully veined , and have an agreeable perfume , on which account they are much used by cabinet-makers in the interior parts of the continent . None of the cherries grow to be very large trees ; but they may frequently be met with from a foot to eighteen niches in diameter at the root . Jlpricois grow wild in China , Japan , and upon many of the mountains of central Asia : the timber has some resemblance to that of the cherry ; but it is white , and not so hard . The apricot is not a native of England , and is not cultivated as a timber tree . The Wild Plum is a native of the warmer parts of Europe , though it be doubtful whether of England or not . It is sometimes found in hedges and other situations where it is not likely to have been planted , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts . The plum-tree grows to a considerable size ; the wood is close and strong ; and the bark may be used in dyeing yellow . The Pear grows to a considerable size : the wood is light , smooth , and compact ; and answers well for carving , for picture-frames , the handles of tools , and wooden spoons and dishes . The wood of the Apple is harder and weightier than that of the pear : it bears a resemblance to that of the crab , although it be not so tough and hard . In the working parts of machinery , it is very durable . The timber of the fruit-trees is not well adapted for works that are to be under water . The sap being soluble /q/ in that liquid , is soon extracted by it , and then the particles of the wood separate . The best timbers for being placed in water are those containing resins which water can not dissolve : the viscid juice of the fruit-trees is a gum , and not a resin . /z/ EVEN at a comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made use of the bright or variegated colours of wood , to give beauty both to their dwellings and their furniture . The temple built by King Soloman was overlaid on the inside with boards of cedar : " all was cedar ; there was no stone seen " ; and among the most ancient specimens of ornamental furniture that are to be met with , we find that attempts have been made to heighten the effect by the contrast of various kinds of wood . Although , both in the materials and the designs , these are inferior to the productions of modern art , many of the cabinets which are still preserved have much higher claims to notice than their mere aritiq-JHty . In all these works a veneer or thitplate of the fancy wood is laid down in glue , upon a surface of a plainer description . This process is of course cheaper than if the whole work were made of the solid fancy wood . The beauty of fancy wood arises in many sorts from its being cross-grained , or presenting the fibres endways or obliquely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as their different colours in grained woods , give a clouded and mottled variety to the surface ; and when some of the parts are partially transparent , as is the case with fine mahogany , the surface gives out a play of different tints , as the observer shifts his place , or the /z/ light falls upon them , and consequently is reflected at different angles . In the earlier stages of the art of cabinet making , and before the forests of the tropical regions had been explored for those beautiful woods which have since added so much to the elegance of modern furniture , the veneering and ornamenting were in woods of native growth . JVone of these have the deep an warm tints of the finest of the foreign ; but the figures with which they are marked are often very beautiful . The yew , which , with its other tints , blends a certain trace of pink or rose-colour , and when it is gnarled or knotty , has a very rich appearance , was the wood used for the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnut ; but as that has but few of those variegations , which are technically termed curls , the works ornamented with it were rather deficient in beauty . The knotty parts of " pollard " oaks , and " pollard " elms , are much better adapted for the purpose of ornament ; but as the grain of both is open , and as it is apt to rise , and as the earlier cabinet-makers were not so well acquainted with the art of varnishing , as those of modern times , the beauties of these woods were not turned to the proper account . When mahogany was first introduced as a cabinet timber , it seems to have been in the dark-coloured , hard , and straight-grained trees , which are now used for chairs , and other articles , in which the solid timber is preferred ; and on that account mahogany was not much used in combination with other woods . When , however , its great value was known the ease with which it can be cut , the improvement that varnish gives to its colours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the improvement which , when properly taken care of , it gains in time it was found that good mahogany was much too valuable a timber /q/ for being used solid ; and it began to be employed as the staple timber in veneering . Other foreign woods , some of them lighter and others darker , were employed for borders and ornaments : but mahogany was used for the body of the work ; and when it came to be so used , a great revolution was effected in the art of cabinet-making . On the first introduction of mahogany , the same process was resorted to , that had before been practised with the walnut and other woods , and effect was sought to be produced by quartering pannels , forming them of gyrony* of sectors , with the grain in opposite directions , and other fantastic and unnatural arrangements : but in course of time , a better taste was introduced , and the object was to make the whole surface have the same appearance as if the work had been made solid out of the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purer style ; but the continuity of the surface was still interrupted by ill-sorted additions . The breadth of the mahogany , which would in itself have been beautiful , was broken by bands and strings of other wood , without much regard to the harmony of the colours ; and thus that which , with the veneer alone , would have been chaste and classical , was reduced to a piece of patch work . The veneering , whether done in mahogany or any other wood , was at first very expensive . The veneers were cut by the hand ; and thus the piece cut off was of unequal thickness in the different parts , the wood was mangled by the operation of cutting , and the finest pieces , which , as has been said , are cross-grained , or have the fibres across their thickness , were always in danger of being broken . It had been found that veneers laid upon good bodies of timber , whether of the more coarse mahoganies , or of * A term of heraldry , in which a shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other kind , were better , in point both of beauty and of standing without warping , than solid timber ; but the cutting of the veneers by the hand was very laborious , and wasted the timber , so that , though the plan was a good one , it was expensive . When the harder and more unmanageable species of fancy woods came to be used , the difficulty and expense were further increased ; and though more beauty and variety were imparted to cabinet furniture , they were imparted at a corresponding increase of expense . Nor was it till the invention of machinery for the cutting of wood into veneers , by Mr. Brunel , that we had the full advantage of the beautiful art of veneering . The machinery used for this purpose consists of circular saws , driven by mechanical power , and they have so diminished the price of cutting veneers , that the saving is immense . Thus , those classes of the people who , not long ago , had even the favourite articles of their furniture in deal , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , now have them in maho- fany , or in some of the less common foreign woods , ndependently of their superior beauty , ( and that is a matter of more consequence than many would be disposed to allow , ) these foreign woods have the advantage of durability , both in their structure and their colours . There are few of the indigenous woods of Britain into which the worm does not eat ; and there are none of them in which the colours have not a tendency to come to the same shade , when long used , unless they are protected by varnish ; while , on the other hand , the fancy woods from the tropical countries , are generally , if not universally , proof agninst the worm in England , and they are not apt to lose their colours . Thus the introduction of machinery , for the purpose of cutting veneers , has been a material saving both in the cost and the wear of furniture , while it has enabled the workman to extend /q/ to a surface of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may meet with , and which , before the invention of that machinery , he could not have extended to as many hundreds . The value to which a single log of fine timber is turned , by means of the improved sawing machinery , is really incredible to those who have not witnessed the operation . Thus , when the cabinet-maker has occasion for veneers , he has only to purchase a log of the wood which suits his purpose , send it to the saw mill , and he has it returned cut up to the thickness that he wishes , in a very short time , and at a trifling expense . In the vicinity of London , there are several mills for the cutting of veneers ; but we do not know that there are any in more general or more constant employment than one we have had an opportunity of inspecting that of Messrs . Watson , at Battersea , which was set up , about sixteen years ago , by Mr. Brunei . Their apparatus is driven by steam , and consists of a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in diameter . One side of those saws is a plane kept perfectly true , by a strong and well bound frame-work , to the circumference of which the saw is attached . The teeth of the saw are rather large than otherwise , in order that it may not clog with the saw-dust , and thus tear the finer veneers ; and it revolves with considerable velocity . The log of timber which is to be cut into veneers is fastened upon a frame , with the piece in the direction in which it is to be cut , in a vertical position . The frame that carries forward the log is moved at a rate which may be varied according to the quality of the timber that is cut . It has a rack on the under part , in which a pinion works . In cutting coarse stuffs , such as the soft and straight grained mahogany , of which the bottoms of drawers , and other internal works of an /z/ inferior kind , are made. , the log moves forward , and the veneer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four seconds . Allowing the depth of the log to be two feet , the quantity of veneer taken off would , by one of those machines alone , be two hundred and forty square feet in an hour . Where the wood is harder , or of more value , the motion is considerably slower ; but , even then , the quantity cut by one machine , as compared with that which sawyers would cut in the same time , is , independently of the saving of wood , and the superiority of the veneers , almost incredible to any one who has not actually witnessed , the operation . The circular saw of eighteen feet diameter , at Messrs . Watson 's mill , makes thirty-two revolutions in a minute . We observed a veneer of a log of mahogany , four feet six inches long , by thirty-three inches wide , cut in eighty seconds . The smaller saw , at which inferior timber is cut , has a quicker revolution , called a tumbling motion ; and by this we noticed a veneer of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve inches wide , cut in twenty-five seconds . The quantity of veneer that can , by means of these machines , be sawed out of a given quantity of timber , is astonishing . Those who are reckoned respectable cabinet-makers do not , in general , wish to have more than eight or nine thicknesses out of the inch ; but those who manufacture furniture for occasional sale , and are in consequence indifferent as to the quality of the timber , and the durability of their work , often have the inch cut into fifteen or sixteen thicknesses . The extent to which a log cut in this last manner would extend , is wonderful . Suppose a log fifteen feet long , and three feet in each of its other dimensions , cut into fifteen thicknesses to the inch , it would be spread out to the vast expanse of about an acre and three quarters ; and , when cut for the more /q/ respectable part of the trade , it would cover nearly an acre . Now , when it is considered that the mahogany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seldom that which is the best adapted for solid work , it is easy to be conceived how much advantage must result from this invention . Veneering in fancy woods has sometimes been compared to gilding and plating , but the process does not gain by the comparison ; as the covering of one wood with another is a much nearer approach to solidity than the covering of one metal with another . While the cabinet article is kept in such a state as that the glue is not dissolved , the covering of beautiful wood does not wear out ; and thus with a vast saving in the more costly material , there is the same durability , as if nothing but that material had been used for the whole . There is another advantage in the use of fancy-woods on the surface ; the body of the article upon which the fancy wood is laid can be much better put together than if it had formed the external part of the article . Where that is the case , dovetails 6r mortices can not be wedged without an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article can be put together with every degree of care and strength , and the veneer will hide the whole . The slightest observation of the domestic life of the middle and humbler classes will shew that , within the last thirty years , there has been a manifest improvement in the appearance of the household furniture of this country . A century ago , even in the mansions of the rich , though there was occasional luxury both in the materials and the forms ol their furniture , much of it was mean and ill-fashioned . There were , indeed , splendid cabinets , to be exhibited at seasons of festivity , filled with rare porcelain and laden with costly plate ; but the table for ordi- VOL. ir . 1.5* /z/ jf- nary use was of rough unpolished oak , and the chairs were equally plain and unornamental . The Windsor chair , made of elm , and a heavy deal table , were generally found in the tradesman 's parlour , even up to a somewhat recent period . The general introduction of mahogany , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( principally in consequence of the extreme thinness into which veneers can be cut , ) have introduced a more elegant description of furniture even into the commonest houses . In this , there is a national benefit . A taste for comforts and elegancies , universally diffused throughout society , not only calls into action a great deal of mechanical ingenuity , and employs considerable capital , but it gives even to the humblest a sort of self-respect , interior , indeed , to purer motives , but still operating to produce something of independence , and a desire to maintain the possession of these comforts and trifling distinctions , by honest industry . But the general adoption of articles of luxury , such as well-made furniture , by the bulk of the people , has a natural tendency to make the wealthy desirous of procuring articles not so accessible to the many ; and , in this way , there is a constant demand not only for new patterns in furniture , but for new materials of which such furniture should be made . Our commerce with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce new sorts ; and even our native timber , such as oak and elm , by the ingenuity of the workman , has been converted into the most beautiful and the most expensive of the articles of common use by which the rich are surrounded . The large roots of a fine oak have , in this manner , been rendered extremely valuable ; and , when cut into small veneers , and inlaid with that skill which constitutes the art of the cabinet-maker , have produced very high prices /q/ when manufactured into tables . Mechanical skill converts the commonest materials into articles of high price ; and this is one of the best directions which can be given to the luxury of an age . Mahogany is of universal use for furniture , from the common tables of a village inn to the splendid cabinets of a regal palace . But the general adoption of this wood renders a nice selection necessary for those articles which are costly and fishiona le The extensive manufacture of piano-fort ss has much increased the demand for mahogany . This musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of any other part of Europe ; and English pianofortes are largely exported . The beauty of the case forms a point of great importance to the manufacturer . This circumstance adds nothing , of course , to the intrinsic value of the instrument ; but it is of consequence to the maker , in giving an adventitious quality to the article in which he deals Spanish mahogany is decidedly the most beautiful ; but occasionally , yet not very often , the Honduras wood is of singular brilliancy ; and it is then eagerly sought for , to be employed in the most expensive cabinet-work . A short time ago , Messrs . Broadwood , who have long been distinguished as makers of piano-fortes , gave the enormous sum of three thousand pounds ibr three logs of mahogany . These logs , the produce of one tree , were each about fifteen feet long and thirty-eight inches wide . They were cut into veneers of eight to an inch . The wood , of which we have seen a specimen , was peculiarly beautiful , capable of receiving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in the most varied manner , like the surface of a crystal ; and , from the wavy form of the fibres , offering a different figure in whatever direction it was viewed . A new species of mahogany has been lately introduced in /z/ cabinet-work , which is commonly called Gambia . As its name imports , it comes from Africa . It is of a beautiful colour , but does not retain it so long as the Spanish and Honduras woods . One of the peculiar excellences which is sought for by cabinetmakers , consists in what they call the curl the direction which the darker parts take in the grain of the wood . But the dealers , although they introduce an auger before they buy a log , are seldom enabled to determine , with much exactness , the quality of the timber . Although mahogany has been so long known in commerce , there is little correspondence between those who export the timber and those who purchase it in this country ; and thus it is generally a matter of chance whether the manufacturer may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which procured such a large price as Messrs . Broadwood gave for them , were particularly celebrated , and were brought to this country with a knowledge of their worth . The wood most in use for cabinet-work , next to mahogany , is Rose-wood . The name of this species of wood is derived from its fragrance ; and it has long been known to the cabinet makers of England and France . It was first introduced , it is said , from the isle of Cyprus ; though the great supply now comes from Brazil . The width of the logs imported into this country averages twenty-two inches , so that it must be the produce of a considerable tree . The wood is too well known to require any description . The more distinct the darker parts are from the purple-red , which forms the ground , the more is the wood esteemed . It is ordinarily cut into veneers of nine to an inch ; and is employed in this way for all the larger furniture , such as tables ; but solid for the legs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for small cabinetworks , /q/ and for borderings to those which are larger . It is extremely hard . The tree which produces it is small , as the sticks are seldom brought to this country more than five inches wide and four feet long . Its colour is of a chocolate ground , with black veins ; sometimes running into the finest lines , and at others more spread over the ground , as in rose-wood . The botanical name of the tree which produces this wood , is not known . It comes from Brazil . And here we should remark the exceedingly imperfect state of our knowledge with regard to the species of trees which produce the Fancy-woods , so extensively used in cabinet-work in this country . It might be supposed that there would be no more diffi culty in determining the botanical names , and deciding the species of those foreign woods which are used in our finer sorts of furniture , and in many small articles of taste , such as Tunbridge-ware , than in pointing out that oak is used in ship-building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary is the fact . The attention of botanists who have described the productions of South America and Australasia , from which these fine woods come , has not been directed to this point ; and the commercial dealers in these woods have paid no regard to it . It would be well , in this age when natural history is so much cultivated , if naturalists , and dealers in foreign timber , would combine their experience upon this subject , and supply the deficiency . No knowledge of the matter can be procured in books ; and we have consulted commercial men , and practical botanists , without obtaining any information that could be depended upon , though each agreed in lamenting that a subject of general interest should have been left so entirely without investigation . Although no important results to science might pro ceed from such inquiries , it is certainly humiliating /z/ not to be able to tell with precision where those materials are naturally produced , and what species of trees produce them , with which the useful arts have surrounded our every-day life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the larger woods are employed , is intensely hard and extremely heavy . Its colour is of a pale red , not so clouded as mahogany . The timber arrives in this country in logs of about nine feet long by thirteen or fourteen inches wide . The tree which produces it is not known in botanical description , but it is a native of New Holland . Tulip-wood would appear to be the produce of a tree little exceeding the character of a shrub , for it arrives here in sticks of about five inches diameter , seldom more than four feet in length . It is very hard , and of a clouded red and yellow colour . Its principal use is in bordering ; though it is employed in smaller articles , such as caddies and ladies ' worktables . Zebra-wood is the produce of a large tree , and we receive it in logs of two feet wide . It is a cheap wood , and is employed in large work , as tables . The colour is somewhat gaudy , being composed of brown on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly contrasted , as its name imports , derived , as it is , from the colours of the zebra . Coromandd-wood is used in large works , like zebra and rose wood . It is inferior to rose-wood in the brilliancy and division of its colours , having a dingy ground , and sometimes running into white streaks . The tree which produces it is of a large size . Satin-wood is well known for its brilliant yellow colour , with delicate glowing shades . It is now not much used in cabinet-work . The timber arrives here in logs of two feet wide , and seven or eight feet long . /q/ Sandal-wood is of a light brown colour , with brilliant waves of a golden hue , not unlike the finest Honduras mahogany . It is about the same size as satin-wood . Jlmboyna-wood is now very much used in cabinetwork . It is of various colours ; and the shades are generally small . It arrives in logs of two feet wide . Snakewood is extremely hard , of a deep red colour , with black shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harewood something resembles satin-wood in the arrangement of its waves , but its colour is different , being of a light brown ground . Botany Bay Oak forms very beautiful furniture . The ground is an uniform brown , with large dark blotches . Ebomj has been already described . Of the several cabinet-makers ' woods bearing this name , there are the African cliff ebony , which is black , with a white spot ; and the spotted ebony , a very beautiful wood , and extremely hard ( more so than the common ebony ) , of which the ground is black , with brown and yellow spots . Jicker-wood is the produce of a large tree , and is of a cinnamon colour . Canary-wood is of a golden yellow . Purple-wood , which has been lately introduced , is of a purple colour , without veins . This appears to be the produce of a thorn of tropical countries , being only four inches wide . These three woods have been little used in furniture , but have been lately employed in mosaic floors , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the Buckingham Palace . Bird's-eye Maple , ( its appearance is described in its name , ) which has also been so employed , is a narrow and long , wood . Calamandcr wood . There is a very beautiful wood of this name growing in the island of Ceylon , which , when wrought into furniture , surpasses , we /z/ think , in appearance any other we ever saw . We are surprised that it is not regularly imported into this country : all that is here has been brought over by private gentlemen , returning from that colony , for their own use . The wood is very hard and heavy , and of singularly remarkable variety and admixture of colours . It is very difficult to describe this nay impossible to convey to those who have not seen it an idea of the manner in which the shades run into one another . The most prevailing of these is a fine chocolate colour , now deepening almost into absolute black , now fading into a medium between fawn and cream colours . In some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking , though never quite hi sudden contrast with the richest shades of the brown . The variations are sometimes displayed in clustering mottles , sometimes in the most graceful streaks . There is not , however , anything in the least gaudy or fantastic in the general result . It certainly arrests the eye but it is from the rich beauty of the intermingled colours , not from any undue shewiness . This wood takes a very high polish . It is wrought into chairs , and particularly , into tables . Nay , we have seen large folding doors made of it . The late Governor of Ceylon , Sir Robert Brownrigg , brought over very large quantities of this remarkable product of that country ; and , in some additions he has made to his house hi Monmouthshire , he has had the doors of his dining room constructed of calamander . The effect is peculiarly happy . We are told that the tree grows to the usual size of a forest-tree , and that the leaves are large , and shaped like the figure of a club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw the tree growing but once , and that he speaks from an imperfect recollection . Partridge , Leopard , and Porcupine woods , are very rarely used . Their names are derived from a /q/ /z/ supposed similarity of their colours to those of the animals whose denominations they bear . A return of the Custpm-house duties for 1827 , ordered by the House of Commons to be printed , on the 16th of April , 1829 , gives some data for ascertaining the quantities of ornamental wood imported into the . United Kingdom during 1827 . In some instances , however , the quantity can not be ascertained from the return , as the duty is different when the import is from different places . Mahogany . The duty on mahogany is stated at 68,730/. , being at the rate of 2/. 10s. from Honduras and the Bahamas ; 41. from Jamaica ; and 71. from other places . Now , taking the average duty at 4/. , which is not very far from the truth , that makes the whole quantity of mahogany imported in 1827 amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would load fifteen line of battle ships . Rosewood is subjected to a duty of 101. per ton ; and the duty upon it was 7280J. for 1827 , which makes the quantity seven hundred and twenty-eight tons , trifling as compared with the quantity of mahogany , but still very considerable . Zebra ' is classed with king wood , and some of the other ornamental kinds that come from Brazil , though the duties be different , 2/. per ton on the Zebra , and 51. on the others . The duty on these woods is 630/. , and , taking the average , the quantity may be about two hundred tons . Box pays a duty of 1 1 . from British plantations , and 51. from other places . The duty for 1827 was 2180/. , and the quantity about eight hundred tons . Ebony . The quantity of ebony can not be ascertained , or even approximated from the return , as the duty upon what is called ebony , varies from 31. to 10/. per ton ; the total duty was about 170/ . VOL. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of timber compared with each other have been mentioned in the individual notices , little else will be necessary here than a mere catalogue of some of the leading properties . Oak is best on soils where it is the longest in coming to maturity ; and when two specimens are equally seasoned , their value may be ascertained by trying which , bulk for bulk , is the heavier ; or by soaking them in water till they can contain no more , ( and one very effectual way of doing this is by fixing a disc of oak cut across the grain , in a cylindrical jar containing a quantity of water from the top , and exhausting the lower part of the jar by an air-pump ) ; and the one which is the heaviest in the dry way , or has its weight the least increased by the water , is the best . If an oak be dead at the main top , the centre of the tree is sure to be in a state either of actual or of incipient decay ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where durability or strength is required . The same holds true of all deciduous trees evergreens are not so liable to be hollow , though many of them become so in the course of a very long time . An oak , or indeed almost any other tree that grows singly , or on the outside of the forest , is always more firm and durable than one which grows within the forest , and is partially sheltered ; and the more variable the climate is , not so much with regard to seasons as to shorter periods , the timber is the more /q/ firm and durable . An oak which stands alone on a hill side , exposed to the variable weather of Britain , will , as timber , outlast two from the thick forests of Germany , or three from North America , where the summer is intensely hot , and without a cloud for many weeks together . Trees which are to be used as timber , should be felled in the early part of the winter when the sap is at rest ; because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to bleed , by which the durability of the timber is diminished . This applies to pines as well as to deciduous trees ; for though they and other evergreens retain their leaves during the winter months , they do not vegetate at that season . On account of the value of the bark , however , which can not well be removed from winter-felled trees , there is a great temptation to fell oaks in the early part of the summer . In coppices , or hags , where the bark is the principal object , and the wood is to be used for charcoal or for common purposes , there is of course no harm in cutting down during the season of vegetation ; but a summer-felled oak ought never to be introduced into a ship , or into the timbers of a valuable permanent building . Oak grown on damp situations decays much sooner than that which grows on dry , and the decay is from the outside gradually to the centre . This , however , is to be understood of timber which has been felled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timber rots first at the centre . Oak is best seasoned in water , or rather in water and in air alternately , taking care not to expose it so to the sun during the dryings as that it shall champ and split . A large beam of oak ought to soak for at least twelve months , but half that time will do for planks . It is often the practice to season planks by boiling and steaming ; and when they have to be /z/ curved or twisted , as in the bends of a ship , steaming is indispensable ; but the heat and moisture together always weaken that constituent principle of the timber upon which its strength and durability in a great measure depend . Ash is a bad timber for any purpose in building , whether for dry or aquatic purposes , because it neither stands moisture nor the weather . Beech also is a bad timber for building , though when wholly under water it is durable . Elm is quite unfit for building , because of its tendency to warp and shrink with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinder water , it answers well ; and bolts and nails drive better into it than into any other timber . Beech and elm answer remarkably well for the external or lower keels of ships , and also for the planks nearest the keel , as these are seldom exposed to the air : the same qualities fit them for being used as piles in the construction of bridges and harbours ; though they should never be used above the low water mark . The different species of poplar , the sycamore , the lime , and the birch are , generally speaking , unfit for building , being neither strong nor durable ; birch is indeed very tough , but it is more subject to worm than almost any other timber , and moisture soon rots it . Lime , however , is much the best timber for carving , and poplar answers very well for the boardings of stairs . The properties of chesnut have already been pretty extensively mentioned . It is probably the best of the building timbers , though it has been unaccountably neglected in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the finest specimens of ancient carpentry , both in scientific construction , and in tasteful execution , are made of it . When old , it is not very easily distinguished from /q/ oak , but its colour is finer , and it does not stain by the contact of iron , which is always the case with oak when moisture gets access to it . Mahogany is too costly and too ponderous for its strength , to be used as a building timber . But , when well seasoned , it warps and shrinks less by the heat of the sun than any other wood ; and therefore it is the best timber for sign-boards . It is also excellent for doors and window-frames , but too expensive for ordinary occasions . The Bay wood from the main land of America , and the Spanish wood from the islands chiefly from Cuba ami Hayti , and formerly from Jamaica also are easily distinguished , before they are oiled and varnished . The pores of bay wood are dark coloured ; those of Spanish seem filled with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has some advantages over oak for the purposes of common building : it is lighter , far more elastic , more easily worked , straighter , and of much greater length . The best that comes in the form of deals is from Christiania arm Frederickstadt , chiefly on account of the vast superiority of the saw-mills there . The fir of Norway has also been long celebrated for masts ; and though more weighty , it is far more durable than that obtained from America . /z/ The structures in which timber has been employed , which have been , or are , the most remarkable for their magnitude and utility , are roofs of buildings , bridges and piers , light-houses , and ships . For all of these , timber appears to have been principally used before the introduction of any other material , in every . place where it could be obtained : and , notwithstanding the use of stone pretty generally for piers , and since the invention of the arch , /z/ often for bridges , and occasionally for roofs , and the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden structures are met with in all countries , of vast dimensions , and often of great strength and beauty . ROOFS , &c.; In modern roofing , the timbers of the roof are generally hid by a ceiling , so that strength only is attended to ; while in more ancient times , the timber itself was made at once both ornamental and useful : and in very large apartments , such as the banqueting halls of the kings and barons of the middle ages , it had the advantage in point both of grandeur and apparent stability . An extended flat ceiling appears to hang in the air ; while in an ancient roof , like that of Westminster-hall , the support of every piece of timber is apparent , and the only strain which appears directly across the timber , is on the boards and rafters between the great trusses . Westminster-hall is the largest roof of the ancient construction , any where to be met with ; and it is difficult to imagine a work of human art which possesses , in so equal a degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This hall was built by William II . ( Rufus ) , in the year 1097 ; it was originally intended as a banqueting hall ; and the monarch is said to have held a magnificent feast in it on the Whitsuntide after its erection . Stowe adds , that ample as are the dimensions of the hall , it did not satisfy the ambition of the king , who observed , " This halle is not bigge enough by one half , and is but a bed-chamber in comparison of that I minde to make . " And Stowe adds , " a diligent searcher might yet find out the foundation of the hall , which he hadde proposed to build , stretching from the river Thames even to the common highway . " All traces /q/ of this are of course now obliterated , and the existing hall is left without even an intended rival . It is two hundred and seventy-five feet long , and seventyfour feet wide ; and , though the original proportions have been a little deranged by the raising of the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river downwards , probably the deposition of silt in the bed of the river , and certainly the erection of London Bridge , ( about one hundred years afterwards , ) caused the old floor to be overflowed during floods , - it is still a graceful structure . The roof of Westminster-hall is formed of chesnut , and does not appear to be in the least decayed . This great hall was , however , enlarged , and had its present roof constructed , in the time of Richard II. , who , in the profusion of that expenditure which led to Wat Tyler 's insurrection , is reported to have feasted ten thousand guests under this roof . Westminster-hall is now set apart for the most solemn state purposes , such as the trial of persons impeached by the Commons ; and banquets at the coronations of kings . ; The Parliament-house in Edinburgh , though a much smaller and more recent structure than Westminster-hall , has also a fine roof of the ancient description . The Parliament-house is one hundred and twenty-two feet in length , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the year 1640 ; it was built at an expense of 1600/. , by the corporation of Edinburgh ; and is used partly as an ante-room to the courts of justice , and partly as a place of resort for the inhabitants . The trusses and roof , generally speaking , are of oak ; they have not the massive grandeur of those in Westminster-hall , and . the effect is injudiciously broken by gilding. /z/ In many places there are still roofs of this construction , though few of the dimensions of that at Edinburgh , and none equal to Westminster-hall . Wherever these roofs are found , they are built not only of the best sorts of timber , but of timber very superior of its kind . In Scotland , they are generally of oak ; and the oak of that country , before it was cut ' down almost to extermination in the lowland countries , was very compact and durable . In England , several are of chesnut , and some , we believe , of walnut tree ; both of which are , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose . The Riding-house at Moscow has the largest roof of a modern construction , and probably occupies the largest area that ever was covered by a single roof , unsupported by cross walls , or pillars . The length is one thousand nine hundred and twenty feet , and the span of the roof two hundred and thirty-five ; the floor has the vast extent of more than ten English acres . This enormous roof was supported by a ponderous rib of timber , of a curved form , and made up of three smaller ones , strongly bolted and strapped with iron . The tie-beam by which this immense rib was prevented from separating at the extremities , consisted of seven lengths of the largest timber , and the whole truss thus formed was stiffened by cross-pieces and strutts . The weight was so great , however , that the tie-beam swagged , or bent downwards , until the whole truss had the appearance of two curves joined at their extremities . This roof was constructed under the auspices of the Emperor Paul , then Grand Duke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof of the Theatre at Oxford , is seventy feet , and the length eighty ; but /q/ the durability has not been corresponding ; forthe roof had to be replaced in 1802 . The original architect was Sir Christopher Wren ; and the roofing was long considered as a masterpiece of carpentry . The Basilica of St.Paul at Rome has a roof of large dimensions , the span being more than seventy-eight feet . It is framed of fir . The trusses are double , and placed about fifteen inches asunder , which gives it probably more stability , than if they were strapped and bound into single masses . The Theatre d'Jlrgentino , also in Rome , is of still larger dimensions , the span of the roof being more than eighty feet . This roof is also of fir , and supports the weight of the whole machinery of the theatre . The number of roofs of large span that have recently been constructed , is very considerable . Perhaps one of the strongest is that of Drury Lane theatre , which has a span of eighty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusses of this roof are fifteen feet apart , and they are so judiciously constructed , that each truss can bear a load of three hundred tons . The roof of the chapel at Greenwich Hospital , constructed by Mr. Wyatt , is one of the finest specimens , and perhaps contains less superfluous timber than most of the others of the same span and carrying the same weight . A new roof put upon the church of St. Paul , Covent Garden , in 1796 , also shews the progress of modern art in this very important department of carpentry . The trusses are as strong as those in the original roof , contrived by Inigo Jones , and yet each of them contains eighty cubic feet less timber . Indeed , in no one department of the arts , has the application of scientific principles tended more to lessen the quantity of materials , than in the construction of large roofs ; and this has a treble /z/ advantage , as it lessens the cost of the roof itself , its pressure upon the walls , and its tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber in the chief construction of houses is well known . Some of those in England and Wales , that are framed with oak beams , and filled with bricks or plaster , are both strong and handsome . In Switzerland , the houses constructed of larch last for many ages . Wooden houses are very common in America ; and in the pine countries of Europe they are almost universal , except for palaces and public buildings . In the interior of Russia , ready-made houses are sold at the fairs . They are carried to the fair , and there set up ; and when the purchaser has selected one to his mind , it is taken to pieces and removed to the situation destined for it . One of the most remarkable wooden houses in England was the Nonsuch-house at the north entrance of London-bridge . It occupied two piers with the interverning arch ; and was fantastically hatched and carved , with projecting towers at the angles and ' over the gateways , finished with cupolas at the top . This singular structure overhung the river both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , it was abundantly grotesque . The Nonsuch-house was imported ready made from Holland . It was wholly of timber , even to the fastenings , which were wooden pegs there not being a nail in the whole structure . /z/ Wooden Bridges have been resorted to in all ages ; and wherever there are trees to be found , bridges formed of them are also to be met with , from the simple log or trunk thrown across a mountain torrent , to some of the most scientific and tasteful structures that art has produced . In Sweden and Norway , /q/ where the ravines are often very deep , where the rivers and torrents are apt to swell high and rapidly during rain , and where timber is abundant and costs little , wooden bridges of considerable extent are frequently to be found . Some of these , in consequence of the wild rocks upon which they are made , the large dimensions of the undressed trees , and their great height above the water , have a very striking appearance . The following description of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our arrival at Skale , the noise of roaring waters again announced the vicinity of a cataract . We were in the midst of a gloomy forest ; but all at once , the dark scenery of the surrounding woods opened upon such a view of the Ljusna , as no pen can describe : it burst upon us in all its terrific grandeur ; the whole tide collected from all its tributary lakes and rivers , throughout its course from the Norwegian Alps , in one vast torrent , clamourously foaming and rushing to the Bothnian Gulph . A bridge , constructed of whole trunks of fir-trees , divested only of their bark , stretched across this furious torrent , to the distance of one hundred yards ; presenting one of the most picturesque objects imaginable . Above this bridge , the river is a quarter of a mile broad ; and , growing wider as it recedes from the eye of a person here placed , it is distantly divided by promontories , projecting from its sides until they almost meet , and covered with tall trees ; thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally beautiful , beyond them ; and which appear more remotely terminated by a ridge of mountains , closing the prospect . But , in this amazing spectacle , all is freshness and animation ; the utmost liveliness , and light and elegance , exhibited by th distant sheets of water , combined with all the energy and tremendous force of the cataract , /z/ making the bridge upon which the spectator stands shake under his feet , as if it were rocked by an earthquake . " The bridge of Schaffhausen , across the Rhine at the town of Schaffhausen , was one of the most celebrated of wooden bridges ; and the celebrity was the greater , on account of the architect being an illiterate man , who was not likely to have derived much profit from the works that had been written upon the subject . This architect was Ulric Grubenman . The construction of the SchafThausen bridge was his first effort ; but he was afterwards employed in various other structures of the same description . The width of the Rhine at Schaffhausen is three hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrown into the form of a single arch , although a pier in the centre of the river divided the water-way into two parts , and also afforded material support to the structure . In this bridge there are regular uprights about seventeen feet and a half apart , and they were crossed by braces resting on the abutments , and inclining towards the centre of the bridge . There were also braces radiating from the central pier , some of them below the roadway , extending to thirty-five feet on each side , and others above . The whole bridge was covered by a ponderous roof . The principal beams in the roadway were joggled throughout the whole length with indentures , like the teeth of two sets of saws , and they were tightened by wedges at each of the cross faces . There were also iron ties from the beam that formed the eaves of the roof , to the principal beam of the floor , which tended to stiffen the bridge for about a fourth part at each extremity of each of the divisions . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the*whole of it evinced a very considerable and even uncommon /q/ degree of skill , in balancing strains against each other , so as to insure both steadiness and strength . The principal fault in this celebrated bridge consisted hi many of the timbers being of great length , so as not to admit of being easily replaced in case of decay . It was burned down by the French army in the year 1799 ; and has since been replaced by a more simple wooden bridge , in which the water-way is divided into three parts by two piers , and the road is said to be wider and more convenient . Several other wooden bridges were constructed by Ulric Grubenman , by his brother John , or by the two together . Of these , John built a bridge over the Rhine , near Richenau , of two hundred and forty feet span ; and the two brothers erected another of two hundred feet across the Limmat , near Baden . Both these bridges resembled , in their general framing , the bridge at Schaffhausen . Ulric , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty feet span . In this bridge there were no diverging braces . The abutments were twenty-five feet high , and the arch between them was a catenary , that is , the same form which a rope or flexible chain assumes by its own weight , when hung over two fixed pegs . This arch was of course inverted , in the same manner as the iron chain bridges that have recently been constructed in this country ; and making allowance for the difference of materials , and the mode of the junction , it may be fair perhaps to consider it as the first chain bridge that ever was constructed in Europe . The two catenarian arches from which the roadway was suspended were formed of beams of oak , in lengths of from twelve to fourteen feet ; there were seven thicknesses of them above each other , and they were so contrived as to break bond like masonry , so that there should never be two vertical joints in the same section , and they were strongly bolted and bonded together . Probably for /q/ /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a wooden bridge , since the descending catenary ha much less vibration than a rising arch , and since any one piece , as it decayed , may be removed and replaced , without injury to the structure . Some wooden bridges of very superior construction have been erected in Scotland , by Mr. James Burn , of Haddington : one of these is across the river Don , about seven miles from the city of Aberdeen , and on the road leading to Banff . This bridge consists of a single arch of nearly one hundred and ten feet span , and something more than thirty feet rise . The supporting part of it is formed of a series of frames , each set being made double , or at about four inches from each other , and of short lengths of timber , so that any piece of a frame , or even a whole frame , may be removed , when repairs are necessary , without endangering the bridge or interrupting the roadway . They are kept from lateral vibration , by transverse struts and ties under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished with gravel . Another bridge by the same artist , and across the same river , at a shorter distance from Aberdeen , consists of two arches , each nearly seventytwo feet in span , and having a rise of only ten feet and a half . Mr. Burn has also constructed a very handsome wooden bridge across the South Esk , in the park at Brechin castle ; it consists of three arches , the middle one thirty-eight feet span , with a rise of only ten feet . This bridge has the spandrils boarded and drawn out , and sanded in imitation of stone , so that , until closely examined , it has the appearance of a stone bridge of a very light and handsome construction . Those bridges by Mr. Bum possess a peculiar advantage , in the shortness of the timber of which the framing is composed . This gives them greater stiffness with a less scantling ; /q/ and thus , while they are equally strong with weightier bridges of long timber , they are not so apt to loosen at the abutments by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less hazard and at much less expense . It is rather singular that the wooden bridges on the river Thames , in the near vicinity of the British metropolis , are at once the most clumsy and the most totally destitute of any thing like scientific principle in their construction . The bridges that we more immediately allude to are those at Chelsea , or , as it is now called , Battersea , and Fulham . Fulham bridge is the more ancient structure ; and that it should be destitute of even the least display of constructive skill , is the more singular , considering the mechanical talents of the designer . It was contrived by Cheselden , the eminent surgeon and anatomist , who was , perhaps , the first Englishman that wrote scientifically and at the same time intelligibly , on the mechanics and statics of the human body ; and yet there is not one principle in his bridge , except the mere inert strength of the timber . The length of this bridge is seven hundred and eighty-nine feet , and the breadth twenty-four ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly possible to imagine a more clumsy and tasteless structure , or one ( constructed of wood ) that could offer more interruption to the navigation of the river , or suffer more itself from the action of the ice in severe winters ; nor is there the least doubt that if the learned contriver had but bestowed on it a tenth part of the mechanical skill displayed by the unlettered Ulric Grubenman , in the bridge of Schaffhausen , an elegant structure of three or four arches might have been formed , of little more than half the timber , which would have been at once far more convenient for the navigation , and not have cost half the sum in repairs . The /z/ bridge at Battersea is not much better , though it be a comparatively recent erection . Fulham bridge was completed in 1729 ; and that at Battersea in 1772 ; and though the piers of the latter do not obstruct the navigation quite so absurdly as those at Fulham , in consequence of their being parallel to the current , while those at Fulham stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally destitute of taste in its appearance , and science in its construction , as the other , though it was erected in a comparatively advanced age , and under the sanction of an act of parliament . There is , in fact , little more knowledge of the principles of carpentry , even the very simplest ones , displayed in those bridges , than in the bridges which the beavers are said to build in the vicinity of Hudson 's Bay , by cutting a tree with their teeth , and contriving that it shall fall across the river . That they should be tolerated so near a metropolis in which there are stone bridges like the Waterloo and the New London , and iron ones like the Southwark and Vauxhall , would seem a little singular , if it were not borne in mind that they are private property . Timber is not only useful in forming the materials of bridges , where the circumstances or the expense will not admit of stone or iron , but it is essential for the construction of stone bridges themselves . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the formation of coffer-dams , by means of which the foundations of the piers , or rather the places where they are to be founded , are cleared of water ; secondly , when the soil is not of sufficient consistency to afford a firm foundation , piles of timber are driven into it ; and , thirdly , centerings of timber are constructed , upon which the whole weight of the arch can be borne , until the key-stones are driven into their places , which centerings can then be removed with comparatively little labour . /q/ The driving of the piles is in some degree a simple matter ; though there be a good deal of ingenuity in the engines by which they are driven , and some judgment necessary in order to ascertain that the piling is equally firm throughout the whole foundation : because if one pier , or portion of a pier , were to settle down much more than the others , the beauty of the superstructure would be spoiled , and its stability would be endangered . The other uses of timber in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of much more ingenuity , and are perhaps among the happiest applications of timber ; as without them no stone bridge could be constructed . Coffer-dams are certainly the best means of getting a foundation for the piers of bridges in a river . Two circles of piles are driven into the bed of the river , round the part intended for the foundation of the pier , and the external surfaces being planked , the space between the two circles is filled up with clay . The whole is made water-tight ; and the inner water being removed , the foundation is laid as for any other building . Sometimes a different mode is resorted to : the pier is built to a certain height , the surface of the water in a running river , and the low water mark , at least in a tideway , ' in a caisson , or case composed of a strong bottom and sides of timber . These are made water-tight , sunk at first partly by water , and partly by a portion of the materials ; and by pumping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that work is continued until it be brought above the surface ; then the sides of the caisson are removed while the bottom or platform remains , and becomes the foundation of the pier . In order that building in a caisson may be secure , two circumstances are essential : first , that the platform shall be constructed of the kind and quality of timber least liable to decay in water ; and , secondly , that the bottom on which it /z/ is laid shall be of a firm consistency , levelled throughout , and not liable to be washed or scoured away by currents . Westminster Bridge is an example of founding in caissons ; and some of the piers of it are already undermined by scouring , a danger which will increase when the removal of old London Bridge admits of a more rapid current , and consequently a greater scouring in the river . But though the foundations of Westminster Bridge are thus scarcely deep and secure enough , there is much excellence , as well as ingenuity , in the structure ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able engineer of it , did not publish his plans , as the science of bridge-building might have derived much advantage from a complete knowledge of the principles upon which he worked . Blackfriars Bridge is another instance of building in caissons ; only Mr. Mylne , the engineer of that work , took the precaution of piling round the foundations . Old London Bridge is under still greater obligations to timber than any of those that have been mentioned ; being founded wholly on piles , the tops of which are as high as the low water mark , and thus neither caissons nor coffer-dams were necessary . Those piles are of various timbers , but chiefly of oak and elm , oak being most abundant in the more ancient part of the structure . They have stood uncommonly well ; for though the sap wood had decayed , those which were recently taken up , even in the most ancient parts of the foundations , which had probably remained in water for about six hundred years , were undecayed in the central parts . Foundations in coffer-dams are accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally adopted in large works . From the depth of water , the size of the piers , and the great weight they have /q/ to support , the new London Bridge is probably one of the greatest , and certainly one of the most successful instances of founding in coffer-dams . For this work , the dams were made in the form of ellipses , consisting of three rows of piles , dressed in the joints , but without grooving , which is found not to answer very well , more especially with such a depth , and in so rapid a current . Some of those piles were of the immense length of eighty or ninety feet ; and yet they were driven and puddled with clay between the rows so accurately , that , all things considered , the leakage was very trifling . /z/ Ships of large dimensions have been constructed in all ages . Some of the war gallies of the ancients are represented as being hardly inferior in dimensions to first rate line of battle ships of the present day . The largest masses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those constructed by Mr. Wood of Port Glasgow , in the Isle of Orleans , in the gulph of St. Lawrence . The first of these , the Columbus , was three hundred feet long on the deck , fifty feet seven inches broad amidships , and twenty-nine feet and a half deep in the hold . She was flat bottomed , and wall-sided , or had the sides nearly perpendicular , and the stern post with little or no inclination . The admeasured register of the Columbus was about three thousand six hundred and ninety tons ; and her actual tonnage not much less than five thousand . She had four masts , the largest of which , however , was hardly equal to that of a seventy-four . She came to England with a cargo of timber in 1825 , and arrived safely in the Thames ; but went to pieces on her voyage outwards , owing , as is generally alleged , to the pilot committing some error , or not being accustomed to conduct a mass so /z/ enormous through the hazards of the narrow seas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baron of Renfrew , a vessel of equal , if not of larger , dimensions , seem to have established the fact , that notwithstanding the greatest attention to strength in their construction , there is a limit in size beyond which , if vessels are attempted to be carried , they are neither profitable nor safe . /z/ One of the most celebrated instances of the application of timber , in the construction of a light-house , was that by Mr. Rudyerd , upon the rock of Eddystone , where Smeaton 's magnificent stone edifice now stands . The engineer of this celebrated but illfated structure had not been bred to the profession , for he was a silk - mercer upon Ludgate-hill ; but he seems to have been a man of the greatest talents for carpentry ; and we have the evidence of Smeaton , that , " he directed the performance in a masterly manner . " Before this time , a light-house had been built on the same situation , by Mr. Henry Winstanley , which was completed in 1699 ; but which disappeared with its engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26th of November , 1703 . That 26th of November was the most dreadful storm ever experienced in the British seas ; and the damage that it did , both at sea and on land , has not a parallel in the annals of the country ; so that , although Mr. Winstanley 's light-house was torn from the rock , and it seems to have been so torn in one mass , it does not thence follow that it was a structure of inferior strength , because no subsequent structure has had to abide a trial so severe . What added to the public regret upon that melancholy occasion , was the fact that Mr. Winstanley had erected the light-house at his own expense . APPLICATIONS OF TIMBER . 2Ctt Rudyerd saw and avoided the errors of Winstanley 's structure ; that was a polygon , Rudyerd made the plan of his a circle ; there were projecting ornaments at the top of Winstanley 's , Rudyerd 's was entirely plain . Rudyerd 's structure may be considered as altogether a piece of carpentry ; for the several courses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and served little other purpose than that of keeping the structure firm by their weight , which was about two hundred and seventy tons . The main column of Rudyerd 's building consisted of one simple figure , being an elegant frustrum of a cone , unbroken by any projecting ornaments , or anything on which the violence of the storms could lay hold ; measuring , exclusively of its sloping foundation , twenty-two feet eight inches diameter , on its largest circular base ; sixty-one feet in height above that circular base ; and fourteen feet three inches diameter at the top ; so that the circular base was somewhat greater than one-third of the total height , and the diameter at the top was less than two-thirds of the base at the greatest circle . On the flat roof of this main column , as a platform , Mr. Rudyerd fixed his lantern , which was an octagon of ten feet six inches diameter externally . The mean height of the window-frames of the lantern , above the balcony floor , was nearly nine feet ; so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the base was seventy feet . This structure was completed in three years ; the light being first exhibited on the 28th of July , 1708 ; and the work was perfected the following year . Notwithstanding that this edifice was of timber , and exposed to the most violent swells and storms that can well be imagined , it appears , that , in consequence ot the simplicity of its form , the skill vv ith which it was framed and fastened to the rock the base , naturally shelving , having been worked to a series /z/ of horizontal steps or terraces , it would have defied the ocean and the atmosphere for many centuries , with only a moderate degree of repair . In the year 1744 , a number of the upright timbers were broken , but they were soon replaced by Mr. Jessop , ( father of the late eminent engineer of that name , ) who then had the charge of it . From this time till the year 1755 , Rudyerd 's light-house sustained no particular injury ; but in that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be so well expressed as in the words of the celebrated Smeaton , the engineer of the stone light-house . The present erection , considering the difference of the materials , may be considered as a parallel chef-tfczuvre with that of Rudyerd . " On the 22d of August , 1755 , " says Smeaton , " the workmen returned on shore , having finished all necessary repairs of that season ; between which time and the 2d of December following , the attending boat had been off several times to the Eddystone , and particularly on the 1st of December , and had landed some stores , when the light-keepers made no manner of complaint , and said all was right , except that one or two of the bricks in the kitchen fire-place had been loosened by a late storm . What in reality might occasion the building 's first catching fire , it has never been possible fully to investigate ; but , from the most distinct account , it appears to have commenced in the very top of the lantern , that is , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that when the light-keeper then upon the watch , ( about two o'clock in the morning of the 2d of December , ) went into the lantern as usual , to snuff the candles , he found the whole in a smoke , and upon opening the door of the lantern into the balcony , a flame instantly burst from the inside of the cupola : he immediately endeavoured to alarm his companions ; but they , being in bed and asleep , /q/ were not so ready in coming to his assistance as the occasion required . As there were always some leathern buckets kept in the house , and a tub of water in the lantern , he attempted as speedily as possible to extinguish the fire in the cupola , by throwing water from the balcony with a leather bucket , upon the outside cover of lead ; by this time , his comrades approaching , he /encouraged them to fetch up water with the leather buckets from the sea : but as the height would be , at a medium , full seventy feet , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden and totally unexpected event , would occasion this business of bringing up water , at the best , to go on but slowly . Meanwhile the flames gathering strength every moment , and the poor man , though making use of every exertion , having the water to throw full four yards higher than his own head , to be of any service , we must by no means be surprised , that , under all these difficulties , the fire , instead of being soon extinguished , would increase ; and what put a sudden stop to further exertions , was the following most remarkable circumstance : As he was looking upward with the utmost attention , to see the direction and success of the water thrown , a quantity of lead , dissolved by the heat of the flames , suddenly rushed like a torrent from the roof , and fell not only on the man 's head , . face , and shoulders , but over his clothes ; and a part of it made its way through his shirt collar and very much burnt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent internal sensation , and imagined that a quantity of this lead had passed down his throat , and got into his body . The man , who was ninety-four years of age , died on the twelfth day after the accident ; on opening the stomach , a solid piece of lead was found in it , weighing seven ounces five drachms . Under this violence of pain and anxiety , as every attempt had proved ineffectual , and the rage of the /z/ flames was increasing , it is not to be wondered that the terror and dismay of the three men increased in proportion ; so that they all found themselves intimidated , and glad to make their retreat from that immediate scene of horror , into one of the rooms below , where they would find themselves precluded from doing any thing : for had they thrown down ever so much water there , it could not have extinguished what was burning above them , nor indeed produce any other effect than that of running down into the rooms below , and from thence finally through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , to have had no other resource , or means of retreat , than that of retiring downwards from room to room , as the fire advanced over their heads . How soon the fire was seen from the shore , is not very certain ; but early in the morning it was perceived by some of the Cawsand fishermen , and intelligence thereof given to Mr. Edwards of Rame , in that neighbourhood , a gentleman of some fortune , and more humanity . This prompted him immediately to send out a fishing boat and men , to the relief of the people he supposed in distress upon the Eddystone . The boat and men got thither about ten o'clock , after the fire had been burning full eight hours ; and in this time the three light-keepers were not only driven from all the rooms , and the staircase , but , to avoid the falling of the timber , and red-hot bolts , &c.,; upon them , they were found sitting in the hole or cove in the east side of the rock , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being then low water . At this time the wind was eastward , and did not blow very fresh , but just hard enough to make a landing upon the rock , at the proper landingplace , quite impracticable , or attended with the utmost hazard . It , therefore , became a difficulty how the men were to be taken off ; for the ground-swell upon the west side produced so great surf upon the /q/ sloping surface , that no boat could attempt to land there . They , however , fell upon the following expedient : having a small boat with them , they moored their principal boat by a grappling to the westward , but as near the rock as they durst ; and then launching their small boat , they rowed it toward the rock , veering out a rope , which they fastened to the large boat , till they got near enough to throw a coil of small rope on the rock ; which having been laid hold of by the men , they one by one fastened it round their waists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small boat , and thence delivered into the large one ; and as they found it was out of their power to do any further service , the boat hastened to Plymouth to get the men relieved . No sooner , however , were they set on shore , than one of them made off , and has never since been heard of , which would , on the first blush , induce one to suppose , that there were something culpable in this man ; and if it had been a house on the shore , one would have . been tempted to suspect he had been guilty of some foul play : but the circumstance of its being a light-house , situated so as to afford no retreat in the power of its inhabitants , seems to preclude the possibility of its being done wilfully ; as he must know he must perish , or be in extreme danger of doing so at least , along with the rest . " Such was the termination of a building , which has always been looked upon as a matchless specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that had not been contemplated , and therefore not guarded against at the time of its erection . In a few days it was burnt down to the very foundation , after it had stood for forty-nine years , and been the means of saving many a ship from being wrecked upon that dangerous rock , /q/ /z/ WE have thus taken a general view of the principal timber which is used in this country , in building and in manufactures . The limits of this work necessarily preclude the insertion of much information that might be useful and amusing ; but we have endeavoured to select from the great mass of materials which the subject affords , such as might best gratify the curiosity of the reader , and excite that habit of observation which is the first step towards real knowledge . As timber is one of the most important and valuable materials which man employs for the promotion of his comforts , and is , even to the rudest , absolutely necessary in many ways , so , fortunately , it is the most plentiful of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preceding pages , many details of the extent of the forests of the north of Europe , and of America . In parts of the coasts of South America , Humboldt found the largest trees growing in such unbounded luxuriance , that he could scarcely set foot on the shore , so thick were the woods , running down even to the water 's edge . This thickness of vegetation is a remarkable characteristic of that part of the world ; and where the climate is unfavourable to the growth of trees , rank grass and thistles shoot up , in a profusion , and with a rapidity , which is quite astonishing . The great plain on the east of the Cordillera , called the Pampas , is about nine hundred miles in breadth ; and its vegetable productions are either small evergreens , clover , or thistles , according to the climate of the several districts . In the spring , the region of thistles presents a most extraordinary spectacle . They suddenly spring /q/ up to the height of ten ; or ; eleven feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hemmed in , and the view is completely obstructed . The thistles are so close together , and so strong , that they are perfectly impenetrable . Captain Head , in his journey across the Pampas , says : " it is really possible that an invading army , unacquainted with this country , might be imprisoned by these thistles before they had time to escape from them . " We have mentioned these facts to shew the almost universal luxuriance of natural vegetation : generally , this luxuriance produces the most beautiful and majestic objects of the vegetable kingdom , trees . A country without wood is always disagreeable ; and thus the inhabitants of bleak regions , possessing no timber , are considered peculiarly unfortunate . On the other hand , the extreme abundance of trees , in many parts of the earth , renders it one of the great labours of man to clear the ground of them , that he may be able to raise food by cultivation . The progress of civilization has thus a natural tendency to diminish the forests of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those states of society which have been described by Caesar and Tacitus , lived almost wholly in the woods , which supplied the principal wants of a rude people ; but as the arts of life made advances , through communication with more refined nations , these people permitted the wolves and bears to occupy the forests associated together in towns and cultivated the open country . As population increased , more land was required for culture than the plains afforded ; and then the forests were subjected to the axe , and their spontaneous produce was succeeded by regular tillage . This is the progress of man in all woody countries . For several centuries the forests of England were much neglected . Many of them were royal domains j /z/ but as the inhabitants within a forest generally had customary rights which were considered irreconcileable with much improvement , very little young timber was produced . Within the last twenty years , some of the most extensive of these ancient appendages of the crown have been disafforested that is , a part has been assigned to the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclosed by the crown . The Commissioners of Woods and Forests have important duties to perform , and not the least important is that of providing a proper succession of timber for building ships . We have seen a calculation , in which it is shewn that a first-rate ship of the line contains three thousand loads of timber , and that this quantity could not be grown on a less surface than fifty acres . To maintain , therefore , an abundant supply of timber fit for naval purposes , is not an easy or a trivial matter . At the time when Gilpin published his " Forest Scenery , " about thirty years ago , it was considered that eleven forests had alone preserved their rights , out of seventy-seven which are enumerated in an account of the land revenues of the crown , published by Mr. St. John . These eleven were Windsor , Waltham , Dean , Rockingham , Whittlewood , Salcey , Sherwood , Whichwood , New-forest , Bere , and Walmer . Of these the greater number , as we have already stated , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest law , which had been in former times such a source of oppression to the people , have long since fallen into disuse , although , till within these few years , some of the forms of those laws were kept up , particularly in the New-forest and the forest of Dean . The principle of these despotic laws , according to Manwood , a legal writer on the subject , was this : " It is allowed to our sovereign lord the king , in respect of his continual /q/ care and labour for the preservation of the whole realm , among other privileges , this prerogative , to have his places of recreation and pastime , wheresoever he will appoint . For as it is at the liberty and pleasure of his grace to secure the wild beasts and the game to himself , for his only delight and pleasure , so he may also at his will and pleasure make a forest for them to abide* in . " In this way more than an eighth of the whole kingdom was made forest for the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced for the purpose of preserving the game . The grievance at length , was put down by the spirit of the people . The publication of his Sylva , by Evelyn , gave a considerable impulse to planting in the time of Charles II . ; but in the next century that duty was much neglected by the landed proprietors of this country . There is a selfish feeling , that the planter of an elm or an oak does not reap such an immediate profit from it himself , as will compensate for the expense and trouble of raising it . This is an extremely narrow principle , which , fortunately , the rich are beginning to be ashamed of . It is a positive duty of a landed proprietor who cuts down the tree which his grandfather planted , to put a young one into the ground , as a legacy to his own grand-children : he will otherwise leave the world worse than he found it . Sir Walter Scott , who is himself a considerable planter , has eloquently denounced that contracted feeling which prevents proprietors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a tardy and distant return ; and we can not better conclude than with a short passage from the essay in which he enforces the duty of planting waste lands : " The indifference to this great ruralimprovement arises , we have reason to believe , not so much out /z/ of the actual lucre of gain as the fatal vis inertice that indolence which induces the lords of the soil to be satisfied with what they can obtain from it by immediate rent , rather than encounter the expense and trouble of attempting the modes of amelioration which require immediate expense and , what is , perhaps , more grudged by the first-born of Egypt a little future attention . To such we can only say that improvement by plantation is at once the easiest , the cheapest , and the least precarious mode of increasing the immediate value , as well as the future income , of their estates ; and that therefore it is we exhort them to take to heart the exhortation of the dying Scotch laird to his son : ' Be aye sticking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sleeping .

WHETHER we regard their beauty , their variety , the extent over which they are diffused , or their agreeableness and value to man , there is no class of substances more interesting than the Fruits . Their progressive cultivation , and their removal , by wandering tribes or conquerors , from region to region , associate them in a very remarkable degree with the history of the human race . This historical connexion of fruits with the progress of civilization is sometimes fabulous , and generally obscure ; but the great revolutions of society may be traced in their gradual distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has penetrated , in that spirit of change and activity which precedes or accompanies civilization , he has assisted the dissemination of vegetable productions much more surely and rapidly than the birds which bear their seeds from land to land , than the currents of the ocean , or even the winds . If we examine , for example , the fruits of our own VOL. n. 1 /z/ country , we shall at once see how their introduction has accompanied the great changes in its social state . Before the invasion of the Romans , the natives of these islands probably possessed no other than the wild fruits of Northern Europe , the crab , the sloe , the hazel-nut and the acorn . The Romans themselves had , but a few centuries before , obtained their principal fruits from the countries of the East , and from Greece and its islands . Hirschfield and Sickler , laborious writers on the history of cultivated vegetables , are of opinion that the Romans derived the fig from Syria , the orange or citron from Media , the peach from Persia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plum , the cherry , the apple , and the pear from Armenia . Pliny mentions that they had twenty-two sorts of apples ; thirty of pears ; three of quinces ; a variety of plums and cherries ; peaches , nectarines , apricots , and almonds ; and various sorts of olives . And yet , under the reign of the first Tarquin , the olive did not exist in Italy , although Homer and Hesiod mention it as cultivated hi Greece. * A cherry tree laden with fruit adorned the triumph of Lucullus ; the dictator had brought the plant to Rome as a precious memorial of his victory over Mithridates , in whose province of Pontus he had found the treef . In less than a century , the same species of cherry was common in France , hi Germany , and in England , where the conquerors had introduced it , imparting some few blessings while they inflicted countless miseries in their progress to universal dominion . Thus , the cherry , and in all probability the peach , the plum , the apple , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a colony of Rome . Whatever are the evils of war and conquest , and they are very great , * Humboldt , Geographic des Plantes. t See p. 312. /q/ they yet contributed , in the early stages of society , to diffuse the knowledge of the arts of cultivation . Plutarch , with the partiality arising from his subject , says that Alexander , by his progress into India , which opened communications between distant nations , had more benefitted mankind than all the speculative philosophers of Greece . But when civilization is advanced , war is no longer in any way an instrument even of incidental good it is an unmitigated evil . The spread of a milder , though not a less powerful sway that of the Church introduced new fruits into Great Britain . The monks after the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity , appear to have been the only gardeners . As early as 674 , we have a record , describing a pleasant and fruitbearing close at Ely , then cultivated by Brithnoth , the first Abbot of that place . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compatible with the nature of the climate , and the horticultural knowledge of the middle ages . Whoever has seen an old abbey , where for generations destruction only has been at work , must have almost invariably found it situated in one of the choicest spots , both as to soil and aspect ; and if the hand of injudicious improvement has not swept it away , there is still the " Abbey-garden . " Even though it has been wholly neglected though its walls be in ruins , covered with stones crop and wall-flower , and its area produce but the rankest weeds there are still the remains of the aged fruit-trees the venerable pears , the delicate little apples , and the luscious black cherries . The chesnuts and the walnuts may have yielded to the axe , and the fig-trees and vines died away ; but sometimes the mulberry is left , and the strawberry and the raspberry struggle among the ruins . There is a moral lesson /z/ in these memorials of the monastic ages . The monks , with all their faults , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that they were improving the world , while the warriors were spending their lives to spoil it . In many parts of Italy and France , which had lain in desolation and ruin from the time of the Goths , the monks restored the whole surface to fertility ; and in Scotland and Ireland , there probably would not have been a fruit-tree till the sixteenth century , if it had not been for their peaceful labours . It is generally supposed that the monastic orchards were in their greatest perfection from the twelfth to the fifteenth century . The crusades , impolitic and unjust as they were in principle , contributed something to the improvement of European society ; and , by renewing a communication with the countries of the East , they again assisted the diffusion of those vegetable treasures which had been neglected after the destruction of the Roman empire . The monastic gardens owed many of their choicest fruits to the care of those provident ecclesiastics who had accompanied the expeditions to the Holy Land . This improvement of the country by the monks was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people by whom they were surrounded . In the same manner , the ecclesiastics who have settled in South America , from the time of the discovery of the New World , have caused almost all the fruits , of temperate Europe to flourish amidst the productions of the torrid zone . " In studying the history of the conquest , " says Humboldt , " we admire the extraordinary rapidity with which the Spaniards of the sixteenth century spread the cultivation of the European vegetables along the ridge of the Cordilleras , from one extremity of the continent to the other ; " and he attributes this remarkable effect of /q/ industry principally to the religious missionaries. * The same course is now pursued , in a great measure , by the missionaries in the South Seas , and in Southern Africa . The destruction of the monastic houses , and the rise of the middle orders of society a natural consequence of commercial industry and enterprize gave an impulse to the general cultivation of fruit-trees , instead of their growth being almost entirely limited to the gardens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revival of the arts ; and that princess herself set the example as a horticulturist . Towards the end of her reign , the celebrated Gerard published his well known ' Herball , or Historic of Plants . ' This eminent gardener , who numbered among his patrons Lord JBurleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh , was one of those remarkable men who unite a general scientific knowledge with great practical industry men , above all others , calculated to advance the progress of any art . Gerard kept a garden in Holborn ; and in 1596 he published a catalogue of eleven hundred plants growing there . Fitzherbert , and some others , had written on the subject of plants before Gerard 's 1 Herball ' made its appearance . Those attempts were , however , like most of the early treatises on the arts and sciences , derived rather from the Roman writings on the subject than from an examination and knowledge of nature . James I. , the most pedantic , but the most peace-loving , and far from the least intelligent of kings , planted a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about thirty years afterwards , described with much praise by John Albert de Man- * Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain , book iv. , chap . ix . ror .. n. 1* /z/ delslo , a traveller ; but so little interest had the garden excited at home , that when Mandelslo 's book came to be " done into English , " the description of the garden was left out as not worth reading . In the reign of Charles I. ( 1629 ) , Parkinson published his great work , l Paradisi in sole Paradisus terrestris , or a Garden of all sortes of pleasant flowers , with a Kitchen Garden of all manner of herbs and roots , and an Orchard of all sortes of fruit-bearing trees . ' Parkinson may justly claim to be considered as the Bacon of horticulture , because he sent men into the garden and the orchard to see with their own eyes , and handle with their own hands . He describes fifty-eight sorts of apples , sixty-four pears , sixty-one plums , twenty-one peaches , five nectarines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty-three vines , with sorts of most of the smaller hardy fruits stilt cultivated . Thirty-five years after the appearance of Parkinson 's work , the celebrated Evelyn did for the trees of the forest what his predecessor had done for those of the orchard . Charles II . paid some attention to the luxury of fruits , one of his very few harmless propensities . Le Notre , the favourite gardener of Louis XIV. , was his landscape gardener ; and Rose , his private gardener , who also had studied in France , was so skilled in the management of hot-houses as to be able to produce ripe cherries and strawberries at an installation dinner , holden at Windsor on the 23rd of April , 1667 . We are approaching a period when the commerce of England began to afford some indications of its future greatness of its unbounded enterprize , and its universal application to the interchange of necessaries and luxuries . About this time the first pines were grown in England . We , probably , obtained this /q/ fruit from Holland , and not direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the career of commercial adventure , and from them , principally , we learnt our art of modern gardening . For nearly a century and a half this country has steadily proceeded in augmenting the number of its vegetable productions , gathering from every quarter of the globe the fruits and flowers indigenous to each , and cultivating them at home , either to increase the large and valuable number of plants of easy growth , and therefore , of general use and ornament , or to render the productions of the torrid zone capable of administering to luxurious gratification under our colder skies , by the application of all that science has discovered to make man so far independent of soil and temperature . Thus , the large number of our native plants ( for we call those native which have adapted themselves to our climate ) mark the gradual progress of our civilization through the long period of two thousand years ; whilst the almost infinite diversity of exotics which a botanical garden offers , attest the triumphs of that industry which has carried us as merchants or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has brought from every region whatever can administer to our comforts and our luxuries , to the tastes and the needful desires of the humblest as well as the highest amongst us . To the same commerce we owe the potatoe and the pine-apple ; the China rose , whose flowers cluster round the cottage-porch , and the Camellia which blooms in the conservatory . The addition even of a flower , or an ornamental shrub , to those which we already possess , is not to be regarded as a matter below the care of industry and science . The more we extend our acquaintance with the productions of nature , the more are our minds elevated by contemplating the variety , as well as the exceeding beauty , of the works of the /z/ Creator . The highest understanding does not stoop when occupied in observing the brilliant colour of a blossom , or the graceful form of a leaf . Hogarth , the great moral painter , a man in all respects of real and original genius , writes thus to his friend Ellis , a distinguished traveller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vases , they are a sweet confirmation of the pleasure Nature seems to take in superadding an elegance of form to most of her works , wherever you find them . How poor and bungling are all the imitations of Art ! When I have the pleasure of seeing you next , we will sit down , nai/ , kneel down if you will , and admire these things . " In the progress of this sketch of the various fruits which administer to the comfort of man throughout the globe , we shall endeavour to trace , as far as is possible , the early history and the first localities of those which are more generally esteemed . The information possessed upon these subjects is , however , necessarily limited and vague . The history of many of them belongs to very distant periods ; for , as soon as they were rendered attractive to man by cultivation ( and we know that scarcely any wild fruit is of value ) , a state of civilization followed , which of necessity would lead to commercial intercourse . The very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettle the native localities of the fruits ; and as modern experience shews that their qualities are altered generally for the better by transplantation , it is probable that , in the course of a time by no means long , the fruit which had first attracted the attention of the adventurer in some fertile and favoured spot , would be flourishing in a far superior state upon the inferior soil , or under the inferior climate , where it had received his subsequent care . It is one of the proudest attributes of man , and one which is most important /q/ for him to know , that he can improve every production of nature , if he will but once make it his own by possession and attachment . A conviction of this truth has rendered the cultivation of fruits , in the more polished countries of Europe , as successful as we now behold it . In carrying the pursuit of any branch of knowledge to the utmost limits of its means , a stimulus to activity and mental exertion is produced , which is in itself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London has afforded such an impulse to the art of gardening . It was well observed by the President , in the first paper of its Transactions , that " the austere crab of our woods has been converted into the golden pippin ; and the numerous varieties of the plum can boast no other parent than our native sloe . Yet few experiments have been made , the object of which has been new productions of this sort ; and almost every ameliorated variety of fruit appears to have been the offspring of accident , or of culture applied to other purposes . We may therefore infer , with little danger of error , that an ample and unexplored field for future discovery and improvement lies before us , in which nature does not appear to have formed any limits to the success of our labours , if properly applied . " This institution was founded in 1805 , by the spirited exertions of Sir Joseph Banks , the Earls of Powis and Dartmouth , Mr. Knight , and several other eminent naturalists and encouragers of useful pursuits . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with the assistance of the most skilful practical gardeners , this Society has given a great impulse to that taste for gardening which began to be generally diffused about the middle of the last century . Its objects are of much more extensive range than can be effected /z/ by establishments , however excellent , like the Botanical Garden at Chelsea . A similar society was formed in Scotland in 1809 , at the suggestion of Dr. Andrew Duncan , senior ; and there are many local societies , whose objects are the same , which have contributed in like degree to lead the rich to the encouragement of horticulture , and to instruct those who practise the art , in the real value of a higher knowledge , both of the nomenclature and the physiology of plants , than had formerly been considered necessary or even fitting for practical men . A popular division of fruits , in a sketch of which the object is more to excite than to gratify a desire for the knowledge of their history and properties , must principally have reference to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open air . Without following , therefore , a strict geographical arrangement , we shall first treat of fruits of the temperate climates , and , secondly , of tropical fruits . Of the fruits of the temperate climates , the following will comprise the principal genera : I. Fleshy Fruits , having the seeds enclosed in mem- branous cells . II . Pulpy Fruits , having the seeds lying among pulp . III . Stone Fruits , having the seed enclosed in a hard nut , covered with flesh . IV . Nuts , or dry fruits , which are neither fleshy nor pulpy. /z/ a . Apples . b . Pears . d . Medlar . THE APPLE Pyrus malus . The apple is distinguished as the fruit of the colder climates . It is at once the most brisk and refreshing of any of the common hardy orchard fruits . It remains the longest in season , is used in the greatest number of ways , and , therefore , is the most generally cultivated . The stone fruits of the English orchard keep only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this state they lose that natural flavour on which their value chiefly depends . Many of the finer pears keep only for a short time , when they become vapid and flat : but there are apples of very rich and vinous flavour , which , with care , can be preserved till the early sorts of the succeeding season come in to supply their place . The useful qualities of the apple have extended its cultivation throughout Europe , as far as the 60th degree of latitude . It has been observed by a distinguished traveller , that the commoner fruit-trees , such as apples , pears , cherries , and apricots , grow /z/ in the open air , wherever oaks thrive. * As we proceed farther north , the apple is scarcely known . The people of Lapland shewed Linnaeus what they called an apple-tree , which , they said , bore no fruit , because it had been cursed by a beggar-woman , to whom the owner of the tree had refused some of its produce . The naturalist found that it was the common elm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " f " The apple as well as most other European fruits , which now appear indigenous , is probably a native of the East . The Prophet Joel , enumerating the trees of Syria , says , " the vine is dried up , and the fig-tree languisheth ; the pomegranate-tree , the plum-tree also and the apple-tree , even all the trees of the field , are withered . " The cultivated apple was probably scarce at Rome , in the time of Pliny ; for he states that there were some apple-trees in the villages near the city which yielded more profit than a small farm . The art of grafting was at that period either very recently discovered , or comparatively little known . This practice must evidently have belonged to an advanced state of civilization . It is remarkable that Moses , in his directions to the Israelites when they " shall come into the land , and shall have planted all manner of trees for food , " J makes no mention of the art of grafting . Hesiod and Homer , in like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have formed part of their subject had it existed when they wrote . The art of grafting , as well as that of pruning , has been ascribed to an accidental origin . The more vigorous shooting of a vine , after a goat had broused on it , is said to have suggested the one great principle in the management of fruit trees ; * Von Bach 's Travels , p. 41. 4to. /q/ and it is probable that the occasional natural union of the boughs of distinct trees may have shewn the general practicability of the other . Pliny mentions apple-trees " that will honour the first grafters for ever ; " and this enthusiastic sort of praise belongs to the infancy of an art , when mankind are first conscious of its blessings , and therefore not disposed to undervalue them through their familiarity . To the facility of multiplying varieties by grafting , is to be ascribed the amazing extension of the sorts of apple , probably from one common stock The varieties at present known are considerably more than a thousand . Of late years these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of the pollen* of one sort to the blossom of another . Many of the better sorts of English apples were probably at first introduced into this country from the continent . The greater part of our names of apples are French , either pure or corrupted . Those varieties which had been celebrated abroad were spread through the kingdom by their cultivation in the gardens of the religious houses ; and many of these fine old sorts still exist . Thus the Nonpareil according to the old herbalists , was brought from France by a Jesuit in the time of Queen Mary , and first planted hi the gardens of Oxfordshire . The Os/m , or Jlrbroath pippin , an ancient Scotch variety , was either introduced or extensively cultivated by the monks of the abbey of Aberbrothwick . On the other hand , the celebrated Golden Pippin has been considered as the native growth of ' England ; and noticed as such by French and Dutch writers . It is described by Duhamel under the name of " Pomme d'Or ; Reinette d'Angleterre . " The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reinette d'Angleterre . " The more delicate apples for the table , such as the pippins were probably very little known here till the latter part of the sixteenth century . Fuller states that one Leonard Maschal , in the sixteenth year of the reign of Henry VIII. , brought pippins from over sea , and planted them at Plumstead in Sussex . Pippins are so called because the trees were raised from the pips , or seeds ; and bore the apples which gave them celebrity , without grafting . In the thirty-seventh year of the same king we find the barking of apple-trees declared a felony ; and the passing of the law had probably a relation to the more extended growth of the fruit through the introduction of pippins. l Costard-monger ' is an old English term for the dealers in vegetables , derived from their principal commodity of apples ; the costard being a large apple , round and bulky as the head , or ' costard . ' If we may deduce any meaning from this name , which is the same as ' coster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the sort in common use , and that hence the name of the variety became synonymous with that of the species ; the more delicate sorts were luxuries unknown to the ordinary consumers of our native fruits , till they were rendered common by the planting of orchards in Kent , Sussex , and other parts of the kingdom . The growth of the more esteemed apple-trees had made such a general progress in half a century , that we find Shakspeare putting these words in the mouth of Justice Shallow , in his invitation to Falstaff : " You shall see mine orchard , where , in an arbour , we will eat a last year 's pippin of my own grafting . " Sir Hugh Evans , in the ' Merry Wives of Windsor , ' says , " I will make an end of my dinner there 's pippins /q/ and cheese to come . " Pippins were , therefore , in the time of Shakspeare , delicacies for the dessert . But in another fifty years the national industry had rendered the produce of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cider orchards of Herefordshire began to be planted in the reign of Charles I. The adaptation of these apples to the soil was quickly discovered ; and they spread over the face of the whole country . Of the varieties of the cider apples , the Redstreak and the Sline were formerly the most prized ; and the cider of these apples , and the perry of the Squash pear , were celebrated throughout Europe . At the time when cider was first manufactured in England it was believed that it would almost wholly supersede the use of foreign wines . From the period of the Norman conquest England carried on a great wine trade with France , principally with Bordeaux , and the neighbouring provinces . It increased considerably when Henry II . married the daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine ; and after the kings of England subsequently became possessed of some of the great wine provinces of France , the consumption of their produce was almost universal . About the middle of the sixteenth century , although no wines were permitted to exceed the price of twelve pence per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no person , except those who could expend a hundred marks annually , or were of noble birth , should keep in his house any vessel of wine exceeding ten gallons , a regulation which would suggest that the demand for wine was greater than the supply , owing probably to the increase of the middle ranks of society . In the year 1635 we find a patent granted to Francis Chamberlayne , for making wine from the dried grapes of Spain and Portugal ; and the patentee set forth that his wines would keep /z/ good during several years , and even in a voyage under the line. * This circumstance also shews that the demand for the luxury of wine amongst the commercial classes ( who had become of great number and importance , as the political events of those times fully prove ) could not be supplied from the wine countries , probably on account of the prevalence of false principles of trade . Cider , therefore , became a general beverage before the time of Charles II. , though it had been partially used for nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as already mentioned , about the close of Elizabeth 's reign , says , in his quaint way , " I have seen , about the pastures and hedgerows of a worshipful gentleman 's dwelling , two miles from Hereford , called Mr. Roger Badnome , so many trees of all sortes , that the servants drink , for the most part , no other drink but that which is made of apples . The qualitie is such , that , by the report of the gentleman himselfe , the parson hath for tythe many hogsheads of cyder . " During the reigns of William III . and Anne , when there was a constant succession of wars with France , the use of cider was generally inculcated , as tending to the permanent exclusion of the wines of our great rival . Philips , a contemporary of Addison , wrote a long poem in praise of cider ; and embodied in his work a good deal of the art of selecting and managing - apple- trees . But he wrote as a poet , and maintained the unwise and impolitic doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of living in intercourse with its neighbours , and thus advancing the comforts and riches of all . After praising the cider of Hereford , Philips says , " What should we wish for more ? or why , in quest Of foreign vintage , insincere and mixed , * Rymer 's Fcedera ; see Pennant 's London . /q/ Traverse the extremes ! world ? Why tempt the rage Of the rough ocean , when our native glebe Imparts from bounteous womb annual recruits Of wine delectable , that far surmounts Gallic or Latin grapes , or those that see The setting sun near Calpe 's towering height ? " We have at length learnt that the truest way to advance the prosperity of nations , is by exchanging the best . natural products of one country for those of another . If we are to drink the cider of Hereford , in preference to the claret of Bordeaux , for the sole reason that we grow it , the same principle , applied to ourselves by other nations , would cut us off from the greater part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority . The interest of each individual , and of each country , is best consulted by the facilities with which each can secure a share of the natural advantages and the mechanical skill that belong to the rest . The advice of the well-meaning poet of cider , if acted upon by individuals as well as nations , ( and if it be applicable to the one it must be applicable to the other , ) would destroy society altogether , by making self the means as well as the end in everything . The freedom of commercial intercourse has no tendency to the repression of internal improvement , but has a contrary effect . The finest cider and perry of Herefordshire is brought for exportation to the East and West Indies and to America ; and this foreign demand for the better sorts keeps up an attention in the cultivators which domestic consumption alone could perhaps not induce . The Cider counties of England have always been considered as highly interesting . They lie something in the form of a horseshoe round the Bristol channel ; and the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the channel , and Somerset and Devon on the South . In appearance , they have a considerable advantage over those counties in which grain alone is cultivated . The blossoms cover an extensive district with a profusion of flowers in the spring , and the fruit is beautiful in autumn . Some of the orchards occupy a space of forty or fifty acres ; and the trees being at considerable intervals , the land is also kept in tillage . A great deal of practical acquaintance with the qualities of soil is required in the culture of apple and pear trees ; and his skill in the adaptation of trees to their situation principally determines the success of the manufacturer of cider and perry . The produce of the orchards is very fluctuating ; and the growers seldom expect an abundant crop more than once in three years . The quantity of apples required to make a hogshead of cider is from twentyfour to thirty bushels ; and in a good year an acre of orchard will produce somewhere about six hundred bushels , or from twenty to twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season is favourable , the heaps of apples collected at the presses are immense consisting of hundreds of tons . If any of the vessels used in the manufacture of cider are of lead , the beverage is not wholesome . The price of a hogshead of cider generally varies from 2J. to 5/. , according to the season and quality ; but cider of the finest growth has sometimes been sold as high as 20/. by the hogshead , direct from the press a price equal to that of many of the fine wines of the Rhine or the Garonne . The varieties of the apple are so many , and they are so rapidly multiplied , that it would be impossible for us , within our limits , to present any account of them which should be either useful or interesting . /q/ The knowledge of varieties is a part , and a very important one , of the science of the practical horticulturists ; and one of the most valuable objects which individual growers of fruit , or societies for the encouragement of experiments in cultivation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing list of /q/
