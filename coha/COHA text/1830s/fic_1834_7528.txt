Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : AN INFANT ABOLITIONIST. from An infant abolitionist ( 1834 ) How often by a sinless child May we of error be beguiled ; How oft a single , simple word The sealed springs of thought have stirr 'd , And waken 'd feelings deep , to be A lesson for futurity ! The gayest , most aerial thing , That moves on earth without a wing , Today such lesson taught to me . How sweetly , yet unconsciously , The infant maiden , artless , mild , Reproved her elder playmate 's pride ! And yet the babe has only smiled Three years by her fond mother 's side . They stood before a picture  --  one Where dark ' neath Afric 's burning sun , A wild and lonely native lay : The child 's companion turn 'd to say , " There ' s an old nigger , Anne , see ! " And pointed to the African ; The little one said quietly , " I see he is a colored man . " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infancy ! And sigh , amid their learned lore , For one untaught delight of thine  --  And feel they ' d give their wisdom 's store To know again thy truth divine ! The boasted power of eloquence Can sway the soul with magic art  --  But simple words from innocence May sink more deeply in the heart .
