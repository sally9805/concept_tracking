THE BOARDING SCHOOLS ; Or , LIFE AMONG THE LITTLE FOLKS The autograph manuscript of The Boarding Schools ; or , Life among the Little Folks is in the Luquer collection . The date of composition of this farce , which was probably never acted professionally , can only be conjectured . Its source , Marchalle and Hubert 's Les Deux Pensions , was performed for the first time at the Thtre du Panorama Dramatique , April 16 , 1822 , and published the same year . Since Payne was generally in search of the current Paris hit , it seems likely that he made his adaptation soon after the appearance of the French comedy . ( A. H. Quinn in A History of the American Drama from the Beginning to the Civil War , New York , 1923 , p. 424 , suggests that Payne may be the author of The Boarding School which according to G. C. D. Odell in Annals of the New York Stage , Vol . IV , p. 538 , was performed at the Park , November 17 , 1841 ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not those of Payne 's farce , but instead those of a play with this title by Bayle Bernard which opened in London at the Haymarket , September 1 , 1841 , and which is wholly unlike Payne 's . ) Although Payne does not alter the series of pat coincidences with which the plot is developed , elsewhere he works with a good deal of freedom ; for he changes the scene from Paris to London and portrays with English manners both the precocious children and the pompous grown-ups whom they outwit . The result is an enjoyable farce with a strongly topical flavor . CAST OF CHARACTERS Gustave Mr. Prettyman , Master of a boys ' school Jacko , Factotum of the Widow Wantmore Carte-and-Tierce , Fencing master Pirouette , Dancing master Schoolboys Pauline The Widow Wantmore , Mistress of a girls ' school Prudence Hornbrook , Factotum of Mr. Prettyman Charlotte Schoolgirls The action takes place in London Main text ACT I. Scene : The stage , divided by a wall down the middle , through which there is a well half on one side and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boys ' school , and at the left the garden of the girls ' school . Each garden is backed by a wall with a rail gate opening on the country ; over each of which gates there is a sign , on one side " Boarding School for Young Gentlemen , " and on the other " Boarding School for Young Ladies . " Near the well at the left stands a tree whose foliage rises over the wall . On each side , first wing , there is a bower . As the curtain rises , all the children are at play . The little girls are dancing , hands round , the little boys are playing . Jack . Jacko Now for my wife that expects to be , the lovely Prudence Hornbrook ! Sweet Sunflower of my affections , that follows me with her broad face , whichever way I turn . These fine summer days have the same effect on men and women as they have on the birds . They make ' em think of coupling . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jack . Jacko This is the hour mentioned in the letter she poked through that keyhole . The master 's going out , then we can meet unknown , as true lovers ought , and coo in secret , as intended mates are in decency bound to do . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook To the boys Go and take care to act openly and be above concealments . Jack . Jacko Prudence has rare qualities . She has no notion of courting without something substantial along with it . She never listens to tender protestations but over a well covered table . Her stomach and her heart are in partnership . She loves good things and her love of me 's a proof . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook Seeing the boys eating something , snatches the cake and pockets it Beware , young gentlemen , of gormandizing . There 's nothing so bad as giving way to one 's appetite . Jack . Jacko Accordingly , Miss Prudence Hornbrook and I feast on all possible occasions . This key she got made secretly . She most poetically terms it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little talisman , this first pledge of her love , when Mr. Prettyman goes out , I go in , and there we eat and sigh , sigh and eat , eat and sigh , and eat again ! My Mistress Widow Wantmore 's poor girls are all the better for it ; for , as Prudence makes me supply the provisions ( a heavy task ) , I 'm obliged by so much to lighten the school larder ; and that prevents the young gluttons from overloading their little stomachs and converts the irregularity of taking things without taking notice into a most important benefit to the rising generation . Enter Pauline jumping the rope Why , Miss Pauline , you do nothing all the play hours but dance . Apart She 'll break her neck at last . Paul . Pauline That 's for my health and by the doctor 's orders . Jack . Jacko Aye , aye . Thanks to the doctors of nowadays our little girls do what the little boys used to do in old times . They jump the rope like Madame Saqui , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horseback like the folks at Astley 's . Ah ! If boys and girls go on so , ' twill be no very easy job to make out which is which . Paul . Pauline What would you have , sir ? It 's the education la mode . Jack . Jacko It may be all mode , but it 's not the mode of my time . The young folks of my time were brought up in another way . Paul . Pauline The young folks of your time are not the young folks of mine , sir . Jack . Jacko So much the worse for both . Paul . Pauline Bless me , sir , have you never subscribed to Colburn 's or Hookham 's Circulating Libraries ? Read the novels and they 'll show you how necessary it is that a young lady should know all young gentlemen know . If a young lady knows how to ride , she can gallop from her persecutor ; if she knows how to fence , she can defend her honor ; and if she knows how to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The story of Hero and Leander that we 've been learning by heart would have been a thousand times more romantic if Hero had ever been taught to swim . I 'd have you to know , sir , that there is nothing like the modern style of education to form young maids . Jack . Jacko A side To form maids  --  ' twill rather put an end to the tribe and leave no maids to form . Gus . Gustave To the boys Let 's play Blind Man 's Buff . Giving his handkerchief , and they tie it round his eyes Jack . Jacko Aside But I 'll go to dinner by way of staying my stomach till Miss Prue 's treat . Striking his stomach There 's room here for two meals . Aloud Young ladies , I wish you a good morning . Exit singing Dance away , my jolly dears , dance , dance , and be merry ! The little girls begin to play Gus . GustaveSeizing Prudence You 're caught ! You 're caught ! Pru . Prudence Hornbrook Angrily What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liberty with me , sir ! Mind what you 're at  --  Gus . GustaveTaking off the handkerchief Miss Prudence Hornbrook ! To the others You rascals ! Why did you let me go that way ? Why did n't you call out , " Roast Beef " ? Boys . Schoolboys Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Roast Beef ! Roast Beef ! Miss Prudence must be blinded . Come , Miss Prudence ! Gus. Gustave Take off her spectacles . Then she 'll be blind enough . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook None of your impertinence , you little spoiled jackanapeses . Call me Roast Beef ! Pray , sir , what do you mean by calling me Roast Beef ! Take care how you treat me , sir , or I 'll tell the Master and you shall be put to your tasks . Gus . Gustave As ide I 'd rather be at my tricks . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook Ca n't you play quietly , and amuse yourselves without running after one another , and call out , without making a noise ? Gus . Gustave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amuse ourselves by . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook I 'd have you know I  --  I  --  I 'll be off instantly . Boys. Schoolboys Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! So much the better . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook Yes , but before long you 'll hear the study bell . Gus . Gustave To tell no lies , I 'd rather hear the dinner bell . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook Aside , going I 'll have my revenge . I 'll go and put the clock a quarter of an hour forward and the little rascals shall hear the study bell when they little expect it . Roast Beef , indeed ! Boys. Schoolboys Conducting her Good bye , good bye , Miss Prudence . Pru . Prudence Hornbrook Good bye , little rogues . Exit Gus . Gu stave Well , I 'm glad old Blowzybut 's gone . Now , boys , what news do you think I 've got to tell you ? Boys. Schoolboys What ? What ? Gus .

All laugh Laugh if you like , but it 's no joke . 1st Boy. First Boy Especially to your wife . Gus . Gustave That 's her affair . She may be of a different opinion . Now , I 'll tell you how it happens . There 's some bother between our family and another , and I 'm to be married to settle it all comfortably . You shall all come to my wedding . You 'll have time enough to get your new clothes made , and you shall all come . My wife belongs to the girls ' school next door , and I must get to tell her the news . She 'll be so pleased , she 'll go wild with ecstasy ; and she 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good sort of a fellow , boys , that I am. 1st Boy. First Boy We 've your own word for it , at any rate . Gus . Gustave I 've proofs : thanks to my father 's presents to our master , had n't I three medals at the last examination ? But come , let 's see how I shall contrive to get over the wall . 1st Boy. First Boy What ! Into the girls ' place  --  Gus . Gustave Where else should my duty as a husband take me ? Come , make a ladder for me . That 's right . That 's right . He prepares to scale the wall by mounting on the boys ' shoulders . Enter Charlotte . All the little girls leave their play and run to her Girls . Schoolgirls Here 's Charlotte . Here 's Charlotte . Char . Charlotte Well , misses , and suppose it is Charlotte . Is it such a wonder to see Charlotte ? Girls . SchoolgirlsGetting round her Good morning , Charlotte , good morning ! Oh , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so glad you 're come . Char . Charlotte Good morning , misses . Pushing them But , bless me , do keep off . Do n't rumple me so , I shall look as if I came from the Lord knows where . Paul . Pauline Well , Charley , tell us the news . Had you a merry day at home ? Did you see Papa ? Char . Charlotte Yes , I saw him . I was at your house with Mama . They talked of business , they said this and they said that . In short , I thought they 'd never have done . They did n't mind me , for they look upon me as an infant even at my time of life ; but I am sly and I did n't lose a word . Paul . Pauline And what did you hear ? Char . Charlotte All about your marriage ! Girls . Schoolgirls Her marriage ! Paul . Pauline My marriage ! Oh ! Joy ! Joy ! And who 's to be my husband ? Gus .

Gustave True ; but now you do know it , a n't you delighted ? Paul . Pauline Is n't it natural enough I should be ? Gus . Gustave Why , I think you 're lucky . What a snug home we shall make of it ! Paul . Pauline We shall have nothing at all to do all day long , shall we ? Gus . Gustave Nothing to do ? On the contrary , we shall have a great deal to do . We shall go to sights half the day ; and to confectioners ' shops to eat sugar plums and cakes and ice cream the other half . Then , when winter comes , of a morning , I shall sit by the grate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who are playing in the background laugh , with a dozen little monkeys round me , making at least as much racket as those young ladies . We sha n't be able to hear our own voices , but that 's nothing ; it will be very charming , for they say there 's nothing in the world to be compared with the pleasures of having a family . Paul . Pauline And I shall have a nice satin gown and a beautiful head dress with great plumes of waving feathers ; and you 'll hear me call my servants  --  " Peter ! Jack ! Have my carriage ready at six o'clock . " Because , you see , I mean to have a carriage . " I have a call to make before I go to the opera . " But I shall only stop there long enough to see the audience and nod to the people of fashion in the boxes .

Gustave Yes ; but as this happiness is yet at some few years ' distance , ca n't we contrive to meet often in the meantime ? Paul . Pauline As we are man and wife , there ought not to be any difficulty . Gus . Gustave There will be though , and a great deal . Paul . Pauline That 's very unjust  --  really , tyrannical . Gus . Gustave So it is . What should they be afraid of ? Paul . Pauline Not much , I should think . Gus . Gustave Mind me , now . There 's a notion come into my head  --  it 's rather wild  --  but in an imposing tone as a wife must obey her husband , I trust , madam , you will not throw any obstacles in the way of my wishes . Paul . Pauline In the same tone If they agree with mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gustave That 's the way in all well regulated families . But mind what 's to be done first . You must get me one of your gowns ; I 'll give you a suit of my clothes , and thus by changing about , we can manage to meet sometimes on your side , sometimes on mine , and always in spite of the master and ma'am . Paul . Pauline Good ; but how shall I get your clothes ? Gus . Gustave As I shall yours , over the wall . In half an hour , let a little song be the signal , and I shall be on the spot . Paul . Pauline And I too . Ah , Gustave , how pleasant our playtimes will be ! They hear on each side the study bell . The boys and girls go off slowly giving signs of ill humor Gus . Gustave This begins well ; however , we must go in . Paul . Pauline Make off quick . Gus . Gustave But tell me first  --  Paul . Pauline Adieu , adieu ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gustave Come , she 's off ! I must make haste to do as much . Dear me ! Dear me ! How disagreeable this is ! I think I like this side better than the other . He climbs the wall to return Heydey ! The boys are gone  --  there 's no getting down without breaking my neck . He remains astride the wall Here I am mounted , but my horse does n't get me a bit forwarder  --  and , to crown all , here comes our master ! I 'm caught ; and my next ride will be upon the stool of repentance . By means of the trellis-work he recedes on the side of the girls ' school , not to be discovered by Mr. Prettyman . Enter Mr. Prettyman with a ladder and a basket of cherries . Gustave observing him Pret. Pirouette Thinking himself alone I was just in time with the cherries ; had they been left any longer , there 'd no longer have been any left . Gus . Gustave Apa rt Master Prettyman 's in the right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out , I 'm afraid the cherry trees would have looked foolish this morning . Pret. Pirouette I can at least offer some to my charming neighbor , Widow Wantmore . Gus . Gustave Aside Dear me ! Dear me ! If he should take it into his head to come this road with his offerings . Pret. Pirouette They are the emblem of the rosy lips and cheeks of the loveliest of widows . To her they go  --  the fruits of spring are the fit offerings of love . My heart pants for the happy moment of wedlock when our two establishments may be one . Gus . Gustave Apar t An excellent idea . Then my legs and arms will be safe , and I can see my wife without danger to my neck . Pret. Pirouette I trust at our appointed meeting presently behind Primrose Hill we shall be able to make both ends meet . Gus . Gustave Apa rt Hallo ! Another rendezvous . This is a day of business and there ca n't be any harm in taking after our teachers . Pret. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its place on purpose , let 's see , if by chance , she may be in the garden . Gus .

I 've half a mind to throw this handful of dust in his eyes . Pret. Pirouette Stay . First let me make sure there 's no one looking . Gus . GustaveApart Oh , you need n't look for trouble . Pret. Pirouette Should I be seen , I do n't know how I should get out of the scrape . Places his ladder and his basket near the wall and regards on all sides Gus . GustaveSeeing the ladder Nor I. He descends by the ladder , while Mr. Prettyman looks out to see if anybody is coming  --  takes some cherries from the basket and escapes , exclaiming It 's a bad rule that wo n't work both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ! Beelzebub is the schoolboy 's friend . Victory ! Exit Pret. Pirouette Alone Now there 's nothing to be feared . I am alone and may sigh freely . He must be clever that can catch me tripping , for what I want in steadiness I make up in caution . If you 'd planned a century , you could n't have done it more effectually . He goes up the ladder softly to see if Widow Wantmore is in the garden , as Pauline enters on the other side with a little parcel Paul . Pauline ' T is time Gustave was at his post . Oh ! How he frightened me ! It 's Mr. Prettyman 's ugly moon face peeping over the wall . She hides in the little bower Is he too coming after clothes to turn himself into a girl ? Enter Widow Wantmore Wid . W. The Widow Wantmore Thinking herself alone ' T is near my dearest Prettyman 's appointed hour . How my poor heart palpitates ! Paul .

The Widow Wantmore No obstacle , I think , can now prevent our marriage . I wish it may take place before the week is over . Mr. Prettyman listens and expresses his joy Paul . Pauline Widow Wantmore is in a hurry . Wid . W. The Widow Wantmore Widowhood makes one sad and pouting . Paul . Pauline She expects a husband will make her merry . Wid . W. The Widow Wantmore I think now I may go and fear nothing  --  all the girls are at their studies  --  Paul . Pauline Present company always excepted  --  Wid . W. The Widow Wantmore Making the most of their time in youth  --  Paul . Pauline While you make the most of yours in age . Wid . W. The Widow Wantmore I hasten to renew the memory of former bliss . But let me beware of being seen , lest somebody should suspect that there may be something at the bottom . Pret. Pirouette Leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top  --  Wid . W. The Widow Wantmore Surprised Bless me ! How you disturbed my tender nerves . They have been so long in repose that these sudden jerks quite overpower them . Pret. Pirouette Joy of my heart ! I have brought this basket of cherries , ripe as my affection and blooming as my hopes , as a tender pledge  --  Apart , looking at the basket as she takes it Hey ! What ! Why they 're half gone  --  the birds have been to the feast without an invitation . Wid . W. The Widow Wantmore Oh , most accomplished of true lovers ! None other can hope to reach the elevation to which you dare aspire . When you have mounted , the ladder must be drawn away . Pret. Pirouette Grasping the wall Lord bless me ! I hope not , I  --  Stupid head that I have ! Pray , forgive me . My nervousness had got the start of my imagination and I took your compliment too literally . Tell me , lovely top of the class of my affections , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Wid . W.

There is no harm in these dovelike meetings , but there 's great harm in their being known . We must be secret , love . The morals of the rising generation ' t is for us to keep . Pret. Pirouette Adieu , most lovely of the boarding school mistresses of the barrier of the virtues . Wid . W. The Widow Wantmore Fie ! Fie ! Funny man ! You make me blush and feel so odd  --  Pret.

Farewell ! Farewell ! Prettyman goes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherries Paul . Paulin e Alone They 're gone at last ! And the cherries too , unluckily ; for , next to Gustave , they 're what I like best . Now for the signal agreed on . Let 's see . What shall I give to him ? Yes , my song of the " Tomtit and the Owl . " That exactly suits . The ugly owl is Mr. Prettyman ; and the nice little tomtit is I. Sings Waiting her lover a tomtit sighed , When all of a sudden an owl she spy 'd And fluttered and hid in dismay . Till the owl flew off ; and she sang , " Do n't fear , For now , little tomtit , the coast is clear , And that fright of an owl 's gone away .

I 'm sure ' t is her voice ! Paul . Pauline I 'll try again and see if he 'll answer . Sings The tomtit listens , but hears no reply ; And though at the slight she could almost cry , No reproaches her pangs betray ; And she only sings  --  " Why linger from me , Since now , little tomtit , the coast is free , And that fright of an owl 's gone away ?

I 'll rig it on ; and ' twill make me twice as full of tricks as ever . Boy. Boy That 's a bold word . Gus . Gustave And then my little coz will soon see what I can do .

And , really , ma'am , as the basket was so long here , when I was not here , and so full when it came here , it appears exceedingly odd that it should be as empty as I find it here . Very odd indeed ! Pru. Prudence Hornbrook Come , come , sir . I do n't understand such sidelong insinuations . Pray , sir , dare you fancy that I ever dreamt of going near your trumpery basket .
