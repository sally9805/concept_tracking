txt We have , on former occasions , recommended the two first volumes of the American Annual Register , in terms decisive of our opinion of the plan and execution of the work . In its plan , we scarce know a work capable of being rendered more valuable , in the whole class of literature to which it belongs . The reader has only to consider how important a series of volumes an American Annual Register would be , commencing with the settlement of the country , or even with the revolution , in order to form an opinion of the claims of this publication to general patronage . For want of a contemporary record , like that which is furnished by these volumes , not a little o ( our history is irretrievably lost . The materials for it , if they exist at all , are dispersed throughout newspapers , magazines* , and congressional documents , which it is in vain , after the lapse of a few years , to attempt to collect . A single volume , like one of those before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain probably more information than the antiquary would be able to collect by years of study . It is not extravagant to anticipate , that , from the time when the publication of the English Annual Register commenced , the history of modern Europe will be written with much greater facility , as welL as in much wider comprehension , than before . And what that work has accomplished for British history in particular , and the history of all other countries as far as they are in // eluded in its plan , will of course be accomplished for American history , by a work , which shall appropriately sustain the character of an American Annual Register . But it is not enough to say , that these works will be useful to posterity . It can hardly be expected of any generation to support expensive works solely for the benefit of their successors . We remark , therefore , farther , that publications of this class , judiciously executed , are of great immediate utility . Their object is , at the end of a year , to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . It is possible , indeed , in reference to occurrences of great interest , that the reading of the newspapers from day to day will leave upon the mind , at the end of the year , a distinct and accurate impression of what has happened . Of such events as Napoleon 's invasion of Russia , and perhaps the emancipation of the Catholics , or the election of General Jackson , and of the main incidents connected with these events , the knowledge derived from the daily journals is as clear and correct as is required . Great single incidents of course attract the notice and dwell on the memory . But let any person , even the most assiduous reader of newspapers , endeavor , at the end of the year , to go over , in his own mind , the political history of Great Britain , or of France , of Columbia , or of Mexico , or even of the United States , and he will find how general and vague his recollection is . He will find himself alternately embarrassed by the redundancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time as important news , ' are of no permanent interest ; and many things , that are of considerable consequence , escape even a vigilant attention . To give a summary then of the political history of the year , in which what is merely superfluous detail shall be omitted , and the main events shall be continuously narrated , is the duty of the Annual Register ; and a duty , which can not be discharged without essential benefit to the politician and general reader . We have already expressed a favorable opinion of the manner in which the former volumes of the American Annual Register have been executed . The present volume we consider quite equal to either of the others . In ordinary circumstances , particularly in the case of a periodical work , we might not deem it strictly proper , to make the successive volumes of a series the subject of otw remarks . Supposing , however , the American Annual Register not yet to have reached a // circulation , to make it wholly independent of the usual means of recommending new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it highly important that this work should be liberally sustained , we have felt it a duty to call the attention of our readers to its merits . This volume comprehends the political history of two years , and is to he followed by an additional volume , containing the public documents , law proceedings , and biographies for the same period . This depari*ire from the strictness of the plan of an Annual Register is stated by the conductor , to have been caused partly by private considerations , although regarded by him as justified by the peculiar character of the events , which transpired during the two years embi'aced in the volume . We are not at all disposed to question the weight of the private considerations alluded to , nor to murmur at the delay . Neither do we deny that the history of 1828 and 1829 , both domestic and foreign , may , in its leading events , be very conveniently written at once . We also look forward with interest to the supplementary volume , which is promised us in the course of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that on the punctual appearance of a volume each year , containing , in due proportion , all the matter pertaining to that year , the success of this work will mainly depend . Without this , the publication may be valuable , but it will not be an Annual Register . It will be a departure from that plan , which experience has shown to be admirably adapted to the end proposed ; and which probably possesses advantages over any other , which , being in substance the same , should in form be considerably different . We forbear to enlarge on the topic , although we deem it one , in which the prosperity of the work is involved , because it could not be pursued without apparent disparagement of the present volume and of that which is expected to complete the two years . Of the historical portion of this volume , about twice as much is devoted to Europe and the States of this Continent south of our Union , as is devoted to the United States . We are not disposed to apportion numerically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the year are severally entitled . Circumstances will of course , at different times , sugge*st*greater fullness in the different chapters of each . We are inclined to think it desirable , however , that the portion devoted to the United States of America should be at least as // ample as all the rest put together . The work is unquestiona .. bly looked to as an . /hnerican Annual Register . The foreign portion of this work has been hitherto , and is , in the present volume , exceedingly well executed ; a good deal better than the corresponding-that is , the foreign part of the English Annual Register . Still , however , the last pained work , the French dnnuaire , and other European publications may be depended on to furnish a satisfactory account of foreign history and politics . But none of them an for us , in any degree , supply the place of an drnerican Annual Register , in the account of our own politics . More than once the English Annual Register , under the head of the History of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lihellous trash of our own daily partisan prints , embodied into a form fit , and , it would seem , designed for no higher purpose , than to be quoted hack into our papers as the judgment of foreigners in respect to our domestic politics . Besides this ; it is notorious , that foreigners can not or will not comprehend America . We want , therefore , both for the instruction of Europe and for reference at home , a full and comprehensive history of our own political year . this part of the work will of course be the most attractive to the foreign reader ; and though , on the first impression , the contrary may be supposed , it will be the most interesting even in the United States . A far larger portion of readers will he gratified and instructed by a well-digested and ample narrative of our own afibirs , than by the most finished chapter on England , France , or Russia . It must not be supposed , that what is familiar to the conductor of the work , whose attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , therefore , be trite to the mass of the community . A good portion of its contents will be positively new to them ; and what was known before will serve to give additional interest to the narrative . Nothing pleases most readers more than a full and connected account of an interesting subject , with which they have already a partial acquaintance . The actors in our domestic annals are all of them men well known in some part of the country-some of them well known in every part . The transactions , in which they are concerned , relating to our common country and to passing interests , will be read by many , who would grow weary over the bulletins of a campaign in distant regions , filled with the exploits of men they never heard of ' before . We wish also as much extension as // possible given to the chapters on the separate States . There is generally in each of the States some important or curious legislation , and some contribution toward the permanent and essential history of the country . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the most difficult to prepare . There is no convenient official source , like the journals of Congress , from which it can be derived , it must be sought in newspapers , and not in a small number of them . We believe , however , that the pains and diligence , bestowed on this part of the work , would be amply rewarded in its increased value . Some States might be dismissed more readily than others ; and the State , which presented very important Iatter one year , might be summarily despatched the next . But the chapters devoted to them , if carefully elaborated , would be those perused with most interest by the mass of the readers of the work . Considerable care must be used in assigning to different States their relative portion of the pages of the work , according to the inteyest likely to be felt throughout the country , in the various topics treated under each head . Thus an abstract of the Revised Code of New York occupies seventy pages of the present volume , and the proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehended in two pages . This perhaps is about the due share of each , in a philosophic aspect of the importance of the respective topics . But in an Annual Register of the politics and history of the country , something might have been retrenched from one article and added to the other . We refer to these instances , however , rather in the way of illustration , to explain our meaning , than of fault-finding . The chapters on American history contain the principal incidents in the legislation of the twentieth Congress , and the chief occurrences in the two last years of the late administration . They are related with as much moderation as can be brought to such topics by any person entertaining opinions of his own . There is no partisan violence in relating events and characterising measures , in which the author must have felt deeply , and in which he knew the public felt as deeply as himself . This moderation of tone belongs to the dignity of historical narrative , and in adopting it , the conductor of the Register has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Considered as a publication intended for perusal abroad , we deem this a very important part of its merits . Although licentiousness is inseparable from a free press , the fero // city of our electioneering discussions has injured us essentially in the judgment of enlightened Europe . It is true , our brethren in England can say but little on this topic , for their press is as licentious as our own , though in a much narrower sphere ; but the condition of the political press , in free countries , is already quoted as the justification of its restraint by the arbitrary governments of the continent . We consider the Editor of this volume of the Register as having done wisely , in abstaining , in a good degree , from the insertion of debates in Congress . As nothing like even a fair specimen of the speeches of the two houses could be given , without unduly occupying the pages of the Register , we conceive it every way better ( though otherwise perhaps contemplated in the original plan of the work ) to confine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress through the stages of legislation , and a general view of the arguments , by which they are supported and opposed . All else must be left to a Register of Debates  --  a work of prime necessity in the political literature of the country . We had hoped that the spirited commencement , which was made by Messrs . Gales &amp; Seaton , a few years ago , would , under a liberal public and private patronage , have resulted in the permanent establishment of such a work . The private patronage , we regret to hear , has not been commensurate with the acknowledged importance of the undertaking , and the public subscription , if we are not misinformed , has been withdrawn . It will be a matter of just regret should these circumstances cause the suspension of a work of very high importance to the legislation of the country . We yet hope that there will be found enough of public and private liberality to warrant not merely the continuation of the work , which was commenced in 1825 , but the collection of the congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American Annual Register , we must repeat the opinion that it is a publication richly entitled to patronage . It is essential to the well-instructed politician and the enlightened general reader . It ought to have a place in all our public and social libraries ; and in the collections of individuals , who study the history of their country and of their age . It is in its nature a work of growing value . The series of volumes will constitute a repository not to be dispensed with , the importance of which will be out of proportion to that of the // single volumes , of which it is composed . It is capable of being made , we fully believe , the most popular periodical work published in the country . It would richly repay the time and attention of any conductor , howevur gifted and respectable . And in exhorting the accomplished gentleman , who is understood hitherto to have presided over its preparation , to persevere in this honorable pursuit , and to make it more and more an object of his studies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading public , as well as his own reputation . If the authority of a name be wanted to stamp a character on the work , let him be reminded , that he is executing a plan , which was first projected by Burke , and for years occupied no small portion of his time.
