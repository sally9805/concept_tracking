txt THERE is a string of islands , occupying the middle third of the coast between Charleston and Savannah , which , from the grand sport of which they are the scene , and because they are good for nothing else , are called the Hunting Islands . They are uninhabited , and overrun with deer ; and occasional parties of gentlemen are formed to go and spend a week there in hunting . On Friday , the txventy-eighth of November , in pursuance of such a hunting expedition , I stepped from the recitation-room into the hounding boat , ( what a change ! ) and away we went . Did you ever move to the dipping of a dozen oars , measuring their strokes to the wild cadence of the boat song ? We were ten , in three boats , with two dozen oarsmen - the distance about forty miles . We carried provisions for ten days - tents , beds in short , all things requisite for house-keeping ; besides warlike stores , and a pack of twelve fine hounds . Away , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neat plantation , with its village of white huts and black tenants ; now we rounded the hare sand-island - the home of the sea-bird ; now we coasted the wide marshes , overgrown with gigantic grass , enlivened only by the hoarse voice of the crane , the shrill cry of the curlew , and the dissatisfied cackle of the marsh hen . Here , the porpoise tumbled his huge bulk about , with clouds of gulls hovering over to catch the fish that he drove to the surface ; there , the bank was covered with ten thousand sheerwat6rs , which arose with confused scream as we approached , and then swept , in their noiseless , beautiful flight , over the face of the water ; anon , we were started by the hurtling of innumerable ducks , which swept past us and over us , clouding the air . We had every variety of incident . The channels , as I have said , were intricate . We got aground fifty times , and shook our // fists at the laughers in the more fortunate boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made on those occasions ; for misfortune is the parent of wit . As we neared the hunting region , marks of human improvement grew scarce . The x-orld began to look solitary , and the sun went down . Not a man in the company had been there for five years . The dim edge of the distinct island at last hove in sight ; hut the tide swept up against us , and the rowers lingered on their oars from exhaustion ; they had not tasted food since early in the morning . We struggled slowly along , and the night came down , black and wild . The course of the boat became a blaze of phosphorescent light , and long flakes of silvery fire fell from the oar* . The blackness around seemed a blank wall - only ourselves were visible by the glitter of the blazing water . We were lost , and wandered along with the stream , when , suddenly , we were aroused hy the merry ringing of the hunting-horn . The boat ahead of us had found the landin * We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out to guide us , and soon found our companions in all the confusion of disembarkation . The tossing of lights on the woody bank , the shouting of men , the heathenish jabber of negroes , the yelping of hounds , were all mingled , and we added our own voices to the general tumult . it was a vile landing , and the servants were obliged to carry us on their hacks about fifty yards to firm ground . I mounted the shoulders of a great stout fellow , and he got almost half way , when , in the very worst of spots , he was bogged above the knees ! He lifted one leg - down went the other ; he changed sides - it was no better ; till , finally , he floundered down and came on all fours ; there he stuck , with fists and heels fast in the mud , and myself perched on his back . I had a gun and other precious articles in my hand . What a situation ! In the dead of nightexpecting every moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dismay - mud on every side . In the agony of my heart , I quoted Morris Brown - Noxv this is what 1 call pleasant ! ' Bowse away ! I roared , with the energy of a sea captain . Massa , I canna stir dis foot nor dat foot , ' groaned the poor fel* low , at the same time making a tremendous flounder to prove the fact . I was satisfied , and shouted for aid . It came at last , and we were pulled out , without loss of time or baggage . I stood on the firm earth , and felt like a man again . I walked to the place of encampment . It was an open spot , in the midst of a thick forest . They were pitching the tents . A huge heap of dry wood , mixed with pitch-pine , rolled up its pyramid of flame ; the stars were visible in a little circle above the tops of the crowded trees overhung us , and the branches , covered with moss , hanging to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the blaze . Forked sticks were driven into the ground , poles laid upon them , and the whole crowned with rough boards - behold our table ! Matters had been so expedited , that xve had a good supper before bed-time - that is , midnight . Oh ! to eat , when one is genuinely hungry . It is the only consideration that would ever induce me to suffer partial starvation . We had only three chairs , reserved for the elder of the tribe ; the rest of us ate standing . How limited are the necessaries of life , when men are bent on being happy ! We afterwards set up a marquee for a dining-room , and arrived at the luxury of sitting at meals on piled trunks and water casks . What a beautiful spot ! ' exclaimed Sir Lucius , folding his hands sentimentally across his coat-pockets , and eyeing the towering blaze , the white tents , the speck of visible sky , and the circuit wall of black forest , while his ear caught the low murmur of the skeleton foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with head and shoulders intruded through the long , narrow aperture of the sleeping tent , while his less intellectual half only seemed to linger outside to hear any further observation on the scenery . So saying , we followed him to bed . The next morning , betimes , we were up for the chase - breakfasted and planned the campaign . The horns sounded , the hounds yelled and leaped and frolicked , in exultation - and away we started . How my heart bounded ! The island is seven miles long and three broad . Long ridges of sand run through it , separated by vallies filled with thickets of myrtle and palmetto and clusters of live oak . The deer harbor in the vallies , but when hard pressed , they cross the ridges*at particular spots . Here the huntsmen take their stands , and shoot them as they dash across . It is but a glance , and requires quick , sure aim . The negroes go into the thickets with the dogs , knock about and shout till they start the game ; soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport begins . I felt my inexperience sorely . So , as I stood alone at my station , I was taking aim at every object about me to get my band and eye used to it , when the yell of the hounds broke , clear , fierce and xvild , not far distant . I started , cocked my gun , and bent towards the thicket . My eye glanced , quick and keen , from side to side . On , on it came , right towards me . I quaked with expectation . I thought I heard the distant bound , when it wheeled and away it went - and away swept the chase after it . I laid down my gun and drew a long breath . The sound grew more distant ; I could just distinguish it from the hum of the forest - then it was lost . Most of the hunters were beyond me , in the direction of the dogs . I moved on slowly - I heard a distant shot- I walked fast- I became exhausted , and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick succession , I sprang up and ran ; I heard the horn calling off the hounds ; I ran faster - again ! - I ran faster ; I puffed and blew ; each minute seemed an age . 1 hallo oed - it was answered ; I stopped and walked . I had passed all the hunters but one , and soon came up with him . He was bending over a fine , fat deer , that lay bleeding at his feet ; the hounds were , some erouching near him , others licking the wounds of their prey . The fine black eye of the sportsman brightened as I came up with him , and pointing with his finger , he silnj ) ly said , Tb it is. , And did you fire all the guns ? All . I shot first at a motion in the bushes ; then this deer crossed the ridge ; the second barrel snapped I re-loaded , and had just put on the last cap , when - brush ! back she came . You see the four shot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast staggered , and I rushed under the thicket ; I sprang down the ridge , threw myself flat on my back , and fired the second between my feet ; she dropped ; you see the shot struck the top of the head ' So speaking , the rest come up . The deer was mounted on the head of a negro . We sent it forward , by way of avant courier , and walked slowly after . It was a drizzly day , and we gave up the chase , save a little skirmishing on the way home , in which the dogs ran a deer directly over my first station . She was over before we came in sight . I sighed , but thanked fortune it was the first day . * * * The next day ( Sunday ) was only memorable for the eclipse . We marched across the island in a body , to witness it from the beach . The scene was one of simple grandeur . The wide ocean ; the island coast ; the solitary world on which we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the gushing sea ; the few puffs of cloud , that lounged lazily in the bright sky , as if spectators of the coming wonder ; - these made the day of the eclipse one of those unaccountable tricks of time that a man wonders at , during the remainder of his life . The beach was much the finest I had ever seen ; it was at least a hundred yards wide , and continuing several miles , as hard and smooth as a floor . The eclipse was total , though there was a slight halo about the edge of the moon . We could see each other , but we looked like a party of ghosts . It was chilly ; the sea became the color of pale ink , and the sky assumed the hue of death . I noticed a flock of sand-birds ; as the world darkened , they seemed affrighted - and at the moment of greatest obscuration , all huddled together by the edge of the water . About a dozen stars were visible , and the darkness lasted about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun poured a sheet of light over the edge of the moon , and it was mid-day again . The change was // electrical , and every man started involuntarily , and uttered an exclamation of surprise . It was a most impressive scene , and I shall not soon forget the eclipse at the Hunting Islands . * * * * * On Monday , we changed our hunting ground . Another of the party and myself coasted the island and then penetrated the interior , but lost our direction and wandered about for four hours in the gloomiest dells and thickets , so dark that they might have been the passage-way to Erebus . We saw neither dogs nor deer ; once , indeed , the chase came close to us , but the myrtles were as thick as pigeons in Ohio . IWTe could not see an inch ahead , and even that poor space was armed with a briar taking deliberate aim at our faces . My pcor friend ran foul one of these thorns and buried it to the hilt in the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose - and the blood dropped from it like water from the eaves ; he roared , and took out his handkerchief to xvipe the afflicted member , and losing that in the confusion , vas obliged to use leaves . He kicked the bushes , in vexation , and tripped on a vine that brought him down , like a tree under the axe . We then began to think of resignation - talked a little philosophy , and scrambled out . We had heard guns all around us , and the winding of horns . Four deer were brought into the camp this day , but I saw not one of them alive . On Tuesday , we hunted the same ground , and killed but one . I had the *ame fortune as heretofore . On Wednesday , we returned to the scene of Saturday 's sport . Now , Fortune , ' Ii said , sweet lady , he propitious ! suffer me to kill one deer - only one ! - and thy altars shall smoke for it . ' We walked a couple of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other , along the ridge . Determining not to miss an opportunity , I cocked both barrels of my gun , and stood listening . The full , animated cry of the hounds soon told me that the game was up ; but , alas it took another direction - became indistinct - and I was just resigning all hope , when a rush in the bushes made me start . It was a deer ; in a moment my gun was at my eye - a glimpse , and I shot and missed him clear . He gave a bound and stopped full before me , looking round for his enemy . I fired the second barrel ; he staggered - dropped his tail , and ran forward towards the next station . I could not stir ; my head throbbed and my frame trembled . A shot ! another ! I ran breathlessly on . Have you got him ? ' Ay , ay ! was the cheering answer . Noxv , he who first wounds the deer has him , by the laws of sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked along leisurely , and enjoyed the glorious reflection . The huntsmen collected at the sound of the horn . The same // young gentleman before mentioned as the hero of Saturday , laid his hand upon my shoulder , and expressed the warmest delight at my first success ; then dipping his finger in the wound , flowing fresh from the heart , he drew a cross of blood upon my forehead , saying- ' I dub thee , kni*ht of the Hunting Islands . ' Still , I confess , the thought that 1 had not killed the animal , tnade me uneasy ; and when we again took our stations , I felt an increased anxiety to better my shot ; but that was not to be expected for the same day . So I murmured some choice fragments of philosophy , saw that my gun was quite ready for instant service , and lent my ear to the woods . Never did I hear so magnificent a cry as burst from the pack almost the instant they xx ore put in . The leaves seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Louder and clearer and more fierce it came down . I saw that the deer must pass by one or two before it came to me . Onward it sounded - and on ward . Not a shot - stran0 e ! It must have passed them So it shall not me ! Vhiz It was the deer , running for his life . From the thicket he could not see me till within fair shot ; and the instant I caught his *limpse , he caught mine . 1-Je doubled on his haunches , then threw himself directly over to go backand all so quick , that Ii was not prepared for it . I aimed at his body , and broke both his hind legs . Away he scrambled , over a ridge within the one on which I stood . I ran after him , thinking to catch him - pooh ! he was out of sight by the time I had ascended the other ridge . Down came the hounds ! The cry was so splendid , that I paused to look at them . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked like devils ; their eyes glared and shot forth living fire ; and all the passions of bedlam seemed to have found a tongue in their yells . I was spell-bound till they passed me , and then followed , with might and main . I was crazy ; kicked down bushes , knocked my head against trees , ran foul of vines , and finally stopped , from mere exhaustion . Suddenly the voice of the hounds ceased , and a wild , pitiful cry filled the whole forest . It was the deer . Again I ran - I flew - I found it , writhing and struggling , in the jaws of the whole pack ; some had it by the throat , others by the legs , and they were stretchinb it in mid-air . At the same time , the other sportsmen came in . The poor animal was raised and bled ; and then , simultaneously , half ' a dozen voices asked - Who shot ? ' I did . ' You ! ' I would not have sold that moment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday . The next day , also , two were brought in . But nothing happened to me , except that I was mistaken for a deer once or twice , and had some guns cocked at me , which occasioned a gentleman to re // mark that I must be growing buckish - an observation wbi*h savors more of facetiousness than originality . Such was our hunt . It was the pleasantest week that I ever passed . We brought in ten deer . Several more were mortally wounded , but got out of the *v*y-scme into the surf and others into the thickets . We returned to Beaufort without any accident , and in high spirits.
