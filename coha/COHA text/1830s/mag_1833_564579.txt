txt MASSACHUSETTS . flnnaal Visit to the State Prison . On Thursday , the 17th of October , His Ex*eIlency Gov . Lincoln , Lieut . Coy . Armstrong , and the Executive Council with the Secretary of the Commonwealth made their annual visit to the State Prison . Reports relatint* to the general state of the Prison , health and moral condition of the convicts , were presented by the B ard of Inspectors , the Warden , Physician , and Chaplain of the Institution , and were read to the Council by the Governor . The favorable character of the reports , and the general prosperity of the Prison , called forth some interestin and highly gratifying remarks from the Governor , in which he spoke oC the difficulties which had been met and overcome in producing that moral reformation in the general concerns of this establishment , which , from its condition , was so much needed , and from which such favorable results had followed . He alluded to the valuable services which had been rendered by a distinguished individual , ( Rev. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the state nuder peculiar obligation to that gentleman for his unwearied perseverance in the cause of prison reformation . After visiting and inspecting the work-shops , Prison , and Hospital , His Excellency and the other visiters repaired to the Chapel , where the convicts were addressed by the Governor in a series of very interesting remarks , occupying nearly an hour in their de*livery . He spoke of the object of their visit , which was to make a personal examination into the conduct of the officers of the prison , and also of the treatment which they received from those placed over them . He spoke of the official relations in which he had , for so long a period , stood to the institution , which , he remarked , would soon terminate , and that he probably was addressing them for the last time . In alluding to the reports received from the Inspectors , Warden , Physician , and Chaplain , of the favorable statements , of the general order , obedience , and industry which had prevailed in the insti tution , he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral improvement and prosperity of the establishment , and the gratification his visit , on this occasion , afforded to himself and his associates in the executive branch of the government . His Excellency therm called to their minds the causes which led to their confinement , and consequent privation of the enjoyments of the social relations of society ; requested them to reflect with seriousness upon the manner in which they had spent their time previous to their commitment , and urged them to make a wise use of the privileges with which they were favored , for a moral and religious improvement . He reminded them of the kind treatment they received from those placed over them , and that they were not subject to that severity which was practised in many similar institutions . On the subject of pardons , his Excellency remarked , that those only who had become thoroughly reformed from their vicious propensities , could expect or would receive such a favor ; and those who were in confinement under a sentence for life , for having been three times committed to this prison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy . They had been discharged again and again ; and had as often committed crime , knowing full well the consequences that inevitably would result from a recommitment to this prison . By their bad example they had forfeited all their rights , and they must , as men capable of knowing right and wrong , be fully sensible that they deserved no other favor than such treatment in prison as its laws and humanity dictated . He remarked , however , that . be would not have even such despair , but they must not expect a remission of their sentences , until , by a long course of imprisonment , and by sincere repentance and a thorough reformation , they had , in some measure , atoned for their misdeeds , and rendered themselves suitable objects of executive clemency . His Excellency closed his remarks , ( of which the above is a very imperfect sketch , ) by expressing his fervent hope // and prayer , that those now in confinemnent would justly estimate the great moral privileges with which they were favored in this institution ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be prepared to enjoy the society of their families and friends in this world , should they he permitted to leave this place , but by unfeigned penitence and contrition of heart , be fitted at last for the enjoyment of that habitation where they may forever live in the presence of a pure and holy God . Convicts . Whole number in the prison , October 1st , 1832 , two hundred and twenty-seven ; received since , one hundred and nineteen . There have been ninety discharged , and six have died during the year , leaving , as the present number in the prison , two hundred and fifty . Of the financial concerns of the institution , we understand that they are even more favorable than they were the previous year . The income of that year exceeded the expenditures by three or four thousand dollars . Bunker-Hill Aurora . NEW-JERSEY . E penses of the Government . The Newark Daily Advertiser says the usual appropriation bill was passed at the late session of the legislature ; giving to the Governor , for the current year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the two Associate Justices , each $1,100 ; the State Treasurer $1000 ; the Law Reporter and Chancery Reporter , each $200 ; the Attorney-General $80 ; the Quarter.Master General $100 ; the Adjutant-General $100 ; the Vice-President of Council , and the Speaker of the House are each allowed $351 ) ; and the members of either House $3 a day during the sitting of the Legislature , and $3 for every twenty miles travel in going to and returning from the seat of government . The Clerks of the two Houses are also each allowed $3 a day , S cents for writing every 100 words in the records , and for copies to the printers . The Sergeant-at-Arms and the Door Keepers , are each allowed $2 a day . It is proper to add that the Governor receives , being ex-officio Chancellor , fees for his Chancery duties , arid that there are perquisites , though iriconsiderable in amount , attached to the dirties of the Justices ofthe Supreme Court . The Attorney-General also receives fees in all cases of criminal conviction .

Mason and Di an 's Line . Mason and Dixon 's Line is so called from the names-Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon-of the two gentlemen who were appointed to run the unfinished lines , in 1761 , between Pennsylvania and Maryland , on the territories subjected to the heirs of the heirs of Penn and Lord Baltimore . A temporary liac had been run , in 1739 , but had not given satisfaction to the disputing parties , although it resulted from an agreement , in 1732 , between themselves . A decree had been made , in 1685 , by king James , delineating the boundaries between the lands given by the charter to the first Lord Baltimore , and those adjudged to his majesty , ( afterwards to William Penn , ) which divided the tract of land between Delaware bay and the Eastern sea on one side , and the Chesapeake bay on the other , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 40th degree of north latitude . A decree in Chancery rendered the King 's decree imperative . But the situation of Henlopen became long a subject of serious , protracted , and expensive litigation-particularly after the death of Penn . in 1718 , and of Lord Baltimore , in 1714-till John , and Richard , arid Thomas Penn , ( who had become the proprietors of the American possessions of their father William , ) and Cecihius , Lord Baltimore ( grandson of Charles , and great grandson of Cecilius , the original patentee ) entered into an agreement on the 10th of May , 1732 . To this agreement a chart was appended , which ascertained the site of Cape lienlopen , and delineated a division by an east and west line running westward from that Cape to the exact middle of the peninsula ; and froni this middle point ( between the bays of Chesapeake and Delaware ) was to be drawn a line northward so as to form a tangent with the periphery of the semicircle drawn around Newcastle ( agreeably to the deed of the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line should be continued northward still , till it reached the 40th degree of latitude , which would be fifteen English miles due south of Philadelphia . Erom this point , a west line was to be drawn across and twenty-five miles beyond the Susquehianna river , to the western limits of Pennsylvanialeaving the line not actually run , though virtually drawn , to be the boundary be-519 // tween Maryland and this state . This was precisely one century after the original charter to the first proprietor of Maryland  --  and was certainly favorable to the heirs of Penn , in consequence , not merely of the decree of James , appointing the 40th degree of latitude as the boundary of Pennsylvania , but from their own calmness and circumspection ; for the grant of Maryland to the Baltimore family , may seem to sanction their possession of territory to the 41st degree . Be that as it may , the necessity of an agreement was urgent from the circumstance of the British government being in treaty with the proprietary of Pennsylvania for the purchase of their rights . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he endeavored to invalidate as soon as the emergency was overcome . Chancery suits , kingly decrees , and , proprietary arrangements , followed ,  - -  which eventually produced the appointment of commissioners to run the temporary line . ' This was effected in 1739 . But the case in chancery being decided in 1750 , new commissioners were appointed who were to ascertain the semicircle described from the centre of NewCastle with a radius of twelve milei . Objections ori , sinatin , , about this centre and the periphery , threw the case again into chancery , to have a recognition of horizontal admeasurement , and of statute miles-which ( with other circumstances ) compelled another agreement in 1760 ; and this effectually terminated such protracted and vexatious altercations . This agreement was enrolled in the English Court of Chancery , and enforced as above mentioned in 1761 . The chart and surveys of the former ( not of the latter ) agreement are among the public records of our commonwealth . American Sentinel . GEORGIA . The following is an extract from the Message of Governor Lumpkin to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and comprises all that is said in the Message having a bearing on the relations between the General and State Governments . Commencin* with a glowing picture of the health , prosperity , and resources of Georgia , and a grateful acknowledgement to the great Author and Disposer of the destinies of men and of nations , for such inestimable blessings , the Message proceeds thus " In the midst of all these multiplied blessings , it is truly mortifying to witness the restless spirit of agitation and political excitement , which has been engendered and vigorously kept up amongst the people , calculated , if not intended , to alienate their affections from their own beloved political institutions . That the value of our Federal Union . should have become a familiar subject of calculation , is truly alarming , and argues little for the patriotism of those who encourage discussion upon such a subject . Who could have believed , ten years ago , that , at this early day , we should have witnessed speculative discussions upon such a theme ; or that it could have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Union of the states , one and indivisible , is no longer the motto of every American citizen ! These " signs of the times " speak volumes of admonition to every lover of constitutional liberty , and should fire the bosom and nerve the arm of patriotism in the cause of the Union . Notwithstanding these threatening evils , it is gratifying to see that our admirable system of free government , based upon the will and affections of the people , continues to unfold the appropriate ability contained in its structure , to withstand the assaults of foreign and domestic foes . The enemica of our government , whether open or insidious-under whatever specious form or pretext-appear to be doomed to discomfiture , whenever they attempt to alienate the affections of the people from that government , which is , ensphatically , the offspring and nursehing of their own effort and care . The people may alter and change , as to them may seem fit ; but that they would destroy that mighty governmental fabric , reared by the toils and cemented by the blood of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not to be expected . The spirit that guided our Washington has hitherto pervaded and saved our country . The champions of civil and religious liberty , of popular rights and constitutional government , have thus far succeeded and triumphed over all opposition . Therefore , we should not be dismayed at the symptoms of yielding integrity and treasonable ambition , which have been engaged in estimating the value , and threatening the dissolution of our Federal Union . I am willing to charge the errors of all such , rather to selfish delusion , than traitorous design ; and will , therefore , hope that the clouds which at present overshadow our political horizon , may quietly pass away , before they gather into a ruinous tempest . 520 // But it has been truly said , " that the condition on which God granted liberty to man , is perpetual vigilance . " We , therefimre , fellow-citizens , as the sentinels of the people , should exercise the anost unceasing vigilance , and suffer not ourselves to be led astray " by every wind of doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhere to the doctrines , of Washington , Jefferson , and Madison , and so far as the influence and example of Georgia will extend , our Republic will be safe . " Internal Improrements . An epitome of a report recently submitted to a public meeting in Georgia , on the success of the schemes of Internal Improvement projected in Virginia , North and South-Carolina , and Georgia , presents the following facts - The Eatonton and Athens roads in Georgia , are links in a grand scheme to intersect the other three states . The Charleston road will be extended to Columbia , without delay ; northwardly , the opening of the Petersburg rail-road , and the commencement of a rail-road " from Norfolk to Fayetteville , ' will end , in a union of successive rail-roads , until Georgia shall be connected directly with Virginia , the capital , and the Northern states . On the south , the same road is to be extended to Columbus and lIontgoinery , carrying , it is expected , considerable travel and trade to the Atlantic shore , whicla has heretofore gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an important feature of the plan . In stating these views , an account is given of the peculiar geographical position of that country , which is worth transcribing . Parts of four states form an immense valley , with no outlet for commerce available to much extent . North-Alabama , East-Tennessee , the western part of North-Carolina , and the Cherokee Counties of Georgia , form , together , a body of land of about twenty-four thousand square miles , surrounded by mountains , lying almost entirely within three hundred and fifty miles of Savannah and Charleston , and with literally no means of reacoing a market , but through the Tennessee river , a long and winding navigation , of which the difficulty is greatly increased by the obstructions of the Muscle Shoals . The average distance from the Ohio and from the Atlantic is nearly the same . The advantage in favor of the latter market is , therefore , greater , other circumstancesbeing equal . to the aInount of the whole expense in time , labor and cost , of reaching an Atlantic market 521 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying these roads into that country , the distance from Knoxville to New-York will be diminished from three thousand to eleven hundred miles of travel , and the time from thirty-five or forty , to about ten days . One third of the line of road is already made . OHIO . Cincinnati Schools . A report of the Board of Trustees of Common Schools in the city of Cinciianati , made to the Councils , is published in the Gazette of that city . About eight thousand dollars have been expended during the year , for tuition , and there is a balance on hand of six thousand five hundred dollars . Nearly three thousand dollars have been expended in buildings , and there are nearly ciaht thousand dollars of a building fund *n hand . The City Council have taken measures to raise by loan the further sum of fifty thousand dollars , authorized by the legislature in aid of Common Schools . The report furnishes no details of the nuinher of schools or scholars , nor the method of instruction . TENN USSEE . Circuit court . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern district of Tennessee , Benjamin Baily , a white was indicted for the murder of another white man , in- the Cherokee county in that state . On a plea of the jurisdiction of the Court , the question of the coristitutioiiahity of an act of Congress , passed on the 3d of March , 1817 , came into discussion . This act provides , that any Indian , or other person , who shatl , withimi the United States , and within any territory beloncing to the , Indians , commit any offence , which if committed in any district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States , would he punishable by their laws , shall suffer the same punishment , as is provided by those laws for the same offences , if con , , nitted in any place or dis riot under the SOlO and axc*usive jurisdiction of the United States . It was lantained on the part of the prosecution , that this act ives jurisdiction to the United States Courto of all crimes or misdemeanors , committed on Indian territory within the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priso . er discharged from the custody of the Marshal , by Mr. Justice McLean , upon the ground , that Congress ha no constitutional power to enact a law for the exercise of general // jurisdiction over any Indian territory whatever , within the limits of a state , except in regard to such offences as relate to commercial intercourse with the Indians , as distinct communities ; such jurisdiction can be only exercised in the territories of the United States , or in places within the states , whereof the jurisdiction has been specially ceded . ALABAMA . During the last two months , considerable difficulty has taken place in Alabama , in consequence of steps taken by the General Government , to remove intruders or squatters from the Indian lands in that state . One of the first steps taken , resulted in the death of a person named Owens . lie had , it is stated in the Charleston , S. C. Courier , dispossessed one man of his house and land , and a young girl of a valuabl farm , robbed the Indian graves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other illegal acts . For these , the United States Marshal ordered him to leave the Indian County , but he refused , and when force was used to expel him , he attempted to blow up the Marshal and his party with gunpowder , during which attempt he was shot . The state had previously laid out the whole Creek nation into Counties , and ordered the Judges of the Circuit Courts to hold terms in them as in other Counties . At the next t rm of the Court for Russel County , after the death of Owens , a bill of indictment was found against certain soldiers of Fort Mitchel , " for the muder of Col. Hardeman Owens , ' and subpenas were issued for the file men and for Major McIntosh , the Commander of the Fort . The Major refused to pay any regard to the mandate of the Court , and would neil suffer his men to be arrested . An attachment was then issued. , which Major McIntosh would not allow to be served , and the Sheriff made oath that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . Upon this , the Court sent express to the Governor of the state , for military power sufficient to enforce the doings of the Court . A correspondence then ensued between the Governor , Gayle , and the proper officers of the General Goverment , in which he st ted his views of the jurisdiction , contending that it rested with the state government , and not with the United States . The Secretary of War , in reply , denies that any thing stated by the Governor oes to exempt the Indian lands in the state of Alabama , from the same measures that have heretofore always been taken by the United States in such cases , and cites similar cases as having occurred under former administrations . The Secretary of War con-. cludes the correspondence with stating that the troops of the United States have been divected to remove all intruders from the public lands . " They are instructed to do this with as much moderation as possible . Time has been given by the Marshal till the 15th January next , for time peaceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has sent Francis S. Key , Esq . Attorney forthe District of ' Columbia , to Alabama , with instructions to assist the United States Marshal , to have the troops submit to all legal process without resistance and without hesitation . But , in order to guard against all vexatious proceedings , to have the case , in every instance , brought immediately before a Judge of the United States , for his determination . Mr. Key is also instructed to aid the Attorney of the District , to examine the whole state of the affair , and especially to take care , that while the laws of the United States are enforced , the laws and the judicial authorities of Alabama should he duly respected.
