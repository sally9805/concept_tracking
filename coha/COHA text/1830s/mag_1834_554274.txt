txt ROUSSEAU declared that he must visit the man who had witnessed two summers in a single year ; and readers in general will be glad to learn something of the personal history of one , who , after receiving the applause of Burke and Johnson , remained silent for more than twenty years , and came forth at last to receive the homage of another generation . In truth , when we speak of Crabbe , we feel as if we were speaking of one who belonged rather to the last century , than to ours ; yet there is no other poet , whom the public have known so favorably and so long , of whose history they know so little ; and his son has performed an acceptable service , as well as a filial duty , in treasuring up all that can now be remembered of a man of great ability and worth ,  --  of a poet , distinguished for his manly and original powers . We shall avail ourselves of the contents of this volume , in order to present such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crabbe , as may be required to illustrate a cursory view of his writings . Mr. Crahhe was horn at Aldhorough , on the Christmas eve of 1754 . The circumstances of his family were very humble , and he has himself told us , with good humored sarcasm , of the vanity of one of his ancestors , who endeavored to repair in some degree the unkindness of fortune , by dignifying the family name , originally Crab , with the addition of two final letters . His father , after passing several years in the itinerant occupation of a schoolmaster , was at length installed in the offices of warehouse-keeper , and deputy-collector of the port of Aldborough , to which he afterwards added that of collector of the salt duties , or salt-master , as this officer is usually denominated . He appears to have united many valuable traits of character with repulsive sternness and severity ; while his wife , on the other hand , to whom Crabbe often alludes in terms of affectionate veneration , was one of those beautiful examples of retiring Christian virtue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found but in the shade . There // was little in the aspect of his native village to charm a poet 's fancy : it was a barren and deserted spot , situated between the base of a low cliff and the shore of the German ocean ; its dwellings were like those which are not unfrequently seen on the sands of our own coast , appearing as if draxvn up at anchor on the shore ; and it was peopled by a *vild and amphibious race of fishermen and sailors , competently versed in the accomplisliments which are apt to beset the men of perilous adventure . The landscape , notwithstanding the attempt made by some hardy poet to describe it as a scene of beauty , presented little to the eye excepting a desolate succession of unbroken heath and sand , enlivened with a meagre covering of weeds and rushes ; there was in fact nothing in the prospect to excite or fire the poetical imagination , but the ever varying aspect of the ocean , on which , as is obvious from all Crabbe 's writings , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , if possible , still less inviting than the face of nature . His home was rendered sad and desolate by the harshness of his father ; and there were none abroad among whom his own tastes could find the least encouragement or sympathy . His youthful proficiency in the art of managing a fishing boat was so indifferent , that his father would sometimes ask , in the bitterness of his heart , What that thing would ever be good for ? ' it should be stated , however , that the father had sense enough to discover the talent of his son , and , as the latter afterwards acknowledged with gratitude , labored to provide him with such means of education as his own limited resources would allow . But the literary toleration of the salt-master did not extend to so crying a heresy as poetry : he was a subscriber to some philosophical magazine , the gravity of whose pages was regularly enlivened with a score or two of verses ; these it was his custom to cut out when he sent the numbers to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession by his son , who found in them his first models of the art , in which he afterwards excelled . In his eleventh or twelfth year , after having attended a village school , for what period we are not informed , he was removed to another , where he was expected to prepare himself to become apprentice to a surgeon . He is said here to have exhibited a decided taste for mathcmatical pursuits , as well as for poetry , in which he made his first essay in the form of a salutary caution to a school girl , not to suffer herself // to be too much elated by the triumph of displaying new ribbons on her bonnet . Some time elapsed , after he left this school , before he could find an opportunity of entering upon the business he intended to pursue . A portion of this time was spent in musing , in his solitary walks by the sea shore ; but the greater part was occupied in piling butter and cheese on the quay at AId borough , under the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and least of all that which was consecrated to poetic dreams . This occupation was long remembered by the poet with little satisfaction . At length , in his fourteenth year , the long expected opportunity was presented ; and he set forth , with a heavy heart , to become apprentice to a surgeon at Wickham Brook . His pursuits , even there , were not wholly of a scientific kind ; his master distributed his time impartially between the arts of husbandry and healing , and his apprentice was the bed-fellow and fellowlaborer of his plough boy . In this way , he passed about two years ; then he removed to a more eligible situation , to complete the term of his apprenticeship under the direction of a surgeon at Woolridge , a few miles distant from his native village . Poetry still continued to occupy a large share of his attention : he was never much in love with his profession , though he devoted himself to it with tolerable earnestness . He found a source of inspiration , which youthful poets never wait for long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niece of a wealthy farmer , who twelve years afterwards became his wife , and in the mean time stimulated his literary zeal by encouragement , which proved in the result to be both fortunate and wise . A small premium for a poem on the subject of Hope , was offered by the proprietor of some Ladies ' Magazine : this prize it was his fortune to gain , and the success , trifling as it was , set all the springs of his poetical enthusiasm in motion . It was here , also , that he published a poem , entitled Inebriety , ' a name of rio particular attraction ; this work is said to exhibit much facility of versification and maturity of thought , but attracted little notice at the time . Mr. Crabbe 's term of apprenticeship ended in 1775 ; he then returned to Aldborough , hoping to find some means of completing his professional education in London ; but his father 's means were inadequate to this demand , as well as to maintaining him in idleness at home : he returned therefore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubly irk // some by new circumstances of domestic sorrow . The habits of his father had undergone that change , which fills the cup of affliction to the brim ; and the health of his mother , in whose happiness his own was hound up , was sinking under a fatal and quick decline . Impelled less by choice than a sense of its necessity , he devoted himself with more zeal than before to the study of his profession , and the sciences connected with it ; particularly botany , which was then and afterwards his favorite pursuit . At length his father found the means of sending him to London , with a purse too slender to attend lectures or to walk the hospitals , and only with the hope , as he himself said , of picking up a little surgical knowledge as cheaply as he could . In the course of a few months , he returned to Aldhorough , but with no propitious change in his prospects or his fortune . There he became assistant to a surgeon , who soon retired from the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself : but he had a rival in the field , and his own practice was the least productive which the place afforded . His patients , who saw his botanical researches , thought it unreasonable that they should be called upon to pay for medicines collected in the fields and ditches . On the whole , his prospects were not very encouraging , and not the least of his afflictions was a sense of his deficiency in professional knowledge and skill . A transient gleani of sunshine broke out in 1778 , when the Warwickshire militia were quartered in his neighborhood , with whose officers , as their medical attendant , he formed some useful intimacies . He felt , however , that Aldborough was no place for him , and resolved to take the earliest opportunity to leave it . It was late in the year 1779 , at the close of a cold and gloomy day , when , as he was wandering on the bleak cliff above the village , he determined to abandon his profession , and embark on the uncertain sea of literary adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as dark and desolate as his own thoughts , and , as he gazed upon it , resolved to go to London and to venture all . His prospects must have indeed been melancholy , to impel him to a resolution , apparently so hopeless . His health was not firm ,  --  the reception of his poetical attempts had not been flattering , and his nerves were ill calculated to wrestle with adversity . There was not a single friend in the metropolis , on whom he could rely for aid . He had also to endure the reproaches of his father , who did not , however , labor much to // change his purpose . The means of effecting it were yet to be found ; his own immediate friends were unable or unwilling to supply them , and he applied to Mr. Dudley North , to whom his father had been useful in some political canvass , for the loan of five pounds . The letter , in which he made the application , was afterwards described by that gentleman as a very extraordinary one : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds in his pocket , a case of surgical instruments , and a box of clothing , the whole stock of his worldly fortune , he embarked on board a little sloop , and took his way to London . It was in the year 1780 , that he reached that city ; a propitious period , as his biographer remarks , for an adventurer in poetry , if indeed the good fortune of a poet can he said to consist in the absence of a rival . Goldsmith , Gray , and Churchill were dead ; Johnson had long before abandoned poetry , and was drawing near the close of his eminent career ; the genius of Cowper , which bloomed , like the witch-hazel , in the late dUtumn of his years , had not yet been revealed ; and the echo of the fame of Burns had hardly crossed the Scottish border . His biographer is , however , mistaken , if he supposes that the demand for poetry in the literary market is governed by the extent of the supply ; and who was to assure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the admiration of the world ? He came without a patron ; he could claim but a single acquaintance in London , and she was the wife of a linen draper in Corahill , not particularly likely to forward his literary projects , though kind and liberal in her attentions . He took lodgings at the house of a hairdresser , near the Exchange , and set himself , with a firm and manly spirit , about the doubtful task before him ; first transcribing the poetical pieces he brought with him from the country , composing one or two dramas and essays in prose , and laboring to improve his versitication , and to become familiar with such books as he found at his command . Some of his intimates , at this period , were in circumstances not unlike his own , and were similarly fortunate in their subsequent life . Among them was Mr. Bonnycastle , late master of the Military Academy at Woolwicb , and Isaac Dalby and Reuben Barrow , both mathematicians of distinguished eminence . It deserves to be recorded to his honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety and depressed by poverty , he kept his mind always fixed on the object of his pursuit , neither yielding to // the sore teniptations of adverse fortune , nor ever sinking in despondency . Some of his pieces were offered to the booksellers , and were rejected ; he tried new subjects , and labored still harder than before , but with no better success . An anonymous poem , called The Candidate , ' was published at his own charge , but found no public welcome ; and the failure of his bookseller compelled him to take refuge in the last shelter to which a sensitive mind can resort , an application for pecuniary aid to strangers . For this he first applied to Lord North , but in vain ; a similar appeal to Lord Shelburne produced no answer . After addressing several letters to that coarsest of illustrious personages , Lord Chancellor Thurlow , he received a cold reply , purporting that his lordship 's avocations left him no leisure to read verses . In his journal , written at this time , he says I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawned my watch , am in debt to my landlord , and finally , am at some loss how to eat a week longer . ' Another extract from the same journal will afford an idea of the spirit and temper , with which he bore himselC under these hard circumstances . It is the vilest thing in the world to have but one coat . My only one has met with a mischance , and how to manage it is some difficulty . A confounded stove 's modish ornament caught its elbow , and rent it half away . Pinioned to the side it came home , and I ran deploring to my loft . In the dilemma , it occurred to me to turn tailor myseig but how to get materials to work with puzzled me . At last I went running down in a hurry , with three or four sheets of paper in my hand , and begged for a needle and thread to sew them together . This finished my job , and , but that it is somewhat thicker , the elbow is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this volume , is quite valuable , as presenting a picture of a maniy spirit , tried by a kind of suffering , which the heart of every one will tell him is severe . There is nothing of querulousness in it : no more of despondency , than the circumstances of his situation could not fail to excite ; it betrays throughout the energies of a strong mind , and the tranquillity of a religious one . Mr. Crabbe 's repeated applications to ex ojjlcio patrons having thus proved fruitless , he resolved to make one final effort : and he fortunately directed himnself to one , who was as much above the hereditary or created peers around him in generous feeling , as he was in the miraculous endowments of his mind . lIe addressed the following letter to Edmund Burke . // Sir , I am sensible , that I need even your talents to apologize for the freedom I now take ; but I have a plea which , however simply urged , will , with a mind like yours , Sir , procure me pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are without a friend , without employment , and without bread . Pardon me a short preface . I had a partial father , who gave me a better education than his broken fortune would have allowed ; and a better than was necessary , as he could give me that only . I was designed for the profession of physic ; but not having wherewithal to complete the requisite studies , the design but served to convince me of a parent 's affection , and the error it had occasioned . In April last I came to London , with three pounds , and flattered myself this would be sufficient to supply me with the common necessaries of life , till my abilities would procure me more ; of these I had the highest opinion , and a poetical vanity contributed to my delusion . I knew little of the world , and had read books only ; I wrote , and fancied perfcction in my compositions ; whenl wanted bread they promised me affluence , and soothed me with dreams of reputation , whilst my appearance subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed me my mistake . I see my trifles in that which I think the true light ; and whilst I deem them such , have yet the opinion that holds them superior to the common run of poetical publications . I had some knowledge of the late Mr. Nassau , the brother of Lord Rochford ; in consequence of which I asked his Lordship 's permission to inscribe my little work to him . Knowing it to be free from all l ) olitical allusions and personal abuse , it was no very material point to me to whom it was dedicated . His Lordship thought it none to him , and obligingly consented to my request . I was told that a subscription would be the more profitable method for me , and therefore endeavored to circulate copies of the enclosed Proposals . 1 am afraid , Sir , I disgust you with this very dull narration , hut believe me punished in the misery that occasions it . You will conclude that , during this time , I must have been at more expense than I could afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The printer deceived me , and my little business has had every delay . The people with whom I live perceive my situation , and find me to be indigent and without friends . About ten days since , I was compelled to give a note for seven pounds , to avoid an arrest for about double that sum which I owe . I wrote to every friend I had , but my friends are poor likewise ; the time of payment approached , and I ventured // to represent my case to Lord Rochford . I begged to be credited for this sum till I received it of my subscribers , which I believe will be within one month ; but to this letter I had no reply , and I have probably offended by my importunity . Having used every honest means in vain , I yesterday confessed my inability , and obtained with much entreaty , and as the greatest favor , a week 's forbearance , when I am positively told , that I must pay the money , or prepare for a prison . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appeal to you , Sir , as a good , and , let me add , a great man . I have no other pretensions to your favor than that I am an unhappy one . It is not easy to support the thoughts of confinement ; and I am coward enough to dread such an end to my suspense . Can you , Sir , in any degree , aid me with propriety ? - Will you ask any demonstrations of my veracity ? I have imposed upon myself , but I have been guilty of no other imposition . Let me , if possible , interest your compassion . I know those of rank and fortune are teased with frequent petitions , and are compelled to refuse the requests even of those whom they know to be in distress it is , therefore , with a distant hope I venture to solicit such a favor : but you will forgive me , Sir , if you do not think proper to relieve . It is impossible that sentiments like yours can proceed from any but a humane and generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow , and if I have not the happiness to obtain credit with you , I must submit to my fate . My existence is a pain to myself and every one near and dear to me is distressed in my distresses . My connexions , once the source of happiness , now embitter the reverse of my fortune , and I have only to hope a speedy end to a life so unpromisingly begun : in which ( though it ought not to be boasted of ) I can reap some consolation from looking to the end of it . I am , Sir , with the greatest respect , your obedient and most humble servant , GEORGE CRABBE . ' It is not easy to read any thing relating to Edmund Burke , without pausing for a moment , to indulge in the thousand recollections , which gather round his name . He was a roan , whose like has been seldom seen in the sphere of human intelli *ences , and will not soon be seen again . Ahnost in his youth , he rose to that elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not many examples to show ; and shortly afterwards , he stood without a rival in the long line of her living or departed orators ; - heyond and above them nil in that affluence of thought , deep practical sagacity , an ( l *nrpns*ing glory of rhetorical ornament , which make the // voice of real eloquence as commanding in future ages , as in the moment of its most important victories . He combined the fervor of the most generous enthusiasm , with unerring insight into all the springs and sources of human character and action ; deep scorn of all that was low and sordid with constant solicitude to advance the well-being of his race : and it might almost be considered a triumph of our nature , that one so highly gifted should have been so disinterested and confiding , so earnest in the cause of human happiness and right . It may be , that some of his political views , weighed in our balances and measured by our standards , are found wanting ; but such a mind could not but be noble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not imperfections of the heart : they were the wreaths of mist , which intercept the glories of the morning sun , while they are kindled into beauty by its light . It was indeed a generous and manly spirit , to which the affecting appeal of the young adventurer was made . Men , who are engaged in conducting the destinies of nations , have rarely leisure to attend to individual concerns ; the wholesale good which occupies their thoughts seems to acquit them of the obligation to be benevolent by retail . At this l ) eriod , the mind of Mr. Burke was much absorbed in the fierce struggles of parliamentary war . His pecuniary circumstances were by no means those of affluence : of the pride or vanity of being deemed a patron , he had absolutely none ; his charities were so unobtrusive , that he evidently thought them nothing more than daily acts of duty . There was probably nothing very peculiar in the circumstances of iVir . Crabbe ; claims of equal strength , so far as his could then be known , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to Mr. Burke only as a young man of merit in distress . He went , ' says his son , into Mr. Burke 's room , a poor young adventurer , spurned by the opulent , and rejected by the publishers , his last shilling gone , and all but his last hope with it : he . came out virtually secure of almost all the good fortune that , by successive steps , afterwards fell to his lot : - his genius acknowledged by one whose verdict could not be questioned ,  --  his character and manners appreciated and approved by a noble and capacious heart , whose benevolence knew no limits but its power ,  --  that of a giant in intellect , who was , in feeling , an unsophisticated child ,  --  a bright example of the close affinity between superlative talents , and the warmth of the generous affections . ' Mr. // Burke immediately received him under his roof , and proceeded to examine his compositions , with the view of selecting a porlion of them for the press . The Library , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his purpose ; he took the manuscripts himself to Dodsley , and gave the whole weight of his critical decision in their favor . The worthy bookseller indeed declined to take the hazard of the publication , but used every effort to procure for them a rapid sale , and uniformly treated the author with a liberality , which was always gratefully acknowledged . Of these poems , The Lihrary ' was published first , and was shortly afterwards followed by The Village . ' The latter is a much better example of Crabbe 's peculiar power , than the former ; we shall therefore detain our readers for a moment by some remarks upon its style and character . It was the principal object of the writer to represent rural character , and scenery , and manners as they are , without much regard to that rule of taste , which rejects from the picture all those incidents , which might impair its pleasing and harmonious effect . The venerable pastoral had been transported from old times and other climates , just as Chinese pagodas and Grecian temples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving an artificial aspect to the scene , quite at variance with the purposes of nature . It was cherished by modern poets with as much zeal , as the French dramnatists adhere to their Greek model , and of course was cold and unnatural to those , whose imaginations were too faint to clothe the fields of Albion with the verdure of Arcadia , or to convert ploughmen and day laborers into the musing shepherds of the golden age . Gay 's Pasrorals , intentionally coarse and ludicrous as they are , are more true to nature than those of Pope ; because these were never designed to be faithful to nature , hut only to present a pleasing copy of a work of ancient art . Goldsmith 's descriptions have more of truth about them , but the sunlight rests on these as on our landscape in the Indian summer ; there is a soft haze which veils the ruder features of the prospect , and the dreary sky and gathering storm are kept entirely from the view . Crabbe 's error was just the opposite one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village life , and in his own depressed and sad circumstances , they occupied and filled his imagination ; he had himself experienced what others only sung , and had found it cheerless as the valley of the shadow of death . We all // know how much our impressions of scenery and modes of life are governed by our feelings ; the brightest sun is cold and melancholy to the mourner , and the dreariest landscape pleasing to the eye , when we ourselves are happy . Crabbe saw the country without pleasure , and left it without regret ; to him it presented no recollections but those of disappointed hope : and he accordingly describes it with a stern and powerful hand , without compunction or mercy , and with colors too severely true . The Village ' opens with a merciless rebuke of the fond Corydons , ' who have studiously disregarded truth and nature in their pictures of rural life . The author avows his determination to reveal those real ills , which have been hitherto concealed beneath the vain trappings of poetic pride ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not of green woods and sunny streams , of an innocent and artless race ,  --  but a delineation , as powerful and vivid as it is repulsive , of the barren heaths of his native village , and the beings who inhabit it . Lo ! where the heath , with withering brake grown o'er , Lends the light turf that warms the neighboring poor : From thence a length of burning sand appears , Where the thin harvest waves its withered ears ; Rank weeds , that every art and care defy , Reign o'er the land , and rob the blighted rye ; There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar , And to the ragged infant threaten war ; There poppies , nodding , mock the hope of toil ; There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil ; Hardy and high , above the slender sheaf ; The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf ; O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a sh*.de , And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade ; With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound , And a sad splendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched arts adorn , Betrayed by man , then left for man to scorn : Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose , While her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose ; Whose outward splendor is but folly 's dress , Exposing most , when most it gilds distress . Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race , With sullen wo displayed in every face ; // Who far from civil arts and social fly , And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye . ' These are scenes , in which nature has been sparing of her bounty ; the poet now turns to those where plenty smiles ; but there , too , he finds a contrast between apparent comfort and real misery , which throws the latter into even deeper shade . The laborers hoard up aches and anguish for their declining years by exposure to the sun and storm ; they toil with earnestness , hoping to forget their wretchedness in the strong effort of manly pride ; yet they sink to the earth beneath that hopeless poverty , which murders peace ; and go down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . The gates of the village poor house are thrown open to receive its most unwelcome guests . There is yon house that holds the parish poor , Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door ; There , where the putrid vapors , flagging , play , And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day There children dwell who know no parents ' care ; Parents , who know no children 's love , dwell there ! Heart-broken matrons , on their joyless bed , Forsaken wives , and mothers never wed : Dejected widows , with unheeded tears , And crippled age , with more than childhood 's fears : The lame , the blind , and , far the happiest they ! The moping idiot and the madman gay . Here , too , the sick their final doom receive , Here brought , amid the scene of grief , to grieve , Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow , Mixed with the clamors of the crowd below ; Here , sorrowin g , they each kindred sorrow scan , And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reverend age provide , And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride ; But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh , And pride embitters what it ca n't deny . ' Here is in truth a mass of misery , which reminds one of Virgil 's description of the gate of Tartarus . The village doctor , with fate and physic in his eye , enters this abode of wretchedness , to insult the victim , whom he means to kill ; hurries over some habitual queries , without waiting for a reply , and rushes to the door , leaving his patient to sink into the grave . The dying poor man asks the consolations of religion , and the murmuring nurse reluctantly summons the parish priest : // A jovial youth , who thinks his Sunday 's task As much as God or man can fairly ask : The rest he gives to loves and labors light , To fields the morning , and to feasts the night ; None better skilled the noisy pack to guide , To urge their chase , to cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots through halfthe day , And , skilled at whist , devotes the night to play ; Then , while such honors bloom around his head , Shall he sit sadly by the sick man 's bed , To raise the hope he feels not , or with zeal To combat fears that ev'n the pious feel ? ' Death comes at last , in a form far less repulsive than that of the overseer or church warden ; the rejoicing parish cheerfully pay the frugal fees of interment ; the mourners , sedately torpid and devoutly dumb , ' enter the church ; the fox-hunting priest is too busy to perform the last religious offices over one so humble , and the unblessed remains are committed to the dust . This is the destiny of the aged and the friendless ; but what is the condition of the young , who , if any can be so , are full of enjoyment and of hope ? They have some brief intervals of leisure and tranquillity , when the sabbath returns ; but their employer is all the while murmuring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one day in seven . The stillness of the day of rest is broken by the clamor of vulgar debauchery : slander pours its bitterness into the shallow cup of pleasure ; and the day closes with ale-house squabjzinles and coarse licentiousness . Such is the portrait of rural life , given by a poet of originality and power ; by one , who had seen what he described , and had sufficient purity of purpose to intend , at least , to describe it faithfully . Every one will see , from the sketches and the extracts we have given , that it is a dark and powerful representation , designed to shadow forth the same forbidding views of life , which are so vividly displayed in the prose and poetry of Johnson . Life is a sphere , of which the pastoral poets saw only the brilliant side , while Crabbe , at this period , was familiar only with the dark one ; they all wanted some moral Mercator 's projection , by which both hemispheres might be at once presented to the eye . We doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to do this , they must carry with them a conviction of their truth . Mr. Crabbe // inverted the maxims of the Greek painter , in the execution of his portrait of the Queen of Love ; instead of selecting and combining beauties , he left no blemish or deformity untouched , and produced a whole , every part of which might be true to nature , while its general impression was as false as it was frightful . But moral defects are the first to be forgiven : men were weary of the small poets who had undertaken to amuse them in the absence of the chief performers , and were glad to welcome one , who revived the ancient inspiration ; they saw in Crabbe a poet of real abilities , who , if he resorted to old themes , treated them in a manner rarely witnessed before ; they saw a model of versification , as finished and far more vigorous than that of Goldsmith , and inferior in his own language only to Pope . No wonder , under these circumstances , that the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this period , were however brief and few : and those of his later years are so different in character , and so much more varied than these , that it would be wholly out of place here to offer any general remarks upon his rank and ability as a poet . We shall therefore pursue the brief sketch , which we proposed to give of the prominent incidents of his life . The liberality of Mr. Burke was equally active and unwearied . At his table , Mr. Crabbe became intimately known to that illustrious circle , of which his friend was the chief ornament ,  --  to Reynolds , Fox , and Johnson , . - all of whom appear to have appreciated his abilities , and to have treated him with marked respect and kindness . Johnson , in particular , whose critical word was law , read The Village ' in manuscript , and pronounced upon it a panegyric , of which he was never very prodigal . The views of life which it presented , so similar , as we have already intimated , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of this complacency ; but however this may have been , the eulogy was just ; and when Johnson applauded , the lesser critics felt entirely safe in joining in the chorus . Even the Lord Chancellor , to whom Crabbe , after the rejection of his application , had addressed a severe poetical remonstrance , now requested an interview , at which he addressed him with the words , The first poem you sent to me , Sir , I ought to have noticed ,  --  and I heartily forgive the second . ' He at the same time requested the satirist to accept a bank note of one hundred pounds , and assured him , that when he should take orders , which , by the advice of Mr. Burke , he // was about to do , more substantial evidences of regard should be afforded him . in the year 1781 , his purpose was effected . He was ordained as a priest , and became a curate to the rector of his native village . On returning to Aldborough , under circumstances far different from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind , which confirmed his early impressions of the character of rural life . His poetical reputation was not one , which the villagers were well calculated to appreciate ; those jealousies and hearthurnings , which are sure to follow the possessor of unexpected good fortune , made his residence uncomfortable ; his excellent mother , to whom he not unfrequently alludes in his writings , with a tenderness and feeling , resembling those with which Pope has preserved the memory of the guardian of his early years , had sunk beneath affliction and disease ; and his father had diminished the few comforts of his home by an alliance with one little calculated to repair the loss . After a brief sojourn , Mr. Crabbe accepted the place of domestic chaplain to the I ) uke of Rutland , and took up his residence at Belvoir Castle . Some circumstan.ces are related by his biographer , which tend to show that he was not inclined to regret the separation from his patron , which took place shortly after , on the departure of the Duke to assume the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lord Chancellor , after assuring him , with some of those emphatic asseverations with which his conversation was apt to beembroidered , thathe was aslike Fielding 's Parson Adams as twelve to a dozen , presented him with two small livings . He was now united in marriage to the early friend , who had watched his progress to competency and fame through many weary years . Not long afterwards , his old friend the Lord Chancellor , at the instigation of the Duchess of Rutland , and sorely against his inclination , gave him the living of Muston , in the vicinity of Belvoir Castle . On the first suggestion of this exchange , the keeper of the royal conscience had roundly sworn , that he would make it for no man in England ; hut a lady was the intercessor in this instance , so that there was no infraction of the vow . itere , in 1785 , he pubished the Newspaper , ' a brief and not veiny original satire ; and then sunk into a repose , compared with which the slumber of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not until the expiration of twenty-two years , that his other * began to be iss*ieinl from the press . // This persevering silence , on the part of one , who had no reason to complain of a want of public favor , has occasioned much speculation ; we think , however , that it is more easily accounted for than his subsequent reappearance . It is very obvious , from the sketch of his character given in this volume , that lie had no overweening confidence in his own powers the encouragement of Burke and Johnson , to say nothing of the pressure of severe necessity , had overborne his scrul ) les hitherto ; but that spur to effort was removed , and he had acquired a capital of fame sufficient for his wishes . Men of sensitive minds are not unfrequently less reluctant to see their stock diminishing by time , than to risk it on a doubtful venture ; they follow the example of Pope 's father , who retired from business in the prime of life , deposited all his property in a stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and fortune came to an end together . Mr. Crabbe was not one of those who look on poetry as pastime . There were various other engagements to which he more readily inclined ; and he appears , also , to have been at all times scrupulous to permit nothing else to interfere with the rigorous discharge of duty . Goldsmith 's beautiful description of the religious character of the priest of Sweet Auburn , would not have been inapplicable to him . He was always found at the bedside of the sick and dying ; his parishioners unanimously accorded to him the touching eulogy , that no sympathy was like his . ' During the whole period of his duties as a country clergyman , he gratuitously gave to all the benefits of his old professional skill and his poetical reputation , great as it is , seems valueless in the comparison with that which he merits for the assiduous discharge of every moral and religious duty . Earthly fame has no rewards to offer , like those which follow him , who ministers with fidelity , however humbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high intellectual gifts with an almost child-like simplicity . As a preacher , he was eloquent and impressive , and though very regardless of ceremony , entirely tree from affectation . I must have some money , gentlemen , ' was the public notice which his parishioners received of the *i pproaeh of tithe day . If the evening began to fall before the conclusion of his discourse , lie would remove to a pew near a window , and stand upon a bench to finish it ; these were not indications of a contempt of ordinary forms , but of the forgetfulness of one , who was too sincere to be solicitous about his manner . // We have just intimated , that Mr. Crabbe had no undue confidence in his own powers : he was at all times too ready to follow the advice of others , whose capacity and judgment were not equal to his own ; and the world is probably a loser by this infirmity . Botany was always his favorite pursuit ; he was scarcely ever without a flower in his hand , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for some years in preparing an essay on this subject . It was written in English , and this the Vice-Master of Trinity College considered as nothing less than high treason against the majesty of the Latin tongue . This absurd suggestion discouraged him , and the work was never completed . Among his other avocations , was that of writing romances , for which he was in some respects eminently fitted ; no man surpassed him in descriptive power and keen scrutiny of character , and we can not doubt that his delineations would have been full of energy and truth . As ill fortune would have it , these too fell victims to domestic criticism . One of them was entitled Widow Grey , ' but of this we have no memorial . A second bore the name of ' Reginald Glanshawe , or the man who commanded success . ' It opened with a description of a wretched room , which his wife pronounced inferior in effect to similar descriptions in his poems ; on this judicious hint , he made a bonfire of the whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivate his poetical powers , are hardly suffi&amp;ient to atone for her fatal gift of criticism in the present instance . Another sacrifice of the same kind was offered on his own account , perhaps in order to show his gratitude for the advice of his friends , by following it beyond both the spirit and the letter . This consisted of a series of poems which he had offered to Dodsley , who refused them . We may as well say something here of Mr. Crabbe 's domestic character . He was not without severe trials ; for more than twenty years before her de*ith , his wife was visited with severe disease , which seems , though her son makes little direct allusion to the subject , to have cast a partial shadow over her mind . His constant and attentive kindness to her , when kindness was almost wearied or repelled , is a beautiful trait ; and the recollections of his son are full of many such amiable qual. ities . To the children , his approach was always a signal for delight ; benevolence was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicate interest into the // feelings of every one around him . Men are apt to forget , when they speak of extraordinary virtue , that they in general refer to some single act , or occasional exhibition of exalted qualities : but the virtue , after all , which passes that of martyrs , flows from a living and perennial spring , flashing ever in the sunlight of a cheerful temper , and sending its fertilizing stream through all the dark places and deserts of the way . I can still see him , ' says his son , in the eye of memory ,  - -  his fatherly countenance unmixed with any of the less loveable expressions , that in too many faces obscure that character , but preeminently fatherly : conveying the idea of kindness , intellect and purity ; his manner grave , manly and cheerful , in unison with his high and open forehead ; his very attitudes , whether as he sat absorbed in the arrangement of his minerals , shells and insects ,  --  or as he labored in his garden until his naturally pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , coming lightly toward us with some unexpected present , his smile of indescribable benevolence spoke exultation in the foretaste of our raptures . ' It would be of little interest to dwell upon Mr. Crabbe 's changes of residence , or other circumstances , which are stated with considerable minuteness by his son : we pass therefore to the period , when his long silence was broken , and he again appeared to revive and confirm the original impression of his power . In the year 1806 , he had nearly completed his Parish Register ' for publication . Several years before , Mr. Fox had promised to revise his publications , and to afford him the advantage of his critical suggestions . The career of that great man was now drawing to a close ; but he readily renewed his promise , and it gives additional interest to this poem to know , that it employed his mind almost in his last hours . In 1807 , it appeared , together with Sir Eustace Grey , ' the Birth of Flattery , ' and other poems . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in 1812 by the Tales in Verse , ' and in 1819 by the Tales of the Hall , ' the last of his publications . It has been already intimated , that there is a remarkable difference between Crabbe 's early poems , and those of his maturer years : both have defects and excellencies of their own ; the first are far superior to the later ones in polished beauty of versification , while they are less marked by those traits , which distinguish him from most of the other poets of // his country . The circumstances , which gave a sad and distorted coloring to his early views of life and manners , tended very strongly to impair the effect of his first productions ; they excite our feelings less powerfully , because we know that the misery is partly of his own making . If a man choose the shady side of the way , he will naturally find occasion to complain of the absence of the sunbeams ; but he will surely meet with little sympathy from those , who feel that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long interval which elapsed before his reappearance as a writer , his circumstances had become materially altered for the better , and his views and feelings had undergone a corresponding change : he was in the enjoyment of a competent fortune ; assiduously engaged in that discharge of duty , which brings with it an exceeding great reward , and possessed of some leisure to devote to that study of mankind , which can only be pursued by the contented and the tranquil . The miserable man , instead of studying others , dwells upon his own impulses and feelings , and from these infers how others think and act and feel ; and there are few who do not wonder at the alterations in the aspect of the world around them , as their spirits rise or fall . Mr. Crabbe is said to have remarked , that he derived less pleasure from the contemplation of a beautiful prospect , than from standing in the highway , to watch the faces of the passers by ; and the remark , we think , serves to afford an explanation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small share of his enthusiasm ; it is rare for him to dwell on any lovely scene , though he occasionally describes those of an opposite character with great vividness : with the exception of the ocean , with which many of the associations of his childhood were connected , and whose changing aspects he portrays with remarkable force of coloring , the grand and beautiful in nature have few charms for him . Motives ,  --  feelings ,  --  passions ,  --  all that relates to human character and action ,  --  these are the points which be seizes on with a master 's hand , and unfolds with a stern energy and truth , which convince us that he is engaged with no creations of fancy , but is describing what he has actually seen and studied . No English poet since the time of Shakspeare has painted those diversities of character , which one meets in the ordinary intercourse of life , with equal fidelity or with equal effect . He sees them not through a distorted medium , // nor within the shade of intervening objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither so lofty as to confuse the sight , nor so low as to confine it , where every object appears in a true light and in its just proportions ; the results of his observation are neither things of speculation nor of fancy , but the strong , distinct , vivid portraitures of classes of our race . Mr. Crabbe is certainly entitled to the praise of a reformer . Before his day , no poet would have dreamed of resorting to humble life for any thing beyond a theme of ludicrous caricature , or the personages of a Beggar 's Opera . Even at the present time , critics are apt to shake their heads with looks of peculiar wisdom , when they come in contact with such innovations : they are willing to admit that The Borough ' is well enough in its way , but deem the effort to invest such subjects with poetical attraction as hopeless as to draw the living waters from the rock . The poets themselves have yielded to this prejudice , and instead of copying from nature , when they wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is the waxen image to the animated frame ; the man of their creation has no affinity with merely mortal flesh and blood . We might as well expect in real life to meet a phoenix , as tone of their sentimental swains , musing in rapture as he goes forth to his daily task , or following the plough with unutterable joy and glory . We know that there is enough in humble life which has no claim to the title of poetical , and so there is in every other condition ; but we are not sure , that the materials of poetry are not more abundant in a lowly , than in an elevated sphere ; for feeling is there unfettered by those conventional restraints , which operate like law on natural freedom : the stern rebuke of opinion , which has as much power over those who move in the elevated social walks , as the eye of the keeper over the madman , loses its authority ; passion walks abroad without control , and the reluctant step of the slave is exchanged for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with the utterance of deep emotions ; the natural expression of feeling is never vulgar , and those who deem it so show only that they do not know what they condemn . When Scott , in his romances , puts the most energetic and affecting language into the mouths of his unlettered personages , he is entirely true to nature ; the gipsy 's stern execration of the vain and unfeeling Bertram ,  --  the language of // Edie Ochiltree , in the fearful night at Halket-head ,  --  the eloquence with which the rude and generous Highland outlaw pours out the emotions of his inmost heart ,  --  who can for a moment doubt that these are natural ? On the contrary , it is nothiiig hut their truth , which is the secret of their power and the same simplicity and truth are the only agents , which produce the wonders attributed to Indian eloquence . The INorth American savage has no more literature than the meanest bluegown ' of Scotland , and , as respects refinement , is not greatly his superior hut he gives utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unaffected language , and no conventional forms were ever half so powerful . Examples of this are familiar to the recollection of every reader ; the speech of Logan has been most frequently quoted ; but a more recent illustration occurs to us , which is perhaps not less striking . When the chief of the Sacs , Black Hawk , lately returned from his captivity to the tribe , which he had a few months before led forth to battle , but which was now crushed and broken , the agent of the United States expressed in council the views and expectations of the President . In the course of his reply , the warrior said On your way home , you will l ) *55 where my village once was . Nu one lives there now . All are gone V There is an interest connected with the Indian character , which , in the common estimation , gives more than usual force and impressiveness to their eloquence ; but wherever strong feeling and manly sentiment are found , there will eloquence surely be found also ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that the poet , who confines himself to the exhibition of humble life merely , can hardly expect a willing audience . Our interest is so much absorbed by the fortunes of the great , that it seems almost like presumption to ask it for the little ; the writers of romance have been well axvare of this prepossession , and have employed it for their own purposes ; we see their heroes decorated with all the ornaments of rank and accomplishments and title , and bow down to them , as a matter of course . Mr. Burke says that this is natural ; it certainly is second nature . Perhaps the world will in time grow wise enough to reserve that admiration for the exalted qualities of the heart and intellect , which has hitherto been lavished on adventitious ones ; but that millenium has not yet begun . Undoubtedly , the distitictions which social life infallibly creates are not to be disregarded , hut they may be seen // with a more just and equal eye ; the observer of human nature need not forget the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do well to look abroad , when the outlines of the trees and mountains are distinctly marked on the clear blue sky , and not merely when they are magni6ed by the gorgeous drapery of mist . When all the exhalations of prejudice and of fashion shall have passed away , the moral interest will be more equally distributed among the different conditions of life . The simple energy and truth of Crabbe will be more valued by the many , than they have been heretofore ; if his intellectual vision does not , like that of the most glorious of the sons of light , comprehend all space , it will be acknowledged to be keen , wide , and faithful . Shakspeare , from his watchtower , caught every change of many-colored life ; the great volume of our nature was wide open before him ; and whether he unveils the humble bosom , or describes the fierce struggles of jealousy , ambition or remorse , or the sorrow quickened into madness of the credulous old king , no one ever thought of doubting that the portraiture was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , though when he has attempted it , his success is complete ; he saw and studied all the beings around him with no less interest and care , than he pursued his researches into the secrets of inanimate nature and what he undertakes to describe , neither Scott nor Shakspeare could have painted better . His purpose is a moral one ; he never aims to dazzle or to please ; he conceals no defect , softens no deformity , and aims not to exaggerate a single beauty ; he makes few sacrifices on the altar of fastidious taste whoever admires him , admires him for his plain truth and manly power . In these remarks , we refer of course to his later writings ; for the prevalent defect of the earlier ones has been already pointed out . As he went onward in the way of life , he became a cool , thoughtful , philosophical and somewhat sarcastic observer , with tolerable charity for human vice and folly , hut with principle enough to describe them as they are . The writings of Crabbe are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it intrusive to attempt to illustrate our view of his poetical character by a few examples . In the Parish Register ' , he sketches the history of many of the villagers . combining tales of crime and sorrow with those of humble and unair*oitious virtue . There are several death-bed scenes , of which not the least curious is that of the bustling widow Goc. // " Bless me ! I die , and not a warning given , With much to do for earth , and ALL for Heaven No reparation for my soul 's affairs , No leave petitioned for the barn 's repairs ; Accounts perplexed , my interest yet unpaid , My mind unsettled , and my will unmade A lawyer haste , and , in your way , a priest , And let me die in one good work , at least . " She speaks , and trembling dropped upon her knees , Heaven in her eye , and in her hand the keys ; And still the more she found her life decay , With greater force she grasped those signs of sway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew near And dropped , in haste , the tributary tear , Then from the adhering clasp the keys unbound , And consolation for their sorrows found . ' Here is a sketch of the funeral of a very different example of her sex ,  --  a pattern of unassuming virtue , who fell by the sudden blow of pestilence . Slowly they bore , with solemn step , the dead ; When grief grew loud and bitter tears were shed ; My part began ; a crowd drew near the place , Awe in each eye , alarm in every face So swift the ill , and of so fierce a kind , That fear with pity mingled in each mind ; Friends with the husband came their griefs to blend , For good-man Frankford was to all a friend . The last-born boy they held above the bier , He knew not grief , but cries expressed his fear . * * * * * * * Arrived at home , how then they gazed around , In every place , where she , no more , was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rrhe fireside chair , still set , but vacant still ; The garden walks , a labor all her own ; The latticed bower , with trailing shrubs o'ergrown : The Sunday pew she filled , with all her race ,  - -  Each place of hers was now a sacred place , rhat while it called up sorrows in the eyes , Pierced the full heart , and forced them still to rise . ' But these are not the strongest efforts of his pencil . At the risk of repeating what may be already quite familiar , we will give another example , which is equalled , we think , by few // in the whole compass of English poetry . Among the poor of the Borough , we have the history of Peter Grimes , the fisherman . In his youth , be treats his father with brutal harshness , becomes familiar with debauchery and crime , and is at length shunned by all his neighbors . Two apprentices are bound to him , whose death is supposed to be hastened by his constant cruelty , if not produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding and avoided by all , and is at last the prey of remorse and madness . lie is conveyed to the poor-house , where The priest attending found he spoke at times As one alluding to his fears and crimes : " It was the * he muttered , " I can show The manner how ,  --  i never struck a blow , - And then aloud ,  --  " unhand me , free my chain ; On oath , he fell ,  --  it struck him to the brain Why ask my father ? - that old man will swear Against my life ; besides , he was not there What , all agreed ? - am I to die to-day My Lord , in mercy , give me time to pray . " In one of the paroxysm* of delirium , he makes his fearful and mysterious revelation . " T was one hot noon , all silent , still , serene , No living being I had lately seen ; I paddled up and down , and dipped my net , But such his pleasure I could nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To plague and torture thus an only son ! And so I sat and looked upon the stream , How it ran on , and felt as in a dream But dream it was not ; no ,  --  I fixed my eyes On the mid stream an ( l saw the spirits rise . I saw my father on the water stand , And hold a thin pale boy in either hand , And there they glided ghastly on the top Of the salt flood , and never touched a drop ; I would have struck them , but they knew the intent , And smiled upon the oar , and down they went . Now from that day , whenever I began To dip my net , there stood the hard old man ,  - -  He and those boys : I humbled me and prayed They would be gone ,  --  they heeded not , but stayed ; Nor could I turn , nor would the boat go by , // But gazing on the spirits , there was I ; They bade me leap to death , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure as day arose , Would those three spirits meet me at the close ; To hear and mark them daily was my doom , And , " Come , " they said , with weak , sad voices , " Come . " * * * * * * * In one fierce summer day , when my poor brain Was burning hot , and cruel was my pain , Then came this father-foe , and there he stood With his two boys again upon the flood ; There was more mischief in those eyes , more glee In their pale faces when they glared at me ; Still did they force rue on the sea to rest , And when they saw me fainting and oppressed , He , with his hand , the old man , scooped the flood , And there came flame about him mixed with blood ; He bade me stoop and look upon the place , Then flung the red hot liquor in my face ; Burning it blazed , and then I roared for pain , I thought the demons would have turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to behold A place of horrors ,  --  they can not be told ,  - -  When the flood opened , there I heard the shriek Of tortured guilt ,  --  no earthly tongue can speak ; All days alike forever ! did they say , And unremitted torments every dayYes , so they said ; "  --  but here he ceased , and gazed On all around , aifrightened and amazed ; And still he tried to speak , and looked in dread Of frightened females gathering round his bed ; Then dropped exhausted and appeared at rest , Till the strong foe the vital powers possessed ; * Then with an inward , broken voice he cried , " Again they come , " and muttered as he died . ' There is another most powerful delineation of madness in Sir Eustace Grey , ' a brief sketch , but not inferior in power to any of Crabbe 's writin where , in the presence gs . The scene is laid in a madhouse , moods of of the physician and a visitor , the varying madness are unveiled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as happy in the enjoyment of all earthly advantages , but forgetful of religious duty , until his wife deserted him for the arms of a treacherous friend , whom he murders under the impulse of revenge . // Madness comes on , the offspring of disgrace and poverty ; he is under the control of fiends , who torture him for years without an interval of rest ; till , worn out by the very excess of his delirium , he finds tranquillity at last in the belief that his iniquities are pardoned , and that be is redeemed by his Saviour from the foul tormenting fiends . He thus relates how , in the first period of their visitation , they hurried him over sea and land to a boundless plain . There was I fixed , I know not how , Condemned for years untold to stay ; Yet years were not ; - one dreadful now Endured no change of night or day ; The same mild evening 's sleeping ray Shone softly-solemn and serene , And all that time I gazed away , The setting sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sleep stole on ,  - -  Again came my commissioned foes ; Again through sea and land we 're gone , No peace , no respite , no repose Above the dark broad sea we rose , We ran through bleak and frozen land ; I had no strength their strength t ' oppose , An infant in a giant 's hand . They placed me where those streamers play , Those nimble beams of brilliant light : It would the strongest heart dismay , To see , to feel that dreadful sight So swift , so pure , so cold , so bright , They pierced my frame with icy wound , And all that half-year 's polar night , Those dancing streamers wrapped me round . Slowly that darkness passed away , When down upon the earth I fell ,  - -  Some hurried sleep was mine by day ; But , soon as tolled the evening bell , They forced me on , where ever dwell Far distant men in cities fair , Cities of which no trav'lers tell , Nor feet but mine were wanderers there . Their watchmen stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark ; // The watch-light blinks as we go past , The watch-dog shrinks and fears to bark : The watch-tower 's bell sounds shrill ; - and , hark ! The free wind blows ,  --  - we 've left the town ,  - -  A wide sepulchral ground I mark , And on a tombstone place me down . What monuments of mighty dead ! What tombs of various kinds are found ! And stones erect their shadows shed On humble graves , with wickers bound ; Some risen fresh above the ground , Some level with the native clay ; What sleeping millions wait the sound , " Arise , ye dead , and come away ! ** Alas ! they stay not for that call ; Spare me this wo ! ye demons , spare ! They come ! the shrouded shadows all ,  - -  Tis more than mortal brain can bear : Rustling they rise , they sternly glare At man , upheld by vital breath , Who , led by wicked fiends , should dare To join the shadowy troops of death . ' We can insert hardly enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . 1-us biographer tells us that it was written during a severe snow-storm ; a fact , which may be of considerable importance to those , who are anxious to discover the seasons most propitious to poetical inspiration . It is far more wild and imaginative than any of his other writings , and shews a versatility of talent , which those who are acquainted only with the most familiar portions of them would scarcely have anticipated . Before we leave this subject , we are unwilling to pass by the tribute paid to his ability by Sir Walter Scott . It is interesting , no less as a full and striking testimony to his merit , by one whose favorable judgment was of no ordinary value , than as an example of the kindness and liberality of feeling of the great man , whose character is as honorable to our nature , as his writings are to the literature of his country . The following is an extract from a letter , written by him in reply to one of Crabbe , accompanying a present of a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your C Ashestiel , October 21 , 1809. letter , which gives me the more sensible pleasure , since it has gratified a wish of more than twen // ty years ' standing . It is , I think , fully that time since I was , for great part of a very snowy winter , the inhabitant of an old house in the country , in a course of poetical study , so very like that of your admirably painted " Young Lad , " that I could hardly help saying , " That 's me ! " when I was reading the tale to my family . Among the very few books which fell under my hands , was a volume or two of Dodsley 's Annual Register , one of which contained copious extracts from " The Village , " and " The Library ; " particularly the conclusion of book first of the former , and an extract from the latter , beginning with the description of the old Romances . I committed them most faithfully to my memory , where your verses must have felt themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scraps of old plays , and all the miscellaneous stuff which a strong appetite for reading , with neither means nor discrimination for selection had assembled in the head of a lad of eighteen . New publications , at that time , were very rare in Edinburgh , and my means of procuring them very limited ; so that , after a long search for the poems which contained these beautiful specimens , and which had afforded me so much delight , I was fain to rest contented with extracts from the Register , which I could repeat at this moment . You may , therefore , guess my sincere delight , when I saw your poems at a later period assume the rank in the public consideration which they so well deserve . It was a triumph to my own immature taste to find I had anticipated the applause of the learned and of the critical , and I became very desirous to offer my gratulor , among the more important plaudits which you have had from every quarter . I should certainly have availed myself of the freemasonry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a mystery , as well as Abhorson 's ) to address to you a copy of a new poetical attempt , which I have now UpOn the anvil , and I esteem myself particularly obliged to Mr. Hatchard , and to your goodness acting on his information , for giving me the opportunity of paving the way for such a freedom . I am too proud of the compliments you honor me with , to affect to decline them and with respect to the comparative view I have of my own labors and yours , I can only assure you , that none of my little folks , about the formation of whose taste and principles I may be supposed naturally solicitous , have ever read any of my own poems , while yours have been our regular evening 's entertainment . My eldest girl begins to read well , and enters as well into the humor as the sentiment of your admirable descriptions of human life . As for rivalry , I think it has seldom existed among those who know , by experience , that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that one of the // best of these good things is the regard and friendship of those deservedly esteemed for their worth or their talents . I believe many dilettanti authors do cocker themselves up into a great jealousy of any thing that interferes with what they are pleased to call their fame : but I should as soon think of nursing one of my own fingers into a whitlow for my private amusement , as encouraging such a feeling . ' It was not until the year 1817 , after the rising of the second morn on the mid-noon of his former fame , that Mr. Crabbe returned to the society of London , with which , more than thirty years before , he had been familiam ' in the persons of those , whose names xviii not perish so long as English history endures : and it is difficult to imagine xvhat must have been his feelings , on comparing the present literary generation with his recollections of the past . He received a warm and cordial welcome in the highest intellectual and fashionable circles ; Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English poetry ; and there were very few persons of talent and distinction , to whom he was not personally known . But these social enjoyments , however gratifying , do not seem to have elated him ; it is an interesting trait in his character , that the attentions which were lavished upon him were unknown to his family , until after his death . On his return from London , he l ) uI*ued his usual occupations , as if they had undergone no interruption . This volume contains several letter 's , written by gentlemen of high literary fame , in which the writers have embodied their recollections of him at this peri od . On one occasion , at the urgent invitation of Sir Walter Scott , Mr. Crabbe visited him at Edinburgh . The reader will be interested in the folloxving extrac1* of a letter addressed by Mr. Lockhart to his hiobrapher , in which several circumstances , relating to this visit , are detaileml . London , December 26 , 1833 . I am sorry to tell you that Sir Walter Scott kept no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland , otherxvise it would have given me pleasure to make extracts for the use of your memoirs . For myself , although it is true that , in consequence of Sir Walter 's being constantly consulted about the details of every procession and festival of that busy fortnight , the pleasing task of shewing to Mr. Crabbe the usual lions of Edinburgh fell principally to my share , I regret to say that my memory does not supply me with many traces of his conversation . The gen // eral impression , however , that he left on my mind was strong , and I think , indelible ; while all the mummeries and carousals of an interval , in which Edinburgh looked very unlike herself have faded into a vague and dreamlike indistinctness , the image of your father , then first seen , but long before admired and revered in his works , remains as fresh as if the years that have now passed were but so many days . His noble forehead , his bright beaming eye , without any thing of old age about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  his sweet and , I would say , innocent smile , and the calm mellow tones of his voice ,  --  are all reproduced the moment I open any page of his poetry ; and how much better have I understood and enjoyed his poetry , since I was able thus to connect it with the living presence of the man ! The literary persons , in company with whom I saw him the most frequently , were Sir Walter and Henry Mackenzie ; and between two such thorough men of the world as they were , perhaps his apparent simplicity of look and manners struck me more than it might have done under different circumstances ; but all three harmonized admirably together ,  --  Mr. Crabbe 's avowed ignorance about Gaels , and clans , and tartans , and every thing that was at that moment uppermost in Sir Walter 's thoughts , furnishing him with a welcome apology for dilating on such topics with enthusiastic minuteness ,  --  while your father 's countenance spoke the quiet delight he felt in opening his imagination to what was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " though a fiery Highlander himself at bottom , had the satisfaction of lying by and listening until some opportunity offered of hooking in , between the Jinks , perhaps , of some grand chain of poetical imagery , some small comic or sarcastic trait , which Sir Walter caught up , played with , and , with that art so peculiarly his own , forced into the service of the very impression it seemed meant to disturb . One evening , at Mr. Mackenzie 's own house , I particularly remember among the noctes coenaeque Deiiim . Mr. Crabbe had , I remember , read very little about Scotland before that excursion . It appears to me that he confounded the Inchcolm of the Frith of Forth with the Icolmkill of the Hebrides : but John Kemble , I have heard , did the same . I really believe he had never known until then , that a language , radically distinct from the English , was still actually spoken within the island . And this recalls a scene of high merriment which occurred the morning after his arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Walter had not yet appeared there : and Mr. Crabbe had before him two or three portly personages , all in the full Highland garb . These gentlemen , arrayed in a costume so novel , were talking in a language which he did not // understand ; so he never doubted that they were foreigners . The Celts , on their part , conceived Mr. Crabbe , dressed as he was in rather an old fashioned style of clerical propriety , with buckles in his shoes , for instance , to be some learned abb6 , who had come on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Waverley ; and the result was , that when , a little afterwards , Sir Walter and his family entered the room , they found your father and these worthy lairds hammering away , with pain and labor , to make themselves mutually understood , in most execrable French . Great was the relief and potent the laughter , when the host interrupted the colloquy with his plain English " Good morning . " * * * * All my friends , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared ever afterwards to remember him with the same feeling of affectionate respect . Sir Walter Scott and his family parted with him most reluctantly . He had been quite domesticated under their roof , and treated the young people very much as if they had been his own . His unsophisticated , simple and kind address put every body at ease with him : and indeed , one would have been too apt to forget what lurked beneath that good humored , unpretending aspect , but that every now and then he uttered some brief pithy remark , which showed how narrowly he had been scrutinizing into whatever might be said or done before him , and called us to remember , with some awe , that we were in the presence of the author of ' The Borough . ' I recollect that he used to have a lamp and writing materials placed by his bedside every night ; and when Lady Scott told him she wondered the day was not enough for authorship , he answered , " Dear Lady , I should have lost many a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , things that occurred to me in my dreams . " I could never help regretting very strongly that Mr. Crabbe did not find Sir Walter at Abbotsford , as he had expected to do . The fortnight he passed in Edinburgh was one scene of noise , glare , and bustle ,  --  reviews , levm*es , banquets , and balls ,  --  and no person could either see or hear so much of him , as might , under other circumstances , have been looked for . Sir Walter himself I think , took only one walk with Mr. Crabbe : it was to the ruins of St. Anthony 's Chapel , at the foot of Arthur 's seat , which your father wished to see , as connected with part of the Heart of Mid-Lothian . I had the pleasure to accompany them on this occasion : and it was the only one on which I heard your father enter into any details of his own personal history . He told us , that during many months , when he was toiling in early life in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sunday , when he dined usually with a tradesman 's family , and // thought their leg of mutton , baked in the pan , the perfection of luxury . The tears came into his eyes while he talked of Burke 's kindness to him in his distress : and I remember he said , " The night after I delivered my letter at his house , I was in such a state of agitation , that I walked Westminster bridge backwards and forwards until daylight . " ' For many years before his death , Mr. Crabbe underwent severe tortures from the tic donloureux , and the rapid approaches of infirmity gave warning , in the beginning of 1831 , that the period of his departure was at hand . Mine , ' says he , is an old man 's natural infirmity , and that same old man creeps upon me more and more . ' Early in February of that year , he died , after a few days of great suffering . The closing scene was marked by the same religious hope , which had shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He retained to the last , in the intervals of pain , that calmness and serenity , which viewed without terror the event he felt to be approaching ; and he exhibited throughout that interest in others , which had hound many hearts to his . The testimonies of respect , that were freely paid to his memory by the people of his neighborhood , were of that character , which nothing but the loss of a good man would call forth , and nothing but affectionate veneration would bestoxv . We ought not to omit to notice the manner , in which the life of Mr. Crahbe has been recorded by his son . He formed the plan of preparing a biography , some time previous to his father 's death , and has not thought it expedient to alter that portion of it which was written in his lifetime . We think this a judicious resolution ; this portion of the work is undoubtedly more animated and attractive to the reader , than it would have been had it been written in the immediate contemplation of the loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has omitted any thing particularly worthy ofremembrance ; while he has certainly collected much , that would not easily have been accessible to others . On the whole , it will be regarded as a just and gratifyiug tribute to a man of stiperior genius and virtue , whose moral qualities command our veneration , while his poetical abilities will ensure him a high and permanent rank among the poets of his country.
