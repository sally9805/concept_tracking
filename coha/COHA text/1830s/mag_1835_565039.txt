txt BUT few men in this country have , in so short a time , taken a more conspicuous and favorable stand in the public estimation , than Peleg Sprague , the distinguished Senator from Maine . And perhaps - among the many excellent illustrations , which we shall furnish , of the folly of keeping up , and the inapplicability of the old party distinction , which existed during the war , ( a folly of which the Jackson party , assuming to be the only republican party , is ever guilty ) - there is none better than the biography of Peleg Sprague . We therefore have taken some pains to collect facts , concerning his early life , in detail . Mr. Sprague was born in Duxhury , Commonwealth of Massachusetts , and is the son of the Hon. Seth Sprague , who is still living , and who now occupies the same farm upon which he and his ancestors have lived for more than two hundred years-Duxbury being , next to Plymouth , the oldest settlement in NewEngland . His father was a whig of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a soldier ; and , from the first rise of political parties , under the Constitution , he was a republican of the Jeffersonian school . He was , for nearly twenty years , a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts ; and be was an uniform and steadfast supporter of the measures of the administration , through the darkest and gloomiest periods of our history . As a member of the Senate , he ardently supported the late war ; resisting the resolution of that body , which condemned rejoicings at our victories ; and ten years afterwards , he moved the resolution , which expunged it from the records . Mr. Sprague , the son , received the rudiments of his education in the free // schools of his native town , and at the public academy in Sandwich , until he entered Harvard College , in the year 1808 . He had been early and deeply imbued with the political sentiments , feelings , and opinions of his father . The four years which he spent in college , from August , 1808 , to August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and declaration of war , and the commencement of hostilities - was a period of general excitement and intense political interest , which penetrated even the walls of the college , and produced conflicts among the great body of ardent and ingenuous youth , there assembled . All the officers of the college , and nine-tenths of the students , were federalists yet Mr. S. not only openly avowed , but at all times fearlessly and earnestly maintained his own opinions . In 1811 , during the administration of Mr. Gerry , as Governor of Massachusetts , when his annual proclamation was , according to usage , read in church on the Sabbath , the students gave vent to their strong political feelings , by scraping , bissing* and other audible indications of disapprobation , to the interruption of the services . So flagrant an act , in public , was thought to demand some animadversion in the government ; to avert which , a general meeting of all the students was called , the next day , in the public chapel . After being duly organized , an address to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , in fact , justifying all that had been done . On that occasion , Mr. Sprague , as one of the under-graduates , arose and made a speech against it ; and with so much success , that several , who had not before dared to avow themselves democrats or republicans , united with him . The address was , however , carried by an overwhelming majority . But , after it was adopted , the few , not exceeding twenty or thirty in the whole college , who , under the lead of Mr. Sprague , had the courage to raise their voice against it , determined to address a letter to Governor Gerry , as President of the Board of Overseers , expressing their disapprobation of the whole conduct of the students . Mr. Sprague himself wrote the letter , and was chairman of the committee , that presented it to the Governor , who returned a suitable and appropriate answer . Both the letter and the answer were published in the republican newspapers of the day ; and the letter of the democratic students was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period that he was in college , the celebrated Dr. Osgood preached one of his violent political phillipics , in the presence of the students , occasioning no little ferment , for the time . Notwithstanding the uniform openness , energy and boldness , with which Mr. Sprague invariably asserted and maintained his political opinions and sentiments - so unpalatable to the heated and violent partizan feelings of his fellow-students , and *o directly opposed to the opinions of his instructers - he was , nevertheless , not only highly respected but much esteemed and beloved // by both . He was sought for , as a member of all the most respectable college clubs and associations , whether literary or convivial , and was honored by marks of approbation and confidence , from the college government . He devoted himself , with great assiduity and remarkable success , to his books , nntil , in his Sophomore year , his eyes became so seriously affected as to prevent his using them ; so that , during the residue of his college life , he could pursue his studies only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmates ; and yet , nuder this disadvantage , no one in his class was more distinguished as a scholar ; and , upon receiving a Master 's degree , in 1815 , he was selected to deliver the English oration , being the first honor in the class for that degree . His distinction was so well deserved , that it was universally approved by his class , notwithstanding it was composed of many young men , who have since distinguished themselves in several professions ; among whom was the Rev. Henry Ware , of Cambridge ; Rev. Doct . Wainwright , Charles C. Loring and Franklin Dexter , Esquires , of Boston ; and Doct . Abel Pierson , of Salem . After leaving the university , Mr* Sprague pursued the study of law - part of the time at the celebrated law school in Litchfield , Connecticut , under Judges Reeve and Gould , and subsequently under the Hon. Levi Lincoln , of Worcester , the late distinguished Governor of Massachusetts . Mr. Sprague was admitted to the bar in the fall of 1815 ; and , immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maine-then a part of Massachusetts . in 1817 , he removed to Halloxvell , where he has till of late resided , constantly pursuing his profession , with industry and success ; so that he has obtained a rank , at the bar , second to no man in the State ; a bar , too , which is not without able and learned men , and in which , to obtain success , a man must struggle for and deserve it . Tbe first time Mr. Sprague entered into political life , was in 1820 , when , upon the organization of the State of Maine , he was elected a member of the first Legislature . The ensuing year , he was re-elected to the Legislature ; after which , he declined a reelection , and chose to devote himself to his profession , although strongly urged to be a candidate for the State Senate . In 1823 and 1824 , many of his friends urged him to be a candidate for Congress , which he declined . An unsuccessful attempt having been made to elect a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the autumn of 1824 , at the second trial he was induced to consent to become a candidate , and was elected by a large majority . He was re-elected , without serious opposition , in 1824 and in 1828 , but did not take his seat in the House under the last election - the Legislature , in the winter of 1828 , 29 , having elected him to the Senate of the United States . // He took his seat in the Senate on the fourth of March , 1829 - on the same day that Gen. Jackson was first inaugurated as President of the United States . In the House of Representatives , Mr. Sprague was put upon the Committee of Ways and Means - one of the most important committees in that body . Soon after his entrance into the House , his ability , industry , general information , and eloquence , attracted the attention of all . At once , his ability commanded influence ; and his popular manners attracted friends . His name and reputation were no longer bound within the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common country . In the first session of the seventeenth Congress , in which he was , he took part in some of the important debates , which then engrossed the attention of the country . His speeches upon the Massachusetts militia claims , upon the revolutionary officers bill , and upon the Panama mission , are to be found in the register of debates . These speeches at once introduced him to his countrymen , and strengthened his reputation and popularity at home . In the second session of this Congress , his answer to Mr. Hives , of Virginia , on surveys in Maine - in which , as a set-off to a sneer from Mr. Hives , upon the unknown rivers of the North , he contrasted , in an amusing mode , the harsh-sounding , but strong and original , Indian names of places in Maine with the Prince Williams , ' King Georges , ' *and Queen Charlottes , ' of Virginiaalso added to his reputation and popularity at home . At this session , too , his reply was made to Mr. McLane , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Committee of Ways and Means ; but , after Mr. McLane resigned , Mr. Cook , the next on the committee , being ill , a great part of the labor , of that most responsible and busy committee , fell upon Mr. Sprague . Thus , not only from choice hut from necessity , he became well versed in the finances of the country . In the first session of the twentieth Congress , as appears in the register of debates , Mr. Sprague was as active and as enterprising as ever . The question of the north-eastern boundary , which then was deemed so important to his own State , and which afterwards almost threatened to bring Maine into collision with the government of the British provinces of New-Brunswick , he was stirring at an early day . During this session , also , he made his important speech upon the tariff which was printed in a pamphlet form , and was much admired at the time . In the second session of this Congress , he introduced a resolution , instructing the Coinmittee of Ways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of this committee , he reported the tonnage bill , advocated its passage in the House , got it through in 1828 ; and , in 1829 , it passed both branches of Congress , and is now the law of the land . // At the opening of the twenty-first Congress , Mr. Sprague went into the Senate of the United States . At the first session of that Congress , the ever-memorable debate begun upon Foote 's resolutions , limiting the sale of public lands . Col. Benton , of Missouri , gave the first agitation to the waters . Gov . Hayne , of South Carolina , with an eloquence and enthusiasm not soon to be forgotten , launched forth upon xvhat emphatically proved to be an ocean of debate - floating along , as it were , upon the tide of our whole history , with no rudder but his own brilliant imagination , and no rules and orders ' but his own pleasures . Mr. Webster followed ; and , after a little skirmishing , burst forth , with his best and greatest speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect . After such a speech - which may be advantageously compared with the most remarkable efforts of the great debates of the old world - it was difficult almost impossible , to re-awake attention or to impart new interest to the debate . Yet Mr. Sprague succeeded in his speech upon this resolution . lt was remarkable for a wide acquaintance with facts , industrious research , well-timed application , and brilliant eloquence . This speech enlarged his reputation . It was his first effort of importance in the Senate , and compared well with all the great speeches ; which is no small approbation , when we remember that Livingston , Clayton , Holmes , and others , entered upon the debate . Henceforward , the fame of Peleg Sprague was established . That name was acquired , which , of itself , is a tower of strength - and which , thus established , will be raised higher and firmer on the mountain-path of fair renown . The next topic of importance , that arose in the Senate , to which Mr. Sprague directed his especial attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians . This bill created no smalL discussion in both branches of Congress . TI'he country took a lively interest in it . Parties ranged and divided upon it , to a considerable extent ; though probably a large portion of the people out of the States , interested in the removal of the Indians within their borders , condemned the measure itself , the manner in which the removal was proposed , and the appropriation demanded for it . The bill passed the House by a trembling majority of only five votes ; for there , it was forcibly and eloquently resisted ; and in the Senate , also , it met with a most able opposition . Mr. Sprague discussed the question at length , with a strength of argument and vigor of eloquence , that left the bill to stand solely on party ground . Subsequently to this time , Mr. Sprague engaged in all , or almost all , the great political questions , which agitated the country . Upon the investigations into the Post-office department , which commenced three or four years ago , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , in a powerLul // speech - displaying great knowledge , and an intimate acquaintance with its whole bearing upon the whole country , particularly upon his own State , which was largely interested in it . The whole country awarded praise to this effort ; and it did much towards advancing public attention . The north-eastern boundary and the Dutch award , questions peculiarly interesting to Maine , he discussed with his usual ability . By his and his colleague 's efforts , the Dutch award was set aside , so far as the Senate was concerned ; and that important question yet remains , amid the gloom and clouds , which party organization has thrown over it in his own State ; so that no one can yet say how the subject stands . Whether a large extent of territory , upon the eastern and northeastern borders of Maine , is now under the government of the United States or of Great Britain , it is difficult to decide for , though Maine , almost with one voice , at first condemned and denounced the award ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States - a prominent citizen of Maine - joined in the outcry ; though the Legislature itself spoke in one tone ; yet , as it was found out that this a6itation in Maine conflicted with the interest of the dominant party at Washington , means were devised for suppressing the agitation and , by a diplomacy yet unknown , the whole subject was slipped aside , amid political ju*glery , that can not well be unraveled Mr. Sprague , however , did his duty to the State . fhe Legislature instructed him to resist the axvard , and he resisted it . The Legislature then equivocated upon the question ; Mr. Sprague , however , persisted in what he had undertaken ; and the award , as we have said before , was set aside , so far as the power of the Senate was concerned . During this time also , and subsequently , Mr. Sprague has been instructed by the Legislature to oppose the tariff ; whether he has obeyed or disobeyed these instructions , is yet a matter of question - for the instructions were so worded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without violating their spirit or tenor . Extreme protection , by enactments of Congress , Mr. Sprague has never advocated . To the compromise bill of Mr. Clay , in 1833 , he gave his ardent support ; not only by his vote in the Senate , but by his influence in debate and iii conversation . Upon the question of the removal of the deposits , he again differed with his Legislature - they instructing him , in substance , to approve the removal ; and he , in his heart , deeming the act , and the circumstances attending it , an outrage upon the laws and upon the Constitution , as well as a violation of the chartered rights of the bank . We have not space , in a Magazine paper , to discuss time great question , and to say how far a Senator in Congress is bound to obey the instructions of his Legislature . Upon the abstract ques // tion , we will only add , that it reduces a Senator in Congress elected for six years in fact to a term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected , when he , by the Constitution , held his office for six years ! At the same time , we are ready to grant that , in States where instructions are fairly got up - where they express the deliberate majority of the peopie , and are not the tempestuous bursts of party excitement - then a Senator is placed in a most unpleasant situation , if what he deems his duty to his country , and to himself , conflicts with the voice of a majority . Certain it is , that the Constitution contemplated that a Senator should he placed beyond the puffs of every party breeze ; but it is equally the fact , that , when a man can not stand upon the majority , the Constitution makes hut little reparation for the annoyances he suffers . All these remarks , however , are more applicable to Virginia and to other States , where instructions are fairly got up , and where the caucus system is unknown . The machinery of Van Burenism has reduced members of the Legislature , in New-York , New-Hampshire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions agitating the whole country , and for the discussion and elucidation of which , the greatest statesman of the day seeks months of solemn deliberation , their caucuses settle in a single evening ! and this , without discussion , without the necessary information , without knowledge or a forethought ! The party leader , in the Legislature , sounds his horn . The clansmen are summoned . They meet together in secret , in the darkness of the night , with closed doors , and often with watchful sentinels . The leader comes , and unfolds what he wants . His second seconds him . His echo re-echos what he says . The country demands it ; ' the country expects it ; regard to General Jackson requires it . the federalists oppose it ; ' these are the watchwords of the country . If the instructions proposed he of too monstrous a nature no doubt the honest portion of the party will oppose it . But , what avails the opposition , if a majority is obtained ? for it is the first duty of a democrat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , not unfrequently , in a Legislature of one hundred and fifty members , a minority can carry the day . Ninety , for example , are Jackson-men , sixty are whigs ; the ninety go into caucus , and forty-six is a majority of ninety . Now , forty-six can not only bind the ninety , but , by uniting them , rule the sixty ; and thus in part , hy the voice of a minority , instruct a Senator in Congress out of his seat . This is the manner in which instructions were got up . This , it is well knoxvn , is the manner in which they are got up wherever the Van Buren machinery is established . We need not add , that men , acting thus , are not free men , free legislators - explaining the spontaneous voice of the people . Certain it is , that they are // qwq lature to be legally returned , was : The whole number , - - - - - - - - 49,852 Of which , Robert P. Dunlap , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( whig ) " - - - - 18,112 Samuel F. Smith , ( Jackson ) " - - - - 4,024 Thomas A. Hill , ( antimason ) " 2,384 Allothers , 101 From this , it will he seen that Mr. Goodenow wanted 13,128 of having a majority over all others last year . The true Jackson majority in the State last year was nearly 11,000 votes . The 3,024 votes given for Smith were all Jackson votes , and this year were given for Dunlap . This is probably the case with some of the votes given for Hill . // ands of his fellow-citizens arose to welcome him . Out of Portsmouth , New-Hampshire , a cavalcade met him , and escorted him to that town . In Portland , the commercial capital of Maine , a large cavalcade met him and escorted him through the streets to the city-hall , where hundreds cheered him . Thus was he received , all along the road . Riots and violence had been predicted for him , and other Senators in his situation , by some of the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exclamation of Mr. Sprague , as he looked round on the throng of grateful and admiring constituents , who crowded about him , with shouts of welcome and heartfelt approbation , if such are the mobs , with whose vengeance we were threatened , on our return , commend me to them for the rest of my life ! We can not resist the temptation to quote the whole of an excellent address , with which a citizen of Augusta welcomed him home . In behalf of these , your fellow-citizens , I bid you welcome to your home . Without effort , without premeditation , we bring you a simple offering - the tribute of grateful hearts ; the only offering worthy of freemen - the only offering truly acceptable to the representative of freemen . Sir , we are not man-worshippers - we bow not to idols , though graven in wood ; we bow to acknowledged merit , to straight-forward integrity , to unbendina rectitude . It is , sir , because you have been true to our country , true to the Constitution , true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you welcome . It is because you are not , as you yourself have declared , Jackson 's man , nor any other man 's man , but your own man - amenable only to conscience and to God . Sir , before you left the capital , it was announced , through the official organ of the administration , that our Senator Sprague - because he had dared to oppose President Jackson , had dared to stand forth in defence of the Constitution - should meet with reproach and indignation from his fellow-citizens ; that his progress towards home would be impeded by an infuriated mob . Sir , was that a mob , that met you in Boston , in the cradle of American liberty , when thousands of your fellow-citizens rose up to bid you welcome ? Was that a mob , that met you at Portsmouth and at Portland ? If these were mobs , then , sir , permit me to introduce you to another mob . Here they are , high and low , rich and poor , old and young , men of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bid you welcome ; but , let me add , so long as the friends of liberty shall remain , you will find them in just such a mob . Permit me again to bid you welcome to warm friends and a pleasant home . Bear with you , to that peaceful mansion , our repeated thanks for your services in defence of the Constitution and of our liberties . Bear with you the approbation of your own conscience ; but above all , and what is of infinitely more value , the richest of all rewards , may you bear with you the smiles of heaven . ' After Mr. Sprague 's return home , an immense assembly of xvhig citizens , in convention , solicited him to stand as a candidate for Governor of the State ; and , as Mr. Sprague appealed to the people , he resolved to throw himself upon them for support . But , popular as Mr. Sprague is , his popularity , it appears by the late elections in Maine , could not overthrow the power of the official defenders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost every nook and corner , bay and creek , // island and river , of her long line of sea-coast-and , not only there , hut forming a cordon of custom-house officers in the Canada and New-Brunswick lines - their influence is almost as impregnable as the rock of Gibralter . Nevertheless , the popularity of Sprague shook this citadel of the office-holders . He almost doubled the whig vote of 1833 ; and though an immense vote , for so young a State , was thrown , yet thirty-four thousand freemen were found to sustain him , almost doubling their strength in the House of Representatives , and more than tripling it in the Senate . Again ; every member in the Legislature , who had instructed him , found it necessary to sustain his instruction , and thus oppose the instructed ; so that , here was a bulwark to be beaten down , as well as the bulwark of the office-holders . A majority , however , of eleven thousand was reduced to about four thousand ; so that , if Peleg Sprague were defeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above , all has been said of the political life of Mr. Sprague , that need be said . In 1832 , he made an address , in the city of Washington , at the Washington centennial celebration . An eulogy of his , on Adams and Jefferson , is all of his other productions , that have met our eye . We do remember of hearing of an address from him , before the Phi Beta Kappa Society , of Bowdoin College , which was highly extolled for beauty and eloquence ; but it has never come under our notice in print . Now all that remains , is to add something upon the prevailing characteristics of Mr. Sprague 's manner and mind . Mr. Sprague is about the middle size , well-proportioned , with a dark and very expressive eye . His countenance is pleasing , trank , and open . His voice full , musical , and capable of much strength . His action is graceful , and , when excited , very energetic . But few men speak with more power and ability , when aronsed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chaste and classical . His taste is admirable . He thinks well , and thinks deeply . He is a clear and logical reasoner ; but yet he has ima0ination , lively and hrilllant , which can adorn and beautify the structure , that logic rears . As a politician , he has that peculiar ability of discovering fitness of time and place , that political tact , which always gives a politician power and reputation . His mind is liberal and expanded - taking a statesman-like view of things , and advocating them in a patriotic manner . His ambition is elevated and laudable ; and though , no doubt , he covets fame , yet he seeks it in an honorable manner . The popularity that xvears is his . J*arty may shake it - party tumults may dash around it , and weaken it ; but , as long as he lives , and among whomsoever he lives , and when he is dead , his reputation will brighten ; and no party can weaken it , or trample // him under their feet .

Any remarkable sentiment or fact , met in my reading , some personal experience , or the observation of others ' peculiarities , serves me for a nucleus and around it , I strive to gather the wisdom which the sun 's revolution has placed within my reach . Out of this habit , have grown the following sentiments . They form the few last pages of my diary . I. The desire of posthumous influence , or fame , is the only feeling under which a man can write , in a manner worthy of himself , or with that energy and completeness of thought , of which he is really possessed . He who writes for , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his powers shackled by popular notions - and his opinions seasoned too much to the prevailing taste , to possess the freedom and freshness of genius , or to bear , very legihly , the individual stamp of originality . A.n author , who writes with this feeling , is like one who , in the company of the illiterate and vulgar , fears to use his proper forms of expression and pronunciation , lest he shall be thought ignorant . He omits many thoughts , which have struck him forcibly , lest they may not be understood by the many ; while he who writes for , and ( with the prophetic boldness of genius ) in the surety of receiving , the homage of posterity , knows that his page shall one day receive that scrutiny , which shall develope the nicest and most delicate thoughts of his mind to the admiration of the world - and untwist the thread of his eloquence and learning , till its tender filaments shall prove that beauty is a constituent of force - and that the strength of a giant can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , or topple down a castle . II . I have often remarked , in sadness , the little feeling of affection , that seemed to subsist between brothers and sisters , or other near relatives , after time and distance , and the different allotments of life , had for a little while separated them . They who , in their youth , have been as one ; who have drunk from the same howl of joys and sorrows ; have wept and been glad together ; whom one electric chain of sympathy bound ; who recoiled at the same blow ; - these have lived through separation , have had their affections weaned from those bound to them by such ties and birth and blood , and turned into strange channels . As the stream sparkies , // not only among the hills that gave it birth , hut glistens and leaps , in its course between banks , far , far away from the green sward , that its waters first knew ; so the affections rejoice and lavish themselves upon strangers , to those who first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of their earliest , purest exercise . It is sad , for young hearts to believe , that the love they now bear each other must one day become rather a matter of judgment and duty ) than an impulse of the heart ; that the same fate probably awaits their affections , that has come to thousands , equally near and dear . The brother must reflect , that soon he must yield his right of prior attachment to those who , picked up midway in the journey of life , yet have better claims to love and sympathy , on to the end of the voyage . Time and distance are the great enemies of mutual affection ; and although it is only when we have first left our friends , that we know how dear they are to us , yet we love them best when we are feeding from the same table - sleeping under the same roof- in the daily reciprocations of favors , and the hourly manifestations of interest and affection . Still , much may be done to counteract the common influences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affections of the heart - declaring that it is only capable of transferring its love from one to another ; not of enlargin0 greatly the number of the objects of its regard . Far otherwise ; the soul expands more and more , with every effort of kindliness ; it can not be crowded ; like that spirit of universal benevolence , whose sublimity consists more in his infinite love for the whole world , than in power or might - that part of us , which stamps us with the image of our Maker ; elevates itself more by the outpourings of its affections , than by any exercise of intellectual power . III . The study of Nature , and the habit of looking curiously into her laws and their objects - besides the so obvious influence of purifying and spiritualizing the character - teaches us human life . It would seem that all natural phenomena , intimately viewed , typify the changes of human existence ; and oftentimes - instead of looking from life and spirit into Nature , for the illustration of some newly discovered law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation ; and , when I see any new , and before unobserved , development of natural laws , . to look into my own mind , or my own experience of humanity , to find the corresponding characteristic . iv . There are many favorite notions abroad in the world , which , true enough in the abstract , are entirely false in their practical bearings , and deceptive in every application for which they were // originally intended . Such are Quinctilian 's famed remark , that no bad man can become a good orator ; ' and Socrates 's triumphant and decisive query , whether a bad man can possibly gain the affection of a good one ; the first of which maxims , Cicero , the greatest orator the world ever saw , refutes in person ; and the second of which , every day 's experience and observation answers in the affirmative . Such remarks are made by that part of the world , ambitious of doing good and encouraging virtue , and believed by the rest , who are willing to credit that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of things- especially since we readily worship every image of Virtue , that we may forestall the pardon of the goddess for those offences coinmitted against her , at hours and places not particularly sacred . But these notions remove farther off the end they would approximate . Error is always dangerous - the more so , lurking under the armor of truth ; and even laboring for the establishment of her dominion . An erroneous principle may serve well to annul one dangerous instance ; but , admitted for that purpose , it introduces a host of evil , and thus smashes the bottle-nose upon the judge , when it only aimed at the troublesome fly upon his nose . ' V. The great Messinian hero , Aristomenes , when thrown into the cavernous Ceanda , by the Spartans , and miraculously saved - one from fifty - by his shield , escaped from the cave , by seizing by the tail a fox , who came to feed on the carcasses of his companions ; and xvhile he with difficulty defended himself , with one hand , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from the fatal labyrinth . We should be more fortunate , if- while we seize , with one hand , new and untried methods of escape , from the desperate difficulties of life - we employed the other in guarding against the ills , that we ought to fear every new and tintried method to possess . VI . The world is too often souring in its effects upon those who have remained long in it . Either its accumulating sorrows overburden , or the old are depressed by the loss of those capacities , that made them alive to pleasure ; or , influencing little the progress of society , and ceasing to be useful , they cease to cornmand the respect and attention of a selfish and interested world - and painfully feel themselves displaced by the bustling generation , who , thinking them fools , they know to be such . ' Whether from one or all these reasons , they too often look , with stern , unsympathizing apathy , upon the pleasures and gaieties of the youthful , and seem to expect the gravity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their surprise , on finding themselves // in such a queer place as this world . But , we occasionally find an instance of one , who xvears a white head , and has a cheerful heart - one who seems not to have outlived the remembrance of his own youth , and who has so lived , as not to regret his approach to the bourne . ' Who can tell the delightful influence such an one exerts ! Like the apples that have not fallen with the winds of autumn , they have lost their asperity with their freshness - and the frost has given them , with all their shriveled wrinkles , a sweetness peculiarly their own . As children run after the frost-apples , so run they after such persons . VII . The smallest permanent ill is more to be feared than the greatest temporal one . viii . I have often thrown a scrap of paper into the blaze , and watched ' it while it burned - preserving , through the chemical nature of ink , the characters written upon it , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substance was reduced to a cinder - and finally , while yet distinguishable , have been caught up by the draught , from further observation . I have thought this no unapt semblance of the close of life , when the body , worn out and slowly consuming - the soul and the memory of thought become ' more vivid and distinct , and prove themselves not indissolubly connected with their frail tenement-not liable to its decay , and only waiting its dissolution , to wing their flight towards home - bearing the indestructible impressions of life before the throne of God . Ix . I know no state of mind more dangerous than that in which one , in struggling between principle and inclination , makes the ' dictates of conscience matters of argument with himself . There are certain innate moral feelings implanted in the bosoms of all - the ignorant and the educated , the dull and the bright - infallible guides to right conduct . These are not subjects of logic ; they are moral axioms , which no reasoning can prove - none dispute* and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question or controvert them ; - for , while his inclinations ensure his arriving at false conclusions , his apparent scrupulosity , in obeying the directions of his judgment , makes his situation ten-fold more alarming , by giving him grounds for persisting in it . x . Among the advantages of solitary study , I do not remember to have seen the following . There is a certain ambition to make advances , when one is unwatched , and looks forward to a distant // and definite period , when he shall bring his progress at one view before his friends and the world - that one does not feel , when his every step , in advance , is observed by the jealous or anxious eyes of companions . The excitenient , too , of acquiring knowledge is dulled , when every newly-acquired fact or idea is made stale by instant communication . The encouraging retrospect , upon past ignorance , loses its force when it becomes vague , and is seen only in perspective ; but acquires great strength , when , by recurring to some fixed period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with present illumination . XI . I have a pervading and poetic love of the romance of the affections-I mean , of all that belongs to the deep love of pure , passionate and elevated beings , set apart from and above the word ; and in contemplating ideal scenes of such happiness , consists - how much of my delight I call it romance , ' because Jam more persuaded , every day , that no such thing here exists . We are of the earth - earthy . ' Such love seems fitted only to the unclogged purity of spirit , over whose subtle life the curse of poverty and th' demeaning demands of flesh and sense exercise no tyranny . And yet , without the weakness , the errors and sin of humanity , what would love be ? What would it be , without the trembling , trusting feebleness of woman - what , without the incoherencies of passion ? - what , without the anxiety , the fears , the accusations of jealousy ? - what , without tears ? And yet , these are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange anomaly ! - the human heart . These are the charming agonies of love , Whose miseries deliaht. ' - THOMsON . XII . It is a glorious thought , and a satisfying one , that we may bequeath , unquenchedly , to the future , ' even but a single spark of the immortal fire of our Heaven-descended spirits . But the mutability of life is so great , and the necessary coincidence of circumstances so uncertain , that who can hope , with confidence , to do this ? Are we not thrown on life 's waters , like stones , from the hand of the skipper , on the sea-shore ? - which iriust , by higher or lo*ver , shorter or longer successive bounds , sink into the dark sea ; and , although the sphere of our posthumous influence and memory may be proportioned to our merit , yet , like the circlet in the water , it must soon become blotted out and untraceable , in the turmoil and commotion of life 's troublous ocean . Yet , the chance of living for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pledge one cup to immortality , ' though it must be filled with blood wrung from the heart-strings. // Are these the body 's accidents ? no more ? To live in it , and when that dies , go out , Like the burnt taper 's flame ? ' If we can not bequeath something , worthy of the past , to the future- be it the instruction of our example , the incitement of our renown , the propagation of our virtues , or the creative energy of our minds - we have lived unworthy of that celestial immortality , which is the soul 's upward rise , and searching out of that eternal spirit , with which it shall co-exist forever . XIII . It is often difficult to reconcile men 's characters with their writings ; and it is an easier task , and much controversy is spared by it , to infer their characters from their works , than to attempt to explain away the inconsistencies between them . Indeed , I doubt not that , when biography assumes the high stand of philosophic speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's hearts , as when we attempt to gather our opinion from a mass of incongruous acts , such as every great man 's life presents - incongruous to all but the soul that took cognizance of the motives which produced them . It would have been a very difficult task for any other man than Boswell , to have written his life of Johnson ; and it would be almost equally difficult to mention any other person than Johnson , whose life would bear to be written in such a manner . Boswell seems to have lived merely for that purpose . A truly great and independent mind would never have conceived the work . It required some one who was willing to risk his character for consistency , and his pretensions to self-respect , upon it ; some one who would permit himself to be entirely thrown into the shade of greatness , for the time , that he might be invested with some interest afterwards ; who would become the butt , that he might be the companion of genius . If it had not been well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast behind him ; and if his work , from its perfect carelessness about appearing consistent , had not thus supported its credit , it would never have been believed . On this account it is , that , although Boswell 's Johnson is perhaps the best biography that ever was written , yet is by no means a standard , or a subject for imitation . H.W.B.@@183069050.txt Now talk we of graves and goblins ! Fit themes- start not ! gentle reader - fit for a ghost like me . Yes ; though an earthclogged fancy is laboring with these conceptions , and an enrthly hand will write them down , for mortal eyes to read , still their essence flows from as airy a ghost as ever basked in the pale starlight , at twelve o'clock . Judge them not by the gross and heavy form in which they now appear . They may be gross , indeed , with the earthly pollution contracted from the brain , through which they pass - and heavy with the burthen of mortal language , that crushes all the finer intelligences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should aught of etherial spirit be perceptible , yet scarcely so , glimmering along the dull train of words - should a faint perfume breathe from the mass of clay - then , gentle reader , thank the ghost , who thus embodies himself for your sake ! Will you believe me , if I say that all true and noble thoughts , and elevated imaginations , are hut partly the offspring of the intellect , which seems to produce them ? Sprites , that were poets once , and are now all poetry , hover round the dreaming bard , and become his inspiration ; buried statesmen lend their wisdom , gathered on earth and mellowed in the grave , to the historian ; and when the preacher rises nearest to the level of his mighty subject , it is because the prophets of old days have communed with him . Who has not been conscious of mysteries within his mind , mysteries of truth and reality , which will not wear the chains of language ? Mortal , then the dead were with you ! And thus shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a misty brightness among his thoughts , and strive to make it gleam upon the page - hut all in vain . Poor author How will he despise what he can grasp , for the sake of the dim glory that eludes him . So talk we of graves and goblins . But , what have ghosts to do with graves ? Mortal man , wearing the dust which shall require a sepulchre , might deem it more a home and resting-place than a spirit can , whose earthly clod has returned to earth . Thus , philosophers have reasoned . Yet , wiser they who adhere to the ancient sentiment , that a phantom haunts and hallows the marble tomb or grassy hillock , where its material form was laid . Till purified from each stain of clay ; till the passions of the living world are all forgotten ; till it have less brotherhood with the wayfarers of earth , than with spirits that never wore mortality - the ghost must linger round the grave . Oh ! it is a long and dreary watch , to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected a sweet spot , of shade and glimmering sunshine , for my grave , it was no burial-ground , but a secluded nook of virgin earth , where I used to sit , whole summer afternoons , dreaming about life and death . My fancy ripened prematurely , and taught me secrets , which I could not otherwise have known . I pictured the coming years - they never came to me , indeed ; but I pictured them like life , and made this spot the scene of all that should he brightest , in youth , manhood , and old age . There , in a little while , it would be time for me to breathe the bashful and burning vows of first-love thither , after gathering fame abroad , I would return to enjoy the loud plaudit of the world , a vast but unobtrusive sound , like the booming of a distant sea ; and thither , at the far-off close of life , an aged man would come , to dream , as the boy was dreaming , and he as happy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all should be finished , in that spot so hallowed , in that soil so impregnated with the most precious of my bliss , there was to be my grave . 1'Iethought it would be the sweetest grave , that ever a mortal frame reposed in , or an etherial spirit haunted . There , too , in future times , drawn thither by the spell which Ii had breathed around the place , boyhood would sport and dream , and youth would love , and manhood would enjoy , and age would dream again , and my ghost would watch but never frighten them . Alas , the vanity of mrotal projects - even when they centre in the grave ! I died in my first youth , before I had been a lover ; at a distance , also , from the grave which fancy had dug for me ; and they buried me in the thronged cemetery of a town , where my marble slab stands unnoticed amid a hundred others . And there are coffins on each side of mine ! Alas , poor ghost ! xviii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , and disposed to be contented with my grave , if the sexton will but let it be my own , and bring no other dead man to dispute my title . Earth has left few stains upon me , and it will be but a short time that I need haunt the place . It is good to die in early youth . Had I lived out three-score years and ten , or half of them , my spirit would have been so earth-encrusted , that centuries might not have purified it for a better home than the dark precincts of the grave . Meantime , there is good choice of company amongst us . From twilight till near sunrise , we are gliding , to-and-fro , some in the grave-yard , others miles away ; and would we speak with any friend , we do but knock against his tomb-stone , and pronounce the name engraved on it ; in an instant , there the shadow stands Some are ghosts of considerable antiquity . There is an old man , hereabout ; he never had a tomb-stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hereabouts he haunts , and long // is doomed to haunt . He was a miser in his life-time , and buried a strong-box of ill-gotten gold , almost fresh from the mint , in the coinage of William and Mary . Scarcely was it safe , when the sexton buried the old man and his secret with him . I could point out the place where the treasure lies ; it was at the bottom of the miser 's garden ; but a paved thoroughfare now passes beside the spot , and the corner-stone of a market-house presses right down upon it . Had the workmen dug six inches deeper , they would have found the hoard . Now thither must this poor old miser go , whether in starlight , moonshine , or pitch-darkness , and brood above his worthless treasure , recalling all the petty crimes , by which he gained it . Not a coin must he fail to reckon in his memory , nor forget a pennyworth of the sin that made up the sum , though his agony is such as if the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . Often , while he is in torment there , he hears the steps of living men , who love the dross of earth as well as he did . May they never groan over their miserable wealth , like him ! Night after night , for above a hundred years , hath he done this penance , and still must he do it , till the iron box be brought to light , and each separate coin be cleansed by the grateful tears of a widow or an orphan . My spirit sighs for his long vigil at the corner of the market-house There are ghosts whom I tremble to meet , and can not think of them without a shudder . One has the guilt of blood upon him . The soul , which he thrust untimely forth , has long since been summoned from our gloomy grave-yard , and dwells among the stars of Heaven , too far and high for even the recollection of mortal anguish to ascend thither . Not so the murderer 's ghost It is his doom to spend all the hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to feel the hot steam - hot as when it first gushed upon his hand - incorporating itself with his spiritual substance . Thus , his horrible crime is ever fresh within him . Two other wretches are condemned to walk arm in arm . They were guilty lovers in their lives , and still , in death , must wear the guise of love , though hatred and loathing have become their very nature and existence . The pollution of their mutual sin remains with them , and makes their souls sick continually . Oh , that I might forget all the dark shadows which haunt about these graves ! This passing thought of them has left a stain , and will weigh me down among dust and sorrow , beyond the time that my own transgressions would have kept me here . There is one shade among us , whose high nature it is good to meditate upon . He lived a patriot , and is a patriot still . Posterity has forgotten him . The simple slab , of red free-stone , that bore his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the gradual accumulation of the soil . A tuft of thistles is his only // monument . This upright spirit came to his grave , after a lengthened life , with so little stain of earth , that he might , almost immediately , have trodden the pathway of the sky . But his strong love of country chained him down , to share its vicissitudes of weal or woe . With such deep yearning in his soul , he was unfit for Heaven . That noblest virtue has the effect of sin , and keeps his pure and lofty spirit in a penance , which may not terminate till America he again a wilderness . Not that there is no joy for the dead patriot . Can he fail to experience it , while he contemplates the mighty and increasing power of the land , which he protected in its infancy ? No ; there is much to gladden him . But sometimes I dread to meet him , as he returns from the bedchambers of rulers and politicians , after diving into their secret motives and searching out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern and awful sadness , and vanishes into his neglected grave . Let nothing sordid or selfish defile your deeds or thoughts , ye great men of the day , lest ye grieve the noble dead Few ghosts take such an enduring interest as this , even in their own private affairs . It made me rather sad , at first , to find how soon the flame of love expires , amid the chill damps of the tomb so much the sooner , the more fiercely it may have burned . Forget your dead mistress , youth ! She has already forgotten you . Maiden , cease to weep for your buried lover ! He will know nothing of your tears , nor value them , if he did . Yet , it were blasphemy to say that true love is other than immortal . It is an earthly passion , of which I speak , mingled with little that is spiritual , arid must therefore perish with the perishing clay . When souls have loved , there is no falsehood or forgetfulness . Maternal affection , too , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , who might have been in Heaven fifty years ago , if they could forbear to cherish earthly joy and sorrow , reflected from the bosoms of their children . Husbands and xvives have a comfortable gift of oblivion , especially when secure of the faith of their living halves . Jealousy , it is true , will play the devil with a ghost , driving him to the bedside of secondary wedlock , there to scowl , unseen , and gibber inaudible remonstrances . Dead wives , however jealous in their life-time , seldom feel this posthumous torment so acutely . Many , many things , that appear most important while we walk the busy street , lose all their interest the moment we are borne into the quiet grave-yard , which borders it . For my own part , my spirit had not become so mixed up with earthly existence , as to be now held in an unnatural combination , or tortured much with retrospective cares . I still love my parents and a younger sister , who remain among the living , and often grieve me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear of theirs ' is an // added weight upon my soul , and lengthens my stay among the graves . As to other matters , it exceedingly rejoices me , that my summons caine before I had time to write a projected poem , which was highly imaginative in conception , and could not have failed to give me a triumphant rank in the choir of our native bards . Nothing is so much to be deprecated as posthumous flown . It keeps the immortal spirit from the proper bliss of his celestial state , and causes him to feed upon the impure breath of mortal men , till sometimes he forgets that there are starry realms above him . Few poets - infatuated that they are ! - soar upward , while the least xvhisper of their name is heard on earth . On Sabbath evenings , my sisters sit by the fireside , between our father and mother , and repeat some hymns of mine , which they have often heard from my own lips , ere the tremulous voice left them forever . Little do they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the glimmer of the firelight , and is almost gifted with a visible shape by the fond intensity of their remem-brance ! Now shall the reader know a grief of the poor ghost that speaks to him ; a grief , but not a hopeless one . Since I have dwelt among the graves , they bore the corpse of a young maiden hither , and laid her in the old ancestral vault , which is hollowed in the side of a grassy bank . It has a door of stone , with rusty iron hinges , and above it , a rude sculpture of the family-arms , and Inscriptions of all their names who have been buried there , including sire and son , mother and daughter , of an ancient colonial race . All of her lineage had gone before , and when the young maiden followed , the portal was closed forever . The night after her burial , when the other ghosts were flitting about their graves , forth came the pale virgin 's shadow , with the rest , but knew not whither to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on earth . She stood by the ancient sepulchre , looking upward to the bright stars , as if she would , even then , begin her flight . Her sadness made me sad . That night and the next , I stood near her , in the moonshine , but dared not speak , because she seemed purer than all the ghosts , and fitter to converse with angels than with men . But the third bright eve , still gazing upward to theglory of the Heavens , she sighed , and said , When will my mother come for me ! ' Her low , sweet voice emboldened me to speak , and she was kind and gentle , though so pure , and answered me again . From that time , always at the ghostly hour , I sought the old tomb of her fathers , and either found her standing by the door , or knocked and she appeared . Blessed creature , that she was ; her chaste spirit hallowed mine , and imparted such a celestial buoyancy , that I longed to grasp her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I thought , too , that she only // lingered here , till my earthijer soul should be purified for Heaven . One night , when the stars threw down the light that shadows love , I stole forth to the accustomed spot , and knocked , with my airy fingers , at her door . She answered not . Again I knocked , and breathed her name . Where was she ? At once , the truth fell on my miserable spirit , and crushed it to the earth , among dead men 's hones and mouldering dust , groaning in cold and desolate agony . Her penance was over ! She had taken her trackless flight , and had found a home in the purest radiance of the upper stars , leaving me to knock at the stone portal of the darksome sepulchre . But I know - I know , that angels hurried her away , or surely she would have whispered ere she fled She is gone ! How could the grave imprison that unspotted one ! But her pure , etherial spirit will not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till I ascend to join her . Soon , soon be that hour ! I am weary of the earth-damps ; they burthen me they choke me ! Already , I can float on the moonshine ; the faint starlight will almost hear up my footsteps ; the perfume of flowers , which grosser spirits love , is now too earthly a lux*ury for me . Grave ! Grave ! thou art not my home . I must flit a little longer in thy night-gloom , and then he gone - far from the dust of the living and the dead - far from the corruption that is around me , hut no more within ! A few times , I have visited the chamber of one who walks , obscure and lonely , on his mortal pilgrimage . He will leave not many living friends , when he goes to join the dead , where his thoughts often stray , and he might better he . I steal into his sleep , and play my part among the figures of his dream . I glide through the moonlight of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th a strange thrill of fear , he writes down as his own . I stand beside him now , at midnight , telling these dreamy truths , with a voice so dreamlike , that he mistakes them for fictions of a brain too prone to such . Yet he glances behind him , and shivers , xvhile the lamp burns pale . IFarewell , dreamer - waking or sleeping ! Your brightest dreams are fled ; your mind grows too hard and cold for a spiritual guest to enter ; you are earthly , too , and have all the sins of earth The ghost will visit you no more . But where is the maiden , holy and pure , though wearing a form of clay , that xvould have me bend over her pillow , at midnight , and leave a blessing there ? With a silent invocation , let her summon me . Shrink not , maiden , when I come ! In life , I was a high-souled youth , meditative , yet seldom sad , full of chaste fancies , and stainless from all grosser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no loathsome smell of the grave , nor ghastly terrors - but gentle , and soothing , and sweetly pensive influences . Perhaps , // just fluttering for the skies , my visit may hallow the well-springs of thy thought , and make thee heavenly here on earth . Then shall pure dreams and holy meditations bless thy life ; nor thy sainted spirit linger round the grave , but seek the upper stars , and meet me there !
