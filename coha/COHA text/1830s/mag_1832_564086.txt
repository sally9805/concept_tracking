" # NOEL . THE AMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY . rThe editors do not wish to be considered as advocates for the plan proposed in the following article , nor even as converts to the opinion of the writer . The presumption that it represents the feelings and wishes of many respectable individuals , and a willingness to surrender our right to reject what may possibly promote a beneficial result , have induced us to admit it into our pages . If a reply should be sent , written in a temper equally moderate , and of no greater length , we shall feel obliged to insert it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a channel for a protracted controversy on this or any other subject . THIs is an institution of no ordinary importance ; its purposes involve nothing less than the expatriation of an entire people , and it is now our part to inquire whether their consummation be practicable or desirable . We are aware that the Colonization Society is a favorite of the nation , and that our view of it is exceedingly unpopular ; but we shall not therefore shrink from the discussion . If " the scheme be of God , " as its excellent originator expressed himself no force of argument can prevail against it ; but if the contrary be the case , as we believe , it ought to be brought before the public in its true light . The American Colonization Society was founded in 1816 , by the Rev. Robert Finley , of New-Jersey , and its first meeting was held in Washington . No active measures resulted from its organization till , in the year 1818 , two clergymen sailed to Africa in quest of information on which the future operations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent and two agents for the government of the United States followed them , with eighty more emigrants . The first location of the colony was so ill chosen that twenty-seven of this party , * Reg . Sc . Dis . of Witchcraft . B. viii . ch. 15 . I // including the three agents , fell victims to the climate within a few weeks of their arrival . However , the friends of the society were not discouraged , and another exportation of free blacks took place the following year . The climate proving absolutely incompatible with human life , the settlers were removed to Sierra Leone , where they remained for a short time by the sufferance of the British colonial authorities . Here the same mortality prevailed . Two of the new agents perished among others . After much difficulty the natives were persuaded to cede a tract of land about and including Cape Montserado , which became the permanent site of the colony , and received the name of Liberia . The emigrants had here to contend with the malignity of the climate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had well nigh extirpated them in 18252 . Since that time about a hundred emigrants have been sent to Liberia annually . Much discrepancy exists in the accounts of the country about the settlement . The friends of the Colonization Society represent it as every way favorable to their undertaking . Its enemies represent the climate as mortal , and the natives as powerful and irreconcileably hostile . Something like the truth may , perhaps , be gained from the statement of the progress of the colony which we shall give hereafter . We can only learn the principles and purposes of the Colonization Society from their official reports , and from the pages of a periodical , entitled , the " African Repository , " which is their avowed and acknowledged organ . According to these authorities the principles of the institution are as follows* 1 . The Society contends that Africa , and not America , is the native country of negroes born in this hemisphere . 2 . It holds that the color of the blacks is , and will be , an insuperable bar to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This class , degraded in character , and miserable in condition , forever excluded by public sentiment , by law , and by a physical distinction , from the most powerful motives for exertion , " &amp;c . African Repository , vol. i. p. 34. 3 . It confines its good or evil offices , as the case may be , to the free blacks , and we bel'ieve ( having no evidence to the contrary ) does nothing for the redemption of slaves . It , however , takes charge of slaves emancipated for the express purpose of deportation . 4 . It contends that the presence of the blacks among us is a curse alike to themselves and us. 5 . It holds out to its friends the prospects of communicating the blessings of civilization and Christianity to the natives of Africa . 6 . It discourages emancipation , unless for the purpose of expatriation . " Emancipation , with the liberty to remain on this side of the Atlantic , is an act of dreamy madness . " See the 13th Annual Report . 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall ultimately be conveyed away through its means , and affirms that this is practicable . We could quote enough matter from the above-mentioned authorties to substantiate these premises fifty times over ; but we hope our readers will have confidence enough in our candor to excuse us from // *ricumbering our pages , especially as these , the principles of the society , are matter of notoriety , and are in the mouth of every man . We believe the Colonization Society do not wish to remove any free negro by force , whether of arms or law . They propose to employ persuasion only . This being the case , it was extremely bad policy to tell the blacks that Africa is their native land . These people love the country which disowns , contemns , and oppresses them , and which would fain thrust them forth as outcasts and aliens . With a feeling common to most people who live in unkind countries , they contend that the land of their birth is their home . The contrary assumption strikes them as supremely ridiculous . ( We speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any connection with Africa . They are almost to a man opposed to the project of emigration , and resolved to await the changes time may bring forth , here . They consider this doctrine as an affront , and it has done more to retard the operations of the society than any other cause . Each and every one of their conventions , and they have lately held many , has passed resolutions expressing the above sentiments , and some of them have declared that they will hold all who may consent to embark for Africa1 as traitors . We think they are right ; this is their country-they are governed by its laws-they contribute their mite to its support-they speak its language-here they were born-here their kindred abide-they know no other . It is as much their country as it is ours . Our ancestors came from Europe , theirs from Africa ; but we see not how that circumstance can affect the birth-right of either party . It is an insult to common sense to speak of sending them " to their own country . " That we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , does not alter the case in the least . Suppose the negroes of Alabama , who are a large majority of the whole population , should become free , and immediately upon their emancipation should insist on sending their former masters " to their own country " - what would these last answer ? The blacks wouW only be reversing the position of the Colonization Society . That the color of the free negroes is a very great obstacle to their improvement is undeniable ; that this bar is insurmountable remains to be seen . The experiment has never yet been tried . The first blacks who came to New-England could bequeath to their children only an inheritance of ignorance , misery and degradation . No hand has been stretched out to aid them ; on the contrary , they have not been permitted to help themselves . Prejudice has excluded them from the exercise of most of their civil rights , though the laws have made them our political equals . They have been denied the common privileges of education , and forbidden to associate with those by whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under all these disadvantages , instead of wondering that they have done so little for themselves , we ought to be surprised that they have done any thing . Yet a very considerable change has taken place in their condition within the last twenty years . There are few of them now who are not at least able to read . Many of them have property , and very many are united with their white neighbors in church fellowship . // They are beginning to acquire an esprit de corps , and to unite in effecting particular objects . Very many of them are able writers , as the proceedings of their conventions amply testify . Some of the reports of these bodies will not suffer by comparison with any similar documents which have of late been indited by whites . They have presses , devoted exclusively to their interests , and support them with great spirit . The columns of some of their papers are wholly , and all of them partly , filled with the productions of negroes . Without pretending that this kind of instruction is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has its use , and that it rouses them to exertion . They are endeavoring to establish schools all over the country-there has been one gathered in this city within a few weeks , and it is rapidly increasing . In a word , they have discovered that knowledge is power , and riches , and honor , and they are strenuously exerting themselves to acquire it . We very much doubt that color is the sole source of the universai prejudice against the descendants of Africa , though undoubtedly it has served to strengthen and perpetuate it . The name of negro has , in this country , always been associated with the idea of slavery , and the word slave is , and ever has been , a term of reproach all over the world . Our blacks are no longer slaves , and when vice and igno-. rance shall disappear from among them , will not the prejudice disappear also ? Reasoning from analogy , we think it must . For more than a century , our pilgrim fathers held their Indian neighbors in. as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no more . For ages , the Jews were as much despised , and as much degraded , in England , as ever the negroes were in Massachusetts . They now rank and mix with other subjects of the British crown . Christians residing in Mahometan states have even now but begun to emerge from the condition of our blacks . Color was not the foundation of pre*judiee in either of these instances , but the feeling was not therefore the less strong . These people have conquered the ill-will of their fellows by raising their own character . The gypsies , and the race called in Europe Cagots , Cretins , &amp;c. have made no such change , and are now despised as much as they were three centuries ago . We think we may take it for granted that the race , who left the colossal head of Memnon and the ruins of Thebes and Memphis , to tell of their glory and power , were not despised by their white contemporaries , though their hair was as crisp and their noses were as flat as those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans , in any part of Europe , where they have not been held in thraldom . Our remote Indians , far from regarding negroes with dis-. gust , admire their appearance exceedingly , till they discover that the whites hold them in slavery and contempt . If a stronger proof that our dislike is not wholly founded on color be needed , it may be found all over the union , in the number of persons of mixed blood . In the valley of the Mississippi , especially , the national prejudice has been so far overcome , that a very large proportion of the whole population , probably more than a third , are mulattoes . After all , the voice of interest is louder , and speaks more to the purpose , than reason or philanthropy . When a black merchant shall sell his goods cheaper than his white neighbor , he will have the most // customers . When a black mechanic shall work cheaper and better than a white one , he will be more frequently employed . When a black lawyer shall have proved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a thorough knowledge of his profession , he will have white clients . The laws do not hinder the blacks from following any honest calling , and the cases we have supposed are , therefore , possible . If , two hundred years hence , the free negroes shall have made no material advance toward political equality , or having made a considerable one , if the prejudice shall not have disappeared , we think it will then be time to adopt the sentiment of the Colonization Society , and to say that a black skin is a natural and therefore a just cause of offence . It seems to be admitted on all hands that the presence of slaves is a curse to our country , a drawback on our prosperity , which we would be rid of , could we discover the means . The slave-holders themselves concur in these sentiments . It needs no argument to prove that the slave states have more reason to wish their slaves in Africa , than the free ones to desire the removal of the free blacks . The condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even should they perish in the process of acclimation ; for death is surely preferable to hopeless thraldom . Why then do not the Colonization Society confer their benefits on those who need them most ? Why do they overlook the many utterly wretched for the sake of the few who are but partially so ? But it is now our business to inquire what reason we , the people of the free states , have to desire the removal of the black portion of our population . We do not believe that the presence of the free blacks is disadvantageous to us . They are too few to taint our blood , being but about half a million in all . These are almost all seamen , or daily laborers , and are as harmless and inoffensive as the whites of the same class We believe that their capacity to labor is equal . When they are gone , white men must hew our wood , draw our water , and perform our menial offices . They supply the place of so many whites , who may be spared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , that disadvantage can not become greater , for they do not increase in the same ratio with the whites . We have still room for them , certainly . They do not resist the laws , or interfere with us in any respect . They are too few to *affect white laborers , materially , as it respects the chance of employment , and moreover , these last are mostly aliens , who have not the claim of being our fellow-countrymen . The free blacks do us some good and no harm . If they improve , their usefulness will increase ; if they do not , we shall be none the worse . Why then should we drive so many humble and serviceable Helots from our soil ? The answer will probably be that they are not satisfied with their lowly condition , that they are becoming more intelligent , and that they will communicate their discontent to the slaves . If this is not the motive of those who wish their removal , we can see no other . Were the effects of the proceedings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its warmest friends . That civilization and Christianity should take root and flourish , and overspread that unhappy peninsula , must be the desire of every person of // common humanity . Would to Heaven that such a consummation might take place ! The cessation of the slave trade would be one blessed result . The cruel wars which keep that beautiful land desolate woald cease  --  the lion and the tiger would retire before the face of man  --  the jungle would become a corn-field-no future Captain Riley would tell how , when wrecked on the coast , he was evil-entreated and haled away into captivity by the natives  --  the fetiche tree would give place to the village spire , and the church bells would be heard instead of the conch and the war-horn . Above all , we should have repaired a million of wrongs . A glorious picture , indeed . *And what are the means we employ to bring such things to pass I We do not send over men of talents and learning , ( at least not many of them ; ) we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers . We send over yearly about a hundred men , women and children , confessedly the most ignorant , the most helpless , and the most depraved among the lowest of our lowest class . These are not the persons to tame the wilderness , or convert the heathen . They can not improve by associating with each other . They must sink into the barbarism of the surrounding tribes unless preserved by the missionaries and other agents of the Society ; and these , we are happy to say , have done much , and may do more . Since the Colonization Society commenced operations they have exported about two thousand blacks , of whom one fourth were slaves , emancipated for this express purpose . The colony has also received an accession of a few hundred blacks taken from slave ships captured on the coast . The colony has now two thousand inhabitants only , so that we must suppose that there is some truth in the accounts we have received of the malignity of the climate , since it has devoured the whole natural increase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been augmented , not to speak of the missionaries and agents whose bones rest in the soil of Liberia . In fact the progress of the colony has been backward , as far as it respects numbers . The original settlement of New.England was considered a desperate undertaking , yet the process of population was never retrograde , nor even stationary , for half the length of time the Colonization Society has been in operation . In short , the Society has altogether failed in one of its great objects , the civilization and conversion of Africa . All the industry and Christianity in Liberia has been oarried thither , and has there remained stationary , or worse , and all that has been carried thither is not to be found there now . Yet the good men who have taken it on themselves to watch and guard the exiles have not been idle . Liberia can boast of its gardens , and cultivated fields , of its church and its school . Let us hope that , the first dangers and difficulties attending the settlement of a new country being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity . Let us hope that this small germ may give being to an independent and happy nation . The I ) rincipal ground on which we object to the Colonization Society is , that it holds up to the people of the United States hopes which can never be realized , and which tend to perpetuate the degrad&amp;tion of the blacks at home . By persuading the free negroes that // they never can be happy or respected here , it extinguishes their hopes and better feelings , and takes away their motives for honorable exertion . The remote prospect , too , of a gradual but ultimately entire removal- of the race , serves to quiet the consciences of many who would otherwise endeavor to remove a great shame and scandal from the land . Let us now see if the means within the reach of the Society are adequate to remove the evil , or even any considerable part of it . There are two millions an ( l a half of colored persons in the United States at the very least . Their annual increase has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual is , according to the African Repository , thirty dollars . At this rate it would require 1,780,000 dollars to remove the increase of a single year . And could this be done yearly it would merely keep the black population stationary , supposing the emigrants to be taken from the mass indiscriminately , without regard to sex or age . The increase of the free blacks , alone exceeds eleven thousand annually . It would require 330,000 dollars to transport their increase for a single year , calculating the expense at the rate given by the Society . Now the Society has never owned half that sum during the whole period of its existence . No great nation was ever depopulated by emigration , and were the negroes by themselves , they would constitute a great nation . Is Ireland the less crowded , because of the many thousands she has cast on the shores of other lands ? Her present condition may answer the question . To depopulate a country , the emigration must be greater than the increase . To get entirely rid of the black population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us suppose a plan to effect this ob* ject in any given time , thirty years for example . We must transport at least 100,000 per annum . This will cost us three millions of dollars a year . But it is useless to pursue the calculation further , since it is self-evident that the 1,780,000 dollars , which would be requisite to transport the mere increase , can never be raised . It is barely within the limits of possibility that the Society may ever be able to raise the sum required to transport the increase of the free blacks alone . If we say that it has expended 150,000 dollars since its existence began , we believe we shall exceed the truth ; and it is by no means probable that its receipts will ever hereafter be materially augmented . The scheme has had the decided approbation of the American people ever since it was first devised ; it has been constantly before the public , and has probably attained the maximum of its popularity . Our calculations above are based on the assumption that the owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward . Unless that should take place , the price of transportation would be collected in vain . We leave it to our readers to judge whether such liberality can be expected . And if the government should consent to purchase a hundred thousand slaves annually for deportation , the expense would be twenty-three millions per annum , estimating their price at the moderate sum of two hundred dollars each . We also leave it to our readers , whether such an act of ultra legislation can be expected . Let us now see what the Colonization Society has done toward thinning the numbers of the negroes . It has been in operation fourteen // years , and during that time has transported two thousand persons only , some trifle more than the increase of a fortnight . When we believe that the ocean can be scooped dry with a bucket , we shall also believe that they can effect the change to which the public looks forward so confidently . On expressing our opinions on this subject , we have frequently been asked , what , had we the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a question more easily put than answered . On one point , however , we are decided ; we would make no attempt to remove the negroes ; being firmly convinced that it is utterly impracticable . That the members of the Colonization Society are good men , that they are actuated by the purest motives , we firmly believe ; but we believe , as firmly , that their labors are misdirected , inasmuch as they tend to make us impatient under a misfortune which we must endure , and to foment and increase the already too great dislike of the two races to each other . The reasons which we have most often heard in favor of the continuance of slavery are these . We acknowledge the criminality of the system in the abstract , we deplore its existence , and we would be rid of it if we could . But the evil was entailed on us by our fathers , and we are not responsible for it . We can not , however , emancipate our slaves . They have not the habits which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts of life ; they are , moreover , shiftless and ignorant , and would probably perish of want , were they emancipated immediately . Add to this , that they smart under a sense of wrong , and would , perhaps , slay us for our pains . We can devise no means of a safe and gradual abolition , save those offered by the Colonization Society . We have not made these a subject of consideration but we hope they may answer the purpose . Finally , if we set them free , and if none of the above-mentioned evils come to pass , they . will remain in contact with us , which is very disagreeable ; they will acquire power and property , and at last become half owners of all the southern states . This last consideration alone ought to be a conclusive argument against eman9ipation , unless followed by emigration . We are compelled here to beg the question ; but we believe our readers will readily allow that these are the sentiments usually in the mouths of the advocates of the Colonization Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . We , the present generation , are not , indeed , answerable for the introduction of slavery ; but , if any safe means to remove the curse should offer , and we do not avail ourselves of it , we shall stand with our fathers in the relation of the receiver with the thief . How do we know that no such means can be devised ? Have we ever sought for them ? We have not ; and the neglect is in itself highly criminal . The only scheme of the kind which has been offered to our acceptance is that of the Colonization Society , and the experience of fourteen years has proved that to be futile . Let us therefore seek some other . As we can not get rid of our slaves , let us see how we can render their presence safe and tolerable to ourselves and to them . Here they are , and here they will remain , either as our friends or as our enemies . If we do not set them free , they will , ere long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The increasing intelligence of the free blacks begins to have its effect on them . The case is a crying one . The voice of insurrection reaches us on every wind . It is undeniable that the tranquility of the South is gone . She sends forth a voice of sorrow and lamentation , " Ramah weeping for her children . " It is to be feared that this is but the beginning of trouble . As it is , life is not secure ; property has lost its value . Penal enactments and bloody retaliation only make the matter worse . The ignorance of the slaves is no security-it can not continue . They are beginning to learn that " all men axe born free and equal , " and to act upon that knowledge . Insurrection after insurrection may be put down ; the slaves would probably be defeated in a general servile war ; but in the meanwhile what is the condition of the south ? Every man has his hand on the sword . It is better that our brethren should give up their slaves , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things should continue . Something must be done , and speedily . The slaves now maintain themselves and their masters too ; it will be strange if they can not maintain themselves alone . We can not see how emancipation would relax their muscles or otherwise disqualify them from labor . It is true , there is some danger in immediate abolilion , but it seems to us that there is more in the continuance of slavery . If we give them freedom we shall have a claim on their gratitude ; if we do not , they have every thing to hate , but nothing to love us for . Ead we not better give with a good grace what we can not safely hold ? Supposing such a change to be peaceably effected , the present generation of slave holders need fear no material diminution of their im. portance . The negroes are laborers now ; they would then be nothing more . The two parties would still be in the relative situations of master and servant . Why do not the legislatures of the slave states deliberate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedies which only give partial relief , and leave the system in a worse condition than before ? Abolish slavery , and the negroes have nothing to contend for-draw the bonds ciosir , and every further restriction , eviery stripe , is an additional incentive to revenge , a motive for insurrection and massacre . Instead of wiping out the score of wrong , the slave-holders seem to be endeavoring , to put its discharge out of their own power . Policy , if not humanity , should suggest a different course . We are well aware of the present unfitness of the negroes to exercise the rights of free men , or to possess the smallest political power . We believe that an instant , general abolition would involve them in very many difficulties . Yet , we think , that their condition would be bettered even by this measure . Which of ourselves would not prefer a life of freedom , though accompanied by every hardship human nature is capable of enduring , to the mere animal enjoyments of a life of hopeless servitude , ignorance and degradation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well treated , not over-wrought , fed , and comfortably clad , and that they would not be free if they could . We grant that this is true of a great many of them , but what then ? The same things may be said of domestic cattle , and the slave , who feels thus , is no whit , morally , superior to his fellow slave , the horse or ox he drives . Biit this is not true of the great body of slaves . If they // are generally well treated , contented , and happy , how is it that we find a dozen runaways advertised in every southern paper that reaches us , and how is it that these are most commonly identified by the scars of the whip ? We think a safe method of gradual abolition may be devise4 , which will injure neither the master nor the slave . Let us suppose that the slave-holders of a single state consent and agree to give freedom , ten years hence , to every slave , who ) during that period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose , that after that time , each planter shall divide his plantation among his freedmen , and allow them to cultivate it on shares , as his tenants . Let us suppose that freedom from personal violence and restraint is the sole reward of ten years of good behavior ,  --  will not the slaves still have the most powerful motive to exertion ? Will it not be their interest to serve , and to be at peace with their masters ? Will not this ten years ' training go far to remove their unfitness for freedom ? Will this system injure either of the interested parties ? The planter would neither part with his lands nor his income . He would only give up the market price of his slaves , and he would receive peace and safety in exchange . He would convert deadly enemies into friends , and , after all , would only relinquish what he has no moral right to retain , and what , in all probability , will otherwise be wrested from him , or from his posterity . Suppose that the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitting each freedman to all the further privileges of citizenship , five years after the date of emancipation-provided , always , the said freedman should be able to produce a certificate of his previous good conduct , and of his ability to read and write . Magistrates and ministers of the gospel might be empowered to grant such certificates . Would not this system , or something like it , do away with all uncharitableness on the part of the blacks , and silence the voice of insurrection forever . It seems to us , that if the blacks be indeed men , accessible to the common feelings of humanity , such a system would have an all-important effect on them . It would make the curse a blessing , and give our country two millions of useful citizens , instead of the same number of contented brutes and discontented foes who now burthen our soil . In half a century the United States would not be disgraced by the presence of a single slave , and probably this change would be effected in much less time . This scheme would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the whites , and equal sharers of the powers of government . Why , if they qualify themselves for this situation , should it not be so ? We believe no reason can be alleged why it should not , apart from their color . If an amalgamation of the two colors is dreaded , is it not in rapid progress now ? And if the negroes must remain on the soil , is it not better that they should remain as intelligent friends than as brutal enemies ? We are often told , that we of the free states have no interest in the matter , and that we have no right to meddle with our neighbors , Whatever they may do . We hold that we have that right , and that we are interested . By buying the produce of slave labor , we do as much to perpetuate the system as the slave-holders themselves . We have guaranteed the existence of slavery , by acceding to the federal constitution . // We share the national reproach , and we are liable to be called on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern brethren is , that we do not wield the scourge with our own hands , and that our lives are not in danger . And we have no interest to oppose such a change as we have suggested ; for why should we care whether we buy our cotton and sugar from blacks or whites , if both sell at the same price ? We have given our views of the Colonization Society , and of the practicability of extinguishing slavery in the United States , by other and speedier means than theirs . We rest the case here .

Men often hang it up when they come home , and growl at their wives and storm at their children , with the same tongue that can discourse most mournful music , whenever there is an effect to be produced . I do not mean to deny Sentiment all merit whatever , nor to confound it with that nauseous sentimentality which may be seen in the writings of Rousseau , Kotzebue , and a host of others , and which appears to ' be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // most abandoned profligacy in conduct . It is amusing to read the high-flown raptures of Rousseau , in his Nouvelle Heloise and in some parts of his Confessions , ( particularly his account of his love for Madame d'Houdetot , which is written with a fervor and glowing eloquence worthy of all admiration in a merely literary point of view , ) when we recollect that he sent his own children to a foundling hospital as soon as they were horn . The man of Sentiment is not a heartless being . He feels strongly and vividly , but that very rapidity of fancy , which makes his emotions so keen , makes them also shortlived . While the glow is upon him , he will do almost any thing and make almost any sacrifice , but his ardor soon cools and he has not the steady perseverance to put in execution the plans he formed while the excitement lasted . If he be a rich man , he will give away a great deal of money , but he will do it*from impulse , and often injudiciously ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage to give his time and personal attention , which is a far more important and less frequent kind of charity . There are two men of my acquaintance , of nearly the same age , property , and standing in society , one of whom is a man of Feeling , and the other a man of Sentiment . Sentiment is rather a more gifted man than Feeling , writes and talks well , and on no subject does he write or speak so often and so well , as on the duty of doing good to each other . Feeling never wrote a paragraph in the newspapers , nor spoke where ten people could hear him ; but there is not a cellar or a garret in Broad-street , that he has not been into , and there are hundreds of people that pray for him every day of their lives . Sentiment is the admiration of his acquaintances ; Feeling , the delight of his friends . No better illustration can be given of the difference between them , than was shown in their conduct on one particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under circumstances of peculiar affliction , and leaving a large family nearly destitute . Sentiment heard of his death as he was going to an evening party , where he spoke of his departed friend and of his irreparable loss to his widow and children , in such a way as to bring tears into the eyes of all who heard him ; but in a short time the conversation turned upon other subjects , and Sentiment became as lively and entertaining as ever . Feeling also heard of it as he was going to this same party , and he turned about and went home , for he loved his friend too well to feel in the *mood to join a gay crowd while he was yet unburied . The next day Sentiment sat down and wrote a beautiful letter to the bereaved widow , while Feeling went about and collected a subscription for her use . Sentiment published an eloquent obituary notice of his friend , while Feeling paid his funeral expenses . Feeling adopted one of his sons , and educated him , while Sentiment named one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , in whom the two qualities are more strikingly displayed than in any persons of my acquaintance . I shall call one of them by the familiar name of Mary , and the other by the more romantic one of Matilda , assigning to each an appellation somewhat consistent with her character . Mary has a great deal of strong sense , uniform cheerfulness , and a fund of deep and quiet feeling . Matilda has more imagination , more liveliness , more enthusiasm and // more sentiment . Mary is slow in forming attachments and is very constant to her old friends ; but Matilda is apt to be bewitched with new faces , and repose confidence in those whom she soon finds to be unworthy of it . In literature their tastes are widely different . Matilda hangs with rapture over the passionate dreamings of Byron , and the mystical speculations of Shelly , but Mary prefers the tenderness of Cowper , and the deep philosophy of Wordsworth . If Matilda could find out some beautiful being that was dying of a consumption , or a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber tastefully adorned with flowers , and dressed in robes of spotless white , she would devote to her all her time and energies , and be the most assiduous of nurses , and the most sympathizing of friends ; but she can not endure smoky houses , unwashed children , nor any repulsive form of sickness . I remember very well how differently they behaved on an occasion when I happened to be present , when the wife of a poor sailor and the mother of many children , and who lived near them , rushed into the house with the utmost disorder of look and manner , and told them , with the passionate lamentation customary to persons in her rank of life , in circumstances of overwhelming grief that she had just heard that her husband was lost at sea , when within two days sail of the harbor . Matilda was dreadfully overcome , and had nearly fainted , and on recovering , flew to her purse and emptied it into the woman 's lap , and then sat down and wept in helpless impotence . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and applied herself at once to the soothing and comforting of her afflicted and humble friend , and by suggesting to her reflections and consolations in a manner equally creditable to her judgement and her feelings , soon succeeded in converting the hysterical violence of grief into a more calm and subdued state of feeling . And this was but the beginning of her good deeds . She made a decent suit of mourning for her , went about and procured situations for two or three of her children , and spoke of her case to some wealthy friends , with that eloquence which comes from the heart and goes to the heart , so that they became interested in her , relieved her present iiecessities , and provided her with the means of gaining a permanent livelihood . All this Matilda could not have done , though she would have loaded her with gifts if she had had the means . Mary had as limited means as her cousin ; but how much good can be done by one who has a willing heart and a resolute spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her dotage , and is , moreover , confined to her room by infirmities , and it is curious to see how unconsciously they display their different characters by their treatment of her . Matilda is truly attached to her ; often speaks of her with deep feeling , and is ready to do anything for her , and to contribute to her happiness in any way she can . She goes to see her almost every day , and lights up the invalid 's chamber , like a sun-beam , with her sweet looks . She delights to carry her flowers , pictures , or anything that will amuse her childish mind ; but her lively fancy can not endure the " bald disjointed chat " of the poor old lady . She is restless , and fidgets on her chair while she is in the room , and soon makes an excuse to be gone . But Mary regularly devotes a certain portion of her time to her . She will read the newspaper to her by the hour together , and listen , without the least sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a century old , and to the pointless story that she knows already by heart . She will tell her , too , who is married , and who is engaged , and who have failed , and who has come into town , and who has gone out of it , and who have given parties , and who are going to ,  --  and , in short , empty the basket of gossip to its last chip . And she will do all this , though in addition to her excellent sense , she has a very vivid perception and keen enjoyment of the ludicrous . When they were both about seventeen years old , they heard of the death of a schoolfellow , whom they both fondly loved , from whom they had parted only about a year , and whose residence was only a day 's journey from their own . Matilda was almost heart-broken at her loss , and , in the touching language of Scripture , " refused to be comforted . " She hardly slept for several nights , and hardly tasted food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as deeply , but her grief was of that stunning and absorbing nature , that it occupied her whole mind to the exclusion of every other image . Mary , though deeply afflicted , and disposed to yield to the torrent of grief which came over her , remembered , even in that trying hour , that her obligations to duty yet remained . She thought of the mother and sisters of her friend , and said to herself , " their sorrow is yet greater than mine . " She flew to them on the wings of love . She soothed and consoled them . She took upon herself all those household duties for which they were unfitted , and so occupied herself that she was obliged to forego the luxury of tears , till she had retired to rest . She remained with them till the bitterness of their anguish was over , and then came home and resumed her own duties as quietly as if all she had done had been a matter of course . I recollect another instance where the difference in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village where they reside , was slowly recovering from a disorder , which had confined him to the house for several months . The physician had recommended him to drink Madeira wine , and he might as well have prescribed nectar , so far as the sick man 's ability to procure it was concerned . Matilda heard of it and gave up , to the charitable purpose of procuring him the wine , a sum of money which she had laid aside for the purchase of a new bonnet , and wore her old one another winter ; and ( I may remark , en passant ) never did she look so beautiful to my eyes , as she did the next time I saw her with it on . On another occasion , this same sick man expressed a wish to have some particular delicacy , of which his family had not the ingredients , nor did they know how to make it . When Mary heard of it , she immediately sent a servant with the materials to their humble abode , and soon followed herself and cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their only fire as if she had been Sterne 's " fat , foolish scullion " herself . There is , in short , hardly a day in the year in which their peculiar traits do not manifest themselves . I have often seen Matilda stop and caress a beautiful child in the street , addressing it with a look and tone that the child always remembered ; but I never shall forget seeing Mary , when I was once riding in the stage with her , hold in her lap for two or three hours , an infant that was neither clean nor pretty , to relieve its poor mother , who looked sick , and faint , and broken-hearted . And never // shall I forget the grateful look with which the woman expressed her thanks , telling her , with a manner and in language much above her appearance , " that she hoped she would never be in a condition to receive the kindness that she had shown towards her . " Such are my two cousins , each charming in her way , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were a fairy , each of them should marry a prince . But , perhaps , some fair reader may ask , " suppose they were not your cousins , which of them should you prefer ? " Why , in truth , that is one of that numerous class of questions , which are more easy to ask than to answer . But if I must give a reply , I should say , that I prefer a twilight walk in the woods with the romantic Matilda , or to sit by her side in a summer evening when the rich moonlight is steeping , in its silver beauty , her dark hair and spiritual eyes , ; but if I were going to select a companion to walk hand in hand with , through this vale of tears , I am pretty certain it would be the affectionate and kind-hearted Mary.
