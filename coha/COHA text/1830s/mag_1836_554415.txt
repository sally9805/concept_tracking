txt FEW have discharged more fully than Mr. Livingston that debt , which Bacon holds every one to owe to his profession . In addition to an honest and liberal practice , he has indeed , to use the language of that great man , visited and strengthened the roots and foundation of the science itself ; he has graced it in reputation and dignity , and amplified it in profession and substance . It too generally happens , that those , who have confined themselves to a particular science , learn to attrihute to it an undue importance among the various branches of human knowledge and improvement , and also bring themselves to believe , that in its forms , usages and long practised rules , there are intrinsic excellence and advantage , which it is unxvise to controvert and almost improper to change . If we regret , we may yet pardon such prejudices to the votary of // abstract science , or to the professors of those arts whose objects are to excite the imagination or gratify the taste . The astronomer consumes the silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e revolutions of worlds scarcely visible and immeasurably distant ; why should we deny to him the pride of believing , that his pursuit is the purest and noblest that can engage the industry of our race ? Such a belief quickens and rewards his own zeal , while it is innocent in every sense which can affect the interest or welfare of others . The artist or the mechanist , who limits his genius by the rules and theories of other days , is only left to find himself lingering in the race , and losing the profits or the honors which are gained hy more enlightened competitors in the same pursuit . A prejudice , however , is only thus harmless , while it affects no one but him who has the right to indulge it , and may innocently do so . When it operates injuriously on the personal rights , the interests , property , or fortunes of mankind ; when it excludes the lights which are shed on every kindred subject by philanthropy , research , and the certain progress of human knowledge ; when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or cruel doctrines of ages less wise and refined ; when it upholds , as if they were sacred , forms and institutions that have sprung from obsolete customs , or arisen from the wants of a society altogether different ; then prejudice ceases to be excusable , and those who uphold it ought to be regarded less as innocent advocates of the wisdom of other days , than as unwise and injudicious opposers of the improvement and happiness of their own times . These principles are peculiarly applicable to jurisprudence ; a science which directly affects all the social duties and relations of men . In preserving individual rights , it substitutes for the hand of power a universal mutual compact , whose foundation is the intention and desire of protecting all , at the least individual sacrifice . In preventing or punishing the excesses of passion and crime , it acts not from the impulse of personal retaliation , nor assumes a control over the secret emotions of the heart ; but it calmly inquires into the exact extent of infringement on the privileges or happiness of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repetition of similar injuries , and bring home to the aggressor a full sense of the wrong that he has committed . // Such a science , therefore , is not abstract . It is immediately dependent on the state of human society . Its rules vary with the variations of knowledge , of refinement , of all the social arts . It improves in proportion to the improvements of civilization . Reason , and simplicity , and humanity remove its peculiarities , enlarge its utility , and soflen its severity . It regards the present and not the past , equally in the things to be regulated and the manner in which they are treated ; and he , who , in our days , should govern himselF in this science by the rules of Lycurgus or the Decemvirs , would not be more wise than a countryman of Arkwright or Laplace , who should calculate the motions of the stars like the astrologers of Chaldea , or weave our garments on such looms as were used by the fair-haired matrons of Troy . Yet in no science has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce these indisputable principles . in no science have its intelligent professors , those skilled in all its branches , and imbued with all its learning , united themselves so strenuously to maintain its actual excellence ; to oppose its progressive improvement , with the improvement of all things around and to reconcile us to the strange and obsolete forms , which are equally at variance with the reason , the customs , and the humanity of a later age . The despotic vigor of Justinian was requisite to reduce and to pare away the absurdities of centuries in the Roman law ; Napoleon found it scarcely more difficult to unite into one , half the principalities of Europe , than to reconcile the conflicts of the parliaments of France ; and even in Britain , amid all her wonderful progress in science and in art , men , prominent , intelligent and enlightened men , are still found , who vehemently uphold , in her civil and criminal laws , things equally absurd and inhumane ; who seem delighted to find reason in the most ridiculous fictions ; and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sagacity and philanthropy of Brougham , just as their predecessors may have done in former days at the innovations of Mansfield or of Bacon . It could not have been without a full knowledge of all these difficulties , that Mr. Livingston undertook the task of framing a complete system of penal law for Louisiana , the State of his adoption . The opposition he had experienced to his efforts for introducing a simple and expeditious mode of civil practice , free alike from the prolixities of the Spanish and the // fictions of the English Jaw , though it was fortunately unsuccessful , rested in his remembrance , and probably deferred , though it never induced him to forego , this more important and laborious undertaking . During fifteen years of almost uninterrupted residence in Louisiana , he had been engaged as a lawyer of the highest rank ; he had become thoroughly conversant with every portion of the civil and criminal code ; he bad ascertained its intrinsic defects ; and he had resolved , that , in fulfilling his duty to his profession , he would present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their criminal law , as were dictated by the benevolence of an enlightened age , and ought to he expected from a people possessing the fullest power of self-government . In the early part of the year 1820 , being at that time a member of the House of Representatives , he introduced to the notice of the legislature the subject of a complete revision of the criminal law . He stated , as the principles by which the legislature ought in his opinion to be governed , that the objects of a code were solely the prevention of crime , and reformation of the criminal ; that all offences should be clearly defined , in language generally understood ; that punishments should be proportioned to the offence ; that the rules of evidence should be ascertained , as applicable to each ; that the mode of procedure should be simple , and the duty of executive and magisterial officers explicitly declared by law . In all these points , the existing laws of Louisiana were notoriously defective ; and the legislature readily yielded to such enlightened suggestions . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person learned in the law , whose duty it should be to prepare and present to the succeeding assembly , for its consideration , a code of criminal law both in the French and English languages , clearly defining all offences , laying down the rules of evidence and procedure , pointing out the duties of public officers , and designating the nature and manner of punishment . To perform this high trust , Mr. Livingston was himself elected , by a joint vote of the Senate and House of Representatives ; and , in accepting it , he at once resolved to encounter the necessary sacrifice of his private interest and professional engagements . It is scarcely possible to imagine a more chaotic mass , than the existing provisions in Louisiana with regard to criminal offences . They were a strange compound of customs , statutes , // and traditions ; they were framed , as occasion had required , for the various stages of society , from uncertain and almost defenceless settlements in a savage wilderness , to the actual state of an enlightened and numerous commercial community ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the successive sovereignties of the French , Spaniards , and Americans , in the same region . From the settlement of the country , at the close of the seventeenth century , until the year 1763 , the institutions were of course founded on the existing laws of France . On its cession to Spain , that power solemnly promulgated its own laws , though of course many of the municipal regulations , which had previously existed , continued in force . When France in 1803 received hack from Spain the possession of the province , by virtue of the treaty of St. Ildefonso , she retained it only provisionally , in order to deliver it to the United States , according to the treaty of Paris , and , during that short interval , made no material alteration in the existing laws . On the organization of the territoria* government , while Congress extended to it certain general laws , gave the right of trial by jury , and introduced the writ of habeas corpus , they yet expressly retained all not directly inconsistent with these , and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the subsequent fifteen or twenty years , many such alterations undoubtedly took place , yet they were partial or temporary ; the old institutions were for the most part of actual authority ; and , in the course of his investigation , Mr. Livingston discovered , that the citizens of Louisiana , in the nineteenth century , were amenable for the most strange and ludicrous offences , and subject to such punishments as were inflicted in Europe during the middle ages . The inevitable result was , that the definition and prosecution of many crimes were not only uncertain , but placed entirely beyond the reach of the people ; a long list of penalties , equally oppressive and absurd , was , strictly speaking , in force , and might , in bad times , be made an instrument of great injustice ; a discretion , always unsafe and often trenching on legislative power , was of necessity yielded to the judiciary ; and there was an entire want of that precision of language and simplicity of arrangement , without which a penal code becomes little better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy of an enlightened , and dangerotis to a free , people . The time had arrived , when it had // become impossible any longer to retain it , or to delay the remedy of evils becoming daily more apparent and more oppressive . Although the responsibility was great , Mr. Livingston at once perceived , that in executing the honorable duty he had undertaken , he could only satisfy those who had intrusted him with it , by boldly assuming a course entirely different from that of partial modification and temporary expediency . The nature and extent of the change were questions that demanded and received his deepest consideration . While he was determined , on the one hand , that no fear of innovation , or senseless clamor of prejudice , should induce him to throw away so rare an occasion for offering to his countrymen a system founded on the solid and permanent basis of public good , he had yet been too long and intimately engaged in the practice of the law , not to know the absolute necessity of attention to the most minute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , and of such of the later statutes as cast any uncertainty on the construction of those that were retained , would have given but partial relief . To provide , by new statutes , for other cases , would have been only to continue the patchwork system which had produced the existing evils , and to bring back , in a few years , the same incongruities that had afforded the whole ground for amendment . A system of laws , uniform and consistent , either framed into codes , or embraced in different statutes , was the only remedy that could satisfy the people of Louisiana . Though well aware of the objections that had often been started to a written code , the reflections and experience of Mr. Livingston both led him to prefer it to a system of different and independent laws . The State , after a practice of many years , had derived such indisputable benefit from a similar improvement in the civil branch of its jurisprudence , where the endless variety and ever-changing nature of contracts and other civil relations presented peculiar difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections raised to the easier task of making a written system of penal law . As to its superiority , if capable of practical and efficient operation , there could be no doubt . It is finely remarked by Blackstone , in speaking of criminal law , that " the knowledge of this branch of jurisprudence , which teaches the nature , extent , and degrees of every crime , and adjusts to it its // adequate and necessary penalty , is of the utmost importance to every individual in the state ; for no rank or elevation in life , no uprightness of heart , no prudence or circumspection of conduct , should tempt a man to conclude , that he may not , at some nine or other , be deeply interested in these researches . The infirmities of the best among us , " he continues , " the vices and ungovernable passions of others , the instability of all human affairs , and the numberless unforeseen events , which the compass of a day may bring forth , will teach us , upon a moment 's reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country have forbidden , and the deplorable consequences to which a wilful disobedience may expose us , is a matter of universal concern . " That this knowledge is to be more easily obtained by every citizen , and more generally and extensively diffused , by means of a simple arrangement of the penal law , under its different heads and in a single and complete system , seems scarcely to need assertion . The legislator then discovers , at a glance , what ought to be supplied , retracted , or corrected ; the magistrate and the judge see at once their duties , and the extent and limitation of their powers ; the citizen knows , without the necessity of extraordinary scrutiny , the rights of himself and others , by what acts those are to be maintained , and these will be violated . The labors of Mr. Livingston were , therefore , guided by two paramount considerations . He endeavoured to ascertain accurately and completely the offences which were to be guarded against and suppressed , for the welfare of the whole community , without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they affected that *velfare ; and he undertook to prepare , to the fullest extent of his abilities , a written system , expressing in plain language all the rules necessary for protecting the government of the country , and the persons , property , and reputations of the citizens , and for preventing and punishing wilful and careless breaches of these rules , when truly ascertained . At the session of the legislature , in the early part of the year 1822 , he presented the first result of his labors , in a preliminary report to the General Assembly , stating the progress he had made , explaining the plan on which he proposed to execute the work , giving some detached parts as specimens of the execution , and awaiting their direction , whether it should b* completed or not . The // General Assembly was so entirely satisfied with the correctness of the principles laid down by Mr. Livingston , and the able manner in which they were developed , that a joint resolution was passed by the Senate and House of Representatives , and afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire approbation of the plan proposed , and earnestly solicited him to prosecute his work in accordance with it . Thus cheered and encouraged , in the very outset , by the approval of those who had first selected him , he proceeded with alacrity in the execution of his task . The exercise of his best faculties , to use his own language , had been laboriously and faithfully employed , under the direction of a religious desire to perform the high duty intrusted to him , in a manner which might realize , in some degree , the great views at which he aimed . Not a provision was made without the deepest reflection upon its consequences . Not a line was written , that was not sent to every quarter of the Union in search of amendment . Every suggestion offered was adopted without pride of opinion , when it brought conviction to his mind . " Well aware , " he says , " of the difficulties of my task , but feeling convinced that they were not insurmountable , I undertook it with so much confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with that distrust of my own powers , which made me submit to the test of long reflection and severe scrutiny , every principle I laid down , and every provision intended to give it effect . I made these my leading rules ; to adopt no theory , by whatever specious argument supported , until I should be convinced of its practical utility ; diligently to seek for information , but to admit nothing upon the mere authority of high names ; to make no unnecessary innovation , but boldly to propose every change I should think l ) racticable and useful . " This process , of course , unavoidably consumed much time ; but , by assiduous labor , in little more than two years after his plan had received the sanction of the legislature , by the resolution referred to , he completed the entire work . It was at this period , that he was interrupted by one of those accidents , which sometimes occur to destroy the best monuments of human industry , and suddenly and unexpectedly mar the most useful and promising undertakings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal enabled him to prevent that probable result . In the autumn of 1824 , he had finished his manuscript , and prepared it completely for submission to the // legislature . Having received authority from them to print it for that purpose , he caused a fair copy of the whole to be written . So anxious was he to avoid error , that he passed a great part of the night previous to sending it to the press , in himself comparing this with the original draft . He went to bed at a late hour , leaving both the manuscripts together in his library , and consoling himself with the pleasing thought , that he had completed the laborious task which had engaged his time and constant reflections . Not long afterwards he was awakened by a cry of fire . This was found to be in the room where his papers had been left . They were all consumed . Not a note or memorandum was saved . Though stunned at first by the sudden misfortune , his equanimity and industry did not desert him . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced his task anew . On the meeting of the legislature , he communicated the incident to them , and another year was granted him to repair it . This was to be done entirely from recollection , as not a written vestige remained ; and the labor of recomposition , always irksome , was interrupted and rendered more difficult by the interference of engagements which he had made on the supposition that this was done . In two years more , the second edition of his work was finished , and , in 1826 , he presented his complete " System of Penal Law , " to the Legislature of Louisiana , in the shape , more perfect than it originally was , in which we now see it . Prefixed to the system itself , and forming , perhaps , to many persons , the most interesting portion of the work , is a series of introductory reports on each of its principal divisions . In these , Mr. Livingston has delineated , with a masterly hand , an outline of the whole science of penal jurisprudence . Pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of an intelligent legislator , the ends to be attained and the existing errors , he has discussed , with profound skill , the proper remedies to be applied . He clearly explains his own views ; enters most minutely and carefully into them all ; and submits , with the utmost candor , and , it must be admitted , always with much strength of argument and reflection , and generally with great correctness , his own original and peculiar suggestions . No one can fail to be impressed especially with the enlightened spirit of philanthropy , the single aim to benefit his fellow-creatures , which breathes throughout these discus // sions ; and to this it may be added , that there is always an unaffected beauty and simplicity in the language , frequently rising , when the topic demands it , to a fervent eloquence , which will command the attention and interest of those , who might be repelled by the gravity and want of imagination , with which such subjects are generally treated . Indeed , the plan of presenting these preliminary arguments is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated by considerations of a just and beneficent patriotism . They desired to obtain for their constituents the best mode of administering justice , which could be derived from the experience , sagacity , and benevolence of the age . Though selecting a single individual to present this , it was with no weak or inconsiderate reverence for his opinions ; but in a belief , that , from his studies and character , be could offer them a system which must possess more than usual excellence . Whether or not it did so , they were afterwards to judge . The wisdom of abolishing that which existed , the superiority of what might be substituted , the additions proposed to supply deficiencies , - all these were to be solemnly passed upon by them in completing the task , which they bad only commenced , in confiding to Mr. Livingston his honorable trust . It was in accordance with this spirit , that , when he submitted his system , be also submitted , with the utmost frankness and fulness , all his reasons in support of it . Addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer and more argumentative than would have been necessary , if still a member of your honorable body , I could meet objections as they were raised , and make the corrections which your superior wisdom would suggest . Having offered nothing without reflection , I have reasons for all I have proposed . Many of them , probably , will be found insufficient to support my conclusions ; but those conclusions are honestly if not wisely drawn , and the system which they support is submitted in the full confidence , that it will receive a fair , a full , and a deliberate consideration . Fair , without prejudice against the reporter for the opinions he may entertain on other subjects , or against his doctrines for their novelty ; full , after a consideration of the whole system and the bearing of its different parts on each other ; deliberate , without rejecting any one provision , until the reasons for proposing it have been maturely weighed , and its probable effects calculated . A decision thus made must be wise , and will doubtless prove satisfactory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourselves . " // The " System of Penal Law " opens with a Prelirninary Title , briefly stating the fundamental objects for the attainment of which it is established , and the plan and divisions in which it is framed . The original design of Mr. Livingston was , to comprise the whole system in a single code , giving a separate book to each of the principal divisions . A little experience , however , showed him , that , by such an arrangement , the subdivisions would not be sufficiently numerous to preserve order and distinctness in the distribution ; and that , by forming separate codes , these would be secured , and an easier mode of reference obtained . This plan and division , therefore , were finally adopted . The System comprises four distinct codes and a book of definitions . The first is called the Code of Crimes and Punishments . It is divided into two books . It contains general principles , and the description of all acts or omissions that are declared to be offences , with the punishment assigned to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is divided into three books . It contains the means provided for preventing offences that are apprehended , and repressing those that exist ; it directs the mode of bringing offenders to justice ; and it describes the forms to be used in judicial proceedings . The third is called the Code of Evidence . It is divided into two books . It contains the nature and whole law of evidence in penal as well as civil cases ; and it lays down the rules applicable to the several kinds of evidence . The fourth is called the Code of Reform and Prison Discipline . It is divided into three books . It contains a system of prison discipline , in all the stages in which imprisonment is used , either as the means of detention or punishment ; the places of confinement ; the treatment of prisoners therein ; and the proper provisions for the voluntary and compulsory labor of discharged convicts and irreclaimable vagrants . The concluding division of the System is a Book of Definitions , which defines the technical words and phrases used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of course the most interesting portion of the work . It is that in which Mr. // Livingston displays his adherence to , and interpretation of the principles of jurisprudence , previously laid down , as the basis of his system ; that , by which the soundness and practicableness of these is to he effectually tested . It is a different , perhaps an easier task , to reason on the general principles of science , to point out incontrovertibly what justice , philanthropy , and knowledge require , than to frame laws imbued with the spirit of these , which shall also meet the exigencies of human society , and prevent or repair the injuries arising from depravity or crime . To show what is right and fit , is the delightful aim of philosophy ; to reduce it and apply it to practice , is the studious labor of legislation . The first hook of this code contains general provisions , relative to the operations of the laws , to prosecutions and trials , and to the circumstances under which acts , that would otherwise be offences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in brief and simple language , what is necessary to protect the criminal from injustice , while they sustain the administration of the laws . In most instances they do not differ from those which belong to the enlightened jurisprudence of modern times ; but , in some , Mr. Livingston has made changes too important not to be noticed . Offences are explicitly confined to such acts or omissions as are made the direct subject of legislative decision ; and no pretence of their being within its meaning or spirit , no vague reference to the laws of nature , religion , or morality , is permitted to sanction the notice or punishment of them . The necessity of this provision has been proved by the frequent practice of American courts . Deriving their jurisprudence chiefly from the unwritten code of England , many instances are not wanting of the introduction of constructive crimes , which are utterly at variance with institutions , where interference in the different departments of government is forbidden . No injurious consequences , arising from an unpunished offence , accidentally unprovided for , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from judicial legislation . Another provision , novel in its character , which is introduced by Mr. Livingston , is that which simplifies the law , and ascertains the comparative degrees of guilt , where crimes are committed by several persons . To assimilate a person actually ignorant of a crime with the perpetrator , because accident // or the bonds of kindred may have made him acquainted with , and induced him to conceal it , seems to he equally harsh and unjust . To relieve a supplicant offender who relies on our generosity , is an act which humanity can scarcely condemn , even in a stranger . To make obedience to the law consist in sacrificing the ties of nature , in betraying those nearest and dearest to us by affection and by blood , can only he the rule of a barbarous arid distant age . " Almighty power , " Mr. Livingston eloquently remarks , " might counteract , for its own purposes , the feelings of humanity ; but a mortal legislator should not presume to do it . In modern times , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed but that they may never he enforced , they should he expunged from every code which they disgrace . " To put an end , therefore , to this conflict between natural sensibility and harsh legislation , Mr. Livingston provides that no relative of the principal offender , in the ascending or descending line , or in the collateral as far as the first degree , no person united to him by marriage , or owing obedience to him as a servant , shall be punished as an accessory . He thinks , however , that cases involving other ties of gratitude or friendship can not be so properly distinguished by law , and he leaves them for the consideration of the pardoning power . The second hook of this code is the most important in the whole System . It enumerates , classes , and defines all offences , as well as prescribes the nature and extent of punishments . The former naturally divide themselves , for the purpose of arrangement , into two great classes of public or private injuries , according to the character of the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the principle , that loss of personal liberty , of property , and of social and political privilege , are the best modes of suppression , prevention , and reform . Under the head of public offences , are ranked those which affect the sovereignty of the State , in its legislative , executive , or judiciary power ; the public tranquillity ; the revenue ; the right of suffrage ; the public records ; the current coin ; the internal and external commerce ; the freedom of the press the public health ; the public property and highways ; the morals of the people ; and the exercise of religion . Each of the offences falling under these heads is accurately defined , and provisions , intended to meet every case , have been introduced , // with an industry that has left little , if any thing , unnoticed . In regard to some of them , there is considerable novelty . In offences against the legislative power , all interference by violence , threats , or corruption is forbidden under appropriate penalties , instead of being left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempts . In those against the judiciary , while such as are of more usual occurrence are guarded against , those which may be committed by the functionaries themselves are specially considered . Combating , with firmness , but without disrespect , the strongly urged sentiments of those who think it degrading to suppose that men entrusted with this high office can he influenced by such inducements as would bias others , Mr. Livingston has applied , in this instance , the same strict principles of positive legislation , as in every other . " I acknowledge , " he remarks , " the force of the maxim , that confidence in generous minds begets a disposition to merit it but I deny the propriety of its general application . The penalties of law are founded on the supposition , that , without them , its precepts would not be fulfilled . Could we count on that generous disposition which the objection supposes , there would be no need of any sanction to our laws . The legislator need only point out his will and express his confidence in the integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of legislation would be done . But the argument is not pressed so far . It is acknowledged that penalties are necessary to insure obedience in ordinary cases ; but it is said , that judges form an honorable exception . Restrain all the rest of the world by the fear of punishment ; trust to the integrity of the judge for the performance of his duty . What , will you impose no restraint ? no impeachment for corruption ? no indictment for bribery ? Yes , these we will allow ; but he must not be restrained from accepting presents as the testimonials of friendship , which are no more than common courtesies of life . Now if you can think it necessary to guard against the gross corruption of direct bribery , why will you permit a practice which is the most common mode of effecting it ? Not to speak of their being made the vehicle for the more glaring crimes , their favorable effect on the mind of man is evident to any one who has the slightest knowledge of the world . Received as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no suspicion ; they are multiplied ; their value is ncreased , and the obligation goes on augmenting until it can only // be discharged by a favorable decree . But the practice might to be forbidden , if it should have no other effect than that of exciting suspicion . If the judge has been in the habit of receiving presents of game or liquors from a suitor who gains his cause , the loser will not fail to attribute it to the flavor of the venison or the exquisite taste of the wine . Nor is the inhibition either new , or considered as derogatory to officers of the highest trust . It is a constitutional provision , that no one , holding an office of trust or profit under the United States , shall accept any presents from a foreign power . If this does not degrade the ambassador , why should a siniilar one degrade the judge ? Besides , be consistent . You have two sets of judges . If those who determine the fact , when they are exhausted with hunger and fatigue , receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonor them by setting aside their verdict , as being corruptly procured , and often punish them for misconduct ; and yet you think it degrading to the other class of judges , to prevent them receiving gifts of much greater value . " So in regard to the punishment for contempts ; a power subject to be exercised by courts , in a manner and to an extent , utterly at variance with the principles , conceded in every other instance to be just . This indefinite offence , and this dangerous power , are reduced to that certainty and limit which are prescribed in respect to other crimes . Ample means of repression are vested in the court ; they may remove every actual interruption of their proceedings ; they may enforce prompt obedience to their orders ; they may , if simple removal is not sufficient , restrain by imprisonment . But here , their extraordinary interference stops ; the interruption being at an end , the trial and punishment must follow in the regular mode . The judge is not made an accuser , nor the accuser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessened by angry altercation ; above all , the chosen ministers of the law are not specially allowed to violate its most sacred forms . Among offences against morals , Mr. Livingston has embraced and punished insulting and indecent language to women , deliberate seduction , and the infamous agency of ministering to the vices of others ; all of them basely profligate , though our codes , following in the track of the English law , have omitted or inadequately guarded against them . In the same spirit , he has denounced a proper penalty against violating the sanctuary of the tomb ; a provision in accordance with the natural sentiments of men in every country and age . // " The catacomb , the grave , and the urn , " he truly and eloquently says , " have been held equally sacred ; and any intrusion upon them has always not only been considered as immoral , but punished as a crime . It is in vain that pretended philosophy affects to consider it a prejudice . The feelings of the philosopher belie the language of his wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own remains , he would not see , without affliction , the body of a friend or relation torn from the grave , even to promote the progress of science . It is in vain that we are told , and are truly told , that the health and life of the living ought not to be sacrificed to a vain respect for the body of the dead , incapable of suffering here , or feeling the ignominy of exposure ; the reason may be convinced , but the feeling remains . Science must be content with subjects , whose dissection will interest the feelings of none who are alive . The bodies of those few who , themselves above this prejudice , devote their remains to the cause of science ; those of malefactors who die in the imprisonment inflicted by the law , must suffice for the improvement of surgical knowledge . But the laws must protect , in the place of their lasting rest , the remains that are sacred to the memory of surviving relations or friends . This natural feeling has not been neglected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is denounced against every violation of the sanctuary of the tomb . " Under the head of private offences , are ranked those which affect individuals , and injure them in their reputation , their persons , their political privileges , their civil rights , their professions , and their property . From among them is wisely and humanely excluded , suicide ; the sad act of misfortune or despair , which most criminal codes have chosen to treat as a crime of the deepest dye . It seems , indeed , a peculiarly strange dictate of law , to pursue with penal sanctions the inanimate body , which has ceased to feel either ignominy or pain . But it becomes still more so , when , by so doing , we inflict exclusively upon the innocent all the consequences . To prevent or to remedy , even to punish it , is beyond our power ; we can only harrow the feelings , and seize on the fortunes , of those who have been made already to suffer from the sensibilities of human nature , and , with impotent revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond our reach . The justice , therefore , as well as the propriety of omitting this , in the enumeration of crimes , seems indisputable . // In treating of offences , which affect individual reputation , Mr. Livingston has examined , with extreme care , the whole subject of libel and slander . This has always proved peculiarly difficult , where free institutions exist , since the instru* ment usually employed in the work of detraction , is also one necessary to spread information , promote science , support political and civil liberty , and disseminate the truths of reli religion . To permit its unrestrained employment for these noble ends , and yet to prevent its use for the destruction of individual reputation and happiness , is a task worthy , from its importance , of the most zealous studies of a beneficent and patriotic legislator . In the code of Louisiana , the indefinite and absurd offence of libelling incorporeal beings ( if we may use the phrase ) is totally abolished ; men are to be protected , not governments , courts , or corporations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These , which are for the benefit of all , must be guarded by the approving support of all ; they must be strong enough , in the language of Cromwell , " to stand against paper-shot , " or they are not worth guarding ; and while to discuss them in the widest possible range must be a trifling evil , to impose the least restraint on their examination would be one of incalculable amount . In regard to individual character , however , every man is equally protected from defaniation , every man has a right to appeal to the laws ; and upon the same principle , whether he is thus injured while executing a public trust , or pursuing his private business . That principle , as admirably laid down by Mr. Livingston , is , to punish an act wilfully done , which injures the character of a fellow-citizen , without any motive of private good or public duty . This reaches the great object in the law of libel , without violating any rule of justice or general utility ; it meets the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be a justification ; it permits the exposure of that which is proper to be made known , but not of what , without any corresponding benefit , would tend only to produce injury , ridicule , or misery . In the important title of offences against the person ( a class of crimes which it is , perhaps , the first object of civilized society to prevent ) , each of the various kinds of injury , from a simple assault to homicide attended with every circumstance of aggravation , is defined with extreme care , and with an anxious desire properly to measure the degrees of guilt* // In the sections relating to justifiable homicide , the rules are clearly laid down , that authorize the execution of the orders of magistrates or courts , and the defence of person and property to the last extremity . In no branch of criminal law are such rules more needed for the information and protection of a citizen . His first duties to his country and to himself are those of aid to the public officer and resistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only legal , but praiseworthy ; to do so improperly , constitutes an offence , which brings down the severest penalty of the law . The same act in one way is a duty , in another a crime . It is , therefore , a cruel defect in legislation , to leave in the slightest degree obscure , as has been too generally the case , the rules that justify homicide , either in the execution of a public law , or the defence of a private right . Excusable homicide is made to differ from this , in being involuntary , and unavoidable by common prudence or care Culpable homicide embraces those acts which can neither be justified nor excused , and which , beginning at the lowest degree where negligence alone , without any criminal intention , is to be attributed to the perpetrator , rises to murder in its appalling forms of assassination and parricide . Those who are satisfied with the provisions derived from the common law of England , which knows only the two classes of manslaughter and murder , will , perhaps , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intention and manner of the crime . Yet , certainly , to confound together a sacrifice of life caused by negligence and by design ; by extreme provocation and with the want of any ; by open attack , and by secret assassination , poison , or lying in wait ; by avowed hostility arid by a breach of those holy relations which imply confidence , fidelity , or protection ; is a defect of jurisprudence in respect as well to the designation of crimes , as to the just assignment of punishment . The class of offences , which forms the concluding chapter of this code , embraces the numerous catalogue of those affecting property . They are arranged arid defined with much care , whether arising from a malicious intention to destroy , or a fraudulent design to appropriate property that does not belong to the offender . The means by which Mr. Livingston proposes to secure obedience to the provisions he has thus made ; to prevent or to punish the offences he has thus elaborately arranged and // defined ; are limited , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , and social and political privileges . He discards the disgusting , cruel , and inefficient modes of punishment , which , under greater or less modifications , have continued , until a very recent period , to disgrace the jurisprudence of countries pretending to the greatest refinement , and continue at present to be approved , and even applauded , in that of the largest number of the nations of the world . He proposes to abolish at once , and in every instance , all punishments that spring from a desire to gratify revenge , or to inflict on the offenders inhuman suffering . He stops not with the prohibition of the faggot or the rack , because these are universally denounced by modern justice or humanity ; but he equally prohibits punishments of the same character , that are yet retained , and which a similar spirit of justice and humanity ought equally to condemn . Banishment , imprisonment in chains , exposure to public derision , mutilation , and stripes , are all still inflicted by the codes of enlightened nations , but are all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penal sanctions , injustice , cruelty , and revenge . Banishment forces upon another country him who has violated the laws of his own , in defiance of the common rights of nations ; it leaves the criminal at liberty to repeat his crime , where his character and habits are unknown ; it holds out no means of reformation ; and it offers no salutary example to deter others from the commission of a similar offence . Imprisonment in chains is at once cruel and unequal ; it is always a torture to the weak , and may be so to the strong , according to the discretion and petty despotism of his jailer ; it preys upon the spirit by the infliction of bodily pain ; it obliges to constant and debasing indolence . Exposure to public derision is a mode of punishment , whose absolute inefficacy has been established by its increased disuse ; it can produce no reform in the offender ; it serves , on the contrary , to harden him in crimes it offers no useful example to those who behold it , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates any other sensation , it is that of sympathy . *Jutilation is almost repudiated from the code of modern nations ; it inflicts indelible marks of disgrace , which drive the wretched victim into the constant repetition of his crimes ; it has no real motive but revenge , for its sole consequence is bodily suffering ; it destroys the hope of reformation , and exhibits to society // a picture that excites either its sympathy or disgust . Stripes are liable to almost every objection , that can be made to public exposure and mutilation ; they are founded on the propriety of inflicting pain ; they are cruel and revengeful punishments ; they produce public and lasting shame ; they bring no repentance ; convince the criminal of no error ; but restore him to his associates at once exasperated and disgraced . Mr. Livingston regards capital punishment as liable to some of the same objections with the rest which he has discarded , as well as to others peculiar to itself . While xve can not profess to be converts to his system on this very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and force of thought and language , as well as the philanthropic spirit , with which it is maintained . At the same time , whatever of substantial novelty there is in Mr. Livingston 's statement of the argument , will be found , we think , to consist rather in the omission of topics , to which a prominence h*is been given by others , than in the contribution of any new ground of reason* ing ; so that we may be the more readily excused for not following his discussion at any length . lie does not urge , as has commonly been done , the absolute sacredness of human life . He admits , that , while individuals and society have the right to preserve their existence , and are under an obligation to defend it , when attacked , the life of an assailant may he taken , if one or the other is threatened with destruction , and no alternative remains to prevent it . This right of selfdefence , however , allowed to exist between nations during war , and between a nation and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he denies to be justly claimed on the part of a community against its individual members , before the crisis requiring self-defence has arrived , or after it has passed . He insists , that capital execution accomplishes neither of the legitimate ends of punishment ; neither the reformation of the criminal , nor the prevention of crime ; and he refers to the experience of English criminal jurisprudence to show the insensibility of convicts under sentence of death . He denounces the practice , on the ground of alleged ill effects on the moral character and sensibilities of those by whom it is witnessed ; and he urges , with most impressive force , the irrevocable nature of such a doom , making it impossible , by any subsequent act , to repair the wrong which may have been sustained from the perfidy of accusers , the adverse bearing of // unfortunately concurring circumstances , or the infirmity of judges . Part of this argument presents issues of fact , capable , of course , of being settled on sufficient evidence ; and when it shall be manifest , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of mind of convicts under capital sentence , of prisoners liable to it , of the crowds which witness it , and of the communities whose attention is drawn to it , the question will be materially disembarrassed . In the mean time , we can not consent to take instances of apparent insensibility on the part of convicts , as clearly indicating the absence of severe internal struggles ; nor could we receive a few perfectly well authenticated instances of this sort , as proofs of a prevailing state of mind ; nor should we consider examples of an utter recklessness , after sentence was passed , as showing ( what alone is of much consequence ) , that while it was in prospect , and the act that was to incur it was under contemplation , it had not been apprehended with extreme alarm ; nor do we find reason to regard the assembling of crowds at an execution , as evincing any thing so much as the singularly exciting horror of the scene ; nor can we confidently take the effect , good or bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger part of a population , which does not mingle in them ; nor can we , in any way , escape from the idea , that the dread of a dishonorable death is , after all , the sanction of the most universal and absolute efficacy , of all within human appointment . We are not convinced by the view which limits the community 's rights of self-defence to the moment of aggression ; which only allows it to guard , by extreme methods , against violence , *flagrante delicto . The community wants not so much protection against the individual criminal , as against crime . This is the foundation of exemplary punishment ; and this most essential claim of self-defence remails untouched by the argument , even when it should be allowed , that capital punishment , a community s most perfect security against a citizen whose past misconduct shows that it is in extreme danger from him , is a security which it can afford to dispense with , in favor of some other less severe . We are much more moved , - we never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the irrevocable character of a visitation , which , through human frailty , may be made , has been made , to fall upon the innocent . We never look at it without being // prompted anew to an anxious inquiry , whether the security of men in social life is not capable of being adequately provided for , without the administration of an irremissible penalty , subject , by possibility , to such abuse ; and , when we find ourselves driven from this ground , we are still pursued by the problem , whether it would not be better for innocent men to relinquish some , or even much , of their security , than that such a horror should , in any instance , be permitted to befall . Mr. Livingston has argued this part of the question with a pathetic eloquence , which there is no resisting while one reads ; and he refers to one instance of enormous wrong , as occurring within his own practice , which no one can wonder should have materially influenced his feelings on the subject . His views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous earnestness with which they are enforced , are entitled to the most attentive consideration . Much as we fear , that ( at least till popular education has far more fully done its work ) capital punishment will remain an awful necessity of social existence , we feel indebted to whoever helps to secure to the question a calm and thorough scrutiny ; and most earnestly do we desire , that neither haste nor bigotry on the one hand , nor a weak and timid sensibility on the other , but a calm and comprehensive wisdom , and the most compassionate and delicate sense of human infirmities and human rights , may dictate the decision . Mr. Livingston thus confines the punishments , prescribed in his system , to the deprivation of personal liberty , property , and social and political privileges . Fines , disfranchisement , and imprisonment , are those only that he proposes to inflict but these he varies and graduates according to the nature of the crime , and the circumstances that extenuate or aggravate it . Pecuniary fines ; degradation from office ; temporary suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple imprisonment ; imprisonment at hard labor ; and solitary confinement during certain intervals of the time of imprisonment , to be determined in the sentence , - such is the scale adopted in this code . He contends that this is sufficient to produce the just ends of l ) unis1*ment , and has , in itself , peculiar and indisputable advantages ; that it affords a prospect of reformation in the criminal , highly probable ; that it restrains him effectually from the repetition of his crime ; that it offers a l ) ermaneL*t and striking example to deter others ; and that it is so mild , that it can // enlist no prejudice against its execution and in favor of the sufferer , either among those called upon to try and condemn him , or those whose duty it may he to carry the sentence into effect . He submits , that its sufficiency is secured by the advanta6e it has of being divisible almost to infinity ; that there is no offence , however slight , to meet which it may not he moderated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its various degrees , an adequate punishment may not be found ; that it may be made , also , to suit the differences of sex , age , habits , and constitution , which in themselves cause and constitute so different an amount of actual suffering to the criminal , where the nominal penalty is the same . So far as regards imprisonment , either in its simple or more severe character , this scale of punishment looks to the penitentiary system for its complete developement and perfect execution ; it therefore improves in efficiency as well as humanity , with all the improvements of that admirable mode of punishment . II . The Code of CrimiHal Procedure naturally succeeds that designating the acts that are a violation of the law ; for it points out the mode , in which they are to he prevented or repressed , and in which they are to be ascertained , with the precision justice requires . if they have been actually committed . It is not enough , that every citizen should know what actions he ought to avoid as crimes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or punishing such as injure him , and also of defending himself , when unjustly charged with the commission of such as injure others . This code is divided into three hooks . The first contains the means of preventing offences , and of put.ting an end to such as continue ; designating particularly the cases where military force may he employed in aid of the civil power , and prescrihing the rules by which it is to be governed in that service . The second directs the mode of bringing an offender to punishment ; and the last gives the forms that are to be used , in all judicial proceedings , to attain these ends . An introductory title states conspicuously and explicitly the objects of the code ; security to the innocent , not only from the danger of an unjust conviction , but the apprehension of it ; the prevention of intended offences , by pointing out when and how an individual may require the aid of a magistrate and his fellow-citizens , or use bis own physical powers , to resist // aggression ; the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to technical and formal objections , - a species of false clemency , which can arise only from the impropriety or severity of the law in its spirit and provisions , and which violates every principle , as it destroys every benefit , it was meant to secure ; economy and despatch , objects equally desirable for the prosecution of justice on one hand , and the defence of private rights on the other , since the want of them at once increases the difficulty of conviction , and lessens the force of beneficial example where there is guilt , while it inflicts unmerited punishment on the innocent ; the abolition of all vexatious proceedings ; and the establishment of simplicity in forms , an end society has a right to demand , since the obligations and restraints imposed by the most perfect laws are necessarily attended with an inconvenience , that ought to be reduced to the lowest degree consistent with public safety . In pointing out these distinctly , as the objects of a code of procedure , Mr. Livingston remarks , that it is done , that future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall prove the different provisions to be in conformity with them , observe in what points deviations come to be made , and introduce , if requisite , such amendments as will retain them in full effect . The first book contains the provisions of the code for preventing offences . Among them is one , for the most part , if not altogether , novel ; bestowing honorary and pecuniary rewards on him who brings an offender to justice . " If any one shall voluntarily incur any great danger , or use extraordinary diligence , or show unusual skill in preventing or suppressing an offence , or in arresting an offender , he shall be entitled to an honorary certificate made by the court , having the highest penal jurisdiction in the district of his residence , which certificate shall be entered on the minutes of the court , and published three times in three successive years , and authenticated copies shall be sent to the governor of the State , and to the president of the senate , to serve as recommendations for an appointment to any office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In cases of extraordinary exertion , coming within the intent of the last preceding article , which , in the opinion of the judge , and of the governor of the State , shall merit such distinction , a piece of plate of the value of one hundred dollars , with a suita // ble inscription , to be executed under the direction of the governor , shall be added to the honorary certificate . " Whoever shall give such information to a magistrate , as shall lead to the conviction of any one guilty of fighting a duel , or giving or accepting a challenge , or forgery , or any crime punishable by imprisonment for life , shall be entitled to receive , on the certificate of the judge and public prosecutor in the court where the conviction was had , the sum of fifty dollars , from the treasurer of the State , out of the moneys received for fines . " This provision , which may at first strike us as fanciful , if not calculated to encourage delation , is vindicated by Mr. Livingston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great eloquence and much force of argument . He thinks that good policy as well as justice requires , that some external mark should be given of that esteem , which all feel for a citizen who has performed a meritorious action for the general good . That additional rewards will strengthen the motive to action , there can be no doubt ; and , if they do not counteract the more refined and disinterested impulses which have the same tendency , they may be safely employed . The rewards held out for diligence , bravery , and skill , in preventing an offence or punishing an offender , are addressed solely to the love of that distinction which is founded on public gratitude ; such rewards may be expected to raise the citizen in his own esteem , and give him at least a limited celebrity , which not only augments his own happiness , but , within a certain sphere , operates as an incentive to promote that of the public . " Honors , " Mr. Livingston observes , " conferred for brilliant achievements in war , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , perhaps with some propriety , to be liable to objection ; not because they are wrong in themselves , but because , by exciting the admiration of the people to a high degree , and attaching it to one man , they give him an undue influence that may be sometimes used to the destruction of liberty . But no such consequence can be apprehended from the unpretending limited popularity and distinction given by the means pointed out by the code . 0ri the contrary , beneficial political effects may be expected , by bringing within the reach of those in the humblest station , those testimonials of eminent merit , and by associating public favor in their minds with the execution of the laws . Vie who has risked his life in an unequal encounter with ruflians , either to protect another from their violence , or to secure them for the purpose of punishment , every // one will allow , deserves public esteem ; but it can neither be permanent nor extensive , and , of course , will lose much of its value , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to have witnessed , or to have been benefited by its exertion . It is soon forgotten , it loses most of its effect as an example , and it is buried in the same oblivion with the every-day transactions which have nothing to impress them on the memory . " Let the little hero of the hamlet have his celebrity for supporting the laws , and you will have fewer great heroes who seek it by breaking them ; and let it be remembered , that the recorded certificate and the engraved goblet are not given to reward the act , but to keep it in memory . The only reward is the public consideration , which will not be measured by the worth of these testimonials , but by the merit and utility of the service rendered . " Stronger objections may be made to pecuniary rewards for denouncing the commission of certain crimes . Strong antipathies are universally attached to the name and office of an informer , even when the Jaws are neither oppressive nor unjust . If these antipathies originated in times and nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the people the conviction that their execution was adverse to their happiness and interest , and those who exerted themselves in promoting it were the enemies , not the friends , of society ; then it may follow , that the ministers employed in upholding the execution of just and mild laws , well understood by an intelligent community , will cease to be considered as engaged in a dishonorable duty ; and the acceptance of a reward , sufficient merely to indemnify for loss of time , but not so great as to offer temptations for false accusation , will cease to attach any odium to its performance . If an officer , Mr. Livingston contends , receives a salary for the performance of his permanent functions , an individual ought , with equal propriety , to receive a compensation for his occasional service . In both cases there is a sacrifice of private convenience to produce a public good ; in both cases it ought to be compensated . If public prejudice is against it , it may be replied , that the same prejudice formerly existed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gradually given way to the force of truth , and the progress of knowledge . In framing the provisions , which authorize the interference of magistrates to prevent offences and to search for property illegally taken , the cases of interposition and the evidence necessary are pointed out with great precision ; a circum // stance peculiarly required , where something must be left to the discretion of the officer , and where opportunities may exist for much oppression , extortion , and fraud . Under the title of suppressing offences against personal liberty , are contained regulations for granting and enforcing the writ of habeas corpus , so complete as to give the fullest effect to that most simple and admirable of all contrivances for securing personal liberty . Strongly impressed with the utility of this great writ , Mr. Livingston seems desirous to increase every facility for procuring it , to enlarge the sphere of its relief , to give an adequate sanction to every provision respecting it , to impress upon the people the utility of preserving , and the danger of violating it , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bequeathed to us by the wisdom and patriotism of our fathers . In prescribing the highly interesting rules for military aid to the civil authority , such are adopted as may attain the end with the least violence . The militia are to be used , a force differing in nothing from that which is daily at the call of the civil officer , except in being organized and armed . It is of course only to be employed when the ordinary power has completely failed . Before it is brought up , a magistrate must display a white flag , and order the rioters to disperse . Unless to repel an attack endangering life , the order to disperse must be disobeyed for half an hour , before offensive arms are resorted to . When these become necessary , those only ( such as the sword and bayonet ) , which may be directed solely against the assailants , are to he adopted ; and the dangerous effect of fire-arms , which may injure the innocent as well as the guilty , is left to the last extremity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arresting the course of such as are in operation , the second book of this code contains the mode of conducting prosecutions for those already consummated . Minute and careful regulations are laid down respecting arrest , detention , and bail , so as to make them clear to the most common understanding . In the whole course of procedure , there is no circumstance productive of so many vexatious , and even fatal effects , as that of arrests . Officers of justice , often extortionate and overbearing , pass the limits of just authority ; accused men sometimes submit to this injustice , at others they resist where they should yield ; and no inconsiderable proportion of violent infractions of the law constantly arises from an // ignorance of rights and duties in this respect , an ignorance inevitable where there is any obscurity or want of fulness and precision in regulating so important a branch of the conduct of every citizen . The manner and effect of an examination of the accused by a magistrate , immediately after his arrest , have always been subjects of doubt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the innocent the best opportunity of prompt explanation and self-defence ; it obliges the guilty to give that account of society a b his conduct which has riott to demand from every one apparently infringing the laws . On the other , this explanation is not made before those who try the accused , and , of course , gives him little of its benefit ; it may be attended with captious and insidious questions , which disguise , rather than elucidate the truth ; and it may unjustly increase suspicion against the thoughtless or the timid . To secure these advantages , and to obviate these dangers , several provisions are introduced into the code . The prisoner , as soon as arrested , is to have counsel . Before his own examination , he is allowed to hear and read the evidence and depositions of the witnesses against him . The interrogatories which he is then required to answer , are prescribed by law , and point only to such simple circumstances as can be detailed with great simplicity of language . rrhe answers are voluntary , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they ought , unfavorably to the belief of his innocence , when he comes to be tried ; and lie is to be permitted to correct and alter , before he signs them , the answers which the magistrate takes from his lips . Among the provisions that direct the mode of proceeding on the trial , is one giving the closing argument to the defendant . This was thought proper and just , because it is an advantage , which , from necessity , one party may and the other can not enjoy . There are disadvantages inseparahle from the position of the accused , and to deprive him of what may , in some degree , counterbalance them , is thought by Mr. Livingston to be contrary to justice and humanity . The same may be said of a similar change which forbids a judge in his charge to recapitulate the testimony , unless expressly requested to do so by the jury , and obliges him to confine his statements exclusively to such matters of law , as he shall think necessary for their information in giving their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , containing forms for all the proceedings directed or authorized by its preceding parts . In framing them , which has been evidently done with much care , Mr. Livingston 's object appears to have been to unite brevity with so much certainty and precision , as will secure the party from any possibility of mistaking the precise fact of which he is accused . To attain this end is certainly to close the door against one of the greatest evils of criminal jurisprudence . III . The Code of Evidence begins , as do those that precede it , by an introductory title , laying down rules and making explanations , to avoid circumlocution , and to give the perspicuity necessary to a full understanding of the subsequent provisions . Among these are two articles , intended to secure the advantages to be derived from the wisdom of the judges in the suggestion of defects proved by experience , without incurring the fault , into which the same intention has repeatedly led , of transferring to the judiciary , powers exclusively legislative . The first of these articles directs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any provision of the code , for the admission or exclusion of evidence , is found to operate improperly , either to the prejudice of the accused or to the ends of public justice . By these means , instead of judicial decisions , of doubtful authority , interspersed through voluminous reports , a positive law , briefly expressed , may he introduced regularly into the code by the legislative power . The other article provides a similar remedy for omissions , instead of leaving them to be supplied by the discretion of the courts . These provisions , novel in themselves , establish principles highly important to be introduced into every written code ; they counteract the most forcible objection that can be made to the system , without calling in the inappropriate exercise of legislative discretion by the judiciary ; they offer the greatest facility for discovering imperfections , and bringing them to the notice of the legislature ; and they check at once the injurious operation of any rule discovered by experience to be bad . The two books into which this code is divided embrace , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules to be applied , when the different kinds are offered in proof . In the first book , evidence is defined to be that which brings , or contributes to bring , the mind to a just conviction // of the truth or falsehood of the fact asserted or denied . When applied to the determination of litigated rights , it is necessarily restricted to what is declared by the written law sufficient to produce that just conviction , in a greater or less degree . This necessarily divides evidence into two great classes ; that which the power called on to judge has from its own knowledge , and that which it derives from extrinsic sources . The first class has no subdivision . The second is of course of various degrees , whether considered in regard to its source or its weight . Its source may be personal communication , written instruments , or natural objects , making it testimonial , scriptory , or substantive . Its weight asc ends from mere induction to complete proof , and is presumptive , direct , or conclusive . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the object of the second book of the code , that embraced in the first subdivision , as derived from the knowledge of the judge himself , is properly confined within very narrow limits . He can never act merely on his own knowledge of a fact , except where expressly authorized to do so . Instances of this authority are found in his power to pronounce on the authenticity of a record , to commit for an offence in his presence , to remove for a disturbance in court , and to employ the military in aid of the civil power . But where he knows a material fact not thus designated , he must be examined as any other witness ; and , if a juror is similarly situated , his testimony must be given to his fellows in the same judicial manner . In establishing the rules of extraneous evidence , Mr. Livingston has introduced some new principles in regard to such as is testimonial , or derived from personal communication . " The whole machinery of jurisprudence , " he remarks , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling the judging power to determine on the truth or falsehood of every litigated proposition . This is to be done by hearing and examining evidence ; that is to say , hearing and examining every thing that will contribute to bring the mind to the determination required . If we refuse to hear what will , in any degree , produce this effect , we must determine on imperfect evidence ; and in proportion to the importance of the matter thus refused to be heard , must evidently be the chance of making an incorrect rather than a just determination . But , as in morals we are forbidden // to do evil that good may come of it , so in legislation , we should refrain from doing that kind of good which may produce more than its equivalent in evil . The desirable end to be attained by the admission of every species of evidence , may be more than counterbalanced , in some instances , by the evil attending it ; sometimes , in the shape of inconvenience and expense inseparable from its procurement ; sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evidence itself . The great art is to weigh these difficulties , and in those cases where they are most likely to preponderate , but in no others , to exclude the evidence . " The circumstances which are generally understood to cause exclusion , are interest , connexion in marriage , infamy , the relation of an attorney to his client , that of a Catholic to his confessor , and disbelief in a future state of rewards and punishments . In the remarks on the code of procedure , the extent to which a criminal may be allowed to testify in his own case , has been noticed ; the basis of his admission and exclusion being simply the consideration of what is most likely to be effective in establishing his innocence or guilt . This consideration is applied in this code to the evidence of one , who , although not a party , may have an interest in the result of the judicial proceeding , - an eventual gain or loss that may be estimated by money ; and it has led to the abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness is to be filly made known , that it may lessen according to its degree the credit to be given him . To exclude entirely an interested witness involves the double assumption , that his interest will outweigh his conscience and fears of detection and punishment , and that the judge or jury will believe the falsehood he asserts , although his interest is known . These assumptions are founded neither in probability nor reason , and , on that account alone , would authorize the rejection of the antiquated rule . But , even if they were well founded , it xvould be certainly unwise , merely on account of them , to exclude the testimony of interested witnesses from whom the truth may fairly be expected . The only sound rule is the obvious one . The judges of the facts are the true judges of the credit of the witness ; they know his interest and his bias let them hear him ; let them say whether his interest is such as to destroy his credit ; let them form , with full knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // exclusion obliges legislators to form in advance , and entirely without such knowledge . If the search for truth does not require that an interested person , nor even a party himself , should he excluded from giving testimony , neither does it make connexion in marriage a cause for rejecting a witness . If it be admitted , as it will be that every one has a right to all the information necessary to the discovery of truth , unless deprived of it for reasons of great public or private convenience , then it must be proved that such inconvenience arises from a husband or wife being examined in regard to each other . To establish this is manifestly impossible . To say that there is danger of domestic dissension or of perjury is to give a reason not more strong , than might be offered for the exclusion of vast numbers of witnesses ; while , on the other hand , such testimony often is undoubtedly the best which an accused person can offer in his own behalf . The feelings produced by such a tie are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be weighed in the credit which it receives ; to say they are sufficient to close peremptorily such an avenue for truth , is indeed strangely to distrust the intelligence and honesty of the judge . Mr. Livingston considers that in the relations of attorney and client , and Catholic and confessor , there are reasons sufficient to justify the exclusion of their testimony in regard to facts communicated or discovered by means of those relations . The circumstances , under which the knowledge is obtained , would make the disclosure an invasion of the rights of personal liberty and conscience . The law besides would be useless , if it could be executed ; hecause , in that case , as it would destroy both confidence and confession , nothing would be disclosed . Exclusion on the ground of infamy is not admitted in the code . Such a disqualification is less reasonahle than that of interest . There , a motive may exist for stating a falsehood in preference to a truth . Here , there is no such motive . The only reason is the depravity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deprive a person accused of the entire benefit of his testimony , when sufficient or necessary for an acquittal ; to permit a heinous offence to pass unpunished , when the facts are known only to him ; are perversions of // every principle that ought to regulate the admission of evidence . The doctrine which makes a witness 's belief in a future state of rewards and punishments a condition of his cornpetency , Mr. Livingston considers as improperly making the fidelity of statement to depend solely on religious belief . While he owns that such a belief is an additional motive and guaranty for the truth of a witness , he maintains that there are reproaches of conscience in this life ; a moral sense , disclosin* the utility and beauty of truth ; sentiments of manly honor a disdain of falsehood ; a dread of society ; a fear of punishment , which are also motives and strong motives ; and that , although they might and undoubtedly would be strengthened by the impressions of religion , they are yet in themselves sufficient to justify us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer truth to falsehood . The want of that additional inducement might lessen the credit of a witness , among the pious and the good , but he conceives that it would not of itself , among the thinking or the charitable , produce a total disbelief of all he might declare . Allowing , therefore , no exceptions to the admission of testimonial evidence , except the two we have mentioned , together with insanity and immature infancy , the code proceeds to regulate the manner in which it is to be received . Here a boundless field of debatable ground is presented by a provision , that , with the exception of such as suggest facts to the witness , all interrogatories pertinent to the case , may be put and must be answered ; and a short section declares , that in written examinations the rules for receiving oral declarations shall be followed . Scriptory evidence , which includes all kinds of written proof , except the examination of witnesses reduced to writing , is of two kinds ; authenticated and unauthenticated . The former consists of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative acts , those of public officers in executing their official duties , and records of courts or of government . The latter consists of private instruments , either attested by the signature of the party whose act it purports to be , or not attested , from accident or from its natural character . Substantive evidence is so simple and limited in its nature , that it is only necessary to prescribe such rules as require // additional proof to show its application to the principal case . Thus a bloody dagger is substantive and striking evidence ; but it fails of its weight , unless it he proved that it was in the hand of the accused , before or after the time a homicide was perpetrated . From considering evidence in relation to its source , the code proceeds to ascertain the degree of weight it is entitled to , when presumptive , direct , or conclusive . It may he objected , that , the conviction of truth being an intellectual operation , the degree to which evidence is to operate can not he prescribed ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theory of evidence , is not necessary in fixing rules for its admission . It must be alloxved , however , that uniformity in judicial decisions is a highly desirable object , and that , in similar circumstances , the same deductions ought to be made from the same facts . This can only be ( lone by requiring the judicial decree to be rendered in conformity with the established rule , whenever the evidence considered by it to be sufficient is produced . To establish that rule by positive legal provisions is , therefore , infinitely better , than leaving it to usage or precedent . Presumptive evidence may result from circumstances proved , by the mere operation of the mind , or be drawn from them by express direction of law . Its effect , whether simple or legal , is to establish a proposition , until the contrary is directly shown , or it is rendered doubtful by other presumptions . The circumstances from which it arises must he proved by legal testimony , and the deductions must be such as are warranted by the usual propensities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the ordinary course of business and human events . Direct evidence , if true , indisputably establishes a proposition . The declaration of a witness that he saw the act in controversy done , is direct evidence ; for , if the declaration be true , nothing more is necessary to establish the commission of the criminal act ; no deduction need be made from the fact that is proved , as in the case of presumptive evidence . Conclusive evidence proceeds a step farther . It is that which the law declares to be absolutely sufficient , without requiring the judge to draw any inference from the fact , and the reality of the fact alleged is undoubted . The confession of the accused is not admitted to be conclusive , because its // truth is not of necessity undoubted ; insanity , promises , fear , hope of liberty or pardon , may produce a confession contrary to fact ; and , therefore , although it is direct evidence , it becomes not conclusive till its truth is absolutely established . Proof that an absentee was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death , because , though it be the general course of nature for men to die before that age , yet it is not invariable ; hut proof that he was born two hundred years ago is conclusive evidence , because no instance has been known of human life extended beyond that period . IV . The Code of Reform and Prison Discipline contains those provisions without which the peculiar benefits anticipated from the whole system must be lost . Superseding , as we have seen it does , the use of penalties on which reliance has heretofore been placed , its whole efficacy must depend on the manner in which confinement is made to answer the ends of punishment . The place of confinement , therefore , its arrangements and interior regulation , and the treatment and discipline to which prisoners are to be subjected , when confined within it , form the natural divisions of this code . The first book accordingly treats of places of confinement , their construction and officers . These places naturally divide themselves into the two great classes , appropriated for the reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted offenders . The former is called a House of Detention ; the latter a Penitentiary , or School of Reform , according to the age of the convict and the character of his crime . The House of Detention is to be so constructed , as to keep in four divisions , each division entirely separate from the others , the prisoners comprehended in the following classes . First , male persons detained as witnesses ; those confined for misdemeanors , disturbance of a court , breach of recognizance and non-payment of a fine ; and those sentenced to simple imprisonment . Second , female prisoners of the same de* scriptions . Third , male persons regularly committed on an accusation of crime . Fourth , female prisoners of the same description . The confinement of those persons in the first and second classes who have been sentenced to imprisonment , and of every one embraced in the third and fourth classes is to be solitary ; but there are to be two enclosed yards , the one for the male , the other for the female prisoners , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is permitted . The Penitentiary and School of Reform are for the confinement of all those convicted of crime ; the former containing such convicts as have attained the age of eighteen at the time of conviction ; the latter such as are under that age , to whom may be added other youthful offenders and vagrants specially included by law . The Penitentiary is to contain a cell with an enclosed court for every convict , a machine so disposed that a convenient number of prisoners may work at it separated from each other by a wall , school-rooms , an infirmary , and all buildings necessary for safely keeping and preserving the health of the prisoners . The House of Detention has separate divisions for the sexes , a separate dormitory for each prisoner , courts and rooms for their employment , school-rooms , and an infirmary . The officers of these places are not only the wardens and keepers necessarily employed , but there are also chaplains , teachers , matrons , and physicians , whose duties , strictly specified by the code , embrace the religious instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their health , and the enforcement of continual industry . To see that these duties are adequately performed , a board of five inspectors is appointed by the highest authority of the State , who , together with the governor , the presidents of both houses of the legislature , the judges of the supreme court , and other distinguished functionaries , are directed constantly to visit the different places of confinement , to prevent all oppression , peculation , and abuse , in the management of them , and to make frequent periodical reports to the legislature . Their duties in all these respects are strictly prescribed by the code ; they are allowed an adequate compensation ; and their feelings , character , and honor are thus enlisted in the strict maintenance of the institution , on the plan framed by the authority from whom they receive their trust . The second book of this code contains the provisions for the treatment of prisoners in the several places of confinement . It has been already seen from the plan of their construction , as well as from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a proper classification and separation in a few cases , and entire solitude in nearly all , are laid down as the fundamental principles of reform and prison discipline . // Nothing perhaps is more universally admitted than the danger of vicious association ; yet in no respect has the discipline of prisons been more defective , than in confounding together all who are involved in the various , different stages of criminal procedure . After condemnation , there can be no association but of the guilty with the guilty ; in preliminary imprisonment , guilt must be associated with innocence . He who is confined as a witness , for a misdemeanor , or on suspicion , leaves the den , where he was imprisoned , with tainted morals , ( lepraved habits , and excited l ) passions , which are certain to lead him back to the abode of infamy , where they were first acquired or infinitely augmented . The provisions of the code , applicable to this subject , are the more important , because , while there has been much legislation on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few efficient steps have anywhere been taken to prevent the demoralizing consequences attending indiscriminate association before trial , and for offenees which amount not to crime . Persons whose liberty , for the good of society , must be restrained , are either those upon whom imprisonment is imposed merely to secure their appearance when the purposes of justice require it , or those upon whom it is inflicted as a punishment . The detention of those of the first description , to be just , must be accompanied with no unnecessary privation ; it is therefore provided , that they shall be in all respects comfortably attended to , allowed the visits of their families and friends , supplied with books , and receive the proceeds of such labor as they may choose to engage in . Persons who are accused of offences , punishable when proved by a comparatively light penalty , ought not to be treated with that rigor of confinement which is necessary to secure those charged with crime . The degrees of this rigor , are therefore distinctly laid down in the code ; the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated from such as are probably guilty ; those accused of offenees implying no great moral turpitude , from the depraved in mind and manners ; the young from the old offender . Classification and separation are provided for before trial , with the same care as after conviction . The rules which regulate the imprisonment of the convict , when it comes to be treated in a double capacity , as a punishment and means of refortn , are made to refer to the various // degrees of simple imprisonment , imprisonment at hard labor , and solitary confinement at certain intervals ; which were the penalties designated in the Code of Crimes and Punishments . Precise provisions are prescribed , to prevent oppression on the one hand , and on the other strictly to enforce the execution of the sentence ; nothing is left to the discretion of turnkeys or keepers , to be varied according to their caprice or the means a criminal may have of purchasing their favor ; the qualifications required of these officers are pointed out , as a guide to the selecting power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the one may not commit the fatal error of underrating the talents necessary for the employment , and the other may feel its dignity and responsibility ; the punishment , once ordered , can neither he aggravated nor alleviated by a ministerial officer . When labor is added to confinement , the convict is made to rise at the dawn of day and to continue at work until half an hour before sunset , except during the intervals of meals and attendance on a teacher ; perseverance , accoinpanied with obedience , moral conduct , and a desire to reform , bring to the prisoner proportionate and increasing advantages of a better diet , permission to read books of instruction , the privilege of visits from relations and friends , and ultimately a part of the proceeds of his industry . Solitary confinement , without labor and in entire seclusion , varies as to duration according to the enormity of the crime ; those convicted of murder , without any aggravating circumstances , are deprived of labor for two consecutive months every year , while , in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three and to six months ; none of them have any communication with persons out of the prison , except the inspectors , and they are considered dead to the rest of the world . It seems to be equally consistent with humanity and sound reason , that the severity of these punishments should be tempered , or at least the mode of applying them should be varied , in the instance of a youthful criminal . When a child of tender age commits an offence , he probably acts under the influence of those passions which nature has given him , while she has not yet conferred that discretion which teaches him to control them . He is , perhaps , without parental or friendly advisers , and knows neither the duties nor penalties of the law . In such a case , if crime has been committed , it is but just to // seek to remove its cause , by the milder method of instruction and useful employment . Instead , therefore , of being consigned to a penitentiary , the criminal under eighteen is sentenced to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are minutely laid down . Occasional solitude , constant instruction , labor in the different mechanic arts , with mild but certain punishment for the bad , and marks of distinction for those who improve , form the outlines of this excellent branch of prison discipline ; and contribute all that can be devised , to rescue the young from a headlong course leading them to ruin and aggravated crime . To these two books , which , properly speaking , embrace all the branches of a code of reform and prison discipline , Mr. Livingston has added a third , for the purpose of establishing an institution connected with it in its general features , and certainly of great importance in a complete system of police . This he denominates a House of Refuge and Industry . Its object is not the punishment of crime ; it is intended to afford the means of employment , voluntary for those able and willing to labor , and coercive on those who , although able , prefer a life of idleness , mendicity , or vice . Implements and necessary materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry are taught , good but plain food is supplied , the vicious not yet convicted of crime are reclaimed , and the unfortunate are protected and relieved . To one unhappy class , who are expressly entitled to admission , that of discharged convicts , such a refuge is invaluable . Here , " in the language of Mr. Livingston , " he may find employment and subsistence , and receive such wages as will enable him to remove from the scenes of his past crimes , place him above temptation , confirm him in his newly acquired habits of industry , and cause him safely to pass the dangerous and trying period between the acquisition of his liberty and restoration to the confidence of society . The cause , the temptation , or the excuse for relapse , being thus removed , it is hoped that instances of return to vicious pursuits will become more rare and that many will become useful members of society , who , under the present system , either burden it by their poverty , or prey upon it by their crimes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of prudence will no more receive or employ a convict discharged from one of our present penitentiaries , than he would shut up with his flock a wild beast escaped from its keepers ; but , the reformatory plan once fairly in operation , its principles studied , developed , steadily adhered to , im // proved by the light of experience , and its beneficial effects upon morals perceived , the man who has undergone its purifying operation will , in time , be no longer regarded with fear or contempt , and society , by confiding in his reformation , will permit him to be honest . " V. There only remains what may be considered rather as an appendix , than a j lOon of the System of Penal Law , the Book of Definitiorts . This is added , in order to render the system both explicit and concise . The employment of technical terms , though never used where common expressions sufhciently definite are to he found , is in many instances unavoidable . In all such cases , and whenever words or phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that given them in common parlance , they are defined and explained in this supplementary hook . These remarks complete the analysis of the System of Penal Law , prepared by Mr. Livingston for the State of Louisiana . It has been less the object of them to offer a criticism upon its various provisions , than to condense and present them in a complete and single point of view . It would have been a task comparatively easy to examine particular portions more in detail ; some of the views , which we have passed hastily over , might , perhaps , have been partially controverted , others were susceptible of far more illustration and praise than has been bestowed . But the woik is one every way worthy of the deep consideration of all communities , not partially but as a whole ; not merely for the provisions it establishes in regard to one offence or atiother , but for the wise , the liberal , the charitable manner in which it travels over and embraces those rights and duties , the most sacred , that belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taken as a single and complete work , it is the production of a mind at once prepared , by long practice in the study and profession of the law , to treat it with all the lights and aids of science , and imbued with that humane and comprehensive spirit , which is necessary to reform xvhat is rooted in general habit and prejudice , and to systematize and reduce what has been diffused by circumstances and time . It has already fixed upon Mr. Livingston the attention of the most intelligent statesmen and purest philan ! hropists in other countries , and enrolled his name in those high places which are assigned to general benefactors of mankind.
