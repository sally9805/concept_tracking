txt EARLY in the fall of 1824 , a fire broke out in the woods , near Wiscasset and Olney , two pretty villages of Maine , which , after spreading itself slowly and quietly through the underbrush of that neighborhood for a few days , without exciting any unusual attention , appeared to go out of itself . And then , as if it had been refreshing itself by repose , gathering its whole strength , while the inhabitants were looking another way , it burst forth anew , and reappeared , with astonishing suddenness , in twenty places at once encompassing the whole neighborhood , as with a wall of fire , and extending itself , not gradually , nor sloxvly , but with the swiftness of a conquering army , mounted upon the steeds of the Desert , and with a noise like that of the great deep , even to the British Dominions ; filling the air with a preternatural paleness , oversweeping the wilderness of timber-trees , lying between the States and the Provinces , and literally destroying millions of acres . Instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have no parallel perhaps in the history of mankind . By this , I do not mean that others have not suffered as much or more , by other and different manifestations of the Destroyer ; but simply that , in the whole range of History , and I might add , of Poetry and Romance , though well aware of what has been done by Cooper , and Flint - our friend Timothy - whose very hearts were afire , when they described a similar scene - there is no parallel to be found for the truth of what happened here ; and chiefly among the houseless , homeless men , who were caught logging for the fall freshets , or prowling for beaver , by the instantaneous and overwhelming approach of the fire , bursting upon them , at dead of night with the noise of thunder , or surrounding them at noonday , while they are lying half asleep , in the shadow of a mighty tree , calculating its worth in feet and inches - or appearing suddenly before them , and right in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look up in the pursuit of an elk or a bear . There is no poetry in this . I am not exaggerating . Every word I write is the simple truth . I know of many cases like the following . Three men were at work in the wood , towards the lines - Walker and two others Walker lived at Thomson-pond . I have the story from one of the parties . The first thins they saw , as they were at work , with nothing to apprise them of their danger - no sign in heaven or earth - nothing but a little haziness in the atmosphere , which they took no notice of at the time , and only remembered afterwards , while they were running for // their lives - a large tree took fire close by them . They looked up , and without speaking a word , started off at full speed for the nearest water they were acquainted with , so hotly pursued by the fire , that they never stopped until they reached the Schoodic river , forty miles off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they arrived at the bank , holding their heads under the water , as long as they could , and only looking out long enough to get their breath . Of these three , one died on the shore , another , Walker himself , about six months afterwards . The other is still living . Another case . A man - I forget his name - was at work , digging potatoes . Happening to look up , he saw an old stump afire , a little way off . Not dreaming of danger , but wondering where the fire could come from , as he saw nothing to cause it , he happened to turn toward another quarter of the sky . It was all in commotion - over the top of a hill not far off , the flames were pouring with a steady uninterrupted rush , as if they had overswept a barrier , and were tumbling through some vast cavern of the earth , like the waters of Niagara . Heavy black clouds were gathered about the base , and almost upon a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in thick flashes , with the roar of approaching battle ; a sensible vibration of the earth . In less than three minutes , and before the poor fellow had time to recollect himself , or hardly to get his breath , he found himself completely surrounded . He started for his house , only a few rods off ; but before he could reach it , a stack of grain which he had to pass on the way , took fire - and the next moment , his barnand finally the house itself , before he could reach it . And then , the blackness and desolation , above and below , and all about him - the skies thundering afar off- the earth quaking underneath his feet - the flames pouring over the tops of the nearest hills , and through the tempestuous gathering of clouds - Like sheets of light , in their descent Through midnight 's parting firmament . ' All this had he to encounter . But he reached the house - appeared in the door-way for a moment , called to his wife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other two , as they lay stretched out upon the floor , he sprang for the high road , without looking behind him . It was only a few rods off ; but when he arrived there , he missed his wife and the youngest child . Providentially , there was a large open place not far off . Leaving his two boys there , he returned for his wife . On reaching the door , and seeing the frightful appearance of the sky , she had fainted . They were all saved , but their house and barn were destroyed - all their property everything they had on earth , but the clothes upon their backs . And to this hour , that unhappy // mother is haunted by the recollection of that terrible appearance of the sky . To her , it was the Last Day . And if she heard not the trumpet of the Archangel , summoning the countless nations of all the earth to judgment , while the heavens were roled together as a scroll , and the mountains were melted with fervent heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very foundations of the LTniverse . And she fainted . For even the mother could not bear the sight , with her youngest-born at her breast , its little arms outstretched toward the alarming brightness - its parched lips trembling , and its eyes shining with terror , as it turned to her , and clung to her , gasping for breath . Her fri*ht was even too much for a mother 's love . But what are these - all these - to the story I have now to tell ? There was a man by the name of Hayes , who , in consequence of I know not what violation of the law , bad betaken himself to that region along our frontier , which the King of the Netherlands thoujA proper to recommend the abandonment of , not long ago . Hayes had been * *ell educated , was a fiery , intrepid fellow , and cared for nobody on earth , not even Sir Howard Douglas . About him he had gathered , nobody ever knew how , a considerable number of men like himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those attributes which bear sway over the multitude . It was whispered , though I never knew precisely upon what authority , that he had left old Massachusetts , before the separation of Maine , solely on account of the reception he met with , when he spoke to the men having authority there , about the importance of settling the North-eastern boundary , before the British had spoiled us of our strength , and establlihed a line of fortifications along our own territory ; and that , indignant at the indifference betrayed by our great men , respecting what he regarded , and with justice , as the great northern bulwark of the confederacy - be had appropriated to himself a horse , belonging to the then Governor of Massachusetts , leaving in his stead , a note conceived in the following terms , and addressed to him , as Commander-in-chief : Sir - for the horse I have taken , at five days ' notice , value received , I promise to return you , at any place you may appoint , within the acknowledged boundaries of Massachusetts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Howard Douglas , or any other British Governor , of New-Brunswick , or Nova-Scotia - or the value thereof in subordinates . E. HAYES . P. 5 . You will have to *ght for your North-eastern Boundary yet , if you do n't wake up - no matter where you place it . They will not stop , so long as you are satisfied with talking . The Kennebec is not far off- and the Piscataqua but another step . // How much truth there may be in this story , it is not for me to say ; but I must acknowledge , that his exceedingly familiar acquaintance with all that concerned our North-eastern Boundary , and the evident jealousy , with which he was regarded , whenever he appeared at Fredericton , were circumstances , that strengthened me not a little in my belief , that he would be a dangerous fellow for our good neighbors , the British , if the worst should come to the worst . Sir ! said he - it was long after the separation of Massachusetts and Maine - my countrymen are fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is not such another line of defence along the whole frontier of the States . Ours , we should have nothing to fear . Theirs-the whole Confederacy would be open to their inroads . Will they never wske up ! Are they blockheads enough to believe , that in case of another war , the British will be desperate or foolish enough to try the North-River ? No I they had enough of that in the first war . The next will bring out all their strength . - and for the same purpose , a separation of the States , or a dismemberment of territory , along our North-eastern Boundary . The question is , not whether the District of Maine shall lose a p art of her wilderness , a few millions of acres more or less - what are they to her ? - nor is it , whether Massachusetts , or even whether New-England shall have a portion of this vast territorythe raw material for a state , gambled any by ignorant and blundering liticians - but whether the surest and strongest buls wark the Confederacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crafty and powetful adversary . I know of but three men that understand this subject , be.ides myse ( f-one is the late Governor King of Maine- the other Lincoln , of Massachusetts , and the other , Lincoln of Maine - thank God , they are brothers and Governors ! Sir ! Do you know why Sir Howard Douglas is pushing his settlements forward by main force , within the disputed territory ? Because he is a military - . Because he hon the value - the inestimable value - not so much to the Provinces as to the States , however- of the dispoted ground , as a military position . And why is he the Governor of New-Brunswick ? Because he is a raiWarij muss . Mark my wordk ! What is now done warily and secretly , will soon be urged with arroant pretension . Out of our apathy , a claim of right will be raised , and war- open war - may be the consequence of our stupidit7 , before we have done with this . Why Sir- continued he , his black eyes flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just after the seizure of his friend Baker-long subsequent to the pariod of my story , however-Do you how that Qod-Almigh* has laid out amilitary road for us , along that whole line of frontier - a road without an // equal upon the face of the earth - one too , which our adversary took advanta ; e of , at the very outbreaking of the last war , by marching a regiment ( the 104th ) from Fredericton to Quebec , in the dead of winter  --  to the unspeakable relief , as well as amazement , of Sir George Prevost , who complimented the officers for their heroic achievement , up on parade , ad afterwards mentioned it in the general orders . If we abandon that road , we deserve what we shall most assuredly meet with hereafter - the contempt of every military man upon the face of the earth , who understands the subject ; ad the reproach of our children 's children to the latest generation . Upon my word , my dear sir - said I. This is all Hebrew to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along our whole North-eastern frontier ? I mean what I say . A military-road - ranged , laid out , and fortified , by the God of Battles ; the God our Fathers worshipped-the Men of the Revolution . lou can not mean the highlands ? The highiands I-nonsense ! No Sir ; I mean a river-roada water-level- a road , as level as this floor ( stamping with his heavy foot , as he spoke ) for two hundred miles , with no roots nor underbrush in the fly , and as hard as the everlasting rocks - a far better road than that , by which George Washington escaped , when he was beleaguered by the whole strength of the British armies , and struck that astonishinp blow at Princeton ; a road , in short Sir , over which gur enemies moved their armies during the last war , and I then hoped for the last time . What was I to believe ? The man before me , was a roughlooking Don-Easter , with a bear-skin cap , powder-horn , a shotpouch , a wampum-belt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the bearing of a soldier - and he talked the language of a statesman . Circumstances of a singular nature , had thrown us together , and inclination , at least on my part , had kept us together . On some points , he was very free with me - on others , exceedingly reserved . I could not len that he was married - or that he had ever been married ; yet he spoke with such a devout and passionate eloquence , of what married men are , or ought to be , most familiar with ; the pleasantness and sacredness of home , the beauty and simplicity of fireside comforts , the pride of a father- and here his lip quivered- and the in-gathering of all generous and powerful and pure impuises , about the nestling place of your own sanctitudes the oflbpring of your love and faith and holy confidence - nay , the very look of his eyes , the very tones of his voice , were enough to satisfy me that he had been , if he was notnow , ahusband and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I told him so  --  but he made no renlv. // I did not like to put the question in so many words - much less to obtain what I wanted by stratagem ; but the very day before we parted , I am afraid for the last time , he for the deep of the wilderness , there to wait for the trumpet-call of them that know how to defend the ramparts of a mighty empire - II to the bustle and uproar of a crowded city , or to the solitude of a country-village - an accident happened , which took hit-n so completely by surprise , that he betrayed himself . We were standing by a double sleigh , with two young horses hitched to it , ready for a start , and waiting only for the last paper . All at once , they began to plunge - a little boy in a fur-cap , came skating by , just under their noses - they suddenly reared up , and then set off , at full speed , on their way toward Fredericton barracks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes - I must call him so - blubbering like a great school-boy , over a little fellow with a prodigious quantity of bright hair - his cap off- I recollect the cap now - and his clothes all powdered with snow . The case was clear - the little fellow was as white as a miller ; he had evidently had a fall . But the most diverting part of the whole was , to see him looking up into the face of poor Hayes , with such an air of innocent surprise , while the latter was crying over him - literally boo-hoo-ing . It was too much for me . I could n't stand it . Observing me just ready to laugh , Hayes flung the boy a dollar - kissed him - and then started off at full speed , after his horses . He had evidently not missed them until now , for I saw him pull in his right hand with a disorderly twitch - then look at it - and then start away , as if wondering how he had lost his reins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following is an abridgment . Sir , said he , I am a sad fellow - very childish , very wicked , and of course , very wretched . I am a fool , I know - but I ca n't help it . I never see a fur-cap of that color , pointing to his own , which lay steaming on a settle , before a huge roaring fire - on the head of a boy , without feeling as if I could cry my eyes out . I have been , what you told me once you were - a husband and a father , a proud father , and a happy husband . You remember the fires we had in 1824 ? Well , I had camped out that fall , and was making a fortune ; how , and with what view , is nobody 's business . You need n't stare - I saw the question rising to your throat . Well , I had left my wife ; no matter why ; incompatibility of temper , if you like . All I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Had she been more of a woman , and less of an angel , I should not have been what I am now - an outcast - a xvanderer - a hunted out law . Oh , you need n't stare . I ye told you about all I mean to tell you on that head . Well - we separated - in plain English , I ran away , and left my wife ; taking with me only one // child - my poor dear Jerry - the only child I was sure of ; for between ourselves , my good sir , the devil had put it into my head to be jealous of my poor wife - and so I left her all the children with blue and gray eyes , and took with me the only one that resembled me . Ah , if you could but have seen that boy 's eyes They were like sunshine , though black as death . Well , Jerry and I got along pretty well together for nearly three years , when one day , I received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eldest boy , and the two blue-eyed babies , were in their graves . Two were drowned in each others ' arms - the other died of a broken heart - a mere baby - but it pined itself to death after I disappeared - she told me so , and I believed her - asking for farler , poor farler , a hundred times in a day , and whenever it awoke in the night ; and dying - literally dying , with that word upon its lips . My wife added , that she was coming home . What could I say ? I knew that I had wronged her ; that I was a fool and a madman ; but what could I say ? Vell , our arrrangements were made , and I set off to meet her - Leaving my poor little boy at home , with a hired girl to take care of him , until I got back . To be sure that he would not go astray , I had tied a young Newfoundland puppy , of which he was very fond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay there until I returned with his mother , which would be in the course of that afternoon , or toward night-fall . Here he stopped , and his breathing changed ; but after a few minutes , began anew , in a lower and steadier , though much altered tone . Well Sir - we met once more - and she forgave me ; and we were happy . And so , I took her into my arms , lifted her into the saddle , and we started together - two as happy human creatures , as there were upon the face of the whole earth - notwithstanding the self-reproach and heaviness I felt , on hearing the particulars of what I can not bear to speak of yet , or even to think of  --  the death of Luther and his two elder sisters . Poor Lutherpoor baby ! Well , we were already more than half way back to the place where she was prepared to see her little nestling asleep , and dreaming of its mother - his dear , new mother , as he called her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him that she was coming to live with us . Poor little fellow He had almost forgotten her . Suddenly , as we were descending the top of a hill , our horses began to snort - my wife caught my arm , and as I turned toward her , I saw the whole western sky in a preternatural glow . Before I could speak , a strange darkness swept by , and I felt as if the hand of death were upon me , I tried to speak , but I could not . I could only urge my wife to follow - and clapping spurs to my horse , I rode straightway toward the fire . Once only , did I turn - and then only to look // back and forbid her to follow me further . Well , I arrived at the place ; and there I found - bear with me patiently - first the hired girl , frightened half out of our senses , and hiding under a fence . I asked her for my boy . She stood aghast at the inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , as if in search of something . At last , and with great difficulty , she recollected herself enough to say , that she had seen the fire in time to escape with my boy - that being dreadfully fatigued , though she had not ran far , she sat down to rest herself , looking toward the path by which we were expected - that some how or other , she fell asleep - and that the last she remembered was , something little Jerry had said about going back to untie poor Carlo ! My heart died away within me . I knew that I was childless - I knew it - do n't talk to rue - I knew it . And it was so . When I arrived at my house , I found it nearly destroyed by the fire - and a little way off , lay my poor boy , with Carlo watching over him . The child was dead - that is Carlo you see there . l'Jy wife is in the mad-house , at Philadelphia - and here am I. God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
