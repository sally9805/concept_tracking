txt IN looking over , at this close of our literary autumn , the remanent portions of the year 's harvest , we have gleaned no scraps but these , which are worthy to be hoarded up and preserved . And why , as they lie before us on our table , do we regard the characters , in which they seem to have been hastily penned , with so mournful an interest ? Alas ! the hand of the writer has lost its cunning . The mind which conceived these thoughts dwells with the inconceivable and the spiritual alone . SILAS P. HoLBROOK was a man of genius ; he was a true-hearted and an honest man ; he was a philosopher , in the noblest sense of the term ; he was a Christian - his actions declared it to the world , though his voice uttered it only to God in the temple of his soul . His step fell noiselessly on the beaten path of life ; but it was the tread of a strong man , and , had he chosen , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was unobservedly walking . When that step was arrested by death , few , except his near friends , noted it ; yet how deep a void has he left in the space of action which he so honorably filled ! When we look back upon the noiseless tenor of his way , we are tempted to exclaim , in the language of the philosopher of poets and the poet of philosophers - How seldom , friend ! a good , great man inherits Honor or wealth with all his worth or pains It sonnds like stories from the land of spirits , If any man obtain that which he merits , Or any merit that which he obtains. * // Yet , with such men as Holbrook , Goodness and greatness are not means , but ends . ' Truth and honor and the power of genius were not prized by him , inasmuch as they would lead to favor or worldly distinction but they were to him in themselves their own exceediug great reward . He possessed not wealth - he boasted no troops of friends ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasures , LOVE and LIGHT And CALM THOUGHTS , regular as infant 's breath : And three firm friends , more true than day and night , HIMsELF , his MAKER , and the angel DEATH . ' Yet , he has left not a few , whose eyes are dim when they look for his coming , and behold him not . The domestic circle ,  - -  ah , let that most sacred sorrow be shrouded ! His intimates - his associates ; even the latter , among whom we had the pleasure to be numbered , deeply mourn his loss . As we first lighted on these papers in his hand-writing-which , with others , were communicated to us by himself for publication in this Magazine - we were solemnly affected . And how could we be otherwise than affected by whatever reminded us of the hours we had passed in his society ? Were he at this moment sitting near us - how perfectly we remember his smile ! - we doubt whether he would consent that the following morceaux should be known as his ; yet , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight tribute to the memory of their lamented author . As a motto to the thoughts , entitled Men and Boys , ' - this , from the exquisite ode of Wordsworth , might have been chosen : The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benedictions ' Or , this beautiful translation from Faust : Give me , oh , give me back the days When I , too -1 , too , was young , And felt as they now feel , each coming hour , New consciousness of power . Oh , happy , happy time , above all praise ! Then , thoughts on thoughts and crowding fancies sprung , And found a language in unbidden lays - TJnintermitted streams from fountains ever flowing . Then , as I wandered free , In every field , for me Its thousand flowers were blowing - A veil through which I did not see , A thin veil o'er the world was thrown , In every bud a mystery , Magic in everything unknown . // The fields , the groves , the air was haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me , give me back the days of youth - Poor , yet how rich my glad inheritance , The unextinguishahie love of truth . While life 's realities were all romance , Give me , oh , give youth , passions unconfined , The rush of joy , that felt almost like painIts hate , its love , its own tumultuous mind . Give me my youth again ! MEN AND BOYS . I am a misanthrope-for I dislike men ; but then , I love children . A little man , before he is eight years of age , is a better being than his father , grandfather , or any of his progenitors . After that ' golden period , he grows in stature , ugliness , and evil . He parts with his innocence when he acquires knowledge . His mind is full of conductors , and evil flashes into it from everything adjacent . For a while , I was pleased to recall my own childhood to mind ; but I am grown so old and so bad , that it is now a pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I should like to bang it up , if I could , in a heathen temple , a fit offering to the furies , as the poetess offered her mirror , when it no longer reflected a beautiftil face . This mirror true , too true for me , I give to Venus , ever fair ; For , what I was I can not see , And what I am I can not hear . ' Speech and reason , men make their boast of , when they would look down upon the respectable races of quadrupeds. 3ut I was happiest before I could speak plainly , and before I could reason ( that is , twist my intellect into a defence of my actions ) at all . Reason is an obedient servant , but not an imperative master . The master- Will- directs him to prepare a defence of an action or course of conduct , and it is forthwith done , better than Cicero could have made it . These operations were going on in my mind long before I knew by name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early that I knew the distinction between a bad boy and a good one . It was impressed upon me at borne , that I was of the latter kind ; and the evidence was sufficient for my assent to so agreeable a proposition . The most of a boy 's life is passed in dreaming . All his thoughts are dreams - all his reasonings , imaginations . He lies down upon a hard rock , and dreams away half a day in the sun he rests on the margin of a brook , and the murmurs of the water strike his ear as strange as a mingling of distant music and human // voices . He contracts a friendship with quadrupeds , feels a favor towards inanimate objects . The cur-dog and the cosset-lamb are his foster-brothers . They are also his depeadants , and he feeds them with his own hand . The old oak , where he gathers acorns , has a strong hold upon his affections ; and pleasant associations cling like ivy to the old elm . These are the early emanations of Love - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the institutions of society , the pursuits and fashions of the world , subvert . This affection of his soul is left to struggle as it may among sterner passions , while every quality of his understanding is developed by education . The thinking being is educated - the sentient neglected . His intellect is cultivated , too , at the expense of his affections . He is incited to study by the mean motives of rivalry and jealousy ; he is led to pride himself on being at the head of his class , because there are so many between him and the foot . PERFECTION AND AMENDMENT . Perfection whispered , passing by , Behold the Lass of Ballochmyle . ' This Lass of I3allochmyle ' dwelt in Scotland , and , instead of Perfection , was met by the poet . Where Perfection dwells , is not so easy to say ; it is a sort of aurora borealis , shooting up at a distance , hut receding as approached . Few men , however , care much for following it far ; young men dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no delusion ; it is the pillar of fire , the shadowing cloud to lead us to a better country . Man , considered as the mere forked animal , the featherless biped , is but a system of capabilities , a collection of elements , for favorable circumstances to develope . He has emerged somewhat from his tadpole state , but he is discouraged in the beginning of his race after perfection , or perhaps too well satisfied with the small distance he has already run . From one earth were xve created-one soul was breathed into us ; a soul - soaring , groveling , timid , daring , passionate , yet capable of the utmost coolness to gratify passion . In the beginning , all are alike . The dusky infant , that opens its eyes of innocence in a shed , thatched by a palm-leaf , in India-that is to grow up a Pariah , an outcast even in its own eyes has the elements , the capabilities , at least , of affection , if not of intellect , that were given to him that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those of all mankind . Yet it seems that the distance is measureless between a being like Penn and a debased serf in Russia , howling under the cudg // el , - a Chinese , prostrate before a Mandarin , - a Tartar , devouring raw horse-flesh , - or a Batta , feasting upon the flesb of his kindred . It is , indeed , something of a distance ; but it may be marched in one generation . The wild crab of the forest may be engrafted and cultivated , and bear fruit that xviii do credit to a garden . The veriest savage , that ever emulated the wolf in ferocity , or the fox in cunning , may have a son that , if properly trained , xvould pass a life - an eternity - in the practice and enjoyment of duties , good sentiments and affections . Washington , Howard , Wilberforce , Penn , Scott , had comparatively hut just emerged from this wild state , though advanced before mere savages ; their capacities of goodness in intellect were but just opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all things good and great , they are as far behind the pure minds that were released from the body a thousand years ago , as they are in advance of the most groveling soul that ever inhahited the human tenement . All is progressive , eternally . What shall be done , what shall wn do , to advance this march of mind , which men speak of without caring whether the march is retrograde or forward ? Rothschild , the father of the five money kings , who constitute the strongest alliance in Europe , required of his sons , before he died , that they should act in unison . In this he had but one object - their temporal interest ; and well has it been secured by this judicious , yet simple and plain advice . They are the richest sovereigns in Europe , and all others are tributaries . Had the design of their father been to make them good , that they might make others so , he could have given no better counsel . There is no way to regenerate the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impulse to the human mind in the orbit for which it was designed , - but for the good and true , the thinking and the feeling , to unite - to make common cause , to form a joint-stock company , in which all are directors , and , by their untiring zeal and united efforts , to induce others to travel the same road in which they themselves go . It is wide enough for all , and it leads to a land where there are no juries , judges , county attornies , or prisons . Reader ! be not discouraged because you are humble and alone ; resolve to be good that is , to do good - and you will find companions . Pursue your mental improvement , your advancement in good principles and affections , as diligently as your worldly advantage , and you shall hereafter shake hands with Cato , Cicero , and Socrates . They are all living , and you may see them all , and a million of others as good and great , if you prefer not to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large territory , and one good man can make many other men good ; yet , ten good men , united , have the influence of a hundred , separate . // A late traveler in Great Britain remarked , in the manners and feelings of a large population , the influence of one family , without title or civil power , hut their mere effect of goodness . Where the example of this single family operated , it made a heaven around it ; it influenced a hundred of others ; it pointed to brighter worlds , and led the way . Reader , is there any moral evil thou canst remove ? is there a friend to be reclaimed ? try ! if ' you can reclaim him ; but delay , from indolence , or what you call delicacy , and it is as though you had contrived his fall . Rescue him The gates of Heaven are not closed to those who hring others to the portals . If thou art of an intellectual cast , if thou wouldst ascend a high mountain , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delineated as on a map , attend diligently to the ministrations of Channing. if thou requirest impulse and eloquence to move thee to duty , rather than reflection , go listen to the words of that best of reformersEdward Taylor.
