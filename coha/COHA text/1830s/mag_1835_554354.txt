txt ABOUT three years ago , Angelo Maio , the discover and editor of the lost hooks of Cicero " de Republica , " published the works of three Roman writers upon Classic Mythology . He supposes these writers to have been Hyginus , Placidus , and Leontius , who flourished after the commencement of the fifth century . The work before us is an edition of the same writers by Dr. Bode , improved by a careful comparison with manuscripts in the libraries of Wolfenbutteb Gottingen , Gotha , and Paris , and illustrated with critical notes . The name of the editor is a sufficient guaranty of the correctness and value of the work . Dr. Bode has long been known to the literary world as a profound scholar . His dissertation upon the Orphic Poetry , * which gained the prize at Gottingen , introduced him , in early youth , into the fellowship of the learned , with distinguished honors ; and his career has since made good the excellent promise of his first efforts . Having resided for several years in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known and highly esteemed by American scholars , his departure for Germany , in 1828 , was witnessed with regret by all to whom the cause of learning is dear . We learn with satisfaction that this gentleman is about to return to our land , in consequence of an invitation from the University at Cambridge , and to set up his household gods beneath the shades of Harvard . // The collection of Roman writers on mythology , which Dr. Bode has edited , should be in the hands of every teacher , as it embodies , in a convenient form , the principal fables of classic religion , and will be found extremely useful as a book of reference . Copious extracts might be made from it , for the use of pupils , as the Latin is simple and easy , and though written at a comparatively recent period , is still for the most part classical in the construction . The instructer must not , however , depend upon such works as this , for his knowledge of Greek and Roman mythology ; the only resource for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let him drink from the very source of those wells undefiled , " whose waters have fertilized the world ; let him hold communion , not through the medium of translations and commentaries , but in their original and matchless language , with those elder bards who have celebrated the praises of their gods in strains that will never be mute . The early epic , cheerful and serene as the unclouded sky in the theology which it embodies , the darker and more awful visions of tragedy , the lyric devotion , the " pictured page " of the historian , are the sources from which the genuine scholar must derive his knowledge of this most important branch of classical learning . With the hope of aiding the teacher in this pursuit , we intend to offer a few remarks which may serve as an introduction and guide to the study of classic mythology . The classic mythology seems to have been regarded by the Greeks , with nearly the same veneration with which the Hebrew nation regarded the books of their sacred writers . The poems of Homer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute what may be called a Greek bible . They give , according to the popular notions , a history of the creation and of the gods , and then , devoting themselves to the particular history of one nation , they detail the nature and origin and progress of Greece . The Greeks believed themselves to be the favored people of heaven ; - the mighty heroes the ancestors of their race , were allied to , and descended from , the gods ; - not a hill-top in their land , -* not a river nor a fountain , but was the favored abode of some deity . Their faith , though not based on truth , was sincere and deep , and seems to deserve our respect and our earnest consideration . These remarks , however , do not equally apply to the religion of Rome , as we find it embodied in Latin literature . An // important distinction is to be made by the student between the religion of Greece , which is contained in the poems of Homer , Hesiod , Piadar , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in the writings of Virgil , Horace , and Ovid. it may be expla ? n*d in a few words ; the poets of Greece were , in some degree at least , believers in the religion which they celebrated ; the poets of Rome were not . The Romans , it is true derived their worship , in part , from the Greeks ; and the general features of the two are similar . Probably , too , the worship of the uneducated class in Rome , in the days of Augustus , was as sincere as that of the same class in Greece in the time of Solon ; but the more elevated ranks , the enlijnened and educated men in Rome , either regarded it as a vain and worthless superstition , or amused themselves with its poetry ; they placed no faith in it . As it is from this class , however , that the student of the present day must derive his knowledge of Roman religion , it seems to be worth a moment 's attention to investigate the differences which this want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodied by the poets . In the first place , then , the characters of the gods , as they are portrayed by the Greek poets , are more elevated and pleasing , than they are made to appear by Roman writers . They are chargeable with great deficiencies in both ; they are haughty , tyrannical , passionate ; occasionally displaying the most ridiculous weaknesses of humanity ; but in the Greek poets they are invested with the majesty and glory of immortals . We feel , as we stand in their presence , that they are not of earthly race ; they inspire us with awe ; they vindicate their celestial nature . In the Roman poets they are endowed , not with immortal natures , but only with more than human power . They are essentially human in their language and actions . The Greek writers abound in descriptions of the personal appearance of the gods ; they exhibit them in every variety of situation and employment , with a minuteness of description which might serve as a guide to the painter and sculptor . Phidias is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal forms , which he has embodied in marble and ivory . The Latin poets , on the contrary , give but few such descriptions . Who , for instance , could form any idea of the figure of Juno from the Eneid , through the whole of which ? he is made to play a conspicuous part ? Many of the gods are // not mentioned in the poem ; and with the exception of the sixth book , which we regard as a distinct and peculiar effort of genius , and one or two allegorical passages , the portraits of the immortals are extremely slight and indistinct . The iliad , on the other hand , embodies almost an entire theogony ; and the representations of the deities are made with such care and minuteness , that they seem to stand visibly before us . The cause of this difference between the Greek and Roman poets is obvious . To Bonier and Hesiod was allotted the proud duty of making known to their countrymen the gods who watched over them , and from whom they were descended . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To them had been revealed the splendid vision of Olympus , the pavement of gold , the gorgeous throne of Jove , the flaming car of Minerva , the portals of heaven , watched by the Hours , and spontaneously unfolding at the approach of the celestial messengers . For them the impenetrable veil of the past had been removed , and they had gazed upon the infancy of creation , - they had seen primeval Chaos , and Love , eldest of the immortals , moving in solitude over the tenantless earth , - then , as a glorious vision , rose up before them the children of heaven in glittering array , immortal in their nature , and irresistible in their power . They had listened to the hymns of the muses , and received from their hands the laurel bough , the token of kindred inspiration ; and they knew that from their lips would proceed , as the responses of an oracle , the religion of their land . In the days of Virgil , Ovid and Horace , nothing remained to be declared respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers , and the statuary , which was brought from Greece , had so established the persons and attributes of the deities in the minds of the people , that description seemed superfluous . It was only when allegory assumed the place of simple faith , as in the celebrated instance of Fame in the A*neid , that there was any occasion for minute or accurate representations of the celestial forms . Another effect of the want of faith in Latin poetry , especially the Eneid , is to render the appearance and interposition of the gods in reality , what it is very properly called , - machinery . It is mere machinery , and in many instances nearly as clumsy as the abortive contrivances of a theatre . In Virgil , it is like the strings and wooden joints with which the // limbs of a puppet are moved . In Homer , it is the natural and spontaneous motion of the muscles , easy , graceful , and strong . But , to the modern student , the most important consequence of this difference in the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romnans , is undoubtedly to be traced in the moral effect of the study , as pursued in the one language or the other . In forming an opinion of the propriety or indecency of any work , the first and most important consideration is the intention of the writer . Was his object a bad one ? Did he intend to excite the passions , to throw a false lustre upon vice , to bewilder the ideas of right and wrong ? Was his mind , in a word , filled with impurity , a source from which no good thoughts could proceed ? it is the spirit , not the letter , which constitutes the objection to a work . Who would think of applying the term indecent to a work upon surgery or natural history ? And , on the contrary , how easy it is to clothe the most revolting ideas in the language of refinement ! Moreover , the mind of the reader must be in a depraved state to discover indelicacy where the thoughts of the writer were unsullied ; - none but the falsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover food for the passions , for instance , in the sculpture of Greece ; and so it is with regard to the descriptions of the gods . It is with such views , that we must examine the Greek and Roman mythology . In the former we shall find , it is true , a few passages which should be sealed up from the student ; but they are very rare , and do not appear to have been dictated by impure minds . In general , the Greek writers are singularly free from the charge of indecency ; - their own thoughts were evidently unsullied ; they never degraded their beautiful theology , by rendering it the exciter of unholy passions ; they never descended from the lofty station they occupied as the interpreters of the gods , to minister at the altars of indecency and wantonness . But the same undefiled spirit is not always discoverable in the poets of Rome . There , poetry was the growth of a dissolute and ribald age . Epicureanism had usurped the place of religion , and had spread its seducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace were professedly its disciples ; - and Ovid , in his voluptuous elegance , must also be ranked with them . From every side arose the sound of // revelry and debauch ; not yet degraded to the vulgar wantonness of Messalina , but warbling in the delicious and ensnaring lays of Horace and Catullus , as , crowned with garlands and redolent of perfumes , they reclined through the live-long day in the shades of the luxurious gardens of M*cenas , or on the banks of the rushing Anio . By such minds as these , the fair religion of Greece was viewed only in its poetic form , and was easily perverted to the channel of their licentious dreams . Wherever , then , the mythology of Greece is found degraded by later writers to the base office of exciting passion , of arraying indecency in the garb of allurement , it is to be set down as unworthy of its origin ; as throwing no light upon the sincere worship of the ancients , and addin0 nothing to the knowledge of the student , except to shew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . To the scholar we would say , then , expurgate your braces and your Ovids , till not an obscene thought shall stain their pages ; and you may be sure that nothing will be lost in your inquiries respecting the classic religion . With these exceptions , much of beauty and grandeur may be discovered in the classic mythology , whether we study it in the Greek or in the Latin language . Nor shall we find much difficulty in distinguishing its most remarkable and interesting characteristics . The first and most important of these is , that it invests matter with mind ; it beholds in the visible world only the embodying of spirit , - the dwelling-place of the unseen and unsubstantial essence of life . In the view of the early Greeks , the world was not merely instinct with life , it was the habitation of divinity . As the human body is the tabernacle of the soul , so they believed the universe around them , the heavenly bodies , the earth and sea , rivers and fountains , trees and flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more etherial nature . But they saw that the frame of man is perishable ; it grows old and dies , and is no longer the habitation of spirit . On the other hand , the elements seem to he eternal ; the world shows no signs of age the rivers flow on in undiminished grandeur through countless ages . The ceaseless rolling of the immeasurable sea , the undimmed lustre of the sun and moon and stars , the everlasting hills , the freshness and glory of returning spring , all spoke to them of eternal duration ; and they believed that the Soul , which had enshrined itself in a home , over which time has no // influence , must likewise be eternal ; it was more enduring and of greater power than the soul of man , which needs its habitation but a span of years , and then consigns it to decay and oblivion ; it was divine in its nature ; it was God . Hence , in their eyes , outward nature was invested with a dignity and grandeur , which rendered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the embodying of the divinity ; their deep arid dark groves , their fountains , the mountain tops , the firmament , the unexplored caverns of the ocean , were consecrated as the permanent habitation of their gods . It was this trait in the classic mythology , which rendered it so highly poetical . With the Greeks , all that belonged to poetry belonged also peculiarly to religion . The same name was applied in their language to the prophet and the bard ; and they hailed the fancies of the poet as revelations from their gods . Hence , as the Grecian bard sang the praises of the immortals , the lively minds of that gifted race welcomed and repeated the beautiful fictions , which added new charms to their religion . In man 's connection with the outward world , they beheld his communion with the gods . Was the fair youth drowned in the dark waters of the sea ? It was the tutelary nymphs who , enamored of his beauty , had carried him down to their blissful abodes , to enjoy with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sorrows of human life . Was the lovely maiden lost to her companions , as she gathered flowers on the fields of Etna ? She was not dead ; she was reigning in awful pomp over the world of shades , by the side of her stately consort , who had braved the hated light of the upper earth to win her . The fires that blazed from the unfathomed crater of the volcano , the planets that glittered in the firmament , the golden clouds , bathed in the effulgence of the setting sun , the winds that wafted perfumes from the balmy south , or rushed in their terrors from the unknown north , the mysterious songs that echoed from the shores of Ausonia , the enchanted fruit that ripened in the garden of the Hesperides , the trees that dropped amber on the banks of the king of rivers , were all intimately connected with this poetic religion , and spoke to man of his dependence on the gods . The effect of thus embodying divinity in the outward world , was to increase very rapidly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; each element was the habitation of a God ; no branch of human industry , no pursuit in which // body or mind was engaged , no portion of the varied universe was without its tutelary deity . The number of gods , worshipped in Greece , is said to have been about thirty thousand ; and they l ) ecame so numerous in Rome , that it was at length found necessary to dispose of them by colonization . This vast number of deities is generally spoken of by writers on mythology , as a disgraceful feature in the religion of Greece and Rome ; as only rendering their idolatry more disgusting ; and as a still wider deviation from the worship of the true God . We are , however , inclined to view it under a more favorable aspect ; it may be regarded as the natural conclusion of a mind , enlightened by no revelation , but discovering the traces of more than mortal power in every object of the universe ; - perceiving new forms , and more wonderful indications of creative spirit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department a peculiar divinity . Could such a mind have extended its research still farther , it would undoubtedly have found in the endless wonders which present themselves , the proofs of a still greater number of deities , and have multiplied the theogony far beyond the point to which it was actually carried . But the question at once arises , to what result would such progress have at length extended ? When and where would it have been arrested ? To this we can only reply , that we believe its tendency was towards the knowledge of the one Infinite and Omnipotent God . To enlightened and reflecting worshippers , the word needed but to be spoken , which could explain the mystery of the universe , and make it plain , that in every portion there was but the same all-pervading nature ; which could reconcile the contradiction of the elements and explain their union ; which , like the key-stone of the universe , was to bind all in perfect and indissoluble order ; - and this word was God . Towards this grand idea , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verging ; it beamed on the soul of Socrates ; it hallowed the thoughts of Plato ; it was not unknown to the vast mind of Cicero . Another remarkable characteristic of the classic religion , was its intimate connection with the concerns of life . It was not peculiarly set apart for certain days and particular rites , and consecrated exclusively to temples and sacred spots . True , it abounded in ceremonies ; it reared to the honor of the gods temples , whose proportions are immortal ; and enshrined within them those matchless forms , which have been the wonder of // all succeeding ages ; it honored certain days of every year with august celebrations ; but it found other shrines as sacred as the altars of the Parthenon ; other rites as holy as the mysteries of Eleusis ; other days as religious as the Saturnalia and the Thesmophoria . The domestic worship of the ancients , especially the Romans , is among the most beautiful portions of their religion , and seems to have been considered of equal importance and sacredness with their public rites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where burned a fire as pure as that over which the victims were immolated , seemed to be the shrine of the domestic affections ; the altars of the Genius of Home . Here , were offered up the vows of conjugal fidelity , of parental love , of filial duty ; here was the last retreat from sorrow and adversity , the innermost citadel of the dearest of man 's possessions . The Penates , who never abandoned the individual over whom they had peculiar charge , who shared with him alike his prosperity and his misfortunes , who retreated with him from his burning and tottering mansion and his ruined city , and , wherever he again established his home , still presided over the new precincts and made them holy ; the bares , who watched over the weary traveller and guarded him from harm ; the Trivi* , who lighted his footsteps ; the Genii , who presided at the happy birth-day , were all of a character to attract the love as well as veneration of their worshippers . But the classic worship extended even farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the occupations , interests and amusements of men , and rendered them acts of religion . For every branch of industry , every recreation , every enterprise , civil or military , there was some peculiar presiding deity , to whom acceptable homage was offered by the very act performed . From the whole land of Greece , then , arose one universal sound of devotion and praise . The laborer worshipped his gods by his toils in the garden and the vineyard ; offerings of praise ascended from all who were engaged in the different vocations of active life ; from the shepherd , and the goatlierd , and the mariner ; from the hunter who followed the moonlight chase over the hills of Bc*otia , the virgins that revelled on the vine-clad steeps of Taygetus , or bathed in the waves of the Sperchius , the bards and the heroes who contended for the prize at Olympia , the warrior who rode triumphant over the // field of carnage , and directed the storm of battle from his blooddripping car . Finally , the classic mythology was characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it acted with almost incalculable power on the national mind , both in Greece and Rome . It distinctly taught the doctrine of immortal life after death ; ofhappiness for the good , and punishment for the wicked . The belief in the soul 's annihilation seems never to have been generally entertained in Greece . Homer speaks of a dim and shadowy existence , which continued after the termination of the present life , though not of a nature to console and cheer by the prospect . Achilles gives a melancholy representation to Ulysses of his existence in the world of shades . But visions of a happier existence seem also to have visited the mind of the great poet . In the fourth book of the Odyssey , where Menelaus relates to Telemachus the splendid prophecy of Proteus respecting himself : , we find a beautiful description of the Elysian fields . Pindar , in his second Olympic , gives a beautiful picture of the habitation of the virtuous after death . - they , Alike by night , alike by day , Behold the glory of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sinewy hands the ground , Not yet upturn the waters of the sea For empty aliment : But in the blessed company Of spirits , by the gods with honor crowned , Men who rejoiced to keep their oaths unshent , Their days through tearless ages run . And they that thrice above , below This earth , with trausmigrating entity Have stood their trial , passing to and fro , And from the unjust society , Have kept their souls aloof and free ; They take the way which Jove did long ordain , To Saturn 's ancient tower beside the deep ; Where gales , that softly breathe , Fresh springing from the bosom of the main , Through islands of the blessed blow . And flowers , like burning gold of hue , // Some on the green earth creep ; Some bourgeon on the splendid trees ; Some in cool nurturing streams their blossoms steep ; The blissful troops , of these , For their twined wrists inwoven bracelets wreathe , And garlands for their brow . " But besides this , there was still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few , seems to have held out hopes and encouragement to all . Those great men who , by their splendid achievements , by the good they had done to their country and to mankind , by their patience under labors , perils and sufferinr , , their piety and obedience to the gods , their incorruptible faith , their justice , their filial reverence , had far distinguished themselves above their fellow-men , were not merely rewarded by a life of peace and pleasure in the Elysian fields , or the islands of the blest ; they were transferred at once to the glorious mansions of Olympus , allied to the immortals , invited to the symposium of Jove , and worshipped by grateful mortals , in whose minds the memory of their benefits was never to fade away . It is worthy of remark , that this apotheosis of their heroes seems to have been more distinctly impressed upon the belief of the Greeks , than the after-existence of the virtuous . Death was to them the greatest ofenemies ; and the hope of a future life does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last moments of terror . The great object , the absorbing wish of the Grecian hero , was to conquer death , to which he believed that his gods were not subject . The religion , which held out to him the hope of allying himself to the immortals , and thus escaping the passage of the dark valley , must be regarded as rising in its attractions and the sublimity of its promises , above anything that paganism had previously offered . But the action of the classic mythology upon the minds of its believers was not less remarkable in the new ideas of power which it disclosed , than in the hopes it held forth . It was distinguished by making known the existence of greater Power , than had before been conceived by any save those who worshipped the true God . it went beyond the elements and revealed their Creator ; it enshrined in the stars a ruling Spirit ; it assigned to the universe a Master ; it spoke to the mind of a superior Intelligence ; and the influence which it thus ex // erted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth a moment 's attention to trace them . The revelation of the knowledge of greater power , of vaster intelligence , in a word , of mind , differing in capacity , not in nature , from the human , is necessarily attended by an increase of capacity in the mind to which this knowledge is conveyed . When the sublime idea of Infinite Power has dawned UI ) Ofl the soul , it increases capacity by awakening thought . It appeals to the deepest and most intense interests of man ; it speaks of his eternal nature , his powers , prospects , hopes and destinies . Such knowledge , also , gives the proper direction to thought , leading it into paths which terminate in the Infinite , and preventing the waste of strength on subjects which are obscured by falsehood , and which can never afford satisfactory results . It directs the mind to all that is immutably true , reveals the everlasting laws of taste , and leads to the study of the intrinsically beautiful . It increases the powers , because it addresses itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eternal principles of the mind , as " deep calls unto deep . " Moreover , the mind is strengthened by the knowledge of infinite power , because in this way the qualities are developed in their just proportions ; every principle of the mind is exercised alike ; and one faculty is not allowed to grow up at the expense of others . The moral powers are thus cultivated equally with the intellectual , reason is elevated , hope is placed on a sure foundation , thought is illumined , all becomes radiant with life and energy , and the soul grows up in immortal proportions , which are to gather new power and loveliness through eternity . But besides this , the knowledge of an infinite power is necessary to reconcile and harmonize the various faculties and propensities of the mind , if it he true that the mystery of the universe around us , the conflicting elements , the varying worlds , the thousand different existences , can only be explained by the knowledge of God , much more is this the case , with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are greater than those in the world around us ; the passions that rage are fiercer than the winds and the waves , the powers stronger than the elements , the hopes and aspirations loftier than the stars . The idea of the Infinite reconciles the jarring elements , shews the object and explains the agreement of the // faculties ; it reveals the soul to itself , satisfies its doubts and apprehensions , and shews the perfection of its nature , in which all the varying powers and apparently contending elements have , in reality , but one common object , and are united in the end in perfect and uninterrupted harmony . Briefly , then , the idea of the Infinite increases the powers , by developing the germ of immortality and infinity , which is wrapped up in the soul , as the sun calls forth the fruit from the tender bud . It speaks with a kindred voice to every faculty of the mind ; it meets with genial power every lofty thought , every high and holy imagining , every aspiration for a better and purer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of mind . Here , " may the heart muse till the fire burn ; " here , ardent hopes will meet with no repulse ; here , visions of greater loveliness than the earth can boast , not transitory and fading like the vain fabric of a dream , but founded in truth and enduring to eternity , thoughts that will never die , rise up in beautiful succession , and respond to the glorious power which summons them . Of this nature , though in a limited degree , was the influence exerted by the classic religion upon the minds of its believers . It established the worship of mind instead of nature , made known to man a vaster intelligence , and directed his worship to objects of a nature in reality superior to his own . Religion , then , began to elevate instead of degrading the mind , as it had done before ; hope was held out as a motive , instead of fear ; morals began to be inculcated , and duties of a higher kind than mere outward ceremonies were taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it had previously existed ; men began to know and to reverence their own souls , to comprehend the power and duration of mind , its triumph over matter , its divine origin . To this influence of the classic religion , we attribute in a great degree the learning , refinement and power of the Grecian nations . It elevated the national intellect , and with superior intelligence came immediately superior power , and a mighty progress in the arts and literature . It was then first made known to the world , that the most precious possessions of a country are its worthy children , the best riches are intelligence , and freedom , the companion of intellectual cultivation . This great lesson was taught in the strains of Homer and the // living marble of Praxiteles ; it was repeated in every revolving Olympiad ; it was illustrated by the countless myriads of Persia , who came like waves of the sea to spend their vain strength at Marathon , and Salamis , and Thermopyhe . The religion of Greece , then , accomplished a mighty work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be retraced , on the way to that degree of knowledge and refinement for which they seem to be destined ; and in some degree put an end to that worship of material existence , which had previously degraded and chained down the mind . In the fulness of time , too , this religion was doomed to fall , because the truth was but partially found in it , and because men were ready for higher and better things . Like the beautiful fairy in the eastern tale , who perished for the want of the vainly sought promegranate seed , the spirit of classic mythology at length passed away ; but not till it had conquered and destroyed the hideous genius of material worship , and restored the deformed soul to its original and lovely proportions . If these remarks are just , they will do something to rescue the study of the classic mythology from the opprobrium that has been cast upon it ; to shew that it may be pursued without corrupting and degrading the mind , and that there are beautiful and interesting features in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be asked , What is the use of studying this mythology ? Why spend our time upon the discarded and forgotten notions of a people who lived , at best , in the glimmering light of paganism , and who can exert no influence upon the present state of society ? To this we reply , in the first place , that it is the key to ancient art ; it explains and renders interesting what would otherwise be incomprehensible and vague as the unknown hieroglyphic . Without the knowledge of the mythology , the collections and remains of Grecian and Roman art would be devoid of meaning , and of comparatively trifling interest ; the beautiful forms of the Apollos and the Venuses , the majestic proportions of the Pantheon , the storied frieze of the Parthenon , would convey no definite idea to the mind ; and those noble halls and galleries , where the traveller gratifies his longing eye , and the artist awakens his genius at the shrine of divinities in whose lineaments the fire of elder inspiration is yet burning ; the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sacred mantle , those frescoed walls on which the Luculli // and the C*esars loved to gaze , the mosaic pavements which graced the halls of Cicero , would speak only insoluhie enigmas . The objects of classic art , which have been preserved , and the fabled religion of Greece and Rome , respond beautifully to each other ; and they should he studied in connexion . The mythology , however , does more than merely satisfy curiosity as to the name and attrihutes which each statue represents ; it reveals to us the spirit of ancient art , shews us the causes which called it into being , the secret of its development , the mystery of its perfections . We have already pointed out that remarkable characteristic of the religion of Greece , by which it universally invests matter with mind , assigning to every object in nature its own in-dwelling deity . But it went beyond this : not content with worshipping through the outward form of the universe , it sought to gaze directly upon the spirit with which matter is inspired , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly exhibited in his works . Hence arose sculpture , the earliest and the latest effort to reveal the divine existence to man ; it assumed , as was to be expected , that form which is superior to all other natures , and fashioning it in ideal beauty , shewed to adoring multitudes the splendid manifestation of celestial being , in the forms of the Jupiter of Phidias , the Venus of Cleomenes , and the Apollo of the Vatican . But of still higher importance , is the connexion of the mythology with classic literature , especially to the American student , for whom access to the highest objects of art is difficult or impossible . This argument in favor of the study of mythology is the one most commonly brought forward ; it is remarked , and with propriety , that much would be unintelligible in the classic writers without this knowledge , - many allusions would be lost , - many passages obscure ,  --  much of the interest diminished . These remarks are undoubtedly just as far as they extend ; but they do not seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The knowledge which they imply may be of a very inferior sort , a mere catalogue of idle names or school-boy tales . We are far from insisting upon a minute knowledge of names and dates in this branch of learning . For the professed scholar , indeed , it is necessary ; but such knowledge should not be a principal object with the student . Were no other light to be thrown upon classic literature by the mythology , than the gossiping information too com // monly given in our schools and those of England , that certain names stand for certain individuals , or places , that Pan means the god of shepherds , Minerva the goddess of wisdom , Arethusa a woman changed into a fountain in Ortygia , and so on to the end of the chapter ; if no deductions are to he drawn from these facts , and mythology does nothing more than announce them , the study of it may perhaps deserve to he ridiculed . But it extends far heyond this ; it does not merely illustrate ancient literature ; it absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its existence . The deep devotion of the early Greek poets , connecting the history of their nation with the worship of the gods , and ennobling their origin by the revelations of their religion , first gave birth to their literature . It was the result of profound faith and ardent devotion ; the picture of a mind , in which patriotism and poetic imagination were beautifully blended , and fixed their stamp indelibly upon the thoughts . To appreciate this literature , it is necessary to assume , as far as possible , the state of mind which dictated it ; to stand in the place of the poet ; to look hack with him upon an ancestral race of heroes and demi-gods , now enshrined in the palace of Olympus ; to behold with his eye the glorious train of the immortals , watching over the concerns of man , and directing the universe ; in short to comprehend the spirit , not merely the outward form of his religion . The different influences , exerted upon literature by the classic religion and by Christianity , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy . The leading characteristic of Greek tragedy , as Schlegel remarks , is the idea of fate upon which it was founded . The notion of fate , as thus illustrated , was of the most dark and awful kind . As understood by the tragedians , fate was consummate and irresistible ; power , swaying alike the gods and mortals ; for man it was the most dreaded of enemies , uncompromising and merciless , propitiated neither by prayers nor sacrifices , accepting no worship , offering no good . It was manifested in the power of the elements , which conquered and destroyed him ; in the majestic rolling on of time , in the misfortunes and sorrows of life , and lastly , in the dreaded event of death . Nor were the gods more exempt from its terrible influences ; their immortality only subjected them the more surely to its power ; in the sufferings it inflicted upon them , they longed for death ; but they longed in vain . Fate , as thus conceived , seems to // have resembled , in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but in all other points the ideas of Fate and Providence are widely at variance . Providence is a power which calls into being , clothes with beauty and develops in perfection . Fate exerted no influence hut to crush , torment and destroy ; it gave birth to no new existence , nor added anything to the beauty of creation ; it found no pleasure in happiness , no sorrow in misery ; dark and mysterious as the night , it was only seen by the lurid glare of the ruin it wrought . Providence exerts a benign action on the mind , calling forth thought and developing moral worth . Fate operated upon the mind only through physical suffering ; it carried on an eternal warfare with the soul , whose indomitable will defied , while it submitted to necessity . Providence confers inward power ; Fate sports with outward weakness ; the former unfolds the immortal principle contained in the soul , and reveals the prospect of eternal life ; the latter encompasses the mind with the dark shadow of death , or terrifies it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as thus viewed , constituted the spirit of Greek tragedy . A power , from which there is no hope of escape arid no appeal , which is superior to the might of the gods themselves , implacable as the storm and inevitable as time , afforded subjects for tragedy in the ordinary pursuits of life ; but still more in the immortal existences , the splendor of whose station only rendered their sorrows more conspicuous and awful . This idea of Fate led to a very remarkable difference between ancient and modern tragedy , in the choice of subjects of suffering . Ancient tragedy sought for its heroes the most exalted , powerful , and even virtuous characters ; it delighted to exhibit the sublime spectacle of an immortal nature , overwhelrned by the power of fate , yet in the midst of calamities and sufferings not to be imagined without horror , bearing up against an eternity of woe , and defying and even insulting the force to which it is compelled to yield . Unlike the awful creation in which the interest of the Paradise Lost is centred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benefactors of mankind ; or if they were stained with crime , it was not the result of their own will , but of the malignant operation of a destiny which they could neither foresee nor avert . Modern tragedy , on the other hand , seems to choose for subjects characters which , however virtuous and attractive , fall short of // the splendid attributes with which the ancient heroes were invested . They have not the same power of endurance and indomitable will ; they yield to sorrow ; they make us weep for their frailty , their tenderness , their misery ; they seek relief from the weight of woe in death ; and the genius of modern tragedy chants over them , as they go down to the tomb , her solemn and heart-melting requiem , far differing from the sublime and triumphant strains which are sounded forth by the unconqiiered and immortal heroes of the Grecian drama . In general , the characters to which the interest of Shakspeare 's tragedy principally belongs , are not of the highest intellectual or moral power . Goethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to many of the other characters . In his fine critique upon this play , he remarks , " To me it is clear that Shakspeare meant , in the present case , to represent the effects of a great action laid upon a soul unfit for the performance of it . In this view , the whole piece seems to me to be composed . There is an oak planted in a costly jar , which should have borne only flowers in its bosom ; the roots expand , the jar is shivered . A lovely , pure , and most moral nature , without the strength of nerve which forms a hero , sinks beneath a burden which it can not hear , and must not cast away . All duties are holy for him , the present is too hard . Impossibilities are required of him , not in themselves impossibilities , but such for him . He winds and torments himself ; he advances and recoils ; is ever put in mind , ever puts himself in mind ; at last , does all but lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his peace of mind . " * there is a yielding to misfortune , a feebleness , which equally seems to mark the characters of Lear , Romeo , Othello and Macbeth . The character in Shakspeare , which appears in some points to approach nearest to the subjects of ancient drama , is Lady Macbeth . In the power of her mind , in the boldness and decision with which she plans and executes crime , in her scorn for weakness , her freedom from fear and remorse , she may well he compared with the Medea of Euripides . Still , there are vast differences between the two . Lady Macbeth is absorbed by one ruling passion ; the love of power , the burning desire to reign . In the horrors of the chamber of murder , at the awful feast where the dead mingle with the living in their revels , in the haunted // sleep-walk , she still clings to the blood-stained diadem with which crime has encircled her brow . There is no tragedy for her ; her march is triumphant to the throne ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind still victorious over remorse . She is to be regarded as the source rather than the object of tragedy ; she seems in a degree to supply the place of fate ; through her influence Macbeth is urged on as by the impulse of destiny to the commission of crime ; her power sustains , nerves and encourages him , and opens the path of ambition through torrents of blood . The veil is drawn over her fall ; to witness it would add nothing to the interest of the drama ; she retires when her task is finished , and the victim of her power and her crimes gathers into himself the depth of tragedy , which marks the close of the piece . Like Lady Macbeth , Medea is endowed with uncommon powers of mind , boldness in crime and remorselessness of conscience ; like her , she is absorbed by one ruling passion , her love for Jason . But the tragedy of the piece consists in the misery and despair with which she is surrounded . She has severed , one by one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An outraged parent , a murdered brother , a home abandoned and left desolate , monarchs insulted and destroyed , are the sacrifices offered on the altar of her fidelity and affection for one to whom she clings as her last , solitary hope . There seems no farther retreat for her ; one green spot alone remains in the wilderness her crimes have created around her ; if the storm sweep over it , she is lost . The extreme misfortune , the uttermost extent of woe , is now impending ; the play represents her at the moment when Jason , forgetting all that she has accomplished and all that she has sacrificed , is about to repudiate her and espouse another woman . We follow her with a dreadful interest through the ravings of despair , the conception of new and more daring crime , the struggles and agony of a mother 's tenderness , contending with the pride , and hatred , and revenge of an immortal ; and when , triumphant over herself and almost over fate , she disappears at last with the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has lighted a fire in her bosom which will burn and torture her forever . Such is the power of ancient tragedy , manifested in the voice of wailing , mingled with pride and scorn , which comes from the rock of Prometheus ; in the depth and intensity of hatred and // despair in Electra ; in the involuntary crimes of tEdipus , and the awful revenge of Orestes . The cause of this difference between the subjects of ancient and those of modern tragedy is obvious ; it consists in the belief of the omnipotence and the benevolent character of the deity , which has taken the place of the dark visions of fate that terrified the ancients . Their supreme power was malignant , inexorable , hostile to man . The Christian beholds in Omnipotence goodness , equal to its power ; the one depresses and renders desperate ; the other sustains , encourages , makes triumphant ; the former was the source of tragedy ; the latter conquers woe . For the Christian , there is a power which upholds and consoles in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robs death of his sting , and the grave of its victory . The great mind , which is fortified by this power , is beyond the reach of tragedy ; in the midst of the trials and sadness of a mortal career , there is still open beyond it a blissful existence , a light shining from heaven , which sheds its lustre upon the vale of tears , and cheers the heavy-laden way-farer to his eternal home . Lastly , the classic mythology is worthy of attention , as making known to us our own nature . This we deem the highest object of study , and the one which all efforts of learning ought to keep constantly in view . The erudition of editors and commentators , the researches of the antiquarian , the lore of the university and the , monastery are wasted , except inasmuch as they tend , directly or indirectly , to promote this great object . The literature that does not contribute to this end is of little value , and soon perishes . Poetry must shew forth the nature of man by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by proceeding from its depths , by reflecting as a mirror the human soul , or it will not he enduring . The same may be said of history . He who supposes that the importance of this branch of learning consists in the precedents it affords , in the amount of experience , the wisdom of ages which it sums up , errs greatly . The history of one age can be no guide to the statesman of another , except as far as it makes him acquainted with human nature , reveals to him the secret springs of action , and shews the influences by which man may be acted on singly , or in masses . Its true object is to portray an eternal nature , by representing its operations . But nothing shews forth the soul with such undisguised clearness and fidelity as // religion , the embodying of the profoundest thought , the most ardent and devout aspirations , the most far-reaching hopes . Whether religion be revealed from God , or the result only of a mind speculating upon itself and the universe around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the thoughts which previously existed , and unfolds the germs which are innate in the soul . In this way alone can it find any response ; were religion to speak to us of attributes and qualities of which we are not conscious , it would gain no credence , but would be a dead letter , powerless and transitory . All religion , which is sincerely believed , which is enshrined in the heart , is in the likeness of the mind ; and it reveals our nature more than anything else , because it embraces the whole circle of our faculties , and calls them forth in their just proportions ; because it is the most solemn and unfeigned outpouring of the heart . Hence , one of the first inquiries respecting newly discovered tribes or nations , is with regard to their religion ; and from the answer , we draw more certain deductions with respect to their intellectual and moral qualities , and their general character , than from any other facts concerning them . If we could become intimately acquainted with the religion of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the variety , power and beauty of the mind , than we do at present . But there is much of which history takes no note ; - many of the deepest and most sacred attributes of man . The religion of the different ages and nations ascends in sublime concert from every portion of the habitable world ; from the banks of the sacred Ganges , the mysterious haunts of Memphis , the olive groves of Attica , the blood-stained halls of the worshippers of Odin , the gorgeous temples of Mexico , the pleasant hunting-grounds of the Delaware , over which the benign spirit of the south breathes a second and lovelier summer . Millions of high and noble minds , unknown to observation , and seen only by the Author of their being , have blended their ardent devotion in the solemn anthem of the nations . Their longing desires , their deep-seated hopes , the offerings of gratitude , the faith of the mother weeping over the tomb of her children , yet believing that her treasures are laid up in heaven , the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave can not sever , may have passed without notice on the earth ; - but there is a history whose records are written in heaven , and whose living page , blotted perhaps with the tears // of the recording angel , is unrolled before the throne of the Almighty . It is the history of man as a religious being ; the history of the soul ; of its errors in the darkness of paganism ; its efforts to burst into futurity ; the fair creations which it summoned up , lighted by the fires of imagination , yet ever varying and fading like the glories of a sunset sky ; its long wanderings , when , roaming dove-like over the encompassing deluge , it found nought but the olive branch of hope , and finally the rapture with which it welcomed the tidings of Revelation . In this momentous history , the religion of Greece and Rome occupies no small nor insignificant place . It shews the utmost verge which man , unaided by light from heaven , can reach ; the native dignity , and grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force with which , like the p*rimeval race of Titans , it strove to mount to Olympus ; the sublime resignation with which it awaited the coming of the last great foe . Happily for the scholar , happily for all who would be versed in the lore of the soul , this eventful portion of the spiritual history of man has been embodied in a literature , which is destined to endure till human nature itself shall be changed.
