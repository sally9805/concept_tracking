txt EVERY event in human life has its moral . This is true equally of the affairs of nations as of individuals ; and in the former it acquires a grandeur and solemnity of character proportionate to the magnitude of its scale of operation , and the myriads of individual interests affected by it . To analyse and illustrate this moral , for the instruction of the present from the experience of the past , is the true object of history . What , then , is the moral of the terrible crisis which has just convulsed the country ? Of what national sin is it the consequence and punishment ? - of what departure from those true principles of political morals on which all national happiness and prosperity must depend ? That such ust be the origin of such a result as we have witnessed within the present eventful year , none can doubt . The great moral law , that suffering is the invariable fruit of the seed planted by sin , is of universal truth . This question , then , becomes one of essential importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and ponder earnestly . On such occasions as the present , every member of the commu nity is but too apt to lose sight of general considerations , in contemplating the consequences of the little portion of the evil that affects his own private concerns . Engrossed each in his own individual pursuits , we but rarely see the bearings of a mighty question of this nature rightly estimated by the public , by either friend or foe , at least until years have restored peace to the tempest of passions and opinions , and permitted the calm voice of reason and truth to be heard once more . It is particularly to be regretted that this is so generally the ease with our journalists . It is but seldom , indeed , that we find these sentinels of the press true to the higher duties of their vocation . All their energies and thoughts are devoted solely to the party struggle in which they are incessantly engaged . This is never allowed to relax in vigor or bitterness ; argument and illustration are exhausted for attack or defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great questions are rarely at all , or at best but feebly , regarded in the strife , in comparison with the superficial considerations supplied by apparent expediency or narrow party interests . How seldom do we ascend to original truth for the solution of practical difficulty , or fairly attempt to educe the great political moral with which every public question is pregnant , from the calamities or distresses which , even in their most embarrassing forms , never fail to assert the immortality of principle , the undeviating excellence of right and // truth . And yet it is precisely such times that afford the surest test of political principle , and of the truth or error , the essential goodness or evil , of particular doctrines , upon which difference of opinion may exist among us . The enemies of the democratic cause have not failed to profit by the present calamitous period , to renew the assaults on the democratic Administration which has been at the head of affairs during the last eight or nine years , which had almost seemed to have exhausted their fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy complication of evils which has fallen , with combined action , within the present year , upon the country . We are told to look at the prostrate credit , bankrupt commerce , stagnated business , and worthless currency , which we have seen around us , for the legitimate fruits of those doctrines so triumphantly sustained by the popular majority , in the late Administration , and so strongly asserted by the present . The acerbity of party feeling has invaded the recesses of private life farther than it had ever proceeded before ; lips unused to curse ' have learned to join in execration of men and measures , which ignorance has been taught to believe have brought wanton ruin on all held most dear . It has been , indeed , a fearful tempest through which the vessel of the Administration has had to ride ; nothing could have availed to save it from its howling fury , hut its sheet-anchors of honesty and truth to the principles of democracy . These have , however , sufficed , and will ever continue to suffice , to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , and has begun rapidly to abate ; the clouds are breaking up the heavy pall which for a time seemed to enshroud the whole heavens in a portentous darkness , and their black masses are already beginning to roll away ; the atmosphere has been purified of the evil elements with which it had gradually become surcharged ; the hour of peril has tried men 's souls ; and the vessel of state is now not only safe from actual danger , but has a fairer prospect extending indefinitely before it than ever before . The history of the great financial revolution now in progress , and not far from its consummation , will make one of the most remarkable chapters in the annals of free institutions yet known to the world . It affords a very striking instance of the self-rectifying power of a free system of government , under whatever accumulation of evil influences may have been permitted , by long incaution or error of opinion on the part of the mass of the people , to overgrow the social body . It contains a most instructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only pernicious to the society , but in the very act , also , happily selfdestructive to themselves . It is not necessary to go back to a history of the late catastrophe and its causes . It is written in general terms , with a pencil of light , in // the admirable Executive state paper communicated by the President to Congress , and doubtless familiar to every reader of these pages . There can be no doubt that the almost universal public opinion has now fully settled down upon the main ideas of its historical view of the subject , w *atever party difi'eren *es of opinion may exist as to the causes of causes , or as to the future course rendered proper by their existing results . A general over-action , over-borrowing and over-lending , over-buying and over-selling , over-speculating and over-spending , over-importing and relative under-producing and exporting-all growing out of the common parent of evil-overbanking , contain the sum and substance of the cause of the late convulsion . That the whole accumulated and varied evil is the natural fruit of the banking system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadowed the whole land , is virtually admitted by all parties . The admission is made in the fullest terms by the advo ' - cates of a National Bank , when they insist upon a powerful institution of that character , as the only means of regulating the inherent propensity to evil of the system , forgetful not only that the difference between them is one only of size and power , and not of nature ; but also of the fact that a bank of that description has been in active operation throughout the whole period , and has not only shared the common fate of the rest , and exhibited the same tendencies and the same results , but in a more signal manner and degree than the generality of the smaller institutions . The peculiar friends of the State Bank system make the same admission , when , while contending that it has not failed , ' and proposing to renew the now selfdissolved connection between it and the Government , they admit the necessity of a reform , which they idly imagine is to be effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of banks in which its revenue ( hereafter to be within the limits of its economical exirenses , ) is to be deposited . This banking system , which has proved the one main source of the disease with which our social body has been afflicted , has been based ,  --  as not one of its most devoted advocates can pretend to deny ,  --  on principles directly at variance with the fundamental ideas of our democracy and our whole theory of political morals  --  and its evil results , if they should be an instructive warning , ought not to be a subject of surprise . To have indulged in it in the manner in which we have permitted ourselves to do , was in itself a great national sin and folly which could not but bring with it its own eventual chastisement . Its two leading ideas have been false and anti-democratic  --  the one a violation of the great principle of equality of rights , by conferring exclusive privileges , involving all the essential viciousness of monopoly , on a favored and fortunate few , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vastly dispro // portionate profit from their actual capital ; the other , the assumption by our governments , Federal and State , of the function of regulating the whole business concerns of the community , by all this artificial banking legislation , instead of trusting to the intelligence and common sense of the people , and the natural healthy action of the free trade principle , with its counterpoising forces of voluntary association and competition . This has been a great national error , and we have suffered and are suffering its nwet penalty *we have sown the wind and have reaped the whirlwind . However , the consolation remains , that adversity has still its precious jewel in its head ; ' and if we are paying dearly for our experience of the true principles of government , the knowledge will prove eventually well worth its price . The height to which the supremacy of this great banking interest had grown throughout the country , is not easy to be fully appreciated . The acquiescence in it was almost universal ; and in our cities particularly , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as broad and deep a basis as the strength of the eternal hills . It claimed the merit of all the prosperity of the country . The press appeared but the creature of its pleasure ; and few individuals indeed , connected in any way with mercantile business , would ever dream of hazarding the temerity of questioning its claims to public gratitude , or its vested rights to a perpetuity of its profitable privileges . If any one was so rash and so reckless of prudential considerations as to give public utterance to such treasonable sentiments of b*ze-rnajest6 , wo to him ! Even though his name should be one which , before , every lip had delighted to honor as his country 's pride and boast ,  --  though he might be entitled to the privilege of that sacred few on whom all nations unite in invoking blessings and eternal praise , ' as the first poet of his country , and in the first rank of those of his age ,  --  and though he might be known to be in private life all that is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if guilty of this unpardonable sin ! ' He would be persecuted with a tempest of scorn and odium , and assailed with the rudest violence of denunciation , as a pest and common nuisance to society , against which nothing , indeed , but the highest and noblest principles could enable such an one to bear up . This spectacle we have seen ; and we have seen , too , that colossal power , which was able to exert this stupendous social tyranny over the freedom of opinion and discussion , prostrated , by its own weight , to the earth . There is a grand moral in that spectacle ; and it has been embodied by the distinguished poet referred to himself , whose muse has never sung under a nobler inspiration than that of the cause of democratic truth , in a lyric ( which may be found on an early page of our present Number ) worthy equally of that cause and of his own fame . // The credit system ' had gradually expanded and diffused itself , so as to swallow up the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being confined to its natural and proper sphere , of filling up the interval necessarily existing between the inception of legitimate enterprise and the realization of its returns , it gradually extended to all the minor concerns of life , so as even to include the daily consumption of personal necessaries . The most minute retail , as well as the most enormous wholesale business , was based to a great extent on credit principles . From the largest importer or manufacturer down to the pettiest tradesman and his humblest customer , all equally , in their respective degrees , bought and sold , produced and consumed , ate , drank , and wore , on credit ,  --  that is to say , on anticipation . This morbidly overgrown system , teeming with the worst influences of moral evil , thus ramified out to myriads of minutest fibres , received its perpetual sustenance and stimulus from the banks . The entire business community  --  and there are but few of our citizens who do not fall within that designationbecame thus dependent , as it were , for its life-blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of applicants for , and dispensers of , accommodation , ' - of the means of conducting their daily business to earn their daily bread . " Favors " is the word grown into universal use , both by the dealer who petitions , and the director who grants . It has well , indeed , been said that words are things . The new words which , from time to time , grow up , afford the truest indices of the growth of new ideas and usages ; and when it is remembered that the " favor " referred to is that of being permitted to pay an interest of six or seven per cent. , at intervals of two or three months , for the difference between the artificial credit of a special legislative charter and the natural sound credit , well secured and endorsed , of private enterprise and industry , that single word ought to have sufficed ere now to arouse the independence of every free Americaii citizen , to demand a reform of a system which thus places him , and the whole business community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals who direct it and reap its profits . The chartered advantages , and artificial public character , attaching to these institutions , secure to them virtually the monopoly of the business of money-lending ; as it is only in periods of pressure ( the periodical effect of the natural fluctuations of the system ) that private capital , not embarked in the institutions themselves , is attracted to take part in it by the hope of usurious profit  --  and then only through the pernicious agency of the broker . And when , in addition to this perpetual dependence of all the commercial interests of the country upon the system , we take into consideration the social influence of the countless hosts of persons of the highest respectability , wealth , and education , connected with it , as officers , directors , stockholders , // brokers , attorneys , &amp;c. , spread over the entire surface of the country , and occupying nearly all the seats of legislation , we shall not feel surprise at the stupendous supremacy which it has been able to acquire over the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . To comprehend fully the vast amount of social evil which has flowed from this copious and perennial source , would be an attempt far beyond the grasp of the most vie , orous intellect , or the most daring imagination . When we attempt to trace it out by its main channels , we soon be ome lost amidst the innumerable minor streams which spread out in every direction throughout the whole system of society . As illustrative , however , of the great wtor I that we have in view ,  --  namely , of the consequences of a first departure from the original principles of democracy and political economy ,  --  .. it will not be improper to present a brief general outline of a few of its principal branches . The most obvious evil inherent in the system is its irrepressible tendency to fluctuation . The paper issued by the banks forms substantially the entire currency of the country . So long as they retain that pseudo-public character conferred by the artificial form of a legislative charter of monopoly , and so long as their paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , by the example of the public authorities , Federal and State , conducting all th ir fiscal operations through them , so long will it prove Impossible to infuse any considerable proportion of the metals into actual circulation . They may be introduced into the country , but if all the streams and rivulets of circulation are filled with this universally recognised paper medium , it will be impossible to keep them there , to aiy useful purpose ; and the portion actually kept will add but a fresh stimulus to the evil designed to be remedied , by passing into bank vaults to serve , not as a strengthening support to the paper issues already out , but as the basis of still further expansion . This is not theory , but history . To regulate the winds of the air , or the waves of the sea , would not be a less hopeless attempt than to undertake to regulate the inherent tendency of a paper currency to fluctuation . From its very nature , it must always be impossible . The utmost that legislation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis and the paper superstruc .. ture . Yet what is to prevent the proportionate expansion of both , the profit of interest on the two issued being always twice as great as the loss of interest on the one retained in the form of specie in the vault ? The absolute limit of issues which will furnish the exact amount of circulating medium required by the legitimate business wants of the community , no legislation can fix ; for no human intelligence can precisely determine it ; and it can only be attained by leaving the business of the country to be a law unto itself , on VOL . I. NO . I. // the pure free trade system . The restriction of small notes could afford only a mitigation of the evil ; and , to be effectual , would require the co-operation of all the State Legislatures , which is not to be expected for axi indefinite number of years ; and certainly the action of the General Government , upon the small number of depositories which could be influenced by the probable future amount of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We repeat , then , that , to regulate the inherent tendency of the system to fluctuation , is impossible ; and how incalculable are the evils growing out of such a tendency ! Elasticity , claimed as a merit of paper money , is the worst possible attribute of a currency . That natural tendency to slight fluctuations inherent to the soundest business ( as it is swayed moderately to and fro by the correlative laws of demand and supply , ) which ought to find in a stable and uniform currency of intrinsic value , its proper regulation , receives , instead of a check , a constant stimulus , from such an elastic currency . Instead of restraining the first morbid tendency to overaction , such a currency co-operates with it , and impels it on . Those who use , and those who create to lend it , have a common interest in this co-operation together . And so they proceed , th&amp;commercial overaction and the expansion of the currency , pan passu , with a mutual action and reaction upon each other , unsuspicious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least hoping and intending to stop in time , and to return to the more regular road of plodding industry before they shall reach the extreme verge-until it becomes too late to retrace their steps with safety - facilis descensus Averni* Sad revocare gradurn , superasque evadere ad auras , Hic labor , hoc opus est . In this case the banking system is , emphatically , Number One , the commercial community Number Two . The former can and does save itself at the expense of the latter-its dupe , its slave , its victim . On the first symptom of danger the curtailment cornrnences , under the law of necessity and the impulse of fear . Its rapidity is in inverse ratio to that of the expansion . The entire consequence of the mutual delusion and overaction falls on the community . There is an immense amount of floating debt in existence , due , not only to the banks , but mutually throughout the community , as well as to foreign countries . Under the pressure of this burthen it is , that it writhes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , within the brief period of our national experience . And yet the merchant , still depending helplessly on the bank , neither thinks nor dares to murmur against its ascendency over the business of the community ; but as soon as he has struggled , with painful distress and loss , through the convulsion , instead of attempting to reform its vicious organization , and relieve credit from the // unnatural fetters with which an unwise legislation has hampered it , he returns to his false gods no wiser than before , to bask again in the sun-shine of their tempting favors ; ' and repeats the same career again to the same result , within the cycle of the next six or seven years . In all this operation the banks and their directors are not to blame ; they are as much sinned against as sinning-they are the tempted as well as the tempters . They act first under the pressure of a strong impulse received from the community , and next under the compulsion of necessity . The whole evil proceeds from the necessary operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the mistake committed by legislation , when it would undertake to regulate that which ought to be left to its own self-regulation by its own natural laws  --  a mistake , the consequences of which are analogous to those which would ensue from a similar attempt to manage and regulate the elements and the seasons . In such cases , when the evil has not proceeded to an extreme point , it may eventually right itself after a crisis , more or less protracted , of severe pressure , by the remedy of a sufficient quantity of runi and bankruptcy to tarry off the surplus amount of debt , contracted in the expanded currency , over the ability to pay in the same currency after the collapse . But when various powerful influences may chance to combine , to impel it to that extremity at which the banks themselves are compelled to acknowledge their inability to continue specie payments , the relation of dependence subsisting between the community and them makes it indispensable for the legislature to interpose for the general relief ,  --  as evil always entails evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general relaxation by law of the penalties of contracts , at the very moment that they are justly incurred ; legislation goes backward and stultifies and nullifies itself ; and a self-confessed spurious currency is publicly legitimated . The spectacle is not only witnessed , but , from the imperative necessity of the case , taken as It actually exists , must be reluctantly sanctioned and approved , though it ought to be accompanied with a determination to reform , radically , a system whose essential viciousness is more completely demonstrated by this practical reductio ad absurdum , than could be done by the most elaborate argument . It is impossible to conceive even a faint idea of the vast and varied injury to society , growing out of this attribute of our currency-its fluctuating elasticity . The whole business of the community becomes infested with a gambling character . The basis of all contracts and plans is perpetually shifting , in a manner precisely analogous to corresponding variations of all weights and measures in use . That which is equitable to-day is unfair and oppressive six months hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe principles of business* Industry is no longer sure of its fair reward . The goddess of chance is the presiding spirit over the whole scene of confusion . The spirit of speculation pervades the entire commu ity ; and , whatever objects it may specially select for its gratification , runs riot to the most pernicious excesses . It is in its moral effect that the injury is deepest and deadliest . Though society may suffer hea y actual loss , from the diversion of jt5 industry and energies from the dull pursuits of producing labor ? this is comparatively insignificant . But the moral injury is fearful . The heart of the nation is corrupted , and its best principles , from which alone a sound prosperity and happiness can proceed , depraved . An effect is produced analogous to that on the character of the gambler . The curse of avarice enters and demoralizes it ; and deadening every good sentiment of justice , virtue , high-mindedness , benevolence , frugality-gives birth to a sordid selfishness , a thirst after wealth as the supreme good , a restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanctity of promises , an indiffer. * ence to debt , a fondness for display and luxury . How far these fearful symptoms of that worst of all possible evils , national demoralization , have been manifested among us , all may judge for themselves . This is often pointed to by foreigners as a damning evidence against the practical superiority of our institutions , in their influence on national character ; and so long as we leave this evil and its source unreformed , *o long do * e remain faithless to the cause of democracy and humanity , committed to us as a nation . It is on the laboring and producing mass of the nation that the evils of a fluctuating currency fall most heavily . They , after all , must pay the whole tax raised by the system on the industry of the country . They must pay all its profits , and all the enormous expendi* ture of its apparatus of salaries , buildings , &amp;c . Experience ha* proved that at least an average proportion of a third of these institutions fail ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of counterfeits and accidental destruction , falls mainly on them . The saying is full of sad truth , that the perpetual tendency of the system is to make " the rich richer , and the poor poorer . " It grinds the face of the poor , depresses their energies , dishearten* their spirits , embitters their life , vitiates their social habits , and impairs the important sense of the equal dignity of human nature . It is universally admitted that , in the fluctuations of currency , the wages of labor are the last to feel the influence of a general expansion and rise of prices , as they feel it the least ; while they feel , the most severely , the first influence of the contraction . rVhe general irregularity of business is a heavy drawback on their well-being , disturbing the only means , of steadiness and slow uniformity in industry and frugality , by which , as a mass , their condition can be elevated // and improved . The sufferings to these classes of society , by every reaction attendant upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abandonment of great enterprises , together with the moral evil consequences ensuing , are too stupendous for calculation . The incidental evils of legisL ti *e corruption and lobby intrigue . with the consequent impaired public confidence  --  the injurious effect exerted on the purity of politics , by mixing up pecuniary interests , as connected with bank charters , extensions of capital , &amp;c. , with the contests of parties , which ought to be confined to priaciples-* -- the system of stocks and stock-jobbing , growing out of it-the benches of the money-changers , ' and the public gambling-tables of Boards of Brokers-its perpetual aris ocratic influence , through the facilities afforded to wealth , to multiply itself ( necessarily at the expense of the producing mass ) at a more rapid rate than in a fair and natural proportion to the national accumulation , and by its corresponding depressing influence on the poor man , by the sweat of whose brow the rich man 's field is thus fertilized , '  --  the generation of a mutual sentiment of distrust and ill-will between those classes , which is equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the artificial advantages and distinctions created between them by this system of legislation  --  the anti-democratic tendency of such legislation , implying a right , on the part of a small proportion of the community , to special monopoly privileges , as alone possessing the intelligence requisite to manage the general financial business of the society , and as implying a distrust of the principles of freedom applied to practice , and of the common sense of the mass of the people-these , and other comparatively minor evils that might be enumerated , we pass lightly over , enous*h having been said to illus rate the idea that we wished to convex- , of the moral of the late crisis , namely , that all its sufferings , and all the manifold social evil which has proceeded from the banking system of this country , have been the legitimate coasequence , and the just penalty , of our departure from the true principles of democratic equality of rights and freedo of trade , in the adoption of the system . An errQneous idea appears to be very prevalent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , that to the stimulus afforded by this system is to be mainly ascribed the astonishing developement of physical energy and resources that we have exhibited within the last half century . It is , on the contrary , a most remarkable evidence of the benefits of free institutions , and of the intelligence and energy of our people , that we have made such progress in spite of the burthens and obstacles , and periodical convulsions , attendant upon this system . If credit-which can not but be the animating principle of the business of a free , intelligent , // and industrious people-has been able to achieve such results , notwithstanding the unnatural fetters with which it has been clogged , and its free , healthful action distorted and diseased , what may not be expected from it when given fair play a d scope , without these disadvantages ! One single fact will be sufficient to show that , while it he s been made to do much that it ought not to have done , it has left undone much that it ought to have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system in banking works with admirable success , the practice exists ( growing out of the principle of competition ) of giving liberal credits to honesty and industry , by permitting young men , mechanics and small dealers , setting out in business , with no other capital than their characters , to open credits with the banks , on which they are empowered to draw within specified limits , depositinb the receipts of their own business in the banks , on which an interest is allowed , differing but one per cent . from that which they pay for their loans from the bank ; and this is practised not as a matter of favor and patronage , but of mutual interest . The beneficial influence of such a practice on the condition of the poorer classes of *ociety , in the encouragement of integrity , industry , and fair enterprise , is obvious . In our boasted credit system , ' this species of sound , natural , popular credit , which would be a certain effect of the reform now desired by a large proportion of the democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever likely to be , dreamed of . The position assumed by the Administration in relation to this subject is , *t last , a return to that from which the General Govern . ment ought never to have departed . Relatively to the two parties at issue upon it in the respective States , it is the position of neutrality best becoming it . We desire to see the eniancipation of credit arried into effect throughout the States , by the easy expedient of general incorporation laws ( framed with proper caution , ) with a due respect for every existing vested right-as being the only policy consistent with the true theory of democracy . The relative advantages of paper and specie currencies , as adapted to our national character and business , present a problem hitherto never fairly tested , and on which honest difference of opinion may fairly exist . This problem society , if left to itself , will speedily solve ; and will determine , with an unerring instinct , the proper proportions and mode in which they should be combined , so as to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible security , convenience , and cheapness . But yet this is a reform which it is no part of the intended functions of the General Government to meddle with . It is a subject beyond its legitimate constitutional sphere . It was not created to manage , by its legislation , the currency of the country , nor to regulate and control the moneyed institutions that the sovereign States may see fit to create . This // would be the worst species of consolidation ; and the preference of this policy over that of neutrality , on the part of the General Government , and over its return to the simple , self-sufficing action designed by the Constitution ought to rally th whole State-Rights party ( substantially , if not perfectly , identical with the great democratic party ) to oppose it . Strict and honest principl is the best expediency . The continuance , even , of a local evil , is to be preferred to its reform by the agency of the General Government ; the injury of the precedent of the extension of its action beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reater than the temporary practical benefit that may accrue from it in a particular case . The argument in favor of continuing the mutually pernicious connection between it and the banking system , drawn from the consideration of the beneficial control it may exert on the currency of the States , is , therefore , a false one , and operates as an additional motive to urge their divorce . This reform is to be eff3cted , if at all , by the States ; and by them must be accomplished gradually and gently , but firmly , and with a distinct view of the object to be attained . The Federal Goverw *ient will hereafter stand aloof from this contest , pursuing the even tenor of its way in the plain path of its constitutional duty . It will no longer throw the weight of its authority , and the influence of its financial action , in the scale of the one side or the other , as it has heretofore done . Conducting its own operations through the one safe medium contemplated for it by the framers of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common measure of value , and a perpetual example and standard , below which it will be the care of the States never to permit their local money to depreciate , it will leave to the people to determine for themselves , through the proper organs of the State sovereignties , the kind of currency they may respectively prefer . There is a party desirous of the emancipation of the negro race in the portion of the Union in which it is held in slavery : there is also a party desirous of the emancipation of credit from the unnatural and oppressive fetters with which a false system of legislation has encumbered it . Without designing to institute a comparison between the two , the duty of the General Government , of non-intervention , dictated by the State-Rights principle , is equally clear and imperative in both cases . This is the position which the Administration has assumed . That it will be triumphantly sustained in it by the democracy of the country , can not admit of a shadow of doubt . The voice of dissent which an over-cautious timidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of its friends , however worthy and respectable , can not but be drowned in the universal acclamation of applause from the great mass of the people . We have had enough of agitation and derangement from the connection of Bank and State , between great // political and pecuniary interests . The country is tired of the spectacle of its moneyed institutions mingling in the excitement , turmoil , and danger of the party struggles to which their presence lends a tenfold fury and acharnement . It never again wishes to see the Federal Government in the field either with or against a national bank , with or against a still more powerful State Bank interest . A total disconnection of interests both of which need peace and tranquillity as their greatest good , and which must ba kept in a perpetual state of discord and confusion by their unionnever again to be quietly assented to-remains the only sound and safe policy , against which no objection ought to , nor can effectually , be raised from any quarter . We have been passing through a revolution-one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society with a far deeper agitation and agony than any mere physical contest between hostile armies . We are now approaching its close , at least as far as the action of the Federal Government was involved in it .. The reform , long hoped for and long despaired of , of it separation from the artificial money interests of banks , and its return to the constitutional simplicity and purity of its design , is soon about to be consummated . It has been another war of independence ; and its equal duration , in point of time , is not its only feature of analogy with that by which our political independence of foreign power wa first achieved . The sufferings of such revolutions are but a cheap price for their results ; and the day is not far distant when the American people will look back to the long agony of which this year has witnessed the crisis , with a feeling of gratulation analogous to that with which it now hears from history the story of the manifold and intense hardships by which its ancestors originally earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church and State ; or of those sufferings , not less severe , nor less nobly endured , by which its present political independence as a nation was secured . The President 's message has been well styled , on the floor of the Senate , another Declaration of Independence . ' Eulogy of it ability , manliness , and force , equally of argument and style , would be superfluous , as they were at once , with a spontaneous unanimity almost without a precedent , acknowledged immediately on its reception by friend and foe . Its true and pure democratic character is , however , its finest feature . It is entitled to challenge compariso.n , as a great state paper , with any that has ever issued from the Federal Executive . It embodies , as fully as fearlessly , the true theory of the American democracy , and applies its principles to the subject under consideration ( the fiscal concerns of the General Government ) with a clearness and power which can not fail to carry with it the sympathy and conviction of the great mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very rerna rkable . A heavy gloom hung over the democratic party . All its energies seemed neutralized by division . Fear brooded over the present , and darkness and uncertainty appeared to enwrap the future . The democratic party found itself in a very peculiar position . The formidable character of the struggle with the Bank of the United States had made a virtual alliance - ith the State Bank power Indispensable to that success on which depended the vital interests of the democratic en ' se for ages . Probably but a limited number of individuals appreciated fully the nature and necessary ultimate tendency of the principles involved in that struggle to dissolve the connection between the Government and a national bank . Great principles often act on society like those hidden natural c* ergies which lurk within the bosom of the earth , unfelt and unsuspected , till , at their own time , they break forth from the surface , and reveal themselves to men only in their results . The leading principles of democracy on the part of the late admini , tration which prompted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the democratic mass of the people which secured its sympathy and support to that odministration , could not be arrested by any human power , in their mission of reform , short of the entire separation of the state from all banking interests . The State Bank systeb was but a period of transition , though but fex ' , comparatively , rightly understood it as such . The alliance between it and the democratic principle was nevar a very cordial one . It was the lesser of two kindred evils , and its aid was necessary to destroy the greater . Yet , forgetful that the antipathy to monopoly , and to all violation of the principles of equality of rights and freedom of trade , essential to democracy , constituted the main animating impulse that originated and carried through that great struggle , this lesser evil fondly imagined that it had purchased a privileged perpetuity of existence by the part it had borne in the battle and the victory . But it received its death wound in the strife itself ; , or rather it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the golden weight of the reward of its treachery to its own natural cause . The State Bank system co-operated with the democratic principle against the National Bank , serving as a counterpoise against that weight of moneyed power which would otherwise , perhaps , have been able to force th' recharter of that institution . This alliance was an unnatural one . The public deposits constituted its inducement , and , in their eventual operation , its punishment . Thus do great principles work in society ; and but few can rend them aright till their result furnishes the clue and the key . On the failure of the State Bank system , the great body of the democratic party , as also of its leading members , were , therefore , taken aback , ' to use an expressive nautical phrase ; though by a // considerable number of the latter it had been anticipated , ( but not with so severe a convulsion , ) and the idea of the total disconnection , now shortly about to be carried into effect , had received much enruest private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was then reluctantly postponed to the necessity of the case and the immature state of public opinion . Then ensued a critical moment in the history of the democratic party and cause . Had the Administration quniled in the slightest degree before the storm , it had been swept to destruction , , and the party probably disorganized and dissolved . But it proved equal to the crisis , and the republic was saved by its presence of mind , firmness , and faithfulness to its principles . No previous administration that our history has known has ever passed through such a trial . It maintained itself erect . Its crest was never bowed . Planting itself on the Law , on its integrity of purpose , and on the democratic truth of its principles , it faced the storm of attack in every direction , and , conf dent in the ultimate support of the people , stood firmly by the standard of their cause . The crisis reached its height at the assemblage of Congres* . All was doubt , de*pondency , disorganization , when the Message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver trumpet . Its effect seemed almost magical . It was unanswered , because unanswerable . All doubt and fear seemed to vanish on the instant , and all was t*gain courage and good cheer . The democracy of the country is rallying round the flag which it so boldly unfurled , with a zeal , and confidence , a. d determination , never , perhaps , before known to it . There is n-ow a bright banner raised high aloft , of true democratic principle , under which to fight , which every man can see , read , and understand ; a d who is so blinded by prejudice , so misled by interest , so deluded by the fond hope of a still expectant ambition , as to doubt the overwhelming triumph of that principle and that banner , when thus distinctly submitted to the public opinion of the democracy of the United States ?
