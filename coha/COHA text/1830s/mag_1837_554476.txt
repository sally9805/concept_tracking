txt OBJECTS seen through a prism have a gorgeous , fantastical , unnatural appearance , quite striking at first , but wearisome in the repetition . So it is with life and manners , as seen in Mr. Bulwer 's novels . They show us virtues caricatured , vices seductively garnished , generous qualities degraded by paltry motives , petty objects magnified , vulgarities glossed by fashion , and manners tinged with affectation . Whatever is veritable , honest , useful , and truly noble , finds little place in this bizarre , fictitious world . Such is the character of these works in general ; but we will analyze them more in detail . The author does every thing by rule , as mechanically , and with as little inspiration , as the cook makes a ragout from one of his thousand recipes . In the introduction to a recent edition of " The Disowned , " he gives us his modus operandi , showing at the same time how he has achieved his works , and by what rules they should be judged of . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations in his notes , to elucidate the incidents and the language of his dramatis personce . This is virtually admitting the mediocrity of his work ; for it is easy to imagine how out of place and trivial such analyses , keys , and running commentaries by the author himself , would be in the chef.d'cvuvres of literature . Imagine Milton to have given a key to his Sampson Agonistes , or his Comus , or Shakspeare to his Falstaff or Hamlet , Addison to his Sir Roger , or Sir Walter Scott to his Baillie Jarvie . Genius does not // descend from its " highest heaven of invention " to justify its flight by metaphysical or historical disquisitions , hy an affidavit or a rule of Quintilian . But Mr. Bulwer 's is not a " muse of fire " ; it is only a rhetorical muse , of a good high-school education , that is never " enraged , possessed , till madness rules the hour . " He is in no danger of being carried away with his characters ; like his " consummate puppy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Henry Pelham , denominate himself , he always knows what he is about , and not only so , he is very obligingly ready , by a side whisper , to let his readers into his secret . It is in entire accordance with this industrious , mediocre , mechanical mode of proceeding , that he very often introduces his personages with an inventory of their features and dress , height of the person and of the forehead , color of the hair , teeth , and the model of the nose , whether Grecian , bottle , or eagle-beaked , and so on to the end of the catalogue , with the regularity of an anatomical lecture or a gazette of the fashions . But after all , it is only an aggregation of materials . The being , the creature , does not appear and make himself present to the reader . Forms are not to he conjured up in this way from the vastydeepofimagination . All the epithets of beautiful , lovely , cruel , fierce , odious , and so on , serve , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the qualities do not become embodied ; they are still but so many abstractions . The ideal figures , if any , floating in the author 's fancy , do not , in the end , breathe from the canvass . The reader does not imagine them to have ever been alive . His landscapes are wrought after the same method , and with like success . When Milton speaks of trim meadows pied with daisies , shallow brooks , and wide rivers , mountains on whose barren breasts rest laboring clouds , and towers and battlements bosomed high in tufted trees , the few expressions used , by that enchantment which belongs to the power of genius , open before you a vivid scene , more distinctly than can be done by exhausting the whole vocabulary of architecture and landscape gardening . Another characteristic of these productions , as we have already hinted , is the utter selfishness and profligacy of sentiments that pervade the characters . Flattery is represented as one of the great instruments of success , and this , not by way of indirect satire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delineation of practical human nature . Thus Clarence Linden is // made , at the first encounter , to salute with a kiss Dame Bingo , the gipsey bag . Upon the same principle the same personage proceeds with the tradesmen among the electors ; and by the same process Peiharn makes his brilliant career , as the author considers it , in the Parisian circles of fashion . To redeem this fault , of which the writer seems to he sensible , he gives us Mordaunt , accompanied with a dissertation upon his purity and exaltation of principle . But it is a sickly sort of energy , and a shy , unsocial sensitiveness , and dreamy philosophy , which constitute the elevation of this character ; quite admirable , it is true , for misses far gone in the novel mania and boarding-school lore , but of quite secondary interest with sensible men and women who distinguish true beauty and excellence . To such these novels are not adapted ; they are more congenial to the selfish , the heartless , the hypocritical , and those whose highest conceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who , feeling nothing of generous nobility and sincere enthusiasm , deem all mankind to he of the same stamp with themselves . These are the " fit audience " and not " few " of the author of Pelham , &amp;c. , their fit oracle . We would not be understood to insist that the fabricators of airy nothings , with names and local hahitations , for the amusement of idle persons , should limit themselves to the producti6n of insipid pattern characters . Quic quid agunt liomines , estfarrago libelli ; the world is their stage , and they may well introduce such heroes of vice and folly , no less than of virtue and wisdom , as it supplies . But selfishness and egotism , with the vices and bad passions , have not blighted the whole surface ; there is something of moral beauty and majesty still extant , and the false pictures which virtually represent them as extinct , are lihels upon human nature in general , however faithful they may he as likenesses of the artists who make them . The new school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Bulwer one of the followers , delights in confounding moral distinctions , and making the unsocial passions the predominant motives of action in the least depraved characters , and the vices in others . Pirates , highway robbers , thieves , and murderers are the heroes , and kept mistresses the heroines . They may say that they represent these personages as warnings rather than as models ; but what signify professions of this sort , when the fortunes of a raga // muffin with a dirk in his bosom and pistols in his belt , or of a reprobate in a fashionable coat , are followed with a grave solicitude through a long series of extravagant adventures and surprising achievements in his line , to which all other events and interests are merely collateral and subordinate . It is in vain to allege a moral which is contradicted by the whole tone of the narrative . It is the spirit and principle of the work to extol what is diabolical , and elevate what is contemptible , and accordingly to degrade what is worthy and estimable . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the author speaks aside to the reader , he says , " The manners of the times , the characters which from peculiar constitutions of society derive peculiarities of distinction , become the natural , though , I confess , not the noblest , province of the novelist . The noblest sphere of his art is to add to exterior circumstances , which vary with every age , a painting of that internal world which in every age is the same ; and , besides describing the fashion and the vestment , to stamp upon its portraits something of the character of the soul . " This classification is sufficiently obscure ; as well as we can make it out , it seems to be , that the best novelists represent character with manners the second-rate , manners and modes of thinking without character ; in which second class the author modestly ranks himself . It is hardly conceivable how a writer can invent and produce a character , without having in view the motives and principles of action and inmost sentiments . If he thus conceives and displays his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world which in every age is the same " if he does not so conceive and display them , the conception is crude , and the execution wavering , indistinct , and perhaps inconsistent . These are the very faults we have objected to in Mr. Bulwer 's delineations . His notion , that his execution in this respect is the result of his system , or belongs to his province of novel-writing , is , we apprehend , an entire mistake it is , we think , a matter of sheer necessity . His specimens are not merely in a subordinate line ; they are incomplete they do not come up to the mark aimed at . They consist too much of superficies ; they have not soul enough , good or bad . As a part of the brain suffices for thinking , and a part of the lungs for breathing , so a fragment of a soul serves to animate these personages . And this is owing to a secondary style of // execution , not to the cultivation of a subordinate province in novel-writing . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage from our author , namely , his delineation of manners . By manners we mean the display of the social or unsocial sentiments in conversation , conduct , and deportment towards others . Good manners may be the spontaneous offspring of social dispositions , and they are then pleasing to all persons , whether polished gentlemen and ladies , or clowns and the wives of clowns . And so manners of this origin are pleasing , in whatever subject they are found . It is only the silliest and most frivolous of people , such as either have not qualities enough in mass to come up to what may be ranked as a character , or have overlaid and smothered what little nature they originally possessed , with conventional forms and affectation , - it is only such , who stop at the external signs or modes of indication , whereby the social and unsocial dispositions are manifested . All persons , of even a moderate share of sense , look at the true meaning of the indications . They care whether the meaning is kindness , respect , delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made in well-trained looks and tones of voice , and easy and graceful , or awkward and angular , movements ; as a reader for instruction cares more about the sense itself , than whether it is expressed in Hebrew , or Greek , or Roman characters . The teachers of manners , accordingly , attempt to embody the tones , expressions , and other external indications of social dispositions , in a system of rules of good breeding . The pupil is taught to simulate those dispositions ; and as , in acting , it is said that those performers who feel least , often personate best , so in manners , those who are conscious of the total want of social impulses , are the most scrupulous cultivators of their external signs . They are polite , in proportion as they are selfish and heartless . While on the other hand it often happens , that persons of great generosity and overflowing philanthropy , not having the most remote apprehension that their real sentiments can be mistaken , are comparatively careless of their formal deportment towards others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a kind and social nature do not , by any means , always carry their harshness and simplicity to rudeness , or even to negligence ; and , on the other hand , those void of all sympathy , do not always // affect to conceal their real indifference or malevolence under address and polish . In choosing intimate companions or friends , we ought to regard their real qualities ; for mere acquaintances , the exterior indications serve tolerably well as a criterion . Persons incapable of friendship and thorough intimacy , are apt not to seek beyond the external symbols in others ; they attach no particular meaning to the word heart , except as the name of a muscle . We see , then , how people must necessarily disagree respecting the manners of particular individuals , for the superficies of manner is all that some look for , or suppose to exist ; while others are easily satisfied of the truth of external indications , though these may he a lie ; and this deception is not to be wondered at , for simulators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ceremony . But others again may penetrate , or at least think they penetrate , the thin veil of courtesy , and see , under it , selfishness , paltry cunning , and impertinent egotism ; and to these the same bland , punctilious , and studious practice of the rules of the art of pleasing , as laid down by the best authorities , will sometimes be odious , as it will aggravate the deformity of the dissocial sentiments thus attempted to be dissembled , and , besides , will imply disrespect in supposing that others can be so easily deceived . Accordingly , manners that are quite charming to one , will be insipid or annoying , or seem to be impertinent , to another . Now Mr. Bulwer dwells very much on the outside of his personages , as already remarked , and as is proved by his elaborate dissertations upon the springs and clock-work , and his pointing out to you the strings he pulls to make the automata work . The delineation of manners is , accordingly , a great part of his undertaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not hesitating to place his heroes and heroines in situations , by which his own knowledge of society is very severely tested ; and he does not fail to show his acquaintance with a great variety of forms of social intercourse . He appears to plume himself particularly on his skill in portraying fashionable life and manners . But in whatever scene he puts his persons , the manners are not the spontaneous incidents to the characters . Many of them , at least , as the author candidly confesses in the passage already cited , have no distinctive characters at all . His system is to take some passion , or penchant , or mode of thinking , or foible , and conduct it through various situations and adventures . The // conversation and conduct are collateral accompaniments to this passion or abstract quality , foible , or mode of thinking , making a very incoherent , ill-defined whole . In the works of the masters , the manners are natural and characteristic , flowing spontaneously from principles of action and motives and propensities , with which the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author in the capacity of a looker on , but by the action . In Mr. Buiwer 's novels , accordingly , there is an affectation and fastidiousness of manners pervading almost the whole dramatis p*rsonw . The lesson of these works is , as already suggested , that veritable honor , veracity , principle , and sincerity of purpose , if they exist at all , have little to do with the happiness and fortunes of men or women that men come in contact only at the superficies , and that our exterior selves , being factitiously superinduced , take the place of our real selves , and , unless counteracted by fatality of circumstances , determine our fortunes . We are accordingly instructed , upon the Chesterfieldian system , to bestow our whole care upon the shell , - that the nucleus , the soul , the mind , the sentiments , and affections , are of little account . Now as the system of manners in these novels is in general , avowedly based upon selfishness and prompted by egotism , the effect is similar to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual intercourse of the world , where the disguise is seen through , and the hollowness and hypocrisy detected . For though the author discloses the motives , he does not disapprove of them ; on the contrary , he holds up plotting , designing biens*ctnce , and hypocrisy , practised according to conventional rules and forms , as the true models of manners . A sensible reader , therefore , lays down the book in disgust with its practical doctrines ; a superficial , unprincipled reader , with fantastical notions of men and affairs , on the contrary , finds something quite congenial with himself in the book , and lays it down at the end with a very high opinion of his own and the author 's philosophy and knowledge of mankind , and imagines the world to be tolerable , if it be indeed so , because there are so many people in it liable to be gulled , and used by means of their blind sides , follies , foibles , and simplicity . But he is the dupe , and honest , true men are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small cunning , carry their just penalty with them ; and a life of artifice and maneuvre is barren of all satisfaction , as well as pitiful. // The conduct of the plot is as difficult in a novel as in a drama . It is so difficult that many authors have no plot at all , but merely carry their hero through a series of adventures and scenes , having no connexion or common bearing . The whole is a fictitious journal . Mr. Bulwer makes a plot , but sometimes digresses , which is allowable upon sufficient reasons given . But he has one artifice , which , we think , has an effect contrary to his intention . He apparently pleases himself with mystifying the reader , by way of working up his interest , instead of xvbich he sometimes fairly runs down his curiosity . He is kept in the dark so long that he becomes indifferent to it ; or , if he sees through the design , it is a failure on the part of the author . Thus , in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , and an answer to some objections that had been made to bis novels , he is kept a long time under the disguise of Glendower . The reader indeed suspects who he is , but if this is intended by the author , it is inartificial to affect to keep him in the dark , when that is not the design ; if , on the other hand , he is supposed to be deceived and really is so , he is quite fatigued with following so long the fortunes of one , who apparently has not any connexion with the main plot . So in the same novel , as in some of the others , the author brings up his different divisions of persons from time to time ; and for this purpose , to all appearance at the time , stops the progress of the plot . In this way , in the novel just mentioned , the main plot , namely , the disposing of the hero , stands still three quarters of the time , in consequence of the author 's keeping his secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more exciting , to keep the reader , as he goes along , expressly apprized of some connexion of all the parts , and not leave him merely to suspect it . He must be made to wish most vehemently that Mr. Clarence should marry Miss Clara , and he may be permitted to suspect that it may so turn out , though he is not to be so assured of it , as not to be exceedingly distressed with the difficulties . Whatever may be thought of these novels in other respects , the literary execution is certainly very fine ; fine , in the better sense of the term , seems to us to give its general character . It is sparkling , brilliant , sententious , and full of classical allusion and antithesis . The stories embody a great mass of superficial knowledge , collected from a very wide circuit . // From this source the reader may bring away something for his pains . But , of the philosophy and thinking , which occupy so great a space , we can not speak in so high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to politics , political economy , or the philosophy of history , of society , or of the mind . In all these respects they seem to us to he always quite superficial , and often very false and pernicious . Of the different novels , " The Pilgrims of the Rhine " is , in our estimation , decidedly the best . The author 's brilliant sprightliness is applied , with ren ) arkable success , in the burlesque way , to the fairies ; and the digressions are pleasing , and introduced with address . We should put next in rank , " Pelharn " and " The Disowned . " In one respect the latter may be classed with the historical novels of " The Last Days of Pompeii " and " Rienzi , " and with " The Duchess de Ia Valli*re , " as it professes to give the manners and characteristic modes of thinking of seventy years ago ; but , as a record of the past , we can not think this , any more than the other historical novels , very successful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , as far as history is concerned . The labored eulogies upon Bolingbroke serve , as it seems to us , rather to depress the eulogist , than to raise the subject of them . The author can not disengage himself from his own times , and identify himself with other times . It is all but disgusting , for instance , to meet with present Cockney dandyism , in the streets and atrict , and Cockney slang , in the pot-houses of Pompeii , antedated some two thousand years , besides being placed far out of their true latitude . Of " The Duchess de la Valli*re " we have but little to say . It is said to play much more like Mr. Maelzel 's automata worked by machinery , than like a genuine , dramatic performance . The attempt at a drama , with all the help of history to supply personages , betrays at once the defect apparent in the author 's novels . The character , the individual entity , does not show himself . The persons move with a sort of spasmodic action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galvanic battery , than as if animated by Promethean fire.
