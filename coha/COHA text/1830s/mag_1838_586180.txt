txt THE leading objection urged against the great reform principle which the Democratic party is struggling to establish , by the divorce of the fatal connection between Bank and State , is , that it is a measure of hostility to banks , to credit , and to commerce . This is the cry with which we are met at the very outset of the path of inquiry , and which is made to conjure up the most frightful spectral monsters of ruin and dismay . It is in vain that the friends of this truly wise , safe , and necessary reform protest against so utterly gratuitous an assumption of designs having an existence only in the imaginations of panic-making politicians , and their panic. - stricken followers . It is in vain that the charge is met and put to shame a thousand times . It is in vain that the circle of the argument is travelled round again and again , and proved perfect on every point , in all its bearings , while every tangible objection is repelled . Still its opponents , though constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry is raised , and repeated by the thousand echoes of a partisan press . We propose in the present article to present a plain view of the subject addressed especially to the friends of commercial banking and *commercial credit ; and trust that no one , who will permit his excited party passions and panic to yield for a while to a calm reflection upon the true principles and objects of banking , will hereafter hesitate to ascribe the present chaotic condition of the currency and the exchanges of the country to their one true and only source . We leave out of view entirely in this article the question of the currency , in the points of view adverted to by us in former numbers ; and acquiescing in the existence and use of paper-money for a circulating medium as a fact , desire to prove even to its peculiar friends and advocates-at least to the honest and sincere-that an enlightened regard to the true principles of their own theory ought // to direct their efforts to precisely the policy of the Independent Treasury Scheme for which they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished writers on this subject , commercial banks should , in making loans or discounts based on deposits and circulation , confine themselves to business paper having but a short time to run , and never grant an extension of such loans or discounts . As they express it , " the proper business of a bank is not to lend capital , but to lend credit " - not to furnish the trader with sufficient means to carry on his business independently of other resources , but simply to enable him to anticipate the proceeds of his sales , by making advances to him to supply the place of such portion of his own capital as he has parted with by selling on credit . If a bank discounts nothing but business paper , the notes it issues represent the notes it discounts , and the notes it discounts represent the commodities , or the value of the commodities , which the merchant has bought or sold . Let these commodities be flour , sugar , cotton , tobacco , or any thing else , they form a fund by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note discounted by the bank , and thereby enable the bank to redeem its issues . So long as banks observe this rule ; they cannot- , according tothis theory , make issues to excess ; for the accommodations they grant are exactly adapted to the commercial business of the country , increasing as it increases , and diminishing as it diminishes . The ' exact proportion of currency to commodities is preserved , no matter what may be the fluctuations of commerce . So long , moreover , as banks observe this rule , domestic exchanges can not be thrown into confusion . If the trade between different parts of the country were reduced to mere barter , ( both money and credit being excluded therefrom , ) it is self-evident that exchanges would be regular , for no part of the country would part with commodities , except on receiving commodities of equal value in return .. Equally regular would be the exchanges , if , instead of being carried on by mere barter of commodities , they should be carried on by the medium of paper which should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But let banks make issues to enable their customers to pay taxes , . and they introduce disorder into both currency and exchanges . In such cases their paper is not the representative of commodities , and no specific fund is provided for its redemption . The banks are ac. - commodating , not the wants of commerce , but , in an indirect ' way , the wants of Government . The issues of the banks no longer adapt themselves to the trade of the country , expanding as it increases , and contracting as it diminishes , but expanding and contracting according to the demand for public revenue . The foundation is also laid for confusion in exchanges . " While the banks // restricted themselves to discounting business paper , the exchanges of commodities by different parts of the country afforded effectual means of equalizing the exchanges of bank notes which were the mere representatives of the value of these commodities . But there are no commodities to represent bank notes issued for the payment of public revenue ; and Government does not , in its disbursements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would find their way in the natural course of trade , but , very probably , in the points directly opposite . It is hardly nece sary to say , that , when Government receives banks notes in payment of public dues , bank notes will be issued to an amount sufficient to supply the demand . It matters not what particular form bank loans may then assume . It is plain that , in such cases , bank issues exceed what the commercial wants of the community require , and go to supply its wants for other objects . If the banks issue notes for the purchase and improvement of real estate , they may disorder currency and exchanges as much as by issuing notes for the payment of taxes . In such cases , their notes are indeed the representatives of commodities , but not of commodities which can be advantageously sold in time to enable borrowers to repay what has been lent to them , and thus enable the banks to meet their engagements . In some parts of the country the banks may be under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three months , in others in a shorter , and in others in a longer , period . But it would be but a poor " accommodation ' * to the purchaser of a cotton plantation in Mississippi , to be obliged to repay his loan before he could carry his first crop to market ; or the builder of a palace in New York to refund what he had borrowed , before his wife had had an opportunity of giving her first soir6e in her splendid habitation . Yet if the banks of Mississippi will , in addition to making issues sufficient to circulate the annual produce of the soil , also make issues equal to the amount of real estate thrown into market , exchanges will be wofully against Mississippi . Part of these excessive issues will find their way to New York and Philadelphia , but the land can not be exported in order to redeem them . The same remarks will , mutatis mutczndis , apply to the New York banks , if they will make loans to people wherewithal to build palaces at New Brighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these strict rules apply only to the credit dealings of the banks , or to such of their operations as are based on their circulation and deposits . It is of little moment , in regard to the particular point which we are now considering , in what way what is called the capital of a bank is invested , provided that , in its credit dealings , it confines itself to discounting business paper having but a short time to run , and makes it an inflexible rule never to grant a renewal . The whole of the // original capital of a bank may be lent to Government as has been done by the Bank of England-*-.or it may be invested in real estateor in bonds and mortgages  --  or lent on accommodation-notes of long dates , renewable forever-  --  or simply represented by the stock notes of the original subscribers . So long as the loans and discounts of a hank do not exceed the capital paid in , no evil is done even if the whole be invested in stock-notes . The danger commences in those operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to these that our remarks especially refer . Particular cases will serve to elucidate the principles of con-imercial banking , and show the difference between it and other kinds of banking . We shall suppose the reader to be acquainted with the mode in which , when banks are introduced into a country , their paper is made to supply the place of the specie previously in circulation : and we shall not stop to inquire whether the new distribution of capital thus effected is that which is most advantageous to the community , or precisely equitable in all its aspects . We will take the system as established , and select a single bank in the interior of Maryland to illustrate its operations . A miller at or near Hagerstown , has wheat offered to him by the neighbouring farmers , say of the value of one thousand dollars . He has no cash on hand wherewith to make the purchase , but he has a note , bill , or acceptance , for one thousand dollars , given to him by a factor at Baltimore , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has this note or bill discounted by the bank , and with the proceeds purchases the wheat . The farmers take the hank notes , pay them out to the mechanics and traders with whom they have dealings ; and the notes , after having circulated for a time in the neighbourhood of Hagerstown , at length reach Baltimore . They are , in all probability , carried to that city by the Hagerstown storekeepers , and exchanged for dry . goods and groceries . The merchants of Baltimore deposite them in the banks , and the bank of Hagerstown thus becomes debtor to the banks of Baltimore in the sum of one thousand dollars . But this is balanced by the note or bill of the flour factor for one thousand dollars which the Hagerstown hank had sent on for collection . The trade between Hagerstown and Baltimore is an exchange of flour for dry goods and groceries , and the value of the same is expressed in the note of hand or bill of exchange given by the Baltimore flour factor , and in the bank notes issued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is what is called simply " making advances , " or " affording facilities . " The miller has a capital of his own invested in flour at Baltimore . But he can not use this in the purchase of wheat at his mill door . The farmers do not want flour , or if they do , he has // 183S.I Operatioit of Commercial Exchanges . it not at hand to supply them . But they want to make purchases from the storekeepers , and the circulating credit of the bank will serve their purposes . The bank has not lent capital to the miller , for it had none to lend , having previously invested in permanent securities all its original funds . It lends its credit , and it has a double security that the credit it lends will be sustained : first , in the flour at Baltimore , of the value of which the bill or note of the factor is the representative ; and secondly , in the wheat purchased by the miller , of the value of which the notes issued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout , a business transaction , and is in strict conformity with the principles of commercial banking . But take another cas . The miller wishes to make an addition to his mill , and for this purpose requires five thousand dollars . The bank lends him the amount on a note drawn by an obliging friend and endorsed by himself . Here bank notes are issued , not as representatives of a value already existing , but of a value to be created by labour . Before that value can be created , that is , before the new mill can be brought to yield an income , the bank notes find their way , in the natural course of trade , to Baltimore . But there is no flour here now , as in the former case , to constitute a fund for the redemption of the notes . Even after the mill shall be completed , it can not be transferred to Baltimore . Suppose fifty operations of this kind to take place , and it is evident that the balance will be thrown greatly against Hagerstown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of exchanges . According to the theory of commercial banking , while banks discount all good business paper of short dates that is offered , and none other , the channels of circulation are always exactly full . But it is plain that when a vessel is full , a very few drops in addition will cause the water to overflow . Let a bank have ten thousand dollars in specie in its vaults , and a circulation of one hundred thousand dollars , being what is exactly adapted to the business wants of the community . Then let it tnak'e an addition of but ten per cent . to its circulation . Inconsiderable as this addition may seem , it may be sufficient to drain the bank of all its specie . Apply these principles to the banks in two more distant parts of our Union , say New York and Mississippi . The trade is much more round about than that between Hagerstown and Baltimore , but it is , in reality , founded on the same principles . Let us trace its regular course . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred thousand dollars ' worth of goods , giving his notes or bills for the same . The New York merchant has these notes or bills discounted by a bank , and with the proceeds purchases bills of exchange on England , through which he either pays an old debt // due in that country , or procure a fresh supply of foreign commodi. * ties . The Mississippi merchant carries these goods to Natchez , and there disposes of them to the neighbouring planters , in expectation of being paid out of the growing crop of cotton . In due season he receives the cotton , and sends it to a factor at New Orleans . In the interval the notes or bills he gave to the New York merchant have been sent to the Planters ' Bank for collection . They are now due . He draws hills on the factor at New Orleans . The Planters ' Bank discounts these drafts , and with what he thus receives the Natchez merchant pays the notes or bills he gave to the New York jobber or importer . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlcans factor is in debt to the Planters ' Bank at Natchez , and the Planters ' Bank is in debt to the Bank of America at New York . But the factor has , in the cotton consigned to him , the means of paying his debt to the bank at Natchez , and thereby enabling the latter to pay what it owes to the bank at New York . The factor ships the cotton to Liverpool and draws a bill of exchange on England , which bill he selL , and with the proceeds pays the New Or. * leans agent of the Planters ' Bank , which agent we will suppose to be the Union Bank . The Bank of America at New York draws on the Planters ' Bank at Natchez ; the latter draws on the Union flank of Louisiana in favor of the bank at New York ; the Union Bank sends the foreign bill of exchange to New York ; the Bank of America receives it there , and sells it to an importing merchant , who transmits it to Europe , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year before sold to the Mississippi merchant . This may seem like a very complicated process of bill-drawing . But it is , in reality , a plain business transaction . The bills and drafts , in all cases , follow the course of the goods on which they are founded . The trade between Mississippi and England is an exchange of cotton for dry goods and other products of British industry . Mississippi carries on this trade chiefly through the medium of the two ports of New York and New Orleans . Through the former she makes her imports , through the latter her exports . All the notes given and the drafts drawn , are but the representatives of the goods received or the cotton sent . The trade , so far as it is carried on in this country , commences at New York , where the importation was made ; and to that city , in order to liquidate accounts , must the bill of exchange be sent which was founded on the exportation made at N*w Orleans . This bill is forwarded to Liverpool . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is founded arrives ; and thus the accounts between England and the United States are adjusted . If the principles of commercial banking are correct , it would seem that as long as these institutions confine themselves to real business transactions , there is little danger of either foreign or domestic ex // hanges being deranged . In addition to the operations of the Mississippi banks , founded on goods received from New York , and cotton sent to New Orica s , there would be others founded on the business transactions of the citizens of Mississippi among themselves . The is. nes of the banks resting on such transactions would furnish the local currency , and as no note would be issued but in consequence of a value already created , and adapt 4 to circulation , there could be no excess of issues ; and while the currency of Mississippi was thus kept at par at home , there could be no possibility of deranging it from abroad , so long as the exchange dealings of the banks should be based exclusively on goods received from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the banks of Mississippi , in addition to loans to facilitate onci fide commercial operations , also make loans to enable indivi " duals to speculate in lands . Suppose a bank should , in addition to an advance of one hundred thousand dollars to a merchant , made in order to enable him to anticipate the proceeds of his cotton sent to New Orleans , also advance him one hundred thou and dollars to buy government lands . If we are rightly informed , such things have been done in Mississippi . This amount may not enter immediately into circulation , but it must do so sooner or later , whether the amount is " deposited with the States , " or paid out in the ordinary course of expenditure which the public service requires . Suppose that all the banks in Mississippi afford " accommodations " of this kind , and that the aggregate amount is several millions . In the course of trade , a portion of the excess will find its way to New York , and then the rate of exchange , as measured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi ,  - -  unless , indeed , the New York banks shall have made issues equally excessive to accommodate speculators in town lots , dealers in fancy stocks , and builders of fancy palaces . We may suppose all the banks in the country to act in this way , and those in the north , south , east and west , to be so nearly equal in their excess of issues , that , for a time , there is little variation from the ordinary rates of domestic exchange . But this can not long continue . The rise of prices caused by so general an excess , encourages importations , and discourages exportations. rrllough we have the finest and most extensive wheat lands of any country in the world , we cease to export and begin to import bread stuffs . This may for a time seem to do very well ; but as we do not pay as promptly as we ought for part of what we import , our credit abroad begins to be affected . The course of foreign exchanges is turned against us . The merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver . But hardly does the sum total amount to five million dollars , before our eight or nine hundred banks find they s*an bear no further drains . As if with one consent , they all stop // payment , and the country is exposed to all the evils , present and prospective , of an irredeemable paper currency . According to the theory of commercial banking , none of these evils would have come upon us if the banks had made no issues and granted no credits , except on real business transactions of short dates . If there are errors hi this theory we are not responsible for them , We take it as we find it . Objections have been brought against it , but what they are we need not now discuss . Our present object is not either to assail or to defend the theory of commercial banking , but simply to explain it , and to show the utter incompatibility of its principles with the reception of hank notes for public dues and public lands . When banks make issues for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emission of continental money , different from the old in form , but the same in substance . When banks make issues based on lands , what have we but the French assignat system over again ? It is no wonder that currency and exchanges have , during the las fifty years , been in a state of confusion , for the history of most banks has been little more than a history of deviations from correct banking usages In all , or nearly all countries , banks are , to a greater or less extent , fiscal machines , and every government makes them such when it receives bank notes in the payment of the public revenue .. The greater part of the paper-issuing banks on the continent of Europe , are , in a strict sense , government banks . So also is the Bank of England . Its chief business is that of exchanging exchequer bills for bank uiotes . In some years the whole of its advances ti merchants have not exceeded one or two millions sterling , while those of a private firm , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as twenty millions sterling . In our own country banking has never been conducted on purely* commercial principles . The very commencement of the system ' with us placed it on a wrong foundation . / There is reason to believe that the wltoe of the original capital of the Bank of North America was furnished by the Government . It is certain that its notes were received in peyment of taxes , and equally certain that thereby a greater demand was created for them than the mere purposes of commerce required . The supply was , of course , made to equal the tax-paying as well as the commercial demand ; and the consequence was that the due proportion of currency to commodities was not preserved . The abundance of bank issues excited the spirit of speculation . But as a large part of these issues were not based on commodities , the bank was , when the time for redeeming them arrived , forced to make a great and sudden pressure on the community , whereby ' an excitement was produce // which was near depriving the said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil . The framers of the Federal Constitution intended that we should have a hard-money government ; and the first revenue law passed seemed to be so framed as to carry this intention into effect . It declared explicitly that all duties imposed by the act should be paid " in gold and silver coin only . " Words could not make it more plain . But the first Secretary of the Treasury ( strange as it may seem ) construed these words so as to allow bank notes having ' not more than thirty days to run to be received in payment . His next proceeding was ( without any authority from law ) to deposite these notes in the banks , and leave the country without the independent treasury contemplated by the Constitution . He then proceeded to organize a bank with certificates of public debt for its capital ; and by thus completing the union between Bank and State , exposed currency and credit to all the evils incident to derangements in our fiscal operations . This state of things lasted till the year 1811 , when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first United States Bank , but only that a new union might be formed with certain State Banks selected as depositories of the public funds . War was declared in 1812 , and , in utter defiance of all correct principles of finance , attempts were made to carry it on by means of loans of bank notes , instead of drawing on the real resources of the country . The consequence was , that all the banks which made such loans were forced to suspend specie payments , and the very capacity of the Government to borrow in the regular way was exhausted in little more than two years , and when it had thus borrowed little more than forty-five million dollars , or little more than three per cent . per annum of what was then the gross income of the people . Then came peace , and a mode of financiering was adopted the main principle of which consisted in exchanging Treasury notes , many of which bore interest , for bank notes and bank credits which bore no interest . This admirable policy induced the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though the Treasury was thus made to overflow , it overflowed with money , if money it might he called , which would answer the purposes of neither the Government nor the people . The evils of this state of things were intolerable ; but instead of attempting to correct them by direct legislation , a new National Bank must be established with a paper capital , issuing paper receivable in dues to government . Specie payments were then restored , but in such a way that the resumption was worse than the suspension . In 1821 the rates of exchange in the Middle States were brought // into something like regularity , but as industry was prostrated and enterprize paralysed , there was no such increase of commodities as to require an increase of currency . The Bank of the United States , however , sought to find employment for its now , as was thought , well established credit , in a loan of four millions to Government . The consequence of this departure from true banking principles was an excitement of the spirit of speculation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and numerous bank ruptcies . In 1824 the Bank of the United States repeated its error by making a loan of ten millions to Government , and this it really was which , in the next year , brought it and all the other banks in the country to the very verge of suspending specie payments . Since the year 1824 the Government has had little occasion to borrow . But it has paid off what it had previously borrowed , and a reference to the documents affixed to Mr. McDuffie 's and Mr. Clayton 's reports in 1832 , will show that the operations of a bank in making paper loans to Government can hardly be more injurious to the community than are its operations in making repayments to the public creditors . The whole course of domestic exchanges has to be deranged , in order to concentrate funds at the points where the repayments are to be effected . What has occurred since the year 1832 must be too fresh in the minds of men to require us to go into detail . Different persons may entertain different opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that the country would have escaped such evils as it is now suffering , if Bank and State had never been united . It will be difficult , if not impossible , to point to a single convulsion in the money market from the year 1782 up to the year 183* , which , if it has not been caused , has not been increased , by this unholy connection . In all circumstances , whether of peace or of war , whether the public revenue has been redundant or deficient , whether the banks employed have been Federal or State Banks , and whether they have lent to Government or paid off loans contracted by Government-the improper connection of fiscal and commercial trans. actions has proved injurious to either the Banks or the Government , and in some instances to both . If the connection be resumed , the history of the future will be only a repetition of the history of the past with such variations *s may result from different combinations of circumstances . Fiscal operations and commercial banking operations are so distinct in their nature as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a Government wants to borrow , it wants what Banks have it seldom in their power to lend . It does not want mere credit . It wants capital , and it generally wants it for a term of years ,  --  not for the short period which usually elapses be // tween the time when bank notes are issued and when they are returned for redemption . Equally ill adapted , as we have already shown , is bank currency for supplying a public revenue . The notes issued for such an object are not based on commodities , and as the revenue of Government is collected in one part of the country and disbursed in another , no corresponding transfer of commodities takes place to balance exchanges . In the case of receipts for customs , the tax may be regarded as incorporated with the price of the imports ; and in discounting a note to take up a duty bond , a bank may , perhaps , be said to be discounting a note representing a commodity which may be sold in time to redeem the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in furnishing a medium for the payment of postages and other public dues , the banks make issues which are clearly not based on any proper banking principles . In making issues for the purchase of public lands , they must , if they proceed therein to any great extent , utterly derange the whole course of exchanges . Each of the western and southwestern States produces commodities for export barely sufficient to balance its commercial accounts with the Atlantic States and with Europe . There being no commodities to form a basis for further exchanges , attempts to transfer , by means of Government drafts , such sums as are collected in western bank paper to such places as the public service requires , must inevitably derange both currency and exchanges . If the eastern banks , as well as the western , issue notes for the purchase of public lands and other land speculations , they may for a time balance the excess of paper in the Mississippi valley , by an excess on this side of the Alleghanies ; but such an excess can not continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver then leave the country , and the promises of the banks to pay on demand ' prove utterly delusive . Notes issued for the payment of taxes are , as we have already said , but a new emission of Continental money , differing from the old in form , but not in substance . Their being issued hy corpora* tions , and all the profits of the issues going to corporations , does not change their nature . As no particular commodities are pledged for their redemption , their value is kept up wholly by taxation ; and if our public expenditures should eKceed our public receipts as much as they did in certain periods of the Revolutionary war , our new Continental money would soon fall to a level with the old . To many minds this may not he apparent , because the whole of our banks have been engaged in the double business of furnishing cur* rency for commercial purposes , and currency for fiscal objects ; but let these two functions , distinct in themselves , be divided between two set of banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one set of these banks would rest on the same principles as the // old Continental currency , and be liable to depreciation from the same causes . If any find it difficult to discover that another portion of our bank currency has rested on the same principles as the French assignats , it can only be because the matter has been so cunningly managed with us as to give all the profits to corporations . The value of the French assignats was based on the public land , which was the only fund provided for their redemption . The value of much of our bank paper has rested on no better foundation . No other property than the public land bas , in many an instance , been represented by either the notes discounted or the notes issued . And after the title to the land had , by banking operations , been transferred from the public to speculators , there was no other fund than this same land for the redemption of the notes thus added to the circulation . Such a currency is identical in its nature with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to corporations does not change its essential character . Very different is the currency created by banks conducted on purely commercial principles . This is always based on commodities the demand for which is so constant as to insure the prompt redemption of their paper representatives . - It would also seem to have within itself a self-regulating principle by which the true proportion between currency and commodities might be preserved . Whatever objections could , on other grounds , be brought against such banks , they could not be justly accused of deranging ex* changes . Banks conducted on purely commercial principles would be very profitable . Their whole capital might be invested in permanent securities ; for , after being a short time in operation , the whole spare cash of the community would be deposited with them and constitute a fund quite sufficient to support their current credit . From the capital invested in permanent securities , they would derive the ordinary profits of stock , and what should accrue from the use of their current credit would be so much extra gain . All such of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale trade , would , either directly or indirectly , be the subject of their operations and become a pIed* , e for the redemption of their issues . No portion of it could pass from the producer to tbe wholesale dealer and thence to the consumer , without the intervention , in some stage of its progress , of bank credit in some form , and where bank credit is used somebody must pay for it . The aggregate income thus realised would be many millions per annum , and many millions per annum ought to be esteemed quite a suffi* cient reward for simply furnishing paper representatives of the value of commodities , and balancing exchange accounts between different parts of the Union . // But if our banks , not content with the legitimate profits of their trade , will insist on making emissions identical in principle with the Continental money , and other emissions identical in principle with the French assignats , they must expect all the regular operations of their trade to become deranged , and if they gain in one way , to lose quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three distinct functions of commercial banks , government banks , and land banks , and preserve the due proportion of currency to commodities . Their enormous expansions will be followed by as enormous contractions ,  --  each detrimental to the regular progress of wealth , and to safe and regular business , and consequently to the profits of regular banking . The irregularity of movement imparted to our banking operations by the reception of bank notes in payment of taxes , would seem to be not very considerable . As the revenue the government derives from proper taxation , including therein the customs , is seldom more than twenty millions a year , it does not , by receiving bank notes in payment of these dues , give a direct stimulus to bank issues beyond this extent ; and as this revenue is received and paid away in different seasons of the year , the amount thereby added to the active circulation may seldom , at any one time , exceed five millions . But it should be recollected that , when , by discounting all the good business paper offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things to be circulated , a very small addition to this circ dating medium may cause a great derangement of exchanges , and render the whole system insecure . As shown in a former part of this article , a bank with specie in its vaults of the amount of ten thousand dollars , and paper in circulation of the amount of one hundred thousand dollars , and perfectly secure as long as these proportions are maintained , may , by adding only ten thousand dollars to its circulation , be compelled to suspend payment . The receipt and disbursement , in bank notes , of a revenue only of twenty millions , may cause every thing to fluctuate where every thing might otherwise be comparatively stable . But whatever may be thought of the effect produced by the reception of bank notes in payment for duties , there can be no doubt as to the effect produced by the reception of them in the payment for public lands . Here there is no practical limit ,  --  or at least no limit till we reach the Pacific Ocean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would naturally raise the price as the demand for them increased , and thus limit the sales . But the price of our public land is fixed by law , and remains unchanged , when , by ex* cessive issues of paper , the price of every thing else is doubled . To the public lands , then , the attention of speculators is specially directed , when the price of the produce of land is greatly enhanced . And the process of exchanging bales of paper for millions of acres // of prairie and wood-land , is so very easy so very pleasing , and so very profitable , that , unless prevented by some extraneous cause , it may go on till the whole public domain be exchanged for bank promises . Had not certain measures of our own Government , combined with those of the Bank of England , interfered in 1836 with the operations of the land speculating spirit , the Mississippi scheme would not have stood entirely without a parallel in this new world of ours . That spirit now only slumbers and sleeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected , and it will awake up to renewed action . Again will it cause a redundant revenue , a general rise of prices , and a derangement of exchanges foreign and domestic , so that a general resumption of specie payments will only be followed by another suspension . It will be difficult to find an intelligent member of the banking interest who will not admit that the distinctions herein made between issues for commercial purposes , issues for the payment of taxes , and issues for the purchase of lands , are well founded . It is , there fore , a little surprising that the whole body of banks should desire , or seem to desire , a reunion with the Government . The connection , it may be admitted , might be advantageous to stock-jobbing banks , and land-speculation banks , but to commercial banks it can not but prove injurious . If the reunion should be effected , it could take place directly with only twenty-five of the banks , yet the whole eight or nine hundred seem to be striving as if each expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of them should accomplish an object which seems so dear to them all , they may find that no very great or permanent advantage will accrue from being fiscal agents while there is a deficiency of public revenue , and while currency and exchanges are all in confusion . They will be expected to bring all things into order . If they fail in this , the experiments will be pronounced a failure . f Some of those who were connected with the first two administrations of the United States Bank are still in the land of the living , and they can say whether they found an experiments of this kind , between the years 1817 and 1821 , either very pleasing or very profitable . That the experiment of a reunion of Bank and State may effect the object intended , it will be necessary to clothe the favored five and twenty with a power over the other banks similar to that enjoyed by the United States Bank when it was fiscal agent-that is to say , with power to declare what bank notes shall , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power must necessarily be given to them , as they will be required to credit as cash all notes so received . Many objections have been made ( and we will not say // without reason ) to leaving to public officers the power of discrimi. nation as to the kind of funds to be received for duties and lands ; but it seems to be forgotten that this power of discrimination may be exercised much more injuriously in respect to the interests of rival institutions , when a part of these rival institutions are themselves to hold the power . Unless they can make themselves " creditor banks , " they will derive little advantage from their new vocation . The friends of what is popularly called the Sub-Treasury System ' might ( if its enemies so desire ) well consent that the trial of it be deferred to some more convenient opportunity . Making trial of it now would be trying it under very disadvantageous **27;961;TOOLONG very dIfferent from those under which the State Bank Deposite System commenced . Then every thing was prosperity , revenue abundant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps as it is possible for them to be with banks conducted on unsound principles . Now , the revenue is deficient , the banks have suspended payments , and currency and exchanges are in great disorder . The effects of the former suspen-. sion in 1814 can hardly be said to have been over , as regards all parts of the country , before 1829 or 1830 . If we are to judge of the future by the past , the present suspension will be followed by calamities which it may be hard to bear , and difficulties which it may not be easy to surmount* The same ingenuity that has discovered in advance ten thousand evils in the Sub-Treasury System will , when those calamities occur , attribute them to the odious Sub-Treasury , ' and not to inherent defects in our banking system , In which they all really originate . If the banks in any part of the country resume payment , the . Secretary of the Treasury will , as the law now stands , be required to select a certain number of them as depositories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be safe in their custody . How is he to judge of their safety ? If safe in one month , they may be very unsafe in another . Under this very law he selected eighty of what were then deemed the best banks in the country , and in less than one year they all suspended payment with between thirty and forty millions of the public money in their possession . It is now hoped that some of them will resume , but no one expects that all that resume will be able to sustain specie payments , especially when the resuming banks are threatened with the hostility of the powerful Pennsylvania Bank of the United States and its numerous allies . But supposing the Head of the Treasury Department to be able to satisfy himself of the perfect security as a public depository of one bank in each resuming State : then we shall have the anomalous spectacle of two fiscal systems for different parts of the same country . In the resuming States , the public dues will be paid in bank // paper which , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other States they will be paid in gold and silver . In one part of the country , bank credit will be the medium for paying public dues , and in the other , nothing but solid cash will be received ; and this , while the Constitution declares that " all duties , imposts , and ex* cises shall be uniform throughout the United States . " In one part of the country the public revenue will be entrusted to the care of corporations directly responsible only to the States which have created them ; and in the other , left in charge of mere collecting and disbursing officers , in whose hands the laws as they now stand did not intend that the money should long remain . Take another supposition . Suppose the consideration of the Five and Twenty Bank Bill to be resumed , and suppose it to be passed . And suppose the Secretary of the Treasury to have made his selec* tion , and to have submitted the same to Congress for its approval . Is it quite certain that political and pecuniary considerations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good banks , and for the employment of very bad banks ? And how can we assure ourselves that arguments stronger than mere words will not be used to influence the votes of the members , when many of them stand so much in need of money , and the banks have so much money to bestow ? We hear much of the evils of Executive Patronage . Are no dangers to be apprehended from Legislative Pa* tronage , especially when exercised in this very unusual and very objectionable way-when exercised with the intent of giving to twenty-five banks the control of all the moneyed institutions in the country ? For ourselves , we firmly believe the Sub-Treasury System ' to be the best , not only for ordinary times , but for the present exigency : - best for the banks-best for the government-best for the people . Its opponents say its very name is odious . ' Misconception , or , perhaps , misrepresentation , may have made it so to them . It can hardly be more odious than the name of Christian ' once was , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat ' now is . In its principles it is well founded , and if it should fail in practice , it could be only through defects of organization , or errors of administration . Difficulties may attend it the first few years , but these will be owing , not to the system itself , but to the confusion into which our financial affairs , our commerce , our currency , and our exchanges , have all been brought by our radically vicious banking usages . The Sub-Treasury System is the system the fathers of the country had in contemplation when they framed the Constitution . If a fair trial is never to be given to it , it will only prove that there is in the country A POWER which is above the government , above the Con* stitution , and above the people.
