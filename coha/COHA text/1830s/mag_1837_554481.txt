txt THE Legislature of Massachusetts has at various times manifested a very commendable desire to preserve the records and muniments of our forefathers , and to diffuse the knowledge of our colonial and provincial history . In the year 1814 , they subscribed for six hundred copies of " Hubbard 's History of New England from the Discovery to 1680 , " which , after lying in manuscript for upwards of a hundred and thirty years , was then for the first time published by the Massachusetts historical Society , and furnished a copy of it to every town in the Commonwealth , including the District of Maine . In 1824 they purchased three hundred and fifty copies of Mr. Savage 's invaluable edition of Governor Winthrop 's History of New-England , to be distributed in like manner among the several towns of Massachusetts . Without this liberal and efficient aid , it may be questioned whether either of those important works would have appeared even to this day . Again , in the year 1812 , Hon. Nathan Dane , William Prescott , and Joseph Story were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and general laws , of the colony and province of Massachusetts Bay . The result of their labors appeared in 1814 , in a royal octavo volume of 868 pages , of which one thousand copies were printed . In 1818 , the Rev. Dr. Freeman , of Boston , Samuel Davis , Esq. , of Plymouth , and Benjamin ft . Nichols , Esq. , of Salem , were appointed by the legislature to examine the records of the Old Colony of Plymouth , which , notwithstanding the union of that colony with Massachusetts in 1691 , had been retained , and remained deposited in the office of the register of deeds of Plymouth county . These commissioners were subsequently authorized to cause the most important parts of the records to be transcribed , and the copies to be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State . This duty was intrusted by them to B. R. Nichols , Esq. , who performed it with // great fidelity and accuracy . The copies fill eleven folio volumes , which are provided with copious indexes , and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antiquarian . At the last session of the legislature , by the recommendation of his Excellency the Governor , an appropriation of a thousand dollars was made to defray the expense of arranging and classifying the numerous files of papers and documents deposited in the office of the Secretary of State , which had lain there for ages in a chaotic mass , and consequently had , in the course of time , been not a little reduced in quantity by the abstraction of such loose papers as suited the convenience or taste of inquisitive collectors . The Governor appointed to this office the Rev. Joseph B. Felt , a gentleman whose habits of antiquarian research and familiar acquaintance with our early history eminently qualified him for the place . Ever since his appointment , he has been diligently engaged in examining and arranging this mass of documents , and has succeeded in bringing a portion *f them at least into some kind of order . As fast as they were arranged , they have been bound up in large folio volumes , of which twenty are already completed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes will satisfy any one of the wisdom of the legislative resolve authorizing this arrangement , and of the singular qualifications of the gentleman to whom the work has been intrusted . It was likewise at the last session of the legislature that a resolve passed , that 1,500 copies of the Laws of the Old Colony of Plymouth should be published for the use of the Commonwealth ; and the Governor was authorized to appoint a commissioner to superintend the printing . William Brigham , Esq. , received the appointment , and the fruits of his labors we have now before us in the beautifully executed volume , the title of which stands at the head of this notice . In this age of procrastination , particularly in regard to all public works , we feel bound to commend the promptitude as well as the accuracy with which this work has been prepared . The resolve passed on the 5th of April ; and within seven months a royal octavo volume of 357 pages has been compiled and carried through the press . As a large portion of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original spelling is strictly followed , the preparing the copy and correcting the proofs must have been a work of great care and minute attention . We deem it a subject of congratulation , that the editorship of this volume devolved upon one , who was not only so well qualified for the task , but was likewise willing to give to it that personal attention which is essential to secure accuracy in publications of this sort . Thevolume is chiefly valuable as illustrating the spirit of our // Pilgrim fathers , and exhibiting the manners , wants , and sentiments of those early times . The laws of a people are one of the best indexes of its character and condition ; and this is particularly true of a simple and primitive people like the Plymouth colonists , living together in a small community in a new-found world , and resembling a family or a patriarchal tribe rather than a state or nation . The code before us carries us back to the very infancy of the settlement , shows us the misdemeanors and vices prevalent in the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient to check them . We see the moral as well as the physical difficulties with which the first settlers had to contend , and the remedies which they provided for their relief . Some of the laws in the Plymouth code give us a very graphic and amusing picture of the simplicity of manners that prevailed in these primitive times , and we can not refrain from citing one or two of them . The first relates to a custom which we presume will continue to prevail , despite of all laws , so long as the world shall stand . " It is enacted by the Court , that whosoever shall inveigle or endeavour to steal the affections of any man 's daughter or maid-servant , or shall make any motion of marriage , not having first obtained leave and consent of the parents or master so to do , shall be punished either by fine or corporal punishment , or both , at the discretion of the bench , and according to the nature of the offence . " 1'he next relates to a practice which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affections and habits of the community . " It is enacted by the Court , that if any shall be found or seen taking tobacco in the streets of any town within the colonies of this government , or in any barn or out-house , or by the highways , and not above a mile from a dwelling-house , or at his work in the fields , every such person so offending shall forthwith pay twelve pence for every such offence . And for boys and servants that shall offend herein , and have nothing to pay , to be set in the stocks for the first default , and for the second to be whipped . And any person that shall be found smoking of tobacco on the Lord 's day , going to or coming from the meeting , within two miles of the meeting-house , shall pay twelve pence for every such default to the colony 's use . " The last relates to a new species of tythe , if we may not rather call it a new form of the voluntary system . " The Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commendable and beneficial to the towns where God 's providence should cast any *vhales , if they should agree to set apart some part of every such fish or oil for the encouragement of an able , godly minister among them . " We seek however in vain among the Plymouth laws for any thing corresponding to the following law passed by the colony of Massachusetts Bay in 1651 . " It is ordered by // this Court , that whosoever shall be found observing any such day as Christmas or the like , either by forbearing labor , feasting , or any other way upon any such account as aforesaid , every such person so offending shall pay for every such offence five shillings as a fine to the county . " The publication of this volume is but fulfilling , in part , the recommendation of the commissioners who , in 1818 , as we have before mentioned , examined all the records of the Old Colony , and stated it as their opinion that it would be of benefit to the present age , and still more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was particularly desirable that the whole of the laws should be printed in chronological order . As this has now been so well done in the volume under consideration , we hope that the Legislature will proceed in the good work , and cause other portions of these important records to be printed . We are particularly desirous that the Acts of the Commissioners of the United Colonies , which fill two folio volumes in manuscript , should be published by the authority of the State . These records , it is well known , were transcribed by Ebenezer Hazard , Esq . and compose nearly the whole of his second quarto volume of Historical Collections , published in 1794 . That work is now exceedingly scarce , and is not free from errors . This scarcity we have heard accounted for in a way which , for the honor of the country , we hope is not true . It has been stated that , on the death of Mr. Hazard , these volumes of State Papers were put up at auction among his other effects , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by what John Bale , the antiquary , tells us was done with the libraries of the monasteries suppressed by henry Viii . " A great number , " he says , " of them which purchased these superstitious mansions , reserved of these library books some to serve their jakes , some to scour their candlesticks , and some to rub their boots . Some they sold to the grocers and soap-sellers , and some they sent over sea to the bookbinders , not in small number , but at times whole ships full , to the wondering of the foreign nations . I know a merchant man , which shall at this time be nameless , that bought the contents of two noble libraries for forty shillings ' price ; a shame it is to be spoken ! This stuff bath he occupied in the stead of gray paper by the space of more than these ten years , and yet he bath store enough for as many years to come . A prodigious example is this , and a most horrible infamy among the grave seniors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcribing the records of the Old Colony , went through the laborious process of collating Hazard 's printed volume with the original manuscript ; and the corrected volume is now deposited in the office of the // Secretary of the Commonwealth . A great part of the labor is thus already performed , and we have hoped that the Legislature , during the present session , would pass a resolve authorizing the reprinting of this corrected volume . Should this be determined upon , we hope that the services of Mr. Brigham will again be put in requisition . The experience and tact that he has acquired ought not to be lost to the community . We trust , likewise , that a selection will be made from the curious and valuable papers which Mr. Felt is arranging , and that the fruits of his labors also will come before the public in a tangible form . Massachusetts is bound , by gratitude to the founders of her institutions , to perpetuate their memory and disseminate the story of their deeds.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
