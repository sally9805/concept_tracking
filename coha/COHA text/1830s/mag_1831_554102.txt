txt The influence of the several proressions upon the character , moral , as well as intellectual and physical , of their members , would furnish us with a subject of inquiry not a little curious and interesting . There may be much exaggeration in the proverbial characteristics of each profession ; but there can hardly fail to be some foundation for impressions so general , either in the past history , or the present condition of each community . The progress of society may have softened down the distinctions of those who have shared its improvements , or the character of individuals may have outstripped that of the particular community to which they belong ; nevertheless , we apprehend it will still in general hold true , that the lawyer will acquire some peculiar habits by arguing for the fame or the rewards of victory , the clergyman by arguing where he does not expect , and can not receive an answer , and the physician , by being accustomed to prescribe without either arguing , or being argued with , at all . In the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of each exert a permanent influence upon the character of the individuals who compose it . // These peculiarities are more or less distinctive , according as each community , or each individual , has partaken more or less of the improvements and refinements of cultivated society . The liberal and educated merchant of our country and our own day is a very different being from the narrow-minded calculating tradesman of other times ; but we fear it will be long before the proverbial appellation of shoe-maker 's promise will cease to be significant of faithless delay . We propose to pursue the inquiry at this time only in reference to the medical profession . The relation in which this profession stands to society at large , and the estimation in which it is held , are in some respects peculiar to it . As a community , physicians are , more than most classes of men , made the butt of ridicule , and not unfrequently the subjects of sweeping and unsparing censure , while as individuals , no class of men are more honored and trusted . Ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference to human life , and a sacrilegious disrespect to the dead , are freely and generally charged upon them as a body ; but individually , they are as generally esteemed , each in his own particular circle , with peculiar affection and regard . Happily for the profession , every man excepts his own personal physician from the suspicions with which he views the rest of his fraternity , and then , as if to make amends for his injustice to others , tacitly , and perhaps unconsciously , attributes to him the distinguishing excellence of having resisted peculiar temptations , to which most others in his situation have yielded . Now , as a man 's character among those to whoiii lie is personally known , is of incomparably more consequence to him than his general standing with the world at large as a member of a particular community , it follows that this general prejudice against physicians in its practical operation , is in some respects rather beneficial than injurious to them individually . It fixes a lower standard of merit , by comparison with which each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute merit to obtain for him among his acquaintances the reputation of pre-eniinent worth . Nor does the general prejudice against the profession take away the disposition to apply to a physician in case of need . it is almost always found , that those who when in health are the loudest and most ready in their censure of physicians , are the most prompt in seeking their assistance in sickness ; and if they are sometimes troublesome patients , it is not from an unwillingness to trust themselves to professional skill . // But if the primary effects of this prejudice are in some respects favorable to individual physicians , it does not thence follow , that its influence on the whole is either salutary or unimportant . On the contrary , it is obvious , that whatever diminishes the confidence of the public in the profession , takes something from the respectability and influence , and consequently from the means of usefulness of each member . The evil may be in a great measure counteracted by the predilection for particular physicians , of which we have just spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by the elevation of their own character ; but in an extended view of the whole subject it can not be doubted , that both the profession and the public must suffer from an unworthy estimation of physicians , whether there be just cause for it in the condition and character of the profession or not . We do not mean to intimate , that there is in this community at the present time , any especial danger of undervaluing the services of medical men ; far from it . We believe that there never was a time , when they were held in so high respect and confidence as at the present day ; and probably in no part of the world is this confidence more generally felt by all classes of people , than among us . Much of the distrust which now exists , is the remains of former prejudice , the causes of which have mostly passed away ; and hence perhaps it is , that it attaches less to physicians , as individuals , than to the whole body collectively . The principal effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the medical profession , may be resolved into the two following , viz. , a bigoted attachment to authorized modes of practice , and a peculiar sensitiveness of feeling , or readiness to take offence for slight causes . The former renders physicians unwilling to receive information , or to adopt improvements in practice , however valuable , unless they come through the regular channels of scientific investigation , or established theories ; the other disposes them to frequent jealousies and quarrels among themselves . There is , indeed , a third , which charges the profession with a want of scrupulousness in regard to the means of acquiring some kinds of knowledge ; but of this we do not propose to speak at present . Every one must have observed , how frequently remedies are introduced by men who can make no pretensions to regu // Jar professional knowledge , for diseases which often baffle the science and skill of educated physicians . We speak not of the infallible , universal remedies , the panaceas , and the catholicons , which are blazoned forth by deception and falsehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We refer to the more modest discoveries of the means of curing particular diseases , which have obtained the confidence , sometimes founded up&amp;n an experience of their benefits , of intelligent and educated iiien . The effects which sometimes follow the use of such remedies , are not a little surprising ; and occasionally they bring no small share of reproach and ridicule upon the profession and its regular practitioners . The lame man , whom a long attendance of the most skilful surgeons has failed to cure , is made to walk by a few applications from the hands of a blacksmith ; and a bookseller , by a single word , can teach the dyspeptic to forget his indigestion , laugh at the doctor , and throw away his physic . Physicians it is true , give little credit to all these things . They rarely adopt remedies thus irregularly introduced , and still less frequently do they acknowledge their efficacy . This incredulity of the faculty , however , does little to diminish the confidence of the public . It rather gives point to their sarcasms upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curing diseases , which physicians with all their learning have not the sagacity to make , ( and we hear little of discoveries of this kind by wgular members of the profession , ) it argues little for their candor or liberality , that they can perceive no merit in them . Such is the view which many intelligent and educated men take of the conduct of the medical profession towards irregular practitioners , and their irregular practices ; and to such an extent has the feeling prevailed , that we have seen some of them petitioning our Legislature for a modification of the laws in favor of such practitioners . Now , we do not for ourselves object to any alteration of the laws , which shall place all piactitioners of the healing art , whether regular or irregular , upon an equal footing , in regard to privileges . And in saying this , we make no claim to extraordinary liberality ; for it is our belief , that the distinction made by the present law operates unfavorably both upon the profession and upon the public , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so readily acquiesce in the cor // rectness or justice of this view of the conduct of the profession . We do not deny , that remedies are often introduced by men who are not physicians , which acquire no small share of popular confidence . Neither will we deny , that such remedies are sometimes signally efficacious . So frequently is this the case , that some remedy of this sort is almost constantly before the public , and those who pay little attention to the matter , are hardly aware that they do not obtain a permanent reputation . Hence , they are ready to believe , that there may be some complaints , which quacks can cure better than physicians . It is worthy of remark , however , that the particular remedy in favor , is never for any considerable length of time the same . At one time it is a cure for consumption , at another for rheumatismn , at another for dyspepsia , or it is a panacea , and cures every thing . Each has its day , and passes by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it descends from the higher to the humbler walks of life , to struggle on , by the aid of interested puffs and forged certificates , a little time longer . Whether it be that the cures which give it celebrity result only in temporary relief , or that its failures , or its injurious effects , as well as its cures , at length creep into notice , or that the mystery which attended its introduction being dissipated , it proves to be but an old remedy with new pretensions , we stop not now to inquire . The truth of the remark itself will not be disputed by any who have made themselves at all conversant with the subject . This circumstance alone is enough to show what degree of importance is to be attached to remedies the reputation of which is so evanescent , and to free the physician from any just imputation if he is not in great haste to adopt them before their merits are tested , notwithstanding the high-sounding promises with which they are introduced to notice . It were easy to explain , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a high reputation , which it does not possess merit enough to sustain . This circumstance is by no means peculiar to the remedies of irregular practitioners . The whole history of the medical profession is full of analogous instances . The habits of rigorous investigation which prevail at the present day in all the sciences , do not indeed now suffer inefficient medicines to acquire a very general reputation . But there have been times , when medicines have been in very // extensive use , which are now universally regarded as nearly or quite inert . No one but a physician ( and it is scarcely possible even for him ) can sufficiently appreciate the difficulty of discriminating between the effects of remedies upon a disease , and the spontaneous changes of the disease itself . Most diseases have a natural tendency to disappear , sooner or later , of themselves , if not improperly interfered with ; and those which have not this tendency often undergo changes , which are unexpected , and for which no specific cause can he assigned . Hence it happens , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great impression upon it , is ascribed to a medicine simply because its use had preceded one of these spontaneous changes . Often , while a physician is congratulating himself upon a successful prescription , he finds that although his patient is cured , his medicine , from some accident , was not administered . How , then , it will be asked , are we to judge of the value of remedies , if not hy their effects ? Certainly from their effects ;  --  but not as they are ohserved in a solitary case , and in a general manner , in reference only to a final result . There must he a series of observations in which the phenomena are compared in the several cases , and the influence of each remedy ohserved , upon the particular symptoms , as well as its general effect upon the disease as a whole . And before the evidence can be regarded as complete , these observations must have been repeated by different persons , in order that allowances may be made for the influence of a natural partiality for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , empirical remedies are ever subjected to a trial like this . The secrecy which is observed in regard to their true character , and which is secured , or aimed at , by oaths and subscriptions in some cases , and by variations in the composition of the medicine , to elude the results of analysis , in others , necessarily prevents a full investigation of their real merits . It is a fair inference , that the authors of these remedies are not unconscious that such an investigation would not enhance their reputation . Undoubtedly they act wisely , in respect to the accomplishment of their purposes , in insisting upon this secrecy , notwithstanding the unfavorable inferences to which it subjects them . The mystery , which attends the concealment , forms no small part of the causes of their suc // cess . Some years ago , the Parliament of Great Britain gave a Miss Stevens five thousand pounds to make public the composition of her remedy for the stone ; and within a few years the Legislature of one of our sister States gave an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet neither of these remedies has probably ever been used , either by physicians or by empirics , since its contents were made known ; although it can not be doubted , that those learned bodies took care to obtain , what seemed to them good evidence of their efficacy , before they agreed to pay so liberally for them . In the profession , no such concealments are practised or permitted . The whole profession and the public are considered as fairly entitled to the fruits of the knowledge of all its members ; and if valuable observations or discoveries are made by any , they are freely communicated for the general good . Their knowledge is thrown into one common stock , from which each may draw according to the wants of his patients , and his own skill in applying it ; but which no one is permitted to appropriate exclusively to himself . The profession does not recognize the right of any individual member to hoard up his discoveries , whether real or pretended , for his own private emolument . Among liberal , educated men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be made . But if any one should act so unworthily , he would be at once excluded from the profession . Hence the reason , that none of the boasted discoveries of universal or specific remedies are made by physicians . The name of some distinguished physician is indeed often attached to them ; but it is done without his consent or approbation . Whenever the composition of a secret medicine has been made known , it has almost always turned out , that it contained no agents , which had not been before known and in use among physicians . Some unimportant modification of their composition , and a general and confident administration of them without regard to the particular character of the disease , constitute its only peculiarity . The same thing is nearly true , in regard to all tLe external remedies , the different modes of applying friction and fermentations , which bave of late become so fashionable . Physicians do not rely upon these so exclusively , as do some empirics , and as they can not generally go through the mechanical operation them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect to their application of which it is capable ; hut there never has been a time , from the age of Hippocrates to the present day , when they have not been regarded as important auxiliaries in the cure of diseases . In chronic complaints , remedies lose much of their efficacy when the system has become accustomed to their action , so that almost any change , or even leaving off medicine altogether , will many times produce some degree of improvement , which is indeed often only temporary . Practitioners of experience are well aware of this , and regulate their practice accordingly ; hut we have not unfrequently seen a young physician elated with the expectation of accpmplishing a cure where older men have failed , because his first prescriptions have produced such an alleviation of the disease . Many of the cures supposed to be effected by newly-discovered remedies may be accounted for in this manner . While the application is recent , it is extensively spoken of , and reported as an effectual cure ; at length the system becomes accustomed to the remedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novelty of the subject has passed away , and the ultimate failure of the remedy is little known . An attentive observer may remark , however , that it is in general the same individuals who are cured , over and over , by the succession of new remedies which are from time to time in vogue . These different considerations will sufficiently explain why it is , that physicians are habitually incredulous in regard to the wonderful healing powers , so often ascribed to accidental discoveries in medicine . They have so much occasion to know ( and this knowledge is hut too often taught them by disappointments in their own practice ) the difficulty of applying a remedy suited to the peculiar state of the system in each stage of a protracted and complicated disease , with all the advantages that science and experience can afford , that it can not be sup .. posed , that they will place much confidence in the chance operations of ignorant and presumptuous empirics . It may be , that this incredulity , and the contempt for quacks and quackery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not our purpose to defend or a1 ) OlOgiZe for physicians ; but to trace out the causes of some of the peculiarities of character which the profession exhibits . We may remark , however , that it demands no great stretch of charity to find some better // motive for the repugnance of physicians to countenance uneducated practitioners , and their remedies , than the illiberal selfishness not unfrequently imputed to them. * We wish we might hope to come to a result equally favorable to the character of the Medical Profession , in regard to the other point which we noticed . But it can not be denied , that physicians exhihit a sensitiveness and jealousy of temper , especially in their intercourse with each other , far greater than is met with among other educated men . However amiable they may he in every other respect , and they have perhaps a full proportion of amiable qualities in general , if we touch them on a point of professional etiquette , we find ourselves treading upon corns . In many places , this noli me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unfrequently impairs their usefulness . Among ourselves , in this immediate community , it is restrained from breaking out into open quarrels by the excellence of our institutions of medical polity . But in some parts of our country , the profession is divided into factions , which abuse each other with unsparing violence ; and in England , there seems to he no restraint of decency or decorum upon the virulence with which medical men satirize and slander each other . The conduct of individuals in every department and rank in the profession , is there scrutinized and commented upon with unsparing severity ; and every mistake in practice , whether real or imaginary , which jealousy or malevolence can discover , is published with exultation , as proof of the ignorance of some of the first physicians and surgeons of the age . All this is done in language , not merely dishonorable to a learned profession , but which would disgrace the lowest departments of * If it had been more the object of this article to defend the conduct of the Medical Profession in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to show , that in respect to ' pecuniary profit , they are a positive benefit to physicians ; the amount of disease which is removed by their means being much less than the increase occasioned by their mismanagement , and by the neglect of proper remedies , caused by them . We might in that case , too , have taken notice of the very common impression , that to use external remedies only , the same extent of knowledge is not requisite , as to prescribe internal medicines . It is often as difficult to decide when medicines are necessary , as to determine what they shall be ; and it is not easy to conceive of a case , in which any treatment is required , where this question will not arise . // society . To the readers of at least one of the London weekly medical publications , and one that has a very extensive circulation , Sir Astley Cooper , Mr. Abernethy , Mr. Brodie , Sir Henry Earle , and their associates and friends , are as familiarly known by the detracting epithets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to the rest of the world by the names , which their standing in the profession has distinguished . Nor is this slander confined to a few individuals , or a particular class of men , towards whom the editors may be supposed to feel a peculiar dislike . The example thus set is followed by others , and under the pretence of correcting abuses , the same publication has become the vehicle of the jealousies , resentments , and malevolence of discontented physicians , surgeons , apothecaries , and students through the whole kingdom . How little regard is paid to the proprieties of time and circumstances , was shown during the sickness of the late King . It is painful enough to the physician to watch the progress of a fatal disease , with little power even of alleviating the sufferings of his patient , in the seclusion of private life . To do this in public , as it were , with the eyes of a nation fixed upon him , is incomparably worse . That any man , especially any medical man , under such circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anxious solicitude , could look on , without any sympathy either for the patient or his physicians , only to censure and vilify , exhibits a malevolence of character , not easily acquired but by habitual detraction . The state of public feeling too , both in the profession and in the community at large , can not be very sound , which can tolerate such things and encourage them by an extensive patronage . Indeed , it is one of the most mortifying circumstances of all , that these illnatured contentions have brought the profession into such contempt , that the characters of physicians seem hardly to enjoy the protection of the laws . We know not how else to account for it , that in several cases where medical men in England have appealed to the law for defence against the most atrocious libels , juries have awarded damages so low as to operate as an encouragement to the libeller , rather than a punishment . We have said that it is not so among ourselves ; and happy are we that it is not . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profession is more harmonious and peaceable than in Massachusetts . But although we have less open collision , the profession is not even here altogether free // from jealousies and a sensitive regard to etiquette among its members . In the smaller towns , which support but two or three physicians , the intercourse between them is but too often disturbed by personal rivalry , if it be not even wholly interrupted by feelings of actual hostility ; and in the larger towns , we see them carefully attentive to professional etiquette , lest they should either give or receive offence . It is well that it is so , if contention be the only alternative , as the experience of other communities indicates ; but the fact itself shows a consciousness of danger . The causes of this peculiarity are to be found in the nature of the relation between the physician and his patient . This relation is founded altogether upon the confidence which the patient places in the general character and faithfulness of his physician . No man attempts to form an opinion of the wisdom or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire public , learned and unlearned , the whole art of prescribing for disease is a mystery , which none but professional men attempt to penetrate . They see no part of the process in the physidan* s mind , by which he infers the character of the disease from the nature of the symptoms , and therefore they have no power to judge , whether the remedies selected are the deductions of reason , or the mere chance operations of ignorance . Even the result , in any given case , becomes no sure indication of the skill of the physician . We have already seen how many things influence the course of disease , besides the remedies which are applied to it ; and if it be difficult for the physician to determine how much influence the remedy had upon the disease , it is impossible for the patient to judge how far the skill of the physician controlled it . It hardly need be said , how much less stable is a confidence thus circumstanced , than if it were founded upon some adequate knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the case . The intercourse of the physician with his patient is not a mere cold , business matter , but is connected with some of the strongest and tenderest feelings of the human heart . And if there be something like affection in the feelings of the sick towards their physicians , there is often , by a natural consequence , not a little proneness to jealousy . The excited state of mind , produced by sickness and suffering , while it increases the susceptibility to the attentions and sympathy of the physician , adds also to the sensitiveness // to any omission , whether real or apparent , and opens the ear to any unfavorable suggestion , however slight . All this takes place in seclusion and privacy . If any coldness or distrust have arisen , it is unknown to the physician , until he fihds that another is called in his room . Hence he watches with anxiety every thing that looks like an indication of it , and becomes apprehensive of every thing that may tend to produce it ; so it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brought into frequent and open contact , whatever jealousies might arise would be exposed and removed . If quarrels sometimes grew out of them , they would neither be rancorous nor lasting . But in the secluded manner in which they , in most instances , necessarily live in regard to each other , the whisperings of jealousy operate secretly for a time , and then , like the smothered fire , burst forth with greater violence . There is one circumstance in the state of the profession in this country , which is peculiar to us , and which , if it were not counteracted either by th' excellence of our institutions or the good sense of its members , would greatly endanger its peace and harmony . Iii other places , whenever the profession is divided into separate departments , the division is complete . The surgeon does not practise physic , any more than the physician operates as a surgeon ; the oculist confines himself to the eyes , and the chiropodist to the feet . With us , on the contrary , although we have those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they all claim , notwithstanding , an equal share of confidence in the general practice of the profession . It is sufficiently obvious , that a partial attendance may give occasion for attentions and sympathies , which will sometimes afford the opportunity to convert the particular practitioner into the family physician . Such a state of things demands a degree of delicacy of deportment on the part of those who act in this two-fold capacity , which the selfishness of human nature does not often permit us to witn*ss , or a degree of forbearance in the rest of the profession , which , we are sorry to say , the profession has not often exhibited , or else an unusually favora*e state of medical polity , to preserve the balance between them . Having said thus much of those traits in the character of medical men , which are not always the most amiable , it is but justice to the profession , that we should notice , although we // must do it briefly , one which is in every point of view creditable to them . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , we believe , universally allowed , that they are distinguished for their beneficence to the poor . This is not merely the character of distinguished individuals in the profession , or of a considerable number , or a majority of individuals ; but of the profession as a body ; insomuch , that any physician , who should not partake of it , or at least assume it , would lose his reputation and standing . The poor man , however destitute of the means of making compensation , calls for medical aid , with the same confidence that his call will be answered , as the richest man among us . He may go hungry , or ragged , or cold , because he has not the means to purchase food , and clothing , and fuel , or is unwilling to beg them ; but if he be sick , he calls a physician , and feels that he is conferring patronage rather than soliciting charity . Neither is this gratuitous attendance limited to those who are in other respects dependent upon charity . In this good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty , there are some thousands , who never dream of such a thing as a physician 's fee , but who exercise their full privilege of being sick . Boerhanve is said to have called the poor his best patients . ' Happy the young physician who can now so regard them ! It may be said , that there is little merit in a benevolence , which is thus rather forced upon the profession by circumstances , than sought by their own choice . This may be in a degree true in regard to individuals ; although the habitual performance of benevolent deeds , from whatever motive they may have originally proceeded , can hardly fail eventually to excite some corresponding affections in the temper and disposition of the mind . But in respect to the profession as a whole , no such compulsion has ever been , or ever could be exerted upon it , from any circumstance external to it . The custom of attending the poor gratuitously , has now grown , by long usage , into a sort of common law , which the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly abrogate . But it has grown out of the character of the profession itself , and of that of its members . If , therefore , physicians are bound to take shame to themselves for the jealous disposition towards each other , which the circumstances and habits of their profession have entailed upon them , they may well be allowed to offset against their mortification , some pride in their cheerful // compliance with the benevolent customs which they have inherited with it . If it he true , as we have stated , and as we most assuredly believe , that the condition of the Medical Profession is better among us than in any other part of the world , it is not that the individuals of whom it is composed are more amiable or less sensitive in their dispositions here than elsewhere ; but because our institutions are more favorable to the cultivation of a good understanding among them . We have before compared the medical institutions of our own Commonwealth with those of Great Britain , in reference to their power of protecting the public interests from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were led to the conclusion , that ours are not only incomparably more simple and more consistent with the just rights of all parties , but also much the more effective . A similar comparison in reference to the subject of our present inquiry , would , we are fully persuaded , exhibit an equal advantage in favor of our own institutions . In England , and so far as we know , in the other nations of Europe , and in most of the States of our own country , the chief reliance for the regulation of the profession , is upon the direct provisions of the laws , enforced by penalties , which , in some instances , are severe ; in this State , it is upon a sort of concentrated influence of public opinion . The design of the chartered privileges is to secure the community against the ignorance and impositions of empirics . But in attempting this , they have in effect established a difference of rank and of privileges in the profe*sion itself ; and this is not always conformed to the distinctions of scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , whose powers and privileges , as granted by charter , are exceedingly ample , have established it as a by-law , which no force either of persuasion or compulsion has been sufficient to induce them to relax , that no physician shall be elected a Fellow of the College , who has not taken a Doctor 's degree at one of the English Universities , Oxford or Cambridge . This same College has the power ( a power which it has on several occasions shown itself sufficiently disposed to exercise ) to punish by fine and imprison-. ment , any man who shall attempt to practise medicine in London , or within seven miles of it , without a liceiise from its own // Board of Censors . The law , however , compels them to grant the license upon receiving proof of a sufficient education , at whatever school it may have been obtained . The advantages for a medical education at the universities are incomparably less than they are in London and Edinburgh , and in some of the schools on the Continent , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest portion of enterprise and ambition will resort to those schools which offer the greatest advantages , it follows , that a large proportion of the Licentiates in practice , must be men of a higher character and a better education , than those who hold the higher title , and enjoy the extended privileges of Fellows . Still more inevitably does it follow , that there must be perpetual jealousies and collisions between the two classes of physicians . But this is not all . There is still another class of practitioners more numerous than either of these . By the charter of the College of Physicians , as we have said , none but a Licentiate of that College is permitted to practise medicine . More than a hundred years ago , the College attempted to enforce the law against an apothecary , who had visited a sick man , and given him medicine , by which he was cured , without charging a fee . The House of Lords , on an appeal from the King 's Bench , decided that this was not practising physic , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door for all apothecaries to follow the example . They were of course not slow to avail themselves of the privilege ; and in a short time , a very large proportion of the medical practice passed into their hands , while that of the regular physicians declined to little more than consultation . The whole history of this change is curious and instructive ; and singularly illustrates the effect of relying upon legal protection in disregard to the influence of public opinion . It needs no detailed history of the transaction , to show , that at the time when it took place , there was a demand on the part of the community for a more popular class of practitioners , which the law itself could not resist . Whether it was , that the number of physicians was too small , or what is more probable , that relying upon their legal privileges , they demanded more compensation or deference in return for the exercise of their profession , than the public were willing to concede , is of little moment . Nothing but such a necessity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lords , b ) T its decision , and // the public by submitting to it , to do away by a mere fiction of law , with the express stipulations of the royal charter , sanctioned as they were by an act of Parliament . That it was no better than a fiction , is shown both by the nature of the question , and by the subsequent events . For more than a hundred years , the apothecaries in England have performed the duties , which in other countries are performed by physicians . The apothecary visits the patient , and determines what his case requires ; and the only real distinction between him and the physician is , that instead of writing his prescription and sending it to a shop , he supplies the medicine himself , and then , by a degrading subterfuge , evades the law , by charging for medicine only , and obtains compensation for his personal attendance , either by an enormous charge for his medicines , or by a sort of voluntary contribution , which custom has rendered legal . Even this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apothecaries . As they have provided for the education of the members of their company , the court the last winter decided , that it is absurd to regard them as mere mechanists , and that they have the right to demand a fee for the mental labor of prescribing the medicine , as well as for the mechanical labor of preparing it . What are the precise distinctions in the legal rights of this department of the profession , we do not exactly know . But it will readily appear , that here is a third rank in the profession , entitled to , and aiming at , and not unfrequently obtaining , general confidence and employment , as practitioners of medicine . It is sometimes not a little amusing , to witness the struggle between them and their more privileged and higher-titled brethren . While the physicians uniformly speak of them as an inferior class , they seem disposed to forget their origin . They have dropped the name of apothecaries , and commonly style themselves general practitioners . it is curious , too , to observe how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern Europe , drives most of its predecessors before it , or subjugates them , and occupies their places . If we may believe one of the London medical journals , the late King , in his extremity , insisted upon having his apothecary called to the consultations upon his case ; and although this statement has been contradicted , the fact of its being made , shows at least , that the standing of the apothecaries with the community is such as to give some degree of probability to it , even if it be a falsehood. // On the other hand , although they have thus brought themselves into notice and favor , not only without , but in defiance of , the provisions of charters and statutes , we find them no less than their older brethren , relying upon such provisions , for the defence of the privileges they have obtained . They , too , have now their chartered company ; and we find by some of the late journals , that the complaint is already made , that druggists are presuming to prescribe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In twenty years , we shall probably see these same druggists treading in the steps of their predecessors , and exalted by some new legal fiction into acknowledged , if not privileged practitioners . In the ultimate result they , too , may become educated and competent physicians . But in the interim , while the process of transformation is going on , the kingdom is filled with ignorant and unskilful practitioners , and new elements of discord and discussion are introduced into a profession already sufficiently divided . Let us now suppose , that instead of the immense powers conferred on the College of Physicians , by its charter , that body had only received such privileges as are commonly bestowed at the present day on similar corporations , the right to elect its own members , and to regulate their conduct by its by-laws . This we regard as the legitimate , and the only proper means , of combining the influence of individual character and conduct , so as to produce a united effect on public opinion . Had this been the only power of the College of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division between the Fellows and Licentiates . The Fellows would have perceived , that the value of the distinction which they enjoyed as such , could only be maintained by the same professional merit , by which it was first acquired ; and , consequently , instead of framing their by-laws so as to exclude those , whose education and character equally entitle them to the same privileges , they would have taken care so to frame them , that the line of distinction should correspond with that of desert . Had they done otherwise , those who were excluded , no matter by what name they were called , would soon have become the most honorable body . This has been the result in our own State . The Massachusetts Medical Society was originally limited by its act of incorporation , to seventy members . After an experience of // more than twenty years , it was found that the purposes of its institution , either as it respected the profession , or the public , were not , and could not be accomplished by such an organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority was obtained to elect into the Society all the respectable practitioners in the State ; giving the right to all the Licentiates of the Society to claim admission , upon presenting evidence of reputable conduct and character , after three years ' practice . Even this limitation is now regarded as injurious , inasmuch as it divides the profession into two classes ; although the distinction between them is slight and temporary , and there is now pending before the Legislature , a petition for permission to remoVe it . Another effect of such a limitation of the powers of the College of Pby*icians as we have supposed , would have been to prevent the introduction of the apothecaries into practice as physicians , in 1704 . Whatever was the cause of the necessity for additional practitioners of medicine , whether it arose from a deficiency in their number , or the want of a different class , with lower attainments and lower fees , the College of Physicians might easily have prevented or removed it , by diminishing the obstacles to obtaining a license . No one can doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying upon the arbitrary privileges vested in them by the charter , they had felt that their power was derived from the confidence of the public . By this means , the apothecaries would still have been excluded from practising a profession for which they were not educated . At the same time they would have suffered no hardship , because although as apothecaries they might not practise physic ; yet the individuals among them who were in any good degree qualified , would have been admitted to practise , as physicians . The necessity for a greater number , or a different class of practitioners , would have been provided for , without the enormous evil , which we formerly considered , * of introducing a great body of unqualified practitioners of medicine ; and without the additional evil , which it is more particularly our present object to notice , . of entailing perpetual discord and contention upon the profession . That such has been the result of the present institution in England , is sufficiently apparent from what we have already said ; and to such // an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to see how society can much longer endure them , or what remedy can be devised for them . We can hardly too much felicitate ourselves , that we have an institution so simple and powerless , as to be scarcely capable of oppressing any one , and yet so powerful as to be able to restrain , if it can not eradicate , the contentious propensities , which , as we have conceded , prevail too much among physicians . Our Massachusetts Medical Society does this effectually on a large scale . In a smaller sphere , where physicians are brought frequently into close contact with each other , as in one large town , it is necessary that the same system should be carried more into detail , by a more particular code of regulations . This is done for our own city , by the rules of the Boston Medical Association , which direct the course of conduct to be observed by its members , in their professional intercourse . This association has nothing to do with the qualifications of candidates for the profession . It receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Massachusetts Medical Society as competent practitioners , and no others . The principle upon which it is founded , is precisely the same with t ! hat of the general society . It has no power to compel any one to belong to it , or to force a member to conform to its regulations , but simply the right of requiring its members to withhold their assistance from him , if he do not . Nor does it need any other power ; for so long as its requirements are reasonable and proper , the community will not place confidence , to any considerable extent , in any physician who has not the confidence of the profession . There is not a man among us so powerful , that he can withstand its regulations , without suffering materially , not only in his feelings and his respectability , but also in his business and emoluments . It is true that these regulations are often disregarded ; and there are those , who aim at their own advancement by breaking them .. But although they may gain some temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraints than others , yet in the result , it has always proved injurious to their personal interests . The loss of their own self-respect , by the violation of the obligations of honor and duty , into which they have voluntarily entered , is necessarily followed by a diminution of the respect and confidence of others . Thus it has turned out , that those who have sought to advance themselves // in this way , have in the end attained a less favorable standing than they would have acquired by a more honorable course.
