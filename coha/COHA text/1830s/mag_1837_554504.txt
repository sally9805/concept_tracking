txt MORAL evidence is of two kinds , - that of testimony , and that of circumstances . Not that the two are always , or indeed often , entirely distinct each from the other ; for the circumstances on which a train of evidence is based , must for the most part rest on testimony , while testimony often bears to be interpreted as the type of some peculiar and decisive posture of circumstances . But , in the form in which evidence is applied to the establishment of any point of doubt or difficulty , there is always room for this division . We found our decision either simply on the assertion of competent witnesses , or else on the tacit documents presented by well-ascertained phenom // ena , which stand in the relation of cause , effect , or necessary concomitant , with one or the other side of the question at issue . The latter , or circumstantial evidence , is by far the strongest , nay , occupies nearly the same position in historical and moral inquiries , which in the exact sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Providence , and can not lie . It may indeed he rashly inferred and applied ; voiceless circumstances may he tortured into speech ; but , where the language is unforced and genuine , the proof derived from it is as sure as the laws of the divine administration are unchangeable . The evidence of mere testimony , on the other hand , in moral reasoning , corresponds with hypothesis in the exact sciences . It establishes only a degree of probability , varying indefinitely with the number and credibility of the witnesses ; nor can it be said to approach to certainty , so long as a single opposing testimony can he cited . It may be safely relied on with regard to events of recent occurrence and extensive notoriety , or where the witnesses are well known to he keen-sighted , disinterested , and trustworthy ; but it loses its worth and its power of conviction with every darkening degree of obscurity and antiquity in the events to which it is applied , and with every shade of ignorance , doubt , or suspicion , that may rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains strength only by the accumulation of independent testimonies ; and this accumulation must be made up entirely of sound and firm materials , a single dubious , irrelevant , or objectionable testimony going far towards invalidating the whole body of proof of which it forms a part . It has been hitherto mainly by the evidence of testimony , that Christian writers have attempted to substantiate the genuineness of our canonical Gospels . This mode of proof , in different hands , has been liable to two opposite and equally fatal objections . Some , unwilling to adduce any but the most unexceptionable witnesses , have cited too few ( as compared with the multitude , which in such a case might reasonably be expected , ) to create even a high degree of probability in favor of the positions , to which they testify . Others ( like Less and Lardner ) have weakened the cause they aimed to serve , by the heterogeneous combination of real and supposed , genuine and spurious , competent and untrustworthy testimonies . They have made vast and precious accumulations of // materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather by the formless chaos , in which they have presented these materials , and by the stress , which they often place on obscure and doubtful testimony , their works are perhaps as well adapted to cherish skepticism in some minds , as to confirm faith in others . Mr. Norton , in the work under review , has made , so far as we know , the first essay to prove , solely by circumstantial evidence , the genuineness of the Gospels . This mode of reasoning has , we are well aware , been long and successfully employed with regard to the authenticity of the Gospel history ; but we apprehend that its application to the critical question , whether our Gospels were indubitably the works of their reputed authors , has never before been attempted . This volume then , though its materials have always been the property of the Christian world , is , in its aim and structure , original and unique . The writer rejects all witnesses , whose testimony lies open to any rational objection , as also all those , who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves alone , whose assertions can not be viewed as the voice of an age or a community , or as indubitable indications of some peculiar and pertinent posture of circumstances or course of events . By this expurgating process , he admits so few witnesses upon the stand , that , in the mere form of independent and unconnected testimony , their voices would be of little weight , and the argument founded upon them unsubstantial and vague . But he connects each individual testimony with the circumstances under which it is given , with the position and relations of its author , with the light cast from extraneous sources upon his fidelity and competency , and with the general features of the times as made known on unquestionable authority ; and on all these points he never assumes the postulates of those , whose sentiments coincide with his own , but uniformly takes his departure from the admissions of his opponents . He likewise so arranges and confronts his few select witnesses , as to make them mutually illustrate and confirm each other 's testimony . And then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsic probability , grounded on the results of uniform experience , and the recognised laws of human belief and conduct . He has thus constructed , on fewer and simpler data than have ever before been deemed competent , // a fabric of adamantine firmness . He has placed beyond dispute the authorship of our canonical Gospels ; and , this point being established , little is left for the defender of the Christian faith to do ; for , if our Gospels were written by the men whose names they bear , the authenticity of their records and the divine mission of their great teacher hardly need the show of argument . In the light , in which we have presented it , the work before us not only demands a grateful welcome from the theological reviewer ; but may claim respectful notice from a merely literary journal , as a rare specimen of erudite archeological research , acute criticism , and invincible argument , while , did not the magnitude of the subject preclude comment on minor beauties , we might hold forth this volume to our readers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of slyle , a most valuable contribution to the infant literature of the country . For these reasons we offer a hasty sketch of its design , and analysis of its contents , in the unhesitating assurance5 that in so doing we shall not be regarded as transgressing our legitimate scope . Mr. Norton 's work is not designed to meet the cavils of the class of men commonly called infidels . They , as a body , have been long since driven from the fair field of argument , and have contented themselves with hurling the missiles of ridicule and abuse . But , among professedly Christian theologians , there have recently been propounded and cherished theories , which seem to many of their brethren no less subversive of the foundations of our common faith , than were the unmasked attacks of Hume and Voltaire . The school of critics , to which we refer , at the head of which we must place the name of Eichhorn , is very numerous in Germany , has found in England an able expositor and defender in Bishop Marsh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authors of this school , the Gospel of John is for the most part admitted as genuine , or , at least , its genuineness is left open for discussion . Their favorite theory relates only to the first three Gospels ; and , though it admits that these might have been in a certain sense the works of Matthew , Mark , and Luke , it goes the whole length of denying , that , as transmitted to us , they were their original , independent , and uncorrupted compositions . We quote , as condensed by Mr. // Norton , an outline of the scheme elaborated by Eichhorn and Marsh . " There was very early in existence a short historical sketch of the life of Christ , which may be called the Original Gospel . This was , probably , provided for the use of those assistants of the apostles in the work of teaching Christianity , who had not themselves seen the actions and heard the discourses of Christ . It was however but a rough sketch , a brief and imperfect account , without historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , according to Eichhorn , very different from our four Gospels . These present no rough sketch , such as we must suppose the first essay upon the life of Jesus to have been ; but , on the contrary , are works written with art and labor , and contain portions of his life , of which no mention was made in the first preaching of Christianity . ' This Original Gospel was the basis both of the earlier gospels used during the first two centuries , and of the first three of our present Gospels , namely , those of Matthew , Mark , and Luke , by which those earlier Gospels were finally superseded . The earlier gospels retained more or less of the rudeness and incompleteness of the Original Gospel . " But they very soon fell into the hands of those who undertook to supply their defects and incompleteness , both in the general compass of the history , and in the narration of particular events . Not content with a life of Jesus , which , like the Gospel of the Hebrews and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were those who early prefixed to the Memoirs used by Justin l*iartyr , and to the gospel of Cerinthus , an account of his descent , his birth , and the period of his youth . In like manner , we find , upon comparing together , in parallel passages , the remaining fragments of these Gospels , that they were receiving continual accessions. * * * * * By these continual accessions , the original text of the life of Jesus was lost in a mass of additions , so that its words appeared among them but as insulated fragments . Of this any one may satisfy himself from the account of the baptism of Jesus , which was compiled out of various gospels . The necessary consequence was , that at last truth and falsehood , authentic and fabulous narratives , or such , at least , as through long tradition had become disfigured and falsified , were brought together promiscuously . The longer these narratives passed from mouth to mouth , the more uncertain and disfigured they would become . At last , at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order , as far as might be , to preserve the true accounts concerning the life of // Jesus , and to deliver them to posterity as free from error as possible , the Church , out of the many gospels which were extant , selected four , which had the greatest marks of credibility , and the necessary completeness for common use . rrherc are no traces of our present Gospels of Matthew , Mark , and Luke , before the end of the second and the beginning of the third century . 1ren*eus , about the year 202 , first speaks decisively of four Gospels , and imagines all sorts of reasons for this particular number and Clement of Alexandria , about the year 216 , labored to collect divers accounts concerning the origin of these four Gospels , in order to prove that these alone should be acknowledged as authentic . From these facts , it is evident , that first , about the end of the second , anJ the beginning of the third century , the Church labored to establish the universal authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not altogether in their present form , yet in most respects such as we now have them , and to procure their general reception in the Church , with the suppression of all other gospels then extant . " Posterity would indeed have been under much greater obligations , ig together with the Gospel of John , the Church had established , by public authority , only the first rough sketch of the life of Jesus , which was given to the earliest missionaries to authenticate their preaching ; after separating it from all its additions and augmentations . But this was no longer possible ; for there was no copy extant free from all additions , and the critical operation of separating this accessory matter was too difficult for those times . ' " Many ancient writers of the Church , ' Eichhorn subjoins itt a note , doubted the genuineness of many parts of our Gospels ; hut were prevented from coming to a decision by want of critical skill . ' " - pp. 9- 13 . It is chiefly to establish the uncorrupted genuineness of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Norton has prepared the work before us , which , however , as it is in the shape of a positive argutnent , not of a reply or rejoinder , might be read with no less interest and profit by one whose faith was endangered or shaken by any other influence whatsoever . The propositions necessary to be established , in order to vindicate the authority of the Gospels , both from the attacks of foes and the theories of injudicious friends , are , first , " that the Gospels remain essentially the same as they were originally composed " ; and , secondly , that they " have been ascribed to their true authors . " The circumstantial proof of // these two propositions , constitutes the two main divisions of the work before us ; and the general formula of proof , to which every argument employed is reduced , might be stated as follows ; " The testimony cited could not have been given , or the fact adduced could not have existed , under the wellknown and universally admitted circumstances of time and place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . " We now proceed to give a condensed view of the arguments , by which each of the foregoing propositions is established . 1 . That the Gospels remain essentially the same as they were composed , would appear from the present virtual coincidence of all extant manuscripts and versions . There have been collated nearly seven hundred manuscripts of the whole , or of portions , of the Greek text , written in various and distant countries , from the fifth century downward . To these we must add numerous manuscripts of ancient versions in no less than eleven languages , European , Asiatic , and African ; also many manuscripts of the works of early fathers , especially of commentaries , in which the text of the Gospels is expressly quoted . From all these sources inay indeed be brought together a vast body of various readings , yet most of them so slight and trivial , that they can be ascrihed solely to the common accidents of transcription ; and nine tenths , perhaps we may say ninety-nine hundredths of them , affecting only interchangeable particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adopt any one of these manuscripts or versions as the standard text , and the deviations from it , which the others will present , will be neither greater , nor ( in proportion to the number collated ) more numerous , than are found in the antique copies extant of classic and other authors generally . So far then as the essential coincidence of the sources collated for the text of the Georgics , or of Cicero 's Orations , proves that Virgil 's and Cicero 's works were not made what they are by successive additions and improvements by different hands , but that they remain essentially as they were written , so far do similar premises , with rebard to the Gospels , warrant similar conclusions concerning them . From the day that our Gospels existed in any form , they must have been prized and sought ; copies of them would have been taken in every stage of their elaboration ; and these copies could not but have been recopied and perpetuated . It is in the very nature of things impossible , that the fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the now extant exemplars of works so widely circulated . It is indeed pretended by Eichhorn , that " the Church , " about the end of the second or beginning of the third century , selected from the many Gospels then extant , our canonical four , as the authoritative standards of history and faith . He admits that they had then attained their present size and form . But there was at that time no organized universal church , or general ecclesiastical government , or system of concerted action ; nor was there the least approach to any thing of thiskind , until the council of Nice in 325 . On the other hand , at the date assumed by Eichhorn , Christians were separated by frequent persecutions , by wide and arduous distances , by difference of language , by religious alienations and controversies ; arid even the schism between the Eastern and Western churches may be traced thus early , the former having already been excommunicated by the Bishop of Rome . Where thea was " the Church " universal , which had either the authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing hierarchy , a set of symbolical books to the exclusion of those previously used ? To the exclusion of those previously used , we say ; for no one pretends that Christians in general were without some record of their Master 's life . In fact , there is abundant proof that Gospels , genuine or spurious , were in current use in every Christian community . There iriust have been , on the lowest possible estimate , at least three millions of Christians at the end of the second century . Allowing only a copy of a single Gospel to every fifty souls , there were then extant , and scattered over the then known world , sixty thousand copies of Gospels . If of other than our present Gospels , on Eichhorn 's hypothesis , they must have been taken by ecclesiastical authority out of the hands of the everywhere-scattered and many-tongued owners , and so generally destroyed as to prevent their reproduction by copyists , * and in their place must have been substituted , by the same authority , copies , in every * The apocryphal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tionable motives , brought from the dust of antiquarian shelves into popular circulation , need not be considered in this connexion ; for their comparatively recent origin , and the entire falsity of the pretence that they ever had reception or authority in the church , are at once well known to the veriest tyros , and admitted by the wildest visionaries in biblical criticism . // language , of our present Gospels ; and all this must have taken place among orthodox and heretics , in the East and in the West , so quietly and with so little opposition , as to leave no trace in the history of the times , as to he entirely forgotten in the next century , nay , more , as to enable Irenaws , ( who died in 202 , and must have lived in the very days of this overturn , ) in writing against heretics , with whom he must have been on his guard against arrogant assumptions , to refer to our present Gospels as the only ones that had ever been in existence , and as then retaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospels extant at the end of the second century , to the general reception and acknowledged authority of which we have the testimony of Irenaws , were the same Gospels that we now have , we can account for the footing which they then held in the Christian community , only by assigning to the same identical Gospels a date so much earlier , as to throw back their authorship , in their present form , upon the age of their reputed authors , and thus to settle the question of their integrity . These considerations may be fortified by numerous collateral arguments . And foremost among these we may place the reverence with which the Gospels were uniformly regarded by the early Christians . There is hardly an ecclesiastical father , who does not bear ample testimony to as general and implicit a veneration for these records , as is now entertained for them by a vast majority of private believers . This reverence , in these latter days , might be grounded on ignorance ; but it could not have been so at a period when all the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy reach of the curious and skeptical . Books which were undergoing a constant process of interpolation and change , at the pleasure of every transcriber , could not have fastened themselves so strongly on the devout veneration of the pious ; nor , on the other hand , would piety have permitted a process thus sacrilegious , on books that had once gained so strong a hold on the reverence of the Christian community . In fact , the fathers are not silent with regard to the interpolation of their sacred records ; but express themselves with the most devout horror concerning so foul a sin , which they could not have done , bad these very books been the result of successive interpolations . In fine , the reverence , which they uniformly manifest for the Gospel. , is of a kind and degree , which , in // accordance with the laws of mind , can be accounted for only by supposing these narratives the uncorrupted works of Apostles and primitive disciples . Again , there is in the Gospels themselves , abundant internal evidence , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Each Gospel is distinguished from the others , by individual peculiarities in the use of language , and other characteristics exclusively its own . Any one familiar with the originals , perceives , for instance , that Mark , is a writer less acquainted with the Greek language than Luke , and having less command of proper expression . flis style is , in consequence , more affected by the idiom of the Hebrew , more harsh , more unformed , more barbarous , in the technical sense of that word . If you were to transfer into Luke 's Gospel a chapter from that of Mark , every critic would at once perceive its dissimilitude to the general style of the former . The difference would be still more remarkable , if you were to insert a portion from Mark in John 's Gospel . But the very distinctive character of the style of the Gospels generally , and the peculiar character of each Gospel , are irreconcilable with the notion , that they have been brought to their present state by additions and alterations of successive copiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel a diversity of style and character . Instead of the uniformity that now appears , the modes of conception and expression would have been inconsistent and vacillating. " - pp. 78 , 79 . But , waving considerations growing out of each evangelist 's individuality of style , and the well-known difficulty of imitating another 's style so closely that the difference of hands can not be traced , there is yet an historical circumstance , which would have rendered the composition of the entire Gospels , or the interpolation of any portions of them , at a later than their usually assigned date , peculiarly impracticable . The Gospels are written throughout in Hellenistic Greek , a dialect created by the transfusion of Hebrew idioms into the Greek , and which could therefore have been written by none but native or naturalized Jews . Now it is throu6h the Gentile part of the Church , that the Gospels have been transmitted to us ; and , after the death of the Apostles and the destruction of Jerusalem , there was an entire separation and bitter enmity between the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received their Gospels from the Jews , it // must have been at a date not much subsequent to that , at which their authorship is usually fixed . And if the Gospels were afterwards interpolated , it must have been by Gentile transcribers , who were generally ignorant ( as Origen complains ) of Hebrew , and who yet were able to give to their Greek so Hebraistic a savour , as to render it undistinguishatile from that of men , who were by birth or education Hebrews of the Hebrews . The idea of such interpolation bears absurdity on its very face . Once more , the Gospels contain no anachronisms ; and the whole history of fiction and of literary imposture shows us , how almost absolutely impossible it is for the most skilful and intelligent author , who takes his stand in a different age from his own , to avoid anachronisms . Even Eichhorn admits , ( in a series of remarks on the records of the first three evangelists , ) that " every thing in their narratives corresponds to the age in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must believe them to have been placed . " This remark is unquestionably true ; but without a miracle it could not have been true , had facts accorded with its author 's hypothesis of the gradual augmentation of the Gospels by successive hands . The following is also a strong point , and strongly stated . " The character and actions of Jesus Christ , as exhibited in the Gospels , are peculiar and extraordinary beyond all example . They distinguish him , in a most remarkable manner , from all other men . They display the highest moral sublimity . We perceive , throughout an ultimate purpose of the most extensive benevolence . But this character of Christ , which appears in the Gospels , is exhibited with perfect consistency . Whatever he is represented as saying or doing , corresponds to the fact or the conception , - call it which we will , - that he was a teacher sent from God , endued with the highest powers , and intrusted with the most important office , ever exercised upon earth . The different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how unlikely it is that we should have found this consistency in the representation of Christ , if the Gospels had been in great part the work of inconsiderate or presumptuous copiers ; or if they had consisted , in great part , of a collection of traditionary stories ; and especially if these stories had been , as some have imagined , either fabulous accounts of miracles , or narratives having a foundation in truth , but corresponding so little to the real fact , as to have assumed a miraculous character , // which there was nothing in the fact itself to justify . It is incredible , that under such circumstances there should be the consistency , which now appears in the Gospels . On the contrary , we might expect to find in them stories , of a kind similar to those extant in certain writings , that have been called apocryphal gospels ; which betray their falsehood at first view , by their incongruity with the character and actions of our Saviour , as displayed by the evangelists . We shall have occasion to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories referred to , must perceive and acknowledge their striking dissimilitude to the narratives of the Gospels . A dissimilitude of the same kind would have existed between different parts of the Gospels , if they had grown , as has been imagined , to their present form , by a gradual contribution of traditional tales . On the contrary , their consistency in the representation of our Saviour is one among the many proofs , that they have been preserved essentially as they were first written . " - pp. 86-88 . A part of the considerations which have been adduced , apply to St. Matthew 's Gospel , only from the date of its translation into the Greek . But that the Hebrew exemplar , from which this translation was made , had suffered little or no corruption or augmentation , we may infer from the general uniformity and consistency of style , from the absence of all anachronisms , from the strongly marked and pervading individuality of the work , and from its coincidence in the main with the other three Gospels , to which all the foregoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the volume before us is devoted to the evidence , that the Gospels have been attributed to their true authors . Mr. Norton first proves , by authorities beyond dispute or objection , that , during the last quarter of the second century , our four Gospels were attributed to the writers whose names they now bear . The witnesses to this fact are not to be regarded in the same light with those , who might have given similar testimony concerning Horace or Tacitus . The fathers of the Church were official personages ; they speak in the name , and are to be regarded as the representatives of their fellow-Christians . The fulness and diversity of the attestations , which they have left us , prove , therefore , beyond a question , that , at the close of the second century , Gospels , essentially the same with our present Gospels , were received throughout the Church , as the works of Matthew , // Mark , Luke , and John . There is earlier testimony bearing on the same point ; hut it is objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first instance , avail himself of it . But he takes his stand on the ground conceded by his opponents , and proves that these testimonies could not have been given , at the time when , and in the circumstances under which they were given , had not Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John written the Gospels that bear their respective names . Now Christians at the period in question were fully able to determine , whether the Gospels were genuine or not . Iren*-us , who died in 202 , informs us , that he had listened to the preaching of Polycarp , a disciple of St. John . Only a single link then was needed , to connect the old men of his day with the apostolic age . Had the Gospels been written at a later date , or by different authors , than we now suppose , there would have been those living , who could have traced them to their spurious origin , or could , at least , have borne the negative testimony , that they had heard of no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The absence of all such testimony is positive proof , that the facts included in the genuineness of the Gospels were within the distinct knowledge of Iren*eus and his contemporaries . In estimating the weight of the foregoing consideration , we must rememher , that the question of the genuineness of the Gospels could not , at that early age , have been a matter of indifference . Christians were then obliged for their religion 's sake to sunder numerous social ties , to discharge peculiar and arduous duties , to lead lives of the strictest self-denial , and to encounter enmity and persecution . They constantly appeal to the Gospels , as the sole authoritative records of the facts and motives , by which they were induced to do and suffer what they did and suffered . Such duties as they discharged , and such sacrifices as they made , are not wont to be called forth by a known imposture , or a tale of doubtful origin . Their conduct can he accounted for , only by supposing that they were acquainted with the history of the books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " knew that the records were true. ** Once more , the connexion of the Gospels with the other universally received books of the New Testament , confirms their genuineness With regard to eleven of these books , viz , the Acts of the Apostles and ten of St. Paul 's Epistles , // we have evidence of a peculiar kind , arising from the undesigned coincidences , so admirably drawn forth in Paley 's " Horte Paulinte . " Now , if these eleven books are proved genuine , it will seem improbable that spurious books should have gained equal or superior credit with the Christian community . The genuineness of a part is strolg presumptive evidence of that of the whole . The discrepancies between the several Gospels add great weight to the argument in favor of their genuineness . These discrepancies were observed by the fathers , and occasioned them ( especially Origen ) very great perplexity . But they never attempted to relieve themselves of their difficulties by casting doubts upon the authority of either record ; a fact which proves incontestably , that the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gainsaid . In fact , no other hypothesis , but that the four all proceeded from the highest authority , can account for their general reception as possessed of equal claims to credence and veneration . Had one been first received , the discrepancies between the others and it , would have kept them in disesteem ; or , had all four been simultaneously thrown upon the Christian community , their mutual contradictions , apparent and real , would have cast them into common discredit and oblivion . But , if the authorship of the Gospels was known , then the authority of the writers would have overborne , as it did , the doubts which seemingly inconsistent accounts might have cast upon the sacred narratives . With regard to the first three Gospels , our author shows very lucidly , that their peculiar phenomena of coincidence and discrepancy can be accounted for on no other ground , than that of their genuineness . Mr. Norton 's argument is complete and conclusive , without the testimony of Justin Martyr ; and Justin Martyr is put out of court by the critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Memoirs than our present Gospels . But Mr. Norton , after having shown that he can well dispense with this witness , vindicates his right to testify to the point at issue , and exhibits the clearness , fulness , and weight of his testimony , in a chapter of great acumen and power . A short chapter follows , giving the testimony of Papias ( as transmitted by Eusebius ) to the genuineness of Matthew 's and Mark 's Gospels , and of Luke to that of his own in the proern to his " Acts of the Apostles . " // Mr. Norton lays no stress on any arguments drawn from the writings commonly attributed to the apostolic fathers . In those writings , there are many things that accord with , and none that militate against , the contents of our canonical Gospels . But they contain no direct and formal quotations from our evangelists . Supposing them genuine , the facts and sayings , which they cite from the life of Jesus , might have been learned by oral communication , and , in that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would hear only indirectly upon the genuineness of the Gospels . But most of these writings must , by impartial criticism , he referred to an age , which furnishes us a competent number of direct and sufficient witnesses , and can therefore add but little to the weight of evidence . We have thus given a cursory and imperfect outline of Mr. Norton 's course of argument , avoiding , as far as possible , theological technicalities , and confining ourselves to considerations , that can he appreciated by the general scholar , no less than by the professed critic . The notes to this work form a large and well-arranged digest of subsidiary matter , relating to the present text of the New Testament , the theories that have been framed to account for the origin of the first three Gospels , Justin Martyr 's Quotations , and the genuineness and worth of the writings ascribed to the apostolic fathers . Our limits will hardly permit us to give any account or analysis of these notes ; and this we the less regret , as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti also involve several points of controversy , which it would be wide of our scope to discuss , and the settlement of which affects but indirectly the argument constituting the body of the work . The remarks in Note A. , on the systematic classification of the copies of the New Testament into three Recensions , adopted by Griesbach and others , will doubtless seem to many readers to rest on less substantial grounds , than those which form the basis of the classification . For ourselves , we have been convinced by the note , that Griesbach pushed his idea of the Recensions too far , used extravagant language concerning it , and tortured into its defence many irrelevant facts and phenomena ; but , with all the allowance which these considerations compel us to make , we can not but think , that there yet remain sound and solid arguments in favor of the classification . In Note D. , " on the Origin of the Correspondences // among the first three Gospels , " Mr. Norton passes in review all the principal theories of which these books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eichhorn 's hypothesis concerning them , and proves that their peculiar phenomena can he accounted for only by supposing them the original works of independent authors . To the critical scholar , this discussion will constitute one of the most interesting and valuable portions of the volume . Seldom , perhaps never , has oil so well beaten been brought into the sanctuary of our faith , as in the work uhder review . Its preparation was commenced in 1819 ; and the studies and labors of every succeeding year have contributed to its present completeness and accuracy . The result belies not the time which it has cost . The work can not but take its stand at once with those of Butler , Paley , and Lardner , among the main pillars and bulwarks of Christianity . Apart from the general service , which it must render to the common cause of our faith , it will perform also a service by no means contemptible for the rising generation of theologians . It will make them cautious and suspicious readers of ultra German theorists . Mr. Norton has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credner , of misstatement , inaccuracy , and inconsistency , as fully to convince us , ( what indeed we had already suspected with regard to the first-named , ) that , while the lightning of their quick-glancing imaginations may often reveal rich veins of truth , and their vast treasuries of learning may enable us to work these veins successfully , yet they can he trusted no farther , than they can be verified . We hope that we may soon see the remaining volumes of this invaluable work ; and will close our grateful notice of the present , by quoting from its Preface the following account of what we are permitted to expect . " It is my purpose next to show the strong confirmation of the more direct historical evidence , afforded by the manner in which the Gospels were regarded hy the early Gnostic heretics ; a field which , though not untrodden , has been unexplored ; and then , after endeavouring to remove some misapprehensions respecting the historical , to proceed to the collateral evidence for the genuineness of the Gospels . The larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been written ; hut it is yet to be subjected to revision , and , after my past experience , it would be unwise for me to hazard a calculation respecting the // time that may be required to prepare for the public the two volnines which will finish my design . Should life and health be granted me , I shall proceed as I have proposed ; but it should be observed , that this volume is , in its nature , an independent work , and might have been so published , had no others been intended to follow .
