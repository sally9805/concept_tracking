Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : PASSAGES . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1836 ) " Be not conformed to the World . " . .... " The fashion of this world passeth away . " Trust not the world ! It hath a smile And sunny garniture of bloom , Which charm the eye a little while , And bid the soul forget the tomb : The pomp and pageantry it wears , To lure the spirit from her God , Are crossed with doubts , and dimmed by cares , And scourged by stern Affliction 's rod . For who , to mortal ills a prey , Can from life 's darker features turn ? From hopes that beam but to betray  --  From darksome thoughts that sting and burn ? Who can forget that Death remains A hidden spectre by his side  --  Whose lifted shaft a Power restrains , To which no conquest is denied ? Trust not the world ! Oh ! who can know The vile deceits that lurk therein : Unholy dreams that vainly glow  --  Visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers that germ in spring , And blossom in the balmy air ; To which revolving days must bring The blight and dimness of despair . Thus , when in darkness and in storm , The season 's closing hours appear , And winds , no longer sweet and warm , Wail sadly round the dying year  --  Where , then , the rose ? and where the breath It used upon the breeze to pour ? Its scentless leaves are pale in death , Its beauty quenched for evermore . Trust not the world ! for thus , too soon , Its poor , ephemeral raptures die ; And the sick heart rejects the boon Of hopes not garnered from on high . They pall at last ; they fail ; they fade As summer clouds , whose golden wings , Disrobed of light , receive the shade , Which Night from her dominion flings . No : let the burdened heart arise ! Let its bruised chords with love be stirred  --  With love , whose impulse never dies  --  Which flows from God 's eternal Word ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stream whose waters never cease ; The dove , whose ever-tireless wing , Wafts to the soul its spell of peace ! Philadelphia . Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : SYRACUSE . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1836 ) August and queenly spectre of the past ! Along thy waters , and within thy walls , There breathes a deep-toned voice , that tells of days When thou wert throned in glory and in might  --  Admired and frequented ; when armied hosts Trode thy illumined streets , and music filled The old Pentapolis . Five cities , then , Were thine , in bands of union ; and around , Fair lands that teemed with rich fertility , Sent incense to the skies . Above , abroad , The voice of love and happiness arose . Within thy galleries pale statues glowed , And Painting beamed in exquisite repose . Voluptuous life enkindled every heart  --  The conqueror trode thy ways , and echoing hymns Of triumph sounded through thy shining halls , Lit to receive the victor . There , in state , Leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great Marcellus wept . He saw the wreck That war had scattered round him  --  and he mourned To think that scenes so bright should fade so soon . Thou wast a world of marvels , ere the star That lit the Wise to Bethlehem , gemmed the east , And heralded a Saviour . Ere that morn , Thy streets resounded with the hum of men , The charger 's tramplings , and the clang of arms . Thou wast a brilliant mystery  --  and from far , Gathered from many nations , were thy spoils , Thy garlands , and thine honours . Then the dawn Of that bright day which gave the world a God Co-equal with the Father , followed on , And shadowed all thy glory . And to thee One came , in humble guise , upon whose brow A sweet and heavenly peace in beauty shone .  --  Tow'rds proud Rome journeying , the saintly Paul Reposed within thy gates , and talked of God . Oh , had thy thousands then but heard his voice , And trode the way he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the chain That galled thy haughty dwellers , galled no more . What , lacking the warm hope which filled his breast , Were all the remnants of thy pride to thee ? What the broad waters and the swelling sail , And trees that waved in heaven ? What the piles For unknown gods upheaved ,  --  or temples old ? What Arethusa 's fount , that sheening , welled To cheer the rose-lipped nymphs that lingered there ?  --  That travel-worn apostle , in his soul , Kept a superior scene  --  and could have told Of the bright mansions in a better land : Of golden streets , where constantly a train Of shining ones , strayed , " harping with their harps , " And breathing glorious anthems : of pure streams , Through vernal fields meandering ; and of days O'er which no night descended . From his lip , Thou might'st have learned , oh Syracuse ! of love And friendship , such as this low earth of ours Can show nor sign nor symbol . Damon 's faith Was weak and wavering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian 's soul on high , And yields him dreams of heaven ! Thou art o'erthrown , proud city ! and the breath Of pestilence along thy broken streets , And in thy ruined fanes , sweeps to and fro : The dwindled numbers of thy citizens , With pallid lips and cheeks , and languid eyes , Attest thy desolation . On the wave , Where Athens ' armies rode , there lies a shade , That from the past has gathered like a pall . A midnight hangs upon thee  --  not alone External darkness , but the dim eclipse Of moral desolation . Churches rent , And crumbling walls are thine , and all the shows Of sadness and of ruin . Heaven 's frown Is visible around thee . Rise ! thou wreck Of by-gone might , and call upon thy God :  --  So , haply , though to those within thy bound The earth be dark and cheerless , they may see A city builded by the Eternal 's hand , Whose walls are of salvation ; where nor war Nor storm , nor heaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope in gloom go down : But where a Presence , which is life and light , Broods ever like the grandeur of the sun , That sails through summer skies of boundless blue . Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : CHILDHOOD . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1836 ) Fair child ! rejoicing in the morn of being , Whose vernal landscapes brighten to the view ; Scenes of untold delight and beauty seeing , Which wake impressions rapturous and new  --  Thine eyes are smiling , like the smiling skies , And peaceful visions in thy spirit rise . Thou know'st not yet the cares that dim existence ,  --  That pain the bosom with their bitter stings ; A radiant glory gilds the onward distance , And joyous Hope makes music with her wings : And bright on cheek and lip thy thoughts repose , Like sunshine beaming on the early rose . Content is thine , and childhood  --  blessed things ! Dreams that are gladness to the new-born soul , And innocence itself  --  a stream that springs From chrystal fountains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sway divine  --  Untainted dreams and pleasures  --  such are thine ! Alas ! as darksome years shall pass above thee , These gorgeous pictures of the mind will fade ; Uncounted changes will with sorrow move thee , ' Till thou from earthly ills shalt shrink afraid : ' Till , from the anguish of Affliction 's rod , Thy suffering heart is taught to trust in God . Then , let the tempest come ! Though thou inherit That fatal legacy which mortals own ;  --  The gradual cloud that o'erspreads the spirit  --  The gay hopes wasted , and the pleasures gone  --  For thee , within a cup no ill can dim , The draught of Life shall sparkle to the brim ! For when thou learnest , from that wholesome teaching Which this dull earth to mortals must bestow , That the high soul in vain for bliss is reaching , Tow'rds aught that shines celestial worlds below  --  Then shall thine aspirations soar above , Where all is beauty , and repose , and love . Then shall the ransomed soul , its prize receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And for those blessed realms , corruption leaving , Survey a prospect that no cloud may shade . Oh , blessed Child ! such destiny is thine , If thou but worship at thy Saviour 's shrine ! Philadelphia . Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : THE DEATH SCENE . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1836 ) Thou hast a solemn power , oh Death ! Earth 's treasures are thine own ; The sigh of age  --  the infant 's breath  --  The cottage  --  and the throne ! All these , thou spectral Shape ! are thine ,  --  And at thy stern behest , The form beloved , the face divine , Are laid in dust to rest . When time is fresh , and hope is new , And youth is lingering nigh , The world is beauty to the view , And peace informs the sky ; The vernal field  --  the dancing stream  --  The gay clouds as they sail , Beguile the heart , awake the dream , And load the scented gale . Then , all is life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light are fed , That like the passing meteor 's gleam , The bolts of Death are sped ? That love and joy , dependent hang Upon a Spectre 's nod , Whose will can waken gloom or pang , And send the soul to God ? ' T is even thus ! From day to day That mournful Power is nigh ; His frown can cloud the brightest ray That ever lights the sky : Yea , at his touch , the palsied heart Is hush 'd , with all its chords ,  --  While the warm lip forgets its part , And murmurs noteless words . ' T is thus with earth ! Its haughty kings Grow weary of its charms , And turn from all its gilded things , To Death 's remorseless arms : Footnote : 1Kb For joy , alas ! beneath the sky , With Chance is ever bound ; And mortal hopes , that soar on high Fall soonest to the ground .

" But when a scene of death is bathed With radiance from above ; When features by diseases scathed , Beam in celestial love ;  --  When with sharp pains fond raptures strive , And fill the speaking eye ,  --  Who would not like the Christian live , And like the Christian die ? What though the burning tears of grief Fall swift among his friends ? Like Autumn 's full and golden sheaf , He to his grave descends : Garnered to that low bourne , whereon A ray serene is shed , Which gilds the monumental stone That marks a spirit fled ! Though tender youth may pour the sigh , And breathe the voice of wail ; Though tears may dim the filial eye , And turn Affection pale : Yet these may teach the chastened soul Upon its God to lean , ' Till Peace resumes her soft control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the grave :  --  But sweeter the repose , Where angel plumes in glory wave , And blooms the thornless rose . Filled with this trust , the good man dies ,  --  And as his spirit 's wing Is poised for fadeless realms , he cries , " Oh , Death ! where is thy sting ? " Philadelphia .
